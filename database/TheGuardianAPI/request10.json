While Donald Trump’s special adviser on energy and environment, David Banks, said cutting emissions was a US priority, “energy security, economic prosperity are higher priorities”, he said. “The president has a responsibility to protect jobs and industry across the country.” Other attendees at the summit condemned the argument. “Promoting coal at a climate summit is like promoting tobacco at a cancer summit,” said Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and a UN special envoy for cities and climate change. Benson Kibiti, from the Kenya Climate Working Group, said: “More coal will entrench poverty.” When questioned, just one of the four energy executives Trump’s team chose to speak at the event expressed support for his decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement. At the only official event put on by the US government at the two-week summit, Banks said: “Without a question, fossil fuels will continue to be used and we would argue that it is in the global interest that when it is used it is is clean and efficient as possible.” “This panel is only controversial if we choose to bury our heads in the sand and ignore the realities of the global energy system,” he added. The event was interrupted when about three-quarters of the 200-strong audience stood up and began singing in protest. To the tune of God Bless the USA, the mostly young protesters sang: “So you claim to be an American, but we see right through your greed, it’s killing right across the world, for all that coal money.” The protesters then left, but the panel was heckled, with angry members of the audience shouting “bunch of liars” and “clean coal is bullshit”. The appearance of an executive from Peabody Energy, the US’s biggest coal miner, was particularly provocative. In 2016, the Guardian revealed the company had funded at least two dozen groups that cast doubt on manmade climate change and oppose environment regulations. Peabody’s Holly Krutka challenged the argument that coal has no future role. “The discussion needs to be not if we use coal but how,” she said. She also cited carbon capture and storage technology as vital in cutting fossil fuel emissions. Such technology includes the Petra Nova CCS project in the US, which captures CO2 and then uses it to flush more oil out of reservoirs. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that tackling global warming without CCS will be much more expensive. Another panellist, Barry Worthington, executive director of the United States Energy Association, illustrated his points in favour of fossil fuels using future energy projections from ExxonMobil, BP and Statoil. He said US energy companies were already cutting carbon and was the only panellist to back Trump’s Paris pullout, saying: “Frankly, we don’t need the Paris plan.” But the US event prompted fierce criticism at the climate summit, where countries are working to implement the landmark 2015 Paris agreement. Coal is both the dirtiest fossil fuel and a cause of air pollution that causes millions of early deaths every year. “If the [Trump] administration won’t lead, it should at least get out of the way.,” said Bloomberg, who is also a backer of “America’s pledge”. That effort saw 20 states, more than 50 big cities and 60 big businesses confirm their commitment to the Paris goals on Saturday – a group that would have the third biggest economy in the world if it were a country. Kibiti said: “More coal is not going to end the problem of people living without electricity. The vast majority – 84% – of electricity-poor households globally are in rural areas, so off-grid solutions powered by renewables like solar, wind and small hydro are going to be the cheapest and quickest.” “Exploiting poor, disadvantaged populations to justify continued fossil fuel usage is a despicable breach of humanity,” said Kathy Egland, at the NAACP in the US. “The Trump team promoting this abomination are exhibiting the depth of greed, lack of morality and lengths the fossil industry will go to maintain their wealth.” Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, who advises some of the least developed countries, said: “Any country or company continuing to champion coal and even other fossil fuels from now on would be wilfully carrying out a crime against humanity.” Professor Piers Forster, at the University of Leeds, UK, said: “Coal is not clean – it is dangerous. [Coal emissions] have to rapidly reduce to zero. Those who argue coal has a future are putting the planet under real risk.” Two dozen of the 196 countries backing the Paris agreement have included efficient coal technology in their national contributions to cutting emissions. But predictions for future coal use have the plummeted in recent years as the cost of renewable energy has dropped. In 2013, the International Energy Agency expected coal-burning to grow by 40% by 2040; today it anticipates just 1% growth, while China and India have recently cancelled plans for hundreds of new coal plants. Andrew Steer, CEO of the World Resources Institute, said the US event was irrelevant: “It is a total distraction. It will not change the overwhelming momentum away from coal. The closing of coal plants in the US has accelerated since Trump was elected. It’s King Canute trying to hold back the tide.” Earlier on Monday in Bonn, the US’s neighbours Canada and Mexico further isolated Washington by announcing a new partnership with the 15 US states that have pledged strong climate action. Canada’s environment minister, Catherine McKenna, and her Mexican counterpart, Rodolfo Lacy, joined with the governors of Washington state and California, Jay Inslee and Jerry Brown, to form a group that will focus on phasing out coal power and boosting clean power and transport. “We are all in this together,” said McKenna. “The countries that move forward and realise there is a $30tn opportunity will be creating clean jobs and growing their economy.” Inslee added: “Trump is a blip in history. Not one country has expressed that there is any doubt [about climate action] just because Trump is still a climate denier. He can tweet his fingers off, but he won’t stop us. If you want to grow your economy, focus on the jobs of the future.” The global campaign to phase out coal use received a boost last week when Bloomberg donated $50m. He has given $164m to anti-coal efforts in the US in the last six years, during which time half of US coal power plants have closed or been cancelled."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2019/jul/17/top-10-queer-rural-books","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-17T12:00:05Z","webTitle":"Top 10 queer rural books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/17/top-10-queer-rural-books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2019/jul/17/top-10-queer-rural-books","fields":{"headline":"Top 10 queer rural books","bodyText":"If the countryside appears at all in LGBT+ stories, it is usually only as somewhere to escape from. For many of us, this is a pattern that never fitted, and though we did the urban thing to burst (or tiptoe) from the closet, the lure of the rural soon overwhelmed the anonymity of the city. It didn’t feel like a choice, but something intrinsic that would have been dangerous to resist, like the act of coming out itself. So it was for George Walton and Reg Mickisch, an elegant couple who met in the postwar rubble of London, and in 1972 headed for the sticks, opening a B&amp;B in a tiny mid-Wales village. They became much-loved members of our thinly scattered community, and great friends. When they died within a few weeks of each other in 2011, aged 94 and 84, my boyfriend and I found that they had left us their old farmhouse. In us, they saw themselves, and the feeling was mutual. Their legacy was far greater than that though, for it included an archive of letters, diaries, photos, art and books that told a remarkable story. My book On the Red Hill is that story – and so many others. In researching it, I read widely around the topic of the “queer rural”. There wasn’t much, at least not explicitly so. Even more than is normally the case with LGBT+ history, that meant learning to read the shadows, to spot fragmentary connections that had previously been denied or ignored. The truth was clear: we are not newcomers to the countryside. We’ve always been here. In Wales, there is a long tradition of yr hen lanc (literally “the old lad”), the unmarried uncle who might live with, or next door to, his equally unmarried friend. Every village had its hen lanc, and his female equivalents too. These are some of the books that chimed most sonorously in my research. The queer rural is a small but growing canon, and I’m thrilled to be part of it. 1. Maurice by EM Forster The gay grand-daddy of them all, Forster’s elegant love story was written in 1913, but – for fear of scandal – remained unpublished until his death 60 years later. Maurice and gamekeeper Scudder’s passion is ignited in the pillowy folds of a rural English landscape, a place of both beauty and danger. For middle-aged gay men like me, the 1987 film adaptation was a huge catalyst in our coming out – and surprisingly sexy, too, for a Merchant Ivory number. “Men of my sort could take to the greenwood,” sighs the eponymous hero; we all sighed with him. 2. Conundrum by Jan Morris The groundbreaking 1974 memoir of her transgender journey is a masterpiece from the greatest literary traveller of our age. There is a literal journey, its apex on a surgeon’s table in Casablanca, but an existential and spiritual one, too, that brings her back to the only place that can possibly heal her, “the profoundly civilised society of Caernarfonshire”, in Wales’s rocky north-west corner. And there she is still, well into her 10th decade. 3. Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love by Sheila Rowbotham In truth, the copious written works of early socialist Edward Carpenter (1844 – 1929) have not aged too well. More inspiring is this superb biography of the man himself, and especially of the decades he spent living quite openly with his lover George Merrill in the village of Millthorpe, south of Sheffield. Pilgrims came from far and wide, including EM Forster, who credited a bottom-squeeze from Merrill as the thing that freed him – it “touched a creative spring” – to write Maurice. 4. Stripping Penguins Bare by Michael Carson In the second book of the Benson trilogy, set in the mid-1960s, our upright hero leaves Merseyside for university in Aberystwyth. There, he fights prejudice on behalf of the Overseas Students’ Society, while pining unrequitedly for one of its members. He has more luck with taciturn Welsh farmers, who happily deflower him in the wild west. 5. Fingersmith by Sarah Waters Briar House, fog-bound in the Victorian English countryside, is the claustrophobic setting for this arch lesbian mystery story. At Briar, darkness and quiet rule, time moves differently and ordinary rules are upended. For all its clamminess, Briar insinuates itself into the hearts of the two women whose passion is ignited there. Though this countryside is heavy with secrets, it is only there that they can be themselves, and be together. 6. On the Black Hill by Bruce Chatwin The furzy Welsh-English borderland is the backdrop – and chief protagonist – of this epic saga of farmer twins Lewis and Benjamin Jones. Benjamin is not the marrying kind, and Lewis gives up his own hopes of marital fulfilment to stay with him, sharing a bedroom that was “always dark, and smelled of lavender and mothballs”. In many ways, the twins represent Chatwin’s own bisexuality, and the farm bisected by the border his equally divided sense of where he felt he belonged. 7. Modern Nature by Derek Jarman A place of pilgrimage for all queer ruralists is Dungeness, that otherworldly protuberance from England’s south coast and home, for his final years, to Jarman. At Prospect Cottage, he cultivated a garden as strange and spiky as its surroundings, the backdrop of a nuclear power station only augmenting its bleak allure. One unique property of Dungeness is its lack of fences; “my garden’s boundaries are the horizon” wrote Jarman in this passionate evocation of finding the wonder in wilderness. 8. A Place Called Winter by Patrick Gale A muscular tale of escaping shame and demons in Edwardian England by becoming a prairie settler in Canada. The joyous Francis Lee film God’s Own Country was not, as many lazy reviewers had it, a British Brokeback Mountain. This is. The lesbian equivalent, a book that has bewitched its fans for 50 years, is Isabel Miller’s Patience and Sarah, the tale of two women who take on a farm in upstate New York at the beginning of the 19th century. We all need our cowboy/girl stories. 9. Blossom at the Mention of Your Name by Fiona Cooper A book that shone a piercing light ahead for me when I first read it 25 years ago. I ached to be – or perhaps to be with – its central character, an elfin queer witch by the name of Callum. His connection to the green fuse of nature, so fulsomely explored and flamboyantly described, is a force that thrilled me, and only sharpened my hunger to get out of the city. 10. Sacred Country by Rose Tremain Rural Suffolk in the 1950s was not the ideal time or place to be trans. Mary is six when she first realises that she is a boy, a growing understanding that propels him to sanctuary in London and then to Nashville, where he can live as Martin. Though this might seem like the standard queer “escape from the country” narrative, Martin can never quite shake off Suffolk village life, nor does he really want to. On boarding a Greyhound bus in Tennessee, the driver asks him where he wants to go. “Fields,” he replies. • On the Red Hill by Mike Parker is published by William Heinemann.

Tsunekazu Takeda, 71, who will also step down from the International Olympic Committee, has denied allegations of corruption since the Guardian revealed in May 2016 that the Tokyo Olympic bid team had made payments to a consultancy linked to the son of a disgraced IOC official during the city’s successful bid. Takeda was head of the Tokyo bidding committee when it was awarded the Games in 2013, defeating rival bids from Madrid and Istanbul. The president said he would resign from both posts when his current term as JOC president ends in June. “I would like to leave the future of the JOC to a younger generation to lead up to Tokyo 2020,” he said during an executive board meeting on Tuesday. Takeda, who is currently under investigation by French authorities for alleged bribery, has repeatedly denied the allegations. French prosecutors questioned Takeda in Paris and placed him under formal investigation in December. While Takeda, who heads the IOC’s marketing commission, has insisted the payments were legitimate compensation for consultancy services, the investigation has cast a shadow over preparations for the Tokyo Olympics, which begin in less than 500 days. Kyodo news agency quoted sources as saying the IOC was concerned the scandal could continue to tarnish the image of the 2020 Games, and urged Japanese Olympic officials to quickly resolve the matter. The French investigation centres on two payments, totalling at least $2m (£1.5m), that Tokyo’s bid committee made in July and October 2013 to Black Tidings, an account in Singapore linked to Papa Massata Diack – the son of the disgraced former world athletics chief Lamine Diack – and administered by Ian Tan Tong Han. Some of the Tokyo bid team’s payments were suspected to have been directed towards the elder Diack, who as a powerful member of the IOC at the time had a vote in deciding the host city for the 2020 Games. Tan and Papa Massata Diack have reportedly been close friends since they met at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, with Tan even naming his child Massata in 2014. The younger Diack claimed in May 2016 that he had not received money in return for helping Tokyo win the Olympic bid. In September 2016, an independent panel commissioned by the JOC cleared Takeda and other officials who led Tokyo’s bid of any illegal activity. But the panel’s investigation was criticised as flawed, since officials were unable to question Tan or either of the Diacks, or to study official committee documents because they had been destroyed after the city was chosen. The allegations of vote-buying are the most serious of several embarrassments Tokyo has suffered in the run-up to the Games, almost six decades after the city hosted the 1964 Olympics – an event seen as marking Japan’s arrival as a member of the international community after the second world war. In 2015, Japanese officials abandoned the British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid’s design for the new main stadium after costs soared to $2bn, almost twice the initial estimate. The stadium, which was likened to a bicycle helmet, was also due to host the final of the 2019 Rugby World Cup, but will not be ready until after the tournament has ended. The match will be played in nearby Yokohama instead. Hadid, who died in 2016, blamed the cancellation on opposition among Japanese architects to having a national stadium designed by a foreigner. Organisers were later forced to scrap the Games’ official logo amid accusations of plagiarism against the designer, Kenjiro Sano. The Olympics were supposed to highlight Japan’s recovery from the March 2011 triple disaster along its north-east coast, including the meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. When he made Tokyo’s final pitch in Buenos Aires in 2013, Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, assured IOC officials that Tokyo would not be affected by the long and complicated task of decommissioning the plant. Fukushima’s Azuma stadium will host several softball and baseball games in 2020, and the domestic leg of the Olympic torch relay will begin at J-Village, a football training complex near the plant that for several years was used as a base for workers responding to the nuclear crisis. The recent anniversary of the disaster highlighted the scale of the Fukushima cleanup and lingering fears over radiation levels among residents who are being encouraged to return to towns and villages near the plant. Plans to end housing subsidies for Fukushima evacuees in March 2021 prompted complaints that their plight was being overlooked in the rush to promote the “reconstruction Olympics”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/11/watchdog-slams-nuclear-cleanup-contract-that-cost-public-122m","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T23:01:03Z","webTitle":"Watchdog slams nuclear cleanup contract that cost public £122m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/11/watchdog-slams-nuclear-cleanup-contract-that-cost-public-122m","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/11/watchdog-slams-nuclear-cleanup-contract-that-cost-public-122m","fields":{"headline":"Watchdog slams nuclear cleanup contract that cost public £122m","bodyText":"The government agency responsible for mishandling a major nuclear cleanup contract – costing the state more than £122m – has been severely criticised by Whitehall’s spending watchdog. A National Audit Office inquiry into a bungled £6.2bn contract to dispose of material from 12 different nuclear sites has questioned whether the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) is capable of understanding procurement rules. The head of the NDA has apologised for “past mistakes” after the contract collapsed, leading to multimillion pound payouts to firms cut out of deal. The NAO report published on Wednesday also criticised the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy’s oversight of the contract. MP Meg Hillier, chair of the public accounts committee, said: “The NDA was badly mistaken about the work it needed to do on its sites when it let this contract, and has had to cancel it nine years early. It now has to start again from scratch. “This was one of government’s biggest ever contracts and it has gone wrong on a fundamental level. Its failure raises serious questions about the NDA’s capability.” Between 2012 and 2014, the NDA ran a competitive procurement exercise for 10 nuclear outlets and two research facilities resulting in the award of a 14-year contract for up to £6.2bn to Cavendish Fluor Partnership. The deal collapsed after the high court found there was “a significant mismatch between the work specified … and the work that actually needs to be done”. The NDA was forced to settle claims to the losing bidders in March of this year, when the government launched an inquiry into the contract. Auditors found that the NDA: breached its obligation under public contracting regulations; settled legal claims with the rival bidders at a cost of £97.3m; and spent £13.8m on legal and external advisers, while in-house staff time cost £10.8m. Civil servants from the business department and UK Government Investments were aware of the delays but did not raise concerns with ministers until last year, the report said. Responding to the report, NDA’s chief executive officer David Peattie said: “I would like to apologise for these past mistakes. “Since taking over earlier this year, I have made a number of improvements to the way the NDA operates to provide greater focus, discipline, standardisation and simplification to our work.” A department spokesperson said the business secretary, Greg Clark, would scrutinise the auditors’ findings. “The secretary of state has been clear that the reasons for the failure of the Magnox procurement should be exposed and understood, which is why he commissioned the independent Magnox Inquiry earlier this year,” he said. “The government will carefully scrutinise the NAO report.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/jan/18/windfarm-industry-urges-uk-to-lift-onshore-subsidies-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-01-18T16:35:19Z","webTitle":"Windfarm industry urges UK to lift onshore subsidies ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/18/windfarm-industry-urges-uk-to-lift-onshore-subsidies-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/jan/18/windfarm-industry-urges-uk-to-lift-onshore-subsidies-ban","fields":{"headline":"Windfarm industry urges UK to lift onshore subsidies ban","bodyText":"Ministers have been urged to drop their block on subsidies for onshore windfarms, as industry figures showed that nearly 800 renewable projects are ready to plug much of the power gap left by the abandonment of the Wylfa nuclear project. Hitachi dropped plans for the nuclear plant in Wales this week, raising questions over what would replace it and leading the business secretary, Greg Clark, to admit that renewable energy sources are more competitively priced than nuclear. The wind industry said if a bar on onshore windfarm subsidies was lifted it would allow the construction of 794 projects which have won consent through the planning system and are ready to build. Together they would generate around 12 terawatt hours of energy a year; two thirds of what Wylfa would have produced. A dozen firms are behind the schemes, including small players and big names such as Scottish Power, Vattenfall, E.ON, EDF Energy and npower’s owner Innogy. But onshore windfarm installations have stalled since the government banned them from securing subsidies. Emma Pinchbeck, the executive director of RenewableUK, which compiled the figures, said: “We have ready-to-go onshore wind that can help close the gap between the low carbon power we need and the amount government policy is actually delivering, and this week’s announcement on nuclear power has made this mammoth task even harder.” But she said the government had “stacked the odds” against building the onshore windfarms needed to hit the UK’s carbon targets, by excluding developers from competing for subsidies in auctions. Only offshore windfarms can compete for state funds currently. The government’s figures show onshore windfarms are the cheapest source of new electricity generation. The Hinkley Point nuclear project in Somerset won a guaranteed price of £92.50 per megawatt hour, compared with £57.50 for offshore windfarms in the early 2020s. Experts think onshore windfarms could hit around £50 per MWh. Labour said that Clark should match his comments on renewables with action. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: “The government point to renewable energy as an alternative to their failing plans on nuclear. But these figures reveal that the government is being equally reckless with onshore wind – the cheapest form of new renewable energy.” The Scottish energy minister, Paul Wheelhouse, said that after the failure of Hitachi’s projects, it was time for the UK to prioritise onshore windfarms and other renewable technologies over nuclear. The government’s infrastructure advisers, the National Infrastructure Commission, urged a rethink that would allow onshore windfarms to compete for support. Energy analysts and renewable energy companies including BP-backed Lightsource have also written to the government urging it to allow onshore windfarms and large solar farms to secure a government-underwritten price for power from their projects. But energy minister Claire Perry, who has hinted in the past year that a U-turn on the subsidy ban could be on the cards, appears to have cooled on the idea. “Both I and the Scottish conservatives were elected on a manifesto that said there should be no more subsidy. We didn’t think subsidy for onshore windfarms is correct,” she told the Guardian earlier this month, when asked if there were plans for a rethink. Perry said onshore windfarms had reached the point when they no longer needed to be subsidised, a claim not supported by industry. “I think we are getting to a subsidy-free point … The sense I have is that onshore wind deployment will continue without the substantial subsidy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2019/jun/15/car-free-coast-lake-district-cumbria-beaches-walking","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-15T12:00:21Z","webTitle":"Skip the Lakes and see the Cumbrian coast – without a car","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/jun/15/car-free-coast-lake-district-cumbria-beaches-walking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2019/jun/15/car-free-coast-lake-district-cumbria-beaches-walking","fields":{"headline":"Skip the Lakes and see the Cumbrian coast – without a car","bodyText":"The air smells of seaweed and woodsmoke as I step on to the platform at Ravenglass. The salt marsh nearby has galaxies of pale pink thrift flowers, the River Esk glitters in the evening light, and a waterside path heads off towards distant fells. As a fan of walking, Wordsworth and sticky toffee pudding, I’ve had many memorable holidays in the Lake District over the decades. But, like most of the other 16 million visitors a year, I’ve rarely visited the Cumbrian coast. I’d arrived in Lancaster 150 minutes after leaving London – less than half what it would take me to drive – and switched to the railway that meanders past Barrow-in-Furness and through the national park. The kaleidoscope of landscape and changeable weather outside was engrossing: green crags rose out of foggy marshland, ribbed sand shone gold and Black Combe loomed through storm clouds over Silecroft. There were manmade landmarks too, such as the lighthouse-shaped monument above Ulverston or the red sandstone walls of Furness Abbey. I’m staying at the Pennington Hotel, just steps from the Esk estuary and three minutes from Ravenglass station. Heading back there from my evening walk, I pass a ruined Roman bathhouse, half a mile from the village, relic of a second-century fort. It’s part of a huge Unesco world heritage site that includes Hadrian’s Wall: Frontiers of the Roman Empire. In 2017, Unesco added the Lake District to its list, so Ravenglass is one of very few places to have double world heritage status. After grilled Manx kipper the next morning, I take the train five minutes to Drigg station request stop, to explore a huge area of sand dunes on the edge of the national park. Walking to the sea, I pass the fence of a low-level radioactive waste facility – a reminder that Sellafield, the elephant on the coast, is just five miles north. Site of the world’s first commercial nuclear power station and now a decommissioning plant, its chimneys are intermittently visible. Local wildlife seems to be thriving though; there are orange-breasted stonechats on the fences and sand martins looping overhead. The thousand acres of dunes near Drigg are full of flowers and birdsong. The white burnet roses have a particular unearthly beauty – like the simbelmynë flowers that grow on the grassy tombs of Rohan in Lord of the Rings. I follow a sandy path through the marram grass and walk along the beach to Seascale beside a calm, cloud-echoing sea. Birds are the only other creatures I see for three miles along holiday-brochure sands on a sunny summer half-term morning. Waiting for a train back from Seascale, I can see the Isle of Man – a ghostly shape across the sun-hazed sea. “Ah, Mona’s isle, the vanishing isle,” says one of my fellow passengers before lapsing back into telling me how terrible the trains are. (The introduction of last summer’s timetable caused cancellations, although it did also mean new Sunday trains.) You can’t stay in Ravenglass and not ride on La’al Ratty, as the local narrow-gauge steam railway is nicknamed. Sitting in miniature open-air carriages, as sooty vapour drifts through the oak leaves overhead, we pass through scenery that feels more CGI than real. Twisted trunks writhe out of the mossy woods and the slopes of Muncaster Fell are cloaked in violet rhododendrons. At the end of the little railway is the village of Boot, at the foot of England’s highest mountain, Scafell Pike. From Boot, you can hike over tarn-topped moorland or stride through misty woods. I opt for an hour’s amble to the Dalegarth Falls, a series of ferny, fairytale cascades, and a 10-minute stroll down country lanes near the station, past two pubs, to pretty Eskdale Mill. The mill, reopening this month after ambitious renovations, is part of the area’s varied history. “We’ve got everything here, from Neolithic to nuclear,” says Les Coan, an enthusiastic volunteer. The sense of stepping into a film-scape increases with an afternoon visit to Muncaster Castle (adult £15, child £7.50), a pleasant mile from Ravenglass, where the annual Festival of Fools has just finished. I climb through sunlit forest into unfeasibly flowery gardens with views over the estuary to the Irish Sea. Tunnels of cream and crimson blossom lead to the castle, rich in art, carved wood, tapestries and gossipy family anecdotes. A Muncaster ticket includes the on-site Hawk and Owl centre’s displays; the birds sweep and plunge above a wildflower meadow at speeds of up to 70mph. Senior falconer Emma McLachlan seems to dance with a huge falcon, in a choreographed pattern of glides and dives with a stirring musical soundtrack. She describes the bird to us as “like a real-life dragon”. At teatime, tall grey herons start to gather in the trees. Peter Frost-Pennington is director of Muncaster Castle, which is his wife’s ancestral home. Over coffee and lemon drizzle cake, he enthuses about the area’s wildlife. Almost every type of English habitat is represented within an eight-mile radius so “everything from a beetle to an eagle can live here”, he tells me; “it’s the Lake District on steroids.” I head home on the coastal railway next day, via Carlisle this time. The dunes have vanished into veiling rain so I decide to stop off at two museums in Whitehaven, a post-industrial town with Georgian architecture, half an hour north of Ravenglass. The Rum Story (adult £9.95, child £4.95), winding through a series of original cellars and warehouses, explores both grim and cheerful aspects of the “dark spirit of Whitehaven”. Besides a harrowing slave ship diorama, there are squawking rainforests, Chicago jazz, and the ticket comes with a free tipple. The waterside Beacon Museum (adult £6.50, child £3.25) has a floor dedicated to Sellafield and another tracing the area’s past through Vikings and Victorian trading ships. History is inseparable from the ocean on this stretch of coast and, from the Beacon’s top-floor gallery, there’s a view across harbour walls and lighthouse to a wild, wind-whitened sea. • Transport was provided by Virgin Trains (London-Carlisle from £26 one-way, Northern (Cumbria Coast day ranger from £20.90), and the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway (adult day ticket from £9).

A vast cache of material dating from 1939 until the 1980s and including more than 1,700 files about the creation of Britain’s first nuclear bombs at Aldermaston has been unexpectedly withdrawn by the National Archives within the last week, researchers have reported. The files were withdrawn at the instruction of the government’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, according to the National Archives. They range from the private papers of Sir John Cockcroft, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who split the atomic nucleus, to reports of atomic bomb tests carried out as part of the creation of Britain’s nuclear deterrent in Australia and the Pacific. Attempts to access them online are met with the message: “This record is closed whilst access is under review.” Neither the National Archives at Kew nor the NDA were able to comment on Sunday about why they had been removed. Speculation among academics who rely on the papers for their research ranged from whether the NDA had realised there was something in the files that shouldn’t have been made public to more prosaic suggestions such as a reorganisation of the files or a shift in location. The papers are in two sections. The records of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) and its predecessors concern the research, development and testing of Britain’s atomic weapons including bomb trials, feasibility reports on new systems and notes on the theoretical physics behind nuclear weapons. They include files with titles such as “structural vulnerability of aeroplanes to blast from atomic bomb” and “measurement of air blast using petrol cans and toothpaste tubes”. The records of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority largely concern the civilian nuclear energy programme. They include photographs detailing the construction of nuclear reactors and daily log books from nuclear power stations. “We would like to know what is going on,” said Jon Agar, a professor of history of science and technology at University College London. “We would be alarmed as historians that it has been taken out of public view. These are important records for understanding the nuclear project in the UK. A couple of days ago a PhD student noticed that everything in the catalogue is coming up as temporarily retained. We are scratching our heads. It is all a bit mysterious.” A spokeswoman for the National Archives said: “We have been asked to temporarily withdraw these records, which is why they now appear on our catalogue as ‘access under review’. For further information, please speak to the transferring authority.” The transferring authority is the NDA, which comes under the auspices of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. A spokesman for the NDA said he could not yet explain why the records had been removed, but said: “The NDA is absolutely committed to openness and transparency.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/nov/06/uk-renewable-energy-capacity-surpasses-fossil-fuels-for-first-time","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-06T12:28:45Z","webTitle":"UK renewable energy capacity surpasses fossil fuels for first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/06/uk-renewable-energy-capacity-surpasses-fossil-fuels-for-first-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/nov/06/uk-renewable-energy-capacity-surpasses-fossil-fuels-for-first-time","fields":{"headline":"UK renewable energy capacity surpasses fossil fuels for first time","bodyText":"The capacity of renewable energy has overtaken that of fossil fuels in the UK for the first time, in a milestone that experts said would have been unthinkable a few years ago. In the past five years, the amount of renewable capacity has tripled while fossil fuels’ has fallen by one-third, as power stations reached the end of their life or became uneconomic. The result is that between July and September, the capacity of wind, solar, biomass and hydropower reached 41.9 gigawatts, exceeding the 41.2GW capacity of coal, gas and oil-fired power plants. Imperial College London, which compiled the figures, said the rate at which renewables had been built in the past few years was greater than the “dash for gas” in the 1990s. Dr Iain Staffell, who undertook the research, said: “Britain’s power system is slowly but surely walking away from fossil fuels, and this quarter saw a major milestone on the journey.” However, the amount of power from fossil fuels was still greater over the quarter, at about 40% of electricity generation compared with 28% for renewable sources. In total, 57% of electricity generation was low carbon over the period, produced either by renewables or nuclear power stations. In terms of installed capacity, wind is the biggest source of renewables at more than 20GW, followed by solar spread across nearly 1m rooftops and in fields. Biomass is third. In the past year, coal capacity has fallen by one-quarter, and there are only six coal-fired plants left in the UK. Coal operators have been affected by the UK’s carbon tax on electricity generation, as well as competition from gas, though they have enjoyed a recent fillip from high gas prices. Fortunes for new gas power stations are mixed. This week, the German energy company RWE said it was freezing plans for a new 2.5GW gas plant in Tilbury, Essex. However, UK-listed SSE said it had broken ground on Tuesday on a new 840MW gas power station in Lincolnshire. The Imperial College London research, which was commissioned by the gas, coal and biomass company Drax, also found the cost of balancing the energy system had risen to a 10-year high of £3.8m per day between July and September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/oct/06/europes-business-heads-aim-to-keep-iran-nuclear-deal-despite-us-threat","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-06T07:01:27Z","webTitle":"Europe's business heads aim to keep Iran nuclear deal despite US threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/06/europes-business-heads-aim-to-keep-iran-nuclear-deal-despite-us-threat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/oct/06/europes-business-heads-aim-to-keep-iran-nuclear-deal-despite-us-threat","fields":{"headline":"Europe's business heads aim to keep Iran nuclear deal despite US threat","bodyText":"EU business leaders have said they are prepared to do everything they can to salvage the Iran nuclear deal in the event of a US withdrawal, as the Danish credit agency extended export guarantees to Tehran in the run-up to a showdown with Donald Trump. The US president has reportedly decided to decertify Iran’s compliance with the landmark nuclear deal next week. On Thursday, he told a meeting of US military leaders that Tehran was not living up to the “spirit of the agreement” and cryptically added they were witnessing “the calm before the storm”. If Trump decides not to continue certifying the deal it could unravel, but Europe’s business community hopes the economic benefits of the agreement would encourage Iran to stick to its commitments even if the US falters. Speaking at the Europe-Iran forum in Zurich this week, Helga Schmid, the secretary general of the European External Action Service, reassured business leaders that the EU was committed to the accord, saying that “as Europeans we will do everything to make sure it stays”. Business leaders from Iran and Europe gathered for the two-day conference in Switzerland to explore investment opportunities, but the uncertainty before Trump’s decision has created an atmosphere of apprehension, even though many believe the deal may eventually survive. Trump’s refusal to certify would not automatically mean that sanctions will snap back into place, although that remains as the worst case scenario. Trump said in his first UN address last month that “the Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into”, calling it an embarrassment to his country. He has reluctantly certified Iran’s compliance in the past, but he has indicated that he may refrain from signing the certification next week, which will throw the ball into the court of Congress. Schmid said on Wednesday that the agreement could not be changed unilaterally, adding: “We have passed a very clear message: the nuclear deal is working and delivering and the world would be less stable without it.” Reporting a 94% increase in Iran-Europe trade in the first half of 2017 from the same period in 2016, Schmid said it was important for Iranians to directly feel the benefits of the deal. She recognised ongoing difficulties with tier-one European banks, and said “as a sign of confidence in our future financial and economic relations, the European commission has proposed to allow the European Investment Bank operating in Iran in the future.” Major banks are still reluctant to handle Iranian transactions, but 30 Iranian banks have been reconnected to Swift electronic banking and more than 200 international lenders have started correspondent relations with their Iranian counterparts. Iran’s moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, said in New York in September that the country would respond “decisively and resolutely” if the US walked out on the deal, but gave no details. Other Iranian officials have hinted that Iran may continue adhering to the deal provided that the US does not obstruct European investments. Jørn Fredsgaard Sørensen, the director of country, bank and sector risk department at EKF, Denmark’s export credit agency, said it had signed an agreement with Tehran’s finance ministry that would enable the EKF to provide 100% guarantees on financing to those willing to export Danish goods to Iran, even if sanctions were snapped back. Danske bank, the largest lender in Denmark, has also signed an agreement with 10 Iranian banks. “This should hopefully give comfort to banks that are not yet willing to work with Iran that they can work with Iran because we show our commitment to it,” Sørensen told the Guardian on the sidelines of Europe-Iran forum. “I think the Europeans are committed to the nuclear deal but we also believe in it because, if we didn’t believe that Europeans would uphold the agreement, then we shouldn’t be issuing these types of guarantees. “The right way is to keep interacting with Iran, if we in the west want Iran to be included in the western family of nations is we shouldn’t shut them off. We should engage with them and only if we engage with them can we have a dialogue and criticise if we think there’s something to criticise.” Austrian and Italian credit agencies have struck similar agreements with Iran, extending export guarantees and credit lines. Austria’s Oberbank has recently signed agreements with 14 Iranian banks to finance Austrian projects. A senior executive at a European multinational company, who asked to remain anonymous, said he expected the US president to decertify the deal but he believed it would not amount to the end of the agreement. “There is a lot of serious diplomacy by Europeans at all levels from prime ministers to policymakers to make sure the agreement would survive and there are talks of retaliatory legislation or protective legislations like the ones in place in early 2000s,” he said. Seyed Mohammad Eslami, a business commentator attending the forum, said there were mixed feelings in Iran about the future of the deal. “People are worried about what Trump would do on 15 October, but businesses are still continuing with the assumption that the deal will survive,” he said. “Europe would have to have a plan B, not only to ensure the durability of the agreement but also to protect their own interest because a lot of Europeans have already invested in Iran.” Adnan Tabatabai, the chief executive at the Bonn-based Carpo thinktank, said: “Europe needs to make sure that Iran gets enough economic and political benefit to keep complying with the deal. “That means continuing the effort to incentivise European businesses to invest in the Iranian market and develop creative financing mechanism to guarantee that that would happen despite US pressure.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/18/nuclear-must-be-part-of-the-low-carbon-mix","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-18T17:48:40Z","webTitle":"Nuclear must be part of the low-carbon mix | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/18/nuclear-must-be-part-of-the-low-carbon-mix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/18/nuclear-must-be-part-of-the-low-carbon-mix","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear must be part of the low-carbon mix","bodyText":"Re David Lowry’s criticisms of nuclear energy (Letters, 17 September), it is true that nuclear plants stop generating temporarily for maintenance and repair, but the same is true for most other forms of electricity generation. However, on average these outages represent a much smaller quantity of lost generation compared to the day-to-day intermittency of wind or solar. Nuclear plants spend a high proportion of the time generating at their maximum capacity. On emissions, some proponents of both nuclear and renewables do fall into the habit of referring to their technologies as “zero-carbon”, even though there are some greenhouse gas emissions produced with all forms of generation. But there is remarkable academic agreement that the emissions from nuclear, wind, solar and many other non-fossil generation sources are similarly low per unit of electricity generated and these emissions are tiny fractions of those associated with burning coal and gas. We desperately need to cut emissions in our electricity mix to as low as possible. The nuclear industry’s Harmony programme has a goal of 25% of the world’s electricity being supplied by nuclear energy by 2050. The remaining 75% would need to be supplied by a broad mix of other almost zero-carbon generation options, alongside energy storage and smart grids to help deal with intermittent generation and variable demand. We should work together for a strong, clean future for electricity generation rather than quibble while coal burns. Agneta Rising Director general, World Nuclear Association • The simple engineering facts that solar only functions less than one-third of the day and wind only functions when winds are just right mean that they are unreliable and must be backed up at a moment’s notice. In most areas, that’s by burning gas in low-efficiency “peaker” turbine plants that never get shut off fully to protect their expensive equipment. So, wind/solar energy is far from free, has high related emissions and is far more expensive than a nuclear plant that runs 90% of every year for decades. Nuclear power provides far better capacity, stability, longevity and jobs than can wind/solar enterprises, all while providing local communities with reliable power and great economic benefit to boot. The combustion industry loves renewables because their use commits poorly informed electorates and legislatures to installing emissions-producing backup.

Since plutonium – a by-product of uranium-based nuclear power generation – is one of the most toxic materials known to humankind, this seemed like an alarmist metaphor, so I settled down to read. The article, by a Microsoft researcher, Luke Stark, argues that facial-recognition technology – one of the current obsessions of the tech industry – is potentially so toxic for the health of human society that it should be treated like plutonium and restricted accordingly. You could spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley before you heard sentiments like these about a technology that enables computers to recognise faces in a photograph or from a camera. There, it’s regarded as universally beneficial. If you’ve ever come across a suggestion on Facebook to tag a face with a suggested individual’s name, for example, then you’ve encountered the technology. And it’s come on in leaps and bounds as cameras, sensors and machine-learning software have improved and as the supply of training data (images from social media) has multiplied. We’ve now reached the point where it’s possible to capture images of people’s faces and identify them in real time. Which is the thing that really worries Stark. Why? Basically because facial-recognition technologies “have insurmountable flaws in the ways they schematise human faces” – particularly in that they reinforce discredited categorisations around race and gender. In the light of these flaws, Stark argues, the risks of the technologies vastly outweigh the benefits in a way that is reminiscent of hazardous nuclear materials. “Facial recognition,” he says, “simply by being designed and built, is intrinsically socially toxic, regardless of the intentions of its makers; it needs controls so strict that it should be banned for almost all practical purposes.” There are two levels of concern here, one immediate and the other longer-term but perhaps more fundamental. The short-term issue is that the technology is currently only good at recognising some kinds of faces – mostly those with white complexions – and has difficulty with people of colour. Whether this is “insurmountable” (as Stark maintains) remains to be seen, but it’s alarming enough already because it provides a means of “racialising” societies using the charisma of science. The longer-term worry is that if this technology becomes normalised then in the end it will be everywhere; all human beings will essentially be machine-identifiable wherever they go. At that point corporations and governments will have a powerful tool for sorting and categorising populations. And at the moment we seem to have no way of controlling the development of such tools. To appreciate the depths of our plight with this stuff, imagine if the pharmaceutical industry were allowed to operate like the tech companies currently do. Day after day in their laboratories, researchers would cook up amazingly powerful, interesting and potentially lucrative new drugs which they could then launch on an unsuspecting public without any obligation to demonstrate their efficacy or safety. Yet this is exactly what has been happening in tech companies for the past two decades – all kinds of “cool”, engagement-boosting and sometimes addictive services have been cooked up and launched with no obligation to assess their costs and benefits to society. In that sense one could think of Facebook Live, say, as the digital analogue of thalidomide – useful for some purposes and toxic for others. Facebook Live turned out to be useful for a mass killer to broadcast his atrocity; thalidomide was marketed over the counter in Europe as a mild sleeping pill but ultimately caused the birth of thousands of deformed children, and untold anguish. In the end, we will need some kind of control regime for what the tech companies produce – a kind of Federal Apps Administration, perhaps. But we’re nowhere near that at the moment. Instead (to continue the pharma metaphor) we’re in the pre-pharmaceutical era of snake oil and patent medicines launched on a gullible public by unregulated and unscrupulous entrepreneurs. And as far as facial recognition is concerned, we are seeing services that effectively function as gateway drugs to normalise the technology. FaceApp, for example, used to offer a “hot” filter that lightened the skin colour of black users to make them look more “European”, but had to abandon it after widespread protests. It still offers “Black”, “Indian” and “Asian” filters, though. And, interestingly, Apple’s latest range of iPhones offers FaceID – which uses facial-recognition software to let the device identify its owner and enhance its “security”. The subliminal message of all this stuff, of course, is clear. It says that facial recognition is the wave of the future and there’s nothing to worry our silly little heads about. Which is where Stark’s plutonium metaphor breaks down. Nobody ever pretended that that wasn’t dangerous. What I’m reading The politics of laughter A comedian for president?

But Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, and Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, appear to have managed it with their ill-judged attempt to hustle Tokyo into a quick-fire Brexit trade deal. The diplomatic fumble has highlighted rapidly escalating difficulties facing “global Britain” – the government’s nebulous vision for life after the EU – in forging new business and trade relationships around the world without an agreed post-Brexit strategy. Leading Brexiters such as Fox, David Davis and Nigel Farage predicted the process would be quick and easy, but events are proving them wrong. With 29 March fast approaching, Britain has replaced only seven of the EU’s 69 collective preferential trade deals. The “magnificent seven” comprise Switzerland, Chile, Mauritius, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, the Faroe Islands and the Seychelles. Together, they account for a mere £16bn out of a total of £117bn in British trade with EU-partnered countries. In contrast, preferential arrangements with bigger EU partners such as Japan, South Korea, Turkey and Norway have not been replaced, nor does it appear they will be before the deadline. With market analysts warning a no-deal Brexit is a growing possibility, pressure on Fox is intensifying. This may explain last week’s clumsy warning to Japan, in a letter co-authored with Hunt, that “time is of the essence”. Like his predecessors, Shinzō Abe, Japan’s prime minister, has pursued a close diplomatic and security relationship with Britain. Japanese businesses and carmakers have invested heavily. So officials in Tokyo reportedly took strong exception to the Fox-Hunt suggestion of foot-dragging, suggesting it smacked of arrogance. Fox was already struggling with tougher than expected Japanese negotiating tactics. Given widespread perceptions of British weakness, bordering on desperation, other countries, less well disposed than Japan, can be expected to take an even harder line. The question of ministerial incompetence aside, Britain is further disadvantaged by a lack of trade talks specialists – a point made by the Japanese – and ongoing domestic political divisions. Add to that well-founded concerns about a contracting global economy, the US-China trade war and a broader sense that Britain’s standing on the world stage is in decline, and the future negotiating environment looks hostile. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, served up what he and others among Britain’s European friends see as an unpalatable truth. Britain is “a waning country” that is “too small to appear on the world stage on its own”, he said last week. All this renders the task of creating new bilateral trade deals with the world’s largest economies, outside the EU’s 69-nation umbrella framework, ever more daunting. China’s weekend decision to cancel high-levels talks over disobliging remarks by the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, showed how vulnerable Britain is to geopolitical as well as financial pressure from the big emerging powers. The UK’s dependence on Chinese investment, for example in nuclear power, is another weakness open to exploitation. Britain’s refusal to ostracise the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei may please Beijing but will infuriate the US. Was the decision influenced by Brexit considerations? There could also be a high price to pay, in terms of political values and human rights, in obtaining deals from repressive regimes in China, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. And Britain’s often unhappy colonial legacy must be factored in, too. Many in India will view London’s new neediness as a chance to redress old wrongs. For his part, Donald Trump, a Brexit enthusiast, has criticised May for conceding too much to the EU while promising an expanded relationship. The US is already Britain’s biggest non-EU trade partner, and London clings rather pathetically to its so-called special relationship. Money-minded, hard-nosed Trump is certain to drive a hard bargain, and there’s a real risk of bullying. Any agreement with the US could come with political as well as commercial and health and safety strings attached, for instance on Iran, where current policy diverges. Trump’s deep hostility to to the World Trade Organization (“one of the worst deals ever”) means, meanwhile, that a no-deal default to WTO rules would not necessarily win Washington’s approval or support. Such an outcome would truly leave Britain all at sea, lost and adrift somewhere between Europe and America."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2019/may/05/the-huawei-incident-points-to-a-deeper-lesson-for-great-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-05T10:24:13Z","webTitle":"The Huawei incident points to a deeper lesson for Great Britain | Larry Elliott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/05/the-huawei-incident-points-to-a-deeper-lesson-for-great-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2019/may/05/the-huawei-incident-points-to-a-deeper-lesson-for-great-britain","fields":{"headline":"The Huawei incident points to a deeper lesson for Britain","bodyText":"The debate over whether the Chinese telecoms company Huawei should be involved in building Britain’s 5G network has centred on two questions: was the former defence secretary Gavin Williamson the source of the leak from the National Security Council, and would Huawei represent a security threat? These are certainly important questions, but there is a third issue that deserves an airing – namely, why a country that emerged from the second world war with a technological edge in computers and electronics should require the assistance of what is still classified as an emerging economy to construct a crucial piece of national infrastructure. It is indeed a sign of how diminished Britain is as a manufacturing force that it now passes almost without comment that the rivals to Huawei are not the great names of the past such as Marconi and Plessey, but Finland’s Nokia and Sweden’s Ericsson. The Huawei affair should help to puncture a few myths. In the early years of China’s rapid industrialisation, the UK took comfort from the fact that it was only low-cost manufacturing that was migrating east. Developed countries like Britain, it was said, would do all the clever, high-end, profitable stuff, while the Chinese would have to be content with churning out cheap toys and clothes. It seemed highly complacent to assume that China – a country which was making technological breakthroughs while Europe was stuck in the dark ages – would be content with being an assembly plant for western consumer goods, and so it has proved. China is now one of the world leaders in artificial intelligence and solar panels. When the government wanted to build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point, the Chinese got the contract, albeit using French technology. A second myth that China has well and truly busted is that all will be well provided market forces are not hampered by state interference. China has had an industrial strategy over many decades, and has stuck to it, while during the same period Britain has seen the state’s role wane and manufacturing become an ever smaller part of the economy. Britain’s mid-20th century edge in computing, jet engines and radar was a direct consequence of putting the economy on a war footing between 1939 and 1945. What’s more, the reason the UK retains a global presence in aerospace and pharmaceuticals is that companies have been able to rely on the state – in the form of the Ministry of Defence and the NHS – being an important customer. There were, of course, plenty of other reasons for the decline of UK manufacturing. In part, it was the result of complacency: British industry, for many years after the war, relied too heavily on the captive domestic and imperial markets. While Germany and Japan were forced to modernise as a result of the devastation caused by military defeat, British firms rested on their laurels. This failure to compete with more efficient and hungrier rivals was not helped by prolonged periods during which the pound was overvalued. Again, attempting to cling on to the remnants of empire played a part. It was thought vital to have a strong exchange rate to sustain the pound as a reserve currency and to protect the overseas investors who kept their money in London. This was good for the City, but not so good for exporters. Governments of both left and right knew there was a problem, and came up with a succession of different cures. These included indicative planning copied from the French; a national plan; industrial reorganisation; bailing out “lame duck” businesses; and attempts at trade union reform. Yet these well-meaning attempts foundered through a lack of consistency and a series of policy blunders. Harold Wilson’s national plan, for example, was thwarted by the determination to resist devaluation until 1967, by which time it was too late. And then there was Margaret Thatcher and her monetarist experiment of the late 1970s and early 80s. High interest rates were used to squeeze inflation out of the system, but proved fatal to manufacturers already struggling with weak global demand and the appreciation of sterling caused by the arrival of North Sea oil in the mid-1970s. There were debates – as firm after firm went bust – about whether it really mattered that a good chunk of industry was wiped out. Nigel Lawson, when he was chancellor in the 1980s, said it didn’t, because services would fill the gap. Over the years, as Britain has become more and more services-dominated, that theory has been fully tested, and the results are now in. Britain is certainly good at exporting services – especially financial and business services – but it can’t sell enough of them to compensate for a whopping deficit in trade in goods. It is more than two decades since the UK ran a current account surplus. Turning Britain into a global money hub has had two other harmful consequences. It has made the economy more vulnerable to financial crises, as was witnessed by the damage caused by the banking crash of 2008. And it has made Britain more socially riven by concentrating wealth in one corner of the country. To all that can now be added another conclusion: the benign (and sometimes not so benign) neglect of manufacturing now poses a threat to national security. What should be done? The answer is to learn lessons from the City, the one sector that has been blessed with long-term bipartisan planning and plenty of tender, loving care. That means having a vision for where manufacturing should be in 25 years’ time, deciding which industries are the future, not the past, having a strategy that has buy-in across the political spectrum – and sticking to it. • This article was amended on 7 May 2019 to clarify that while China won the contract for Hinkley Point C, it will be using French technology."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/oct/25/australia-politics-live-budget-jim-chalmers-deficit-debt-housing-cost-of-living-spending-economy-unemployment-inflation-labor-coalition-vic-nsw-qld-floods","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-25T10:46:19Z","webTitle":"Labor hints at more controls on energy sector – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/oct/25/australia-politics-live-budget-jim-chalmers-deficit-debt-housing-cost-of-living-spending-economy-unemployment-inflation-labor-coalition-vic-nsw-qld-floods","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/oct/25/australia-politics-live-budget-jim-chalmers-deficit-debt-housing-cost-of-living-spending-economy-unemployment-inflation-labor-coalition-vic-nsw-qld-floods","fields":{"headline":"Labor hints at more controls on energy sector – as it happened","bodyText":"And that was the 2022-23 budget. (Again.) There was lots of talk of inflation, promises of loads of houses, and a smattering of talk about how boring it was. The Joe Hockey/Tony Abbott 2014 budget was the last one that really blew everyone’s socks off (and not in a good way). Since then, governments have played it relatively safe. And as Katharine Murphy points out, for a range of reasons, this was one of the safest budgets yet. Today saw more dire warnings about the global and domestic economic outcome, after the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the floods and other factors rendered the pre-election Coalition March budget all but redundant. We already knew that inflation was going crazy, but the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, put a forceful emphasis on the resultant need for “restraint”. In that restrained environment, though, he put together a cost of living package, the highlight of which was the government’s ambitious, not-yet-fully-formed plan to aim for a million new homes within a decade. There was some unforeseen revenue, some “reprioritisation” of spending, and the news that cumulative deficits over the four years of the forward estimates now total $181bn, which is an improvement of more than $40bn over what was forecast before the election. And we learned that future tax reforms and energy regulations are on the cards. Chalmers delivered some pretty strong hints that we should stay tuned. The Guardian Australian team will keep on ferreting and fossicking away, so we’ll see you here again tomorrow as we unspool more of the budget. In the meantime, catch up here. Here’s Daniel Hurst again, this time with the defence update and Australia’s help for Ukraine: Greg Jericho has pulled together some brilliant graphs to explain the budget – and because he’s from South Australia, that’s graaaaphs, not grafs, thank you very much: Experts and stakeholders offer responses to October budget Back to the conga line of experts reacting to the budget: Georgie Dent, of The Parenthood, said the budget was “good news for families with children”, singling out the changes to the childcare subsidy, paid parental leave and gender equality as her highlights. Dent has met with Albanese several times in recent months, most recently last week in his office for a photo op after he announced the boost to paid parental leave. Dent said she would have liked to see the changes come in “yesterday” instead of gradually phased in over several years, but said it was a very positive move. John Falzon, of progressive think tank Per Capita, was quite disappointed that the government didn’t do more on addressing poverty in Australia, particularly perturbed by no raise to the jobseeker welfare rate. Falzon said there was “something very wrong when those who have the least are expected to do the most”. He accepted that the government “can’t change everything in one budget” but said the 3 million people living in poverty were suffering a “daily form of mental torture that cried out for immediate relief”. “You can’t talk about wellbeing while ignoring the impossible task of surviving on $46 a day,” he said. Melissa Donnelly of the Community and Public Sector Union welcomed better resourcing of the public sector, saying it would have benefits for the treatment of veterans, NDIS participants and on visa processing backlogs. Aged care workers from the United Workers Union said “thanks for recognising us finally – ScoMo didn’t”. Tim Costello, former CEO of World Vision Australia and poverty advocate, welcomed updates to the aid budget. He congratulated the foreign minister, Penny Wong, for “arresting and stabilising the decline”, which he said would be the difference between life and death for people living in absolute poverty. But Costello said he was disappointed the government hadn’t sent more money to address famine in Africa, with food shortages directly linked to the war in Ukraine and grain shortages. He said Australia was not doing its fair share, calling it “a loss of our moral senses” as he called for $150m in extra funding. Daniel Hurst has delved through those NDIS figures, and what will happen next: Too much budget barely enough? Here is treasurer Jim Chalmers’ budget speech in video form! Mike Bowers has been framing budget day for you: And here’s some more detail from Paul Karp on the projects that are set to miss out on regional and infrastructure spending: Caitlin Cassidy has produced an excellent example of that staple of the budget coverage – the winners and losers: The Greens have moved a second reading amendment to one of the budget supply bills. MP Max Chandler-Mather moved: Whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: notes the Government’s first budget gives a $9,000 per year tax cut to billionaires and locks in the $254bn stage three tax cuts for the wealthy; and calls on the government to repeal the stage three tax cuts and provide cost of living relief that will make people’s lives better, including by putting dental and mental healthcare into Medicare, building more affordable housing, and making childcare free. The leader of the house, Tony Burke, accused the Greens of a “stunt” to draw attention to the stage-three tax cuts - warning the house that the effect of the amendment was to “negate the bill”. Burke said if the amendment were carried, the supply bill would have to come back tomorrow, putting “the wages of every public servant” in “jeopardy”. It’s too late for any votes this evening, meaning any division on the second reading amendment would be tomorrow anyway. Burke urgent them not to call a vote. The Liberals’ shadow assistant treasurer, Stuart Robert, confirmed the opposition will hold to an agreement with the government to progress the supply bill. So nothing will come of it, but Labor is dialling the outrage up. Further to that last conversation between Angus Taylor and Sarah Ferguson – Daniel Hurst was paying closer attention than me and has re-created the scene: Angus Taylor: “Going back to your original question ...” Sarah Ferguson: “Please.” Taylor: “... which was – remind me?” Australians will wait years for cost of living relief, Greens leader says The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, told reporters in Canberra that Australians voted for change at the election and “after the budget they are still waiting”. Bandt said Australians will wait “years” for cost of living relief, while the government gives the very wealthy a quarter of a trillion dollars (over 10 years, starting in 2024) of tax cuts. The Greens wanted free childcare, dental care and mental health on Medicare. Bandt said the pledge to build 1m houses is a “house of cards” that builds only 10,000 houses while relying on the private sector to build the rest. The Greens welcomed the funding for truth telling and agreement making with First Nations people, crediting senator Lidia Thorpe for her advocacy. The Greens have signalled they will move to amend (but not block) the budget to remove fossil fuels subsidies. Angus Taylor says $6bn of deferred infrastructure spending ‘has disappeared’ Now Taylor is talking about regional grant funds – Ferguson gives him an opening to have a crack at Labor for diverting some of those funds. Taylor, though, goes straight back to wages and electricity prices. “The problem is the budget lays out a plan where they don’t meet those commitments,” he says. He gets there, though, saying $6bn of infrastructure investment has been deferred. He says: We don’t know when it’s going to be spent. That’s $6bn lost. Much of that is in regional areas. Not all of it. A lot of it is in outer suburban areas, like Western Sydney. That has disappeared, over $6bn. We don’t know exactly which projects have been lost. But we do know that’s a very significant part of the infrastructure pipeline to lose. And there will be many important projects that regional areas, suburban areas, are relying on for their future, for their aspirations, for the opportunities they’re pursuing that will be lost as part of it. Taylor says the NDIS is an “important program”, when he’s asked about Jim Chalmers’ comment that the spending would grow by hundreds of billions of dollars. “It needs to be sustainable,” Taylor says. “There’s no question about that. We’ll work with Labor on ensuring that it is sustainable.” Forecast rise in energy prices breaks Labor’s election commitments, Angus Taylor says Angus Taylor, the opposition’s treasury spokesperson, is on the ABC now. He says Labor’s forecast that electricity and gas prices would go up was a “major breach of an election commitment”. “They promised that they would go down by $275,” he said. (They did, but times have changed dramatically since then.) Taylor says: The war in Ukraine happened before the election. They could have changed their policy, and they didn’t. It was their policy going into the election. They’ve broken that commitment. The fastest way we can support them to get the gas price down is to get more supply into the domestic network. That’s always been true. Another budget day tradition is the “conga line” of stakeholders and expert groups that forms in the press gallery of Parliament House shortly after the treasurer’s speech, to give their snap analysis and comments to media. We’ll bring you dispatches from various groups through the evening, with the conga line now beginning. First up, we had a conservation group calling on the government to “fund the extinction crisis properly” and take more action on wildlife protection. Next was Steve Robson, president of the Australian Medical Association. He said it was a budget that was about “inking a lot of promises” made in the election campaign, but called on the government to do more on hospital and health funding in its next budget in May. Robson said the 2023 budget would require “real change and real reform”, saying access to health in regional and rural areas was being “choked off” and public hospitals being overwhelmed. “This is going to take a large investment,” Robson said, adding “the real work will have to begin” next year. Ian Henschke, of National Seniors Australia, said his group was disappointed that the government hadn’t done more to let pensioners work more without affecting their pension payments. Henschke said he was “frustrated” that the pensioners work policy was only time-limited until next year, and claimed the income cap wasn’t high enough. He said the government could start to solve workforce issues in aged care and childcare by letting seniors work more, claiming many people were being left in “pension poverty” because they couldn’t supplement their income enough. Katharine Murphy’s verdict is in, and it is probably something you should read sooner rather than later. She says: The Albanese government has an unofficial mantra. No sudden movements. Don’t surprise the voters. Chalmers is pressed again on tax reform – that “conversation” he’s keen to keep having with Australia. He ducks a question about whether he’s committed to actual reform. He says: I’m interested in hearing all of the ideas from every corner of the community about how we can make our budget more sustainable. Tax is a part of that but not the only part of it. And that’s the traditional ABC post-budget interview done. On with the show! Review under way to look at increasing revenue from gas exporters: Chalmers Chalmers is now asked about about getting more revenue from the gas exporters. There’s a review under way, Chalmers says, adding that he is doing work “right now” on the code of conduct and on prices. He says: We want to support local industry. We want to keep faith with our international partners and export partners in particular. We need to strike the right balance here. The energy market is not working right now for local industry or for Australians. Any responsible government looks at steps it could take to change that. Ferguson brings up the stage three tax cuts, which the government seemed to flirt with ditching before saying they would keep them. Chalmers says: We’ve said it’s important that people get some tax relief when the budget can afford it. Those tax cuts are legislated. We haven’t changed our plans. Wages are “already moving … in the right direction”, Chalmers says, but he concedes that wages are not keeping pace with the high inflation levels. “Our job is to do what we can on the inflation side and on the wages side,” he says: I’m really confident that we’ve lined up nicely the spending restraints side of the budget, the cost-of-living relief, but, just as importantly, the investment in a stronger economy. Because this budget is more than battening down the hatches. It’s about backing in families. It’s about building a better future. And I think we’ve struck the right balance. Treasurer on forecast power prices: ‘We’ve got a big problem’ I mentioned earlier that the government has promised there’s “more to come” on potential regulatory action on power prices – with predictions of huge increases in the coming years. Those forecasts are “relatively new”, Jim Chalmers says, and the work in that area is “ongoing”. He says: I think it’s reasonable that we flag, as I did before today, and as I did today, that whether it’s gas, whether it’s electricity, we’ve got a big problem. We’ve got an inflation problem. The biggest or most concerning part of that, in addition to the impact of natural disasters, is what’s happening in energy. That’s happening right around the world. But we care about its impact on Australians. We’ve got more work to do. NDIS review will ensure ‘every dollar’ gets ‘value for money’: treasurer The NDIS is going to cost hundreds of billions of dollars over the next ten years, Chalmers says, and it’s putting “incredible pressure” on the government. He says: We don’t approach the NDIS as the source of savings for the sake of it. We believe in the NDIS. We created it. We think it’s doing important work for Australians with a disability. We support it. We want it to endure and survive. That means every dollar needs to get value for money. And that’s what the review is about. Now, if it turns out the trajectory of spending is better than it is currently, that’s a good outcome as long as we’re maintaining the level of service. We’ve started with some substantial budget repair tonight. There is more to come, whether it’s in this area or in other areas. We’ve already flagged that. The best way for your viewers to understand this budget tonight is that it’s the first of three or four in the life of this parliamentary term. It is the beginning of a more responsible approach to the budget, not the end. Ferguson is grilling Chalmers on his spending, saying he’s spent $1bn more than he’s saved this year. She’s quite sceptical that equates to a budget with “hard decisions”. Chalmers says they’ve made a “good start”. “You need to start somewhere,” he says: We’ve got big, persistent, structural spending issues in the budget. That means we’ve inherited a budget with structural deficit. You need to start somewhere. $1tn in debt and deficits as far as the eye can see – you’ve got to start somewhere. We’ve made more savings than recent budgets. He’s talking about the blowouts in hospitals, aged care, and the NDIS – the biggest cost on the budgets, though, is the interest on their borrowing. Jim Chalmers begins interview with Sarah Ferguson on ABC And now he’s up – Jim Chalmers is talking to the ABC’s Sarah Ferguson. He’s defending the number of “hard decisions” his government has made. Chalmers says: The hard decisions are in every dollar of those $22bn in savings. The hard decisions are in every dollar not spent from this very temporary, but substantial, welcome improvement in tax revenues from some of temporary conditions like higher commodity prices. When you sit around the Expenditure Review Committee table as we have for many hours with my colleagues, one of the hardest things to do is to exercise spending restraint. I think what defines this budget and distinguished it from our predecessors is restraint. Finance minister, Katy Gallagher, pointed to the women’s budget statement - which briefly disappeared under former prime minister Tony Abbott but was reinstated in recent years. The statement was an important first step, Gallagher said. “We’re putting women’s economic equality and women’s safety as an important part of this budget,” she said. The idea is that eventually the gender equality information would be “part of the normal process of budgeting”, she said: The idea is that we would mainstream it into the budget papers, my hope is that at the end we don’t need a women’s statement. Chalmers also hinted at more regulatory control on the electricity industry, with predictions of huge price increases. “I’m not going to pretend that we’re not worried about these electricity prices,” he said, blaming the war in Ukraine for “playing havoc” with energy markets, and a decade of energy policy indecision. He said: I think any responsible government facing these kinds of price hikes … needs to consider a broader suite of regulatory interventions than they might have considered in years gone by. We have more work to do … More will be done and we’ll have more to say about that in due course. Housing will be built ‘where the job opportunities are’ in the regions, treasurer says There were a couple of questions in the presser about all those “aspirational” houses. Chalmers said they were looking at parts of the market where “low vacancy rates and high rents are pricing people out”. He was asked where they would be built, and said it would be wherever jobs and opportunities were – and he said that meant in the regions. He said alongside other ways of making homes more affordable to buy, there was also an opportunity to help people rent. That’s where the superannuation industry and other institutions come in. He said: Our overwhelming priority is to be where the job opportunities are, and clearly the job opportunities are in regional areas. There will be more work to do with the really quite committed group that I’ve put together. He said the superannuation industry had signed up: “Superannuation is such an important part of this puzzle and a number of the big funds have signed up, properly signed up and we’ve engaged with them properly and repeatedly.” Chalmers said it was “very deliberate” that work towards the target was set to begin in 2024, because there was inflation in the sector, along with supply chain and workforce issues. Chalmers must be having a relatively relaxed stroll over to the ABC studios, so I’ll squeeze in a bit of the press conference he held earlier today. One of the highlights (or annoying time sucks, depending on how your day is going) of lockup is the afternoon press conference. It’s quite a polite affair, even though it features PowerPoints. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, was joined by the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, for today’s presser. Chalmers started off by repeating many of the main points from the speech, with a particular emphasis on the “spending restraint” in his first budget. “Restraint is the name of the game in this budget,” he said. He was also keen to emphasise that 99% of the increased revenue in the budget was being returned to the bottom line. Chalmers also talked about tax reforms, without directly mentioning those stage three tax cuts that everyone has been talking about. He mentioned several times that he was delighted there appeared to be a public appetite for conversations around tax reform. He said: I think tax needs to be part of the conversation going forward … what we’ve done in this budget is we’ve built the foundation of a more sustainable budget but there’s more work to do. He said there was more work to do on multinational taxes and tax compliance measures as well as any future reforms: “I have been incredibly heartened by people and their willingness to engage,” he said. While we wait for Chalmers to pop up on the ABC, here’s Sarah Martin’s overview of the October budget for 2022-23: Jim Chalmers will swiftly head for the ABC studios for a grilling on the budget. When I get a chance, I’ll share some of the highlights of the afternoon’s press conference, and point you to what my colleagues have been working on all day. And then we will all brace for the onslaught of reactions from lobby groups, the opposition (particularly the Nationals), and, of course, the public. In the conclusion to his first budget speech, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says: Australians know there are hard days to come, and hard decisions to accompany them. Getting through this period stronger than we were before will rely on the best of our character – our resilience, our pragmatism, our cooperation and our confidence, and above all, our belief in each other. And it will rely on a government dedicated and determined – to confront challenges ignored for too long, and to seize the opportunities that won’t wait any longer. This Budget does more than end a wasted decade – a decade marked by energy chaos, a crisis in aged care, skills shortages and stagnant wages, and not enough to show for a trillion dollars in debt. It does more than draw a line under the drift, decline and decay that defined it. It begins to put things right. It begins to build a better future, that befits our people and the sacrifices they make for each other. A future we can all have a stake in, all sharing in its success. A stronger, more resilient Australia. With more opportunities for more people, in more parts of our amazing country. Defence spending will restore Australia’s role as ‘diligent and dependable’ Pacific partner: Chalmers There’s $6.1bn more in this budget for hospitals and healthcare, Chalmers says, and more money for aged care. On the NDIS, he says the budget “begins the task” of repairing it. He talks about money to end violence against women and children, to close the gap and start getting ready for the voice to parliament referendum, as well as establishing “the long overdue” national anti-corruption commission. Defence funding will rise above 2% of GDP over the forward estimates, and Chalmers says we are restoring our role as a “diligent and dependable partner and friend to our Pacific neighbours – for a stable, peaceful and more prosperous region”. Government will limit spending while inflation is high, treasurer says This budget “makes hard decisions for hard times”, Chalmers says. While our economic policies put a premium on resilience, our fiscal strategy puts a premium on restraint. This is important – to keep spending under control, to give ourselves a better buffer for any further downturns, and to make sure we are not adding to inflation. Chalmers points to that forecast $36.9bn deficit and warns that “while the temporary revenue boosts we are getting from higher employment and higher commodity prices will fade and fall, the profound and permanent spending pressures on the budget are forecast to grow and grow”. There’s a “bigger job to do” to make the budget sustainable, he says, and tonight is just “the first step”. Almost all the new revenue will go back to the bottom line, he says, and the government will limit spending growth while inflation is high. New spending will be focused on “investments that grow the capacity of the economy”. Chalmers has been increasingly keen to start a conversation about tax reform, and now he says: This is just the beginning of our budget repair work, and it’s just the beginning of the conversation we need to have as a country – about our economic and fiscal challenges, and about the choices we need to make on what’s affordable and what’s fair. So we can pay to service the debt that was left to us – when borrowing costs are the fastest growing budget pressure, rising at more than 14% a year over a decade. Chalmers outlines goal for Australia to be ‘a country that makes things again’ Chalmers says “a better future for Australia must mean a future made in Australia”. He says the $15bn National Reconstruction Fund will help “finance projects that expand our industrial base, diversify our economy, create sustainable, well-paid jobs, and grow our regional centres”: No more sleepwalking while other advanced economies seize new opportunities. No more surrendering industries and jobs overseas. No more selling out our future, by clinging to the past. In clean energy manufacturing; in medical manufacturing; in new technologies; in agriculture; in critical minerals. So that we can be a country that makes things again. So that we can add more value to the things that we sell to the world. And so that every part of the country can have a stake in our Australian-made future. Government’s energy plan will provide certainty to investors, treasurer says Chalmers is talking about the “generational and economic imperative of acting on climate change”. He says the government has a plan to provide stability to the energy grid and certainty to investors. He lists a range of projects the government has backed to stabilise the electricity grid, from windfarms to Tasmania’s Marinus Link project, as well as plans to make electric cars more affordable and increasing solar battery storage. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is now moving on to education, and the need for an economy that is “more resilient, more inclusive, more modern”, with skills at the centre of it, along with “cleaner, cheaper, more reliable energy”. He’s talking about the plan for nearly half-a-million fee-free Tafe courses, and 20,000 new university places over the next two years: Because no Australian should be denied – by poverty, by postcode, or by lack of privilege – their chance at a better future. Accord promising 1m new homes a ‘serious start’ to solving crisis, treasurer says On the childcare payments, Chalmers says it’s a “gamechanging investment in families our workforce, and our economy”. The expanded paid parental leave scheme, he says, is “about greater equality and greater security for Australian women – and more dads doing their bit”. He’s going through that new housing accord, which has a few different elements, and was (apart from some grim economic figures) the standout story of today’s budget. The accord is a “serious start” to solving the housing crisis, he says. And on wages, he says: “Australians now know this: deliberately keeping wages low is no longer federal government policy.” Bringing it all together, Chalmers is talking about the need to make the economy more resilient. He says too much of Australia’s potential has been “wasted … and the costs of that are clear with falling real wages, flatlining productivity, widespread skills shortages, and too many Australians denied the opportunity of a better future”. He adds: We agreed there that full employment, productivity growth and equal opportunities for women should be core objectives of government policy. And we know the key to this is quality investments in the capacity of the Australian economy and the capabilities of the Australian people. Cost of living relief package is $7.5bn to address childcare, parental leave, housing: treasurer That cost of living help mentioned earlier is a $7.5bn package, Chalmers says (readers, part of the magic of budgets is the way different measures can be sliced and diced and put back together into impressive sounding “packages”). The policies on childcare, parental leave, cheaper medicines, more affordable housing, and wage increases will boost productivity, grow the economy, and put some money back in people’s pockets, he says. The paid parental leave will be scaled up to six months, with a portion reserved for each parent, to encourage both to take leave. Medicines on the PBS will be reduced by $12.50 to $30. The new bit is the housing accord with that aforementioned ambitious target of 1m new homes within the decade. And there’s the plan to “get wages moving again”. (The Guardian Australia team has been ferreting through all those policies, so we’ll have all the details for you shortly.) Chalmers warns about the impact of the floods that have hit large parts of southern and eastern Australia. These are human tragedies that also affect the budget, he says. $3bn has been “provisioned” as a response to the floods, he says, and more than 5,000 extra volunteers will be deployed through Disaster Relief Australia. I was so excited about following treasurer Jim Chalmers’ first budget speech that I very rudely forgot to thank Josh Taylor for looking after the blog while we were in lockup. Sorry, Josh! Chalmers: Wages expected to start growing in real terms by 2023-24 Then, of course, there are the inflationary pressures, both domestic and global. Chalmers has talked a great deal about the need to align monetary policy (the Reserve Bank of Australia’s bit) with fiscal policy (the government’s bit). He says: While we intend to avoid the worst of the turbulence from overseas, we cannot escape it completely … Global challenges, along with high inflation and higher interest rates, will have an impact. Our economy is expected to grow solidly this financial year, by 3.25% – before slowing to 1.5% growth for 2023–24, a full percentage point lower than what was forecast in March. That hit to growth will affect jobs, Chalmers says, with unemployment set to hit 4.5% in 2023-24 (which is still pretty low). Inflation will peak at 7.75% later this year, but will go down to 3.5% in 2023-24, which is when real wages should start growing again. Treasurer warns of prospect of a ‘third global downturn’ due to Ukraine war The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, warns about “the prospect of a third global downturn in a decade and a half”. He says: This time, not a financial crisis or a pandemic, but a war driving high prices and higher interest rates here and around the world, and the risk of another global recession. This time demands a different response. One that puts a premium on what’s responsible, affordable, and sustainable. That’s why this budget pays for what’s important, strengthens our buffers against adversity, and begins to build a better future. He says it delivers on the government’s commitments to deliver: Cheaper child care, and more paid parental leave. Better access to health care, cheaper medicines, and a better standard of aged care. Fee-free Tafe and more university places. Cheaper and cleaner energy. More affordable housing. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has started giving his budget speech. I will now hand you over to Tory Shepherd for the ongoing budget coverage tonight. The budget lock up has been unlocked, the doors flung open, the piles of papers released to the world. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has just got to his feet in the House of Representatives to deliver the budget speech on this “do-over” budget, which was made necessary by ever-grimmer economic conditions both here and globally. Key words in Chalmers’ speech and in the budget papers include “inflation”, “restraint”, “housing”, “responsible”, “resilience”, “cost of living”, “challenges” and the slightly euphemistic “reprioritisation” (which means cutting from somewhere to spend somewhere else). Here’s your first, once-over lightly, look: There’s a five-point cost of living plan, including a new national housing accord that aims to deliver 1m new homes; $4.7bn for cheaper child care; $531.6m for expanding paid parental leave; $787.1m for cheaper prescriptions and a plan to support wage increases. There are more fee-free Tafe places, 20,000 university places for disadvantaged Australians, and a range of other investments in education, along with support for women’s workforce participation, $20bn for “powering Australia”, money for disaster resilience and reconstruction, and for infrastructure including the NBN and transport. And there’s the start of “budget repair”, through “spending reductions”, that “reprioritisation” and a crackdown on tax dodgers. The deficit for this financial year is forecast to be $36.9bn. The government says its audit identified $22bn in savings over the next four years, while a tax compliance crackdown will deliver another $4.7bn. About $950m will come from getting multinationals to pay their fair share. That housing accord aims to deliver 1m “new, well-located homes” by the end of the decade. It’s not clear exactly how it will get to the magic million, but it includes 40,000 more affordable homes, another 20,000 from the states and territories, and will encourage institutions (including superannuation funds) to invest in social and affordable housing. The government will make housing investments more attractive by helping to cover the gap between market rents and subsidised rents. It is an “initial, aspirational” target, by the way. In his budget speech, Chalmers declares this a “responsible” budget that “delivers on the priorities of the Australian people, and … repays their faith in a new government”. He sets out the headwinds facing the nation – from the pandemic, to natural disasters, global uncertainty and “painful price rises” as the world is buffeted by rising inflation. Chalmers says: The Australian people have demonstrated the best of our national character. Resolute and resilient in hard times. Practical and pragmatic about the challenges we confront. Optimistic and confident in a better future. And ready to work together to build it. The budget, he says, will provide cost of living relief, invest in a “stronger, more resilient, more modern economy”, and “begin the hard yards of budget repair”. The Guardian Australia team has – for the second time this year – waded through an enormous stack of budget papers to bring you the best and the worst of it. Katharine Murphy is in Canberra with Sarah Martin, Daniel Hurst, Paul Karp, Josh Butler, Greg Jericho and photographer-at-large Mike Bowers. Lenore Taylor is in Sydney with Anne Davies, Adam Morton, Michael McGowan, Caitlin Cassidy and Nick Evershed. We are now just 10 minutes away from the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, delivering his first budget speech in the House of Representatives, and all the journalists being let out of the lockup. Looks like WhatsApp is down. Severe thunderstorm warning in south-east Queensland and Proserpine Parts of Perth airport evacuated after fire A small kitchen fire has forced the evacuation of parts of Perth airport, AAP reports. The fire activated alarms in terminals three and four on Tuesday afternoon. “As per normal safety procedures, the terminals were evacuated,” an airport spokesperson said. Airport firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze. Crowds of people were forced to gather outside the terminal, with many contemplating delays thanks to the disruption. Although passengers were set to be allowed to return, authorities conceded delays for some departing flights were expected. Experts warn against cuts to NDIS in budget National Disability Services, which represents the industry for National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) services, has warned the government ahead of the budget not to make cuts to the scheme. The NDS chief executive, Laurie Leigh, said: Regarding NDIS expenditure, it’s important to recognise that the NDIS has fundamentally changed the lives of people with disability and we must remember that at the heart of all of this, it is them who will be affected by cutting down the system without proper, thought out consultation with sector. The individuals and organisations providing life changing and lifesaving services are the key to making sure the scheme delivers on its promise. Beyond its social benefits the NDIS is an investment in the Australian economy. Research by economic consultants Per Capita found that for every dollar spent on the NDIS, the scheme delivers $2.25 to the broader Australian economy. In 2020-21 the NDIS generated $52.4bn in value to the broader economy. The NDIS review announced recently by Bill Shorten, minister for the NDIS, represents an opportunity to ensure that this investment is efficiently spent in effectively providing quality services to people with disability. Providers have unique practical expertise in service delivery to contribute to the review process. Cruise ship passengers visiting WA test positive to Covid Passengers and crew on the first major cruise liner to visit Western Australia since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic have tested positive for the virus, AAP reports. Health authorities and the ship’s operators, Carnival Australia, have not revealed how many cases are on board the Coral Princess but say they are being managed according to recently established protocols. That includes the small number with the virus being isolated for five days. After spending a day in Broome on Monday, the ship was sailing to Geraldton on Tuesday and was also due to dock at Fremantle, Busselton and Albany. WA Health said it had been advised that some passengers and crew members had tested positive for Covid-19 but the operators were managing those cases on board. “WA health has not been asked for assistance in managing the cases,” a spokesperson said in a statement. Carnival Australia president, Marguerite Fitzgerald, said as a result of early detection and isolation measures, case numbers on board remained steady. “These guests are being cared for in their staterooms by our medical and support staff,” she said in a statement. “We are pleased to share that all cases on board have been mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic.” Fitzgerald said the majority of the ship’s 2,000 passengers were unaffected and were allowed to move about freely on board and disembark at upcoming locations. This includes Geraldton where any disembarking guests will be required to undertake a rapid antigen test prior to going ashore. This is standard procedure and one that is well understood by our guests to protect themselves, other guests, our crew and the community. The Shire of Broome said many of the Coral Princess passengers came ashore, spending Monday in town or involved in organised shore excursions. It said they were expected to inject about $190,000 into the local economy. But the arrival of the ship was met with mixed reactions from locals. In social media posts, some welcomed the return of the cruise liners and the boost to the economy while others expressed concern about the health risks, particularly to vulnerable groups. Large cruise ships were banned from WA waters in 2020. Those restrictions were lifted in April this year for ships with up to 350 passengers. Larger ships were allowed to return from 1 October. Gear up, fellow Melburnians. Ruling on Opal card reader switch-off postponed The Australian rail union will have to wait until next year to learn whether it can legally turn off Opal card readers at Sydney trains stations in its ongoing industrial dispute with the NSW government, AAP reports. On Tuesday afternoon, Justice Elizabeth Raper refused an application by the Rail, Tram and Bus Industry Union to expedite a hearing on whether the proposal to turn off the readers was legal and protected. The judge dismissed the expedition bid, which was also backed by the NSW-government run Sydney Trains, after saying last week that the courts would not be a mere “adviser” to organisations about whether certain industrial action was permitted or not. The rail union asked for a quick answer from the federal court so it knew as soon as possible whether it could proceed without putting itself or its members at legal risk. On Monday, Raper also refused a separate request by the RTBU that she step down from overseeing the matter. The hearing will now occur over two days in February or March next year on a date yet to be fixed. The court will determine whether proposals to turn off the Opal card readers in August and September this year were actually industrial action which was protected by ballot orders made by the Fair Work Commission. The question of whether the current proposal to switch off the readers announced by the union on 16 October is industrial action will also be considered. The union and government are locked in a protracted stoush over a new enterprise agreement, and are also at loggerheads over a South Korean-built fleet of intercity trains, in storage since 2019. The union argues the trains are not safe to operate in NSW yet while the government insists they are. The RTBU and Sydney Trains did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Josh Taylor is going to guide you through the next couple of hours before Tory Shepherd steps in when the budget embargo lifts around 7.30pm (the actual embargo is when the treasurer starts his speech so it is not an exact time). I’ll be taking a look at the budget once lock up is over, but make sure you keep checking back through the night as coverage is added to the website. Thanks so much for joining me today and have fun with Josh. I’ll be back tomorrow morning. Until then, take care of you A x NSW SES commencing flood assessments across the north of the state The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast widespread intense rain to ease, with warnings being downgraded today in some locations on the east coast. The NSW SES deputy commissioner, Daniel Austin, said NSW SES members had conducted 452 damage assessments primarily in Moree and Gunnedah, and had responded to 559 requests for assistance over the past 24 hours (3pm-3pm). Despite the severe weather easing over the next couple of days, the flood threat remains in many areas across the state as major flood peaks moving downstream and road closures continue. Storms are still possible and can cause flash flooding, so we ask drivers to take care as any amount of rainfall can create a dangerous situation with saturated catchments. There are 126 flood warnings current this afternoon (Tuesday, 25 October), including 24 emergency warnings for parts of the Gwydir, Namoi and Murray rivers. With 7,000 people still affected by emergency warnings, NSW SES members are working with emergency service partners to help residents in western and south-western parts of the state who are isolated by floodwater including at Moree, Gunnedah and Moama. This is in addition to major flooding continuing along the Macquarie, Bogan, Lachlan, Barwon, Darling and Macintyre rivers. With the situation rapidly changing, we ask members of the community to follow directions from emergency services, follow road signs and never enter floodwater. ABC appoints new editorial director ABC’s managing director, David Anderson, has announced the appointment of Judith Whelan to the role of editorial director, effective in February 2023. Currently ABC’s director of regional and local, Whelan is one of Australian media’s most respected editorial leaders, bringing more than thirty years of journalism experience to the role. Whelan replaces Craig McMurtrie, who recently announced his retirement. Anderson said the ABC’s editorial policies, standards, and processes were in good hands with Judith’s decision to take on this very important role. The ABC’s responsibility as the most trusted media provider is more vital than ever, and I am delighted Judith is taking up this important leadership position. The Australian public and ABC employees can have confidence that a journalist and editorial leader of Judith’s calibre will support fearless independent public interest journalism, while ensuring that the ABC continues to meet high editorial standards. With the newly announced role of the ABC Ombudsman, the ABC is committed to upholding the highest and most rigorous standards of journalism and production. Since joining the ABC in 2016 Judith has led her teams through change and growth and successfully delivered enhanced content and services to our audiences. As director, regional and local since 2019, Judith has tirelessly championed the stories and reporting of our teams working in our capital cities and in rural and regional communities, ensuring Australians everywhere can access the content they need. This has been especially critical during emergency broadcasting events. I congratulate Judith on the contribution she has made to the ABC so far and look forward to working with her into the future. Adam Bandt on Thorpe: ‘I’m not going to take lectures from Peter Dutton about that’ Adam Bandt was also asked about Lidia Thorpe in this pre-recorded interview on the ABC: Senator Thorpe has paid a price. She has stood down from the deputy leadership of the Senate. She has admitted that she was wrong. And has requested that it be looked into by the Senate. That is far more than any Liberal politician has ever done. And for the Liberal politicians and Peter Dutton to now come out and talk about pretending to care about integrity after presiding over a decade of rorts and scandals is utter hypocrisy. And I’m not going to take lectures from Peter Dutton about that. Senator Thorpe admitted that she did the wrong thing and has stood down from a her position and has asked for it to be inquired into. When was the last time anyone from the Liberal party ever did anything similar? There are still meetings happening that have nothing to do with the budget, though. Greens: government could ease pressures on everyday people without adding to inflation Adam Bandt tells the ABC the government could be reprioritising spending: There is money that could be spent right now on doing things like getting dental into Medicare that would ease the pressure on everyday people without adding to those inflationary pressures. We can do that. But it’s a matter of choices for the government. So there’s things that the government could do right now to make life better and deal with these external pressures – but at the moment, their priority seems to be to spend a quarter of a trillion dollars on tax cuts for Clive Palmer, politicians, and the very wealthy. That is only going to add to the pressures, including the inflationary pressures, that people are feeling. Now the budget lockup is underway in earnest, the parliament will quieten down a little, as a lot of the MPs enter the lock up or wait for some clear air when people are actually paying attention (which is not now). Liberals: ‘what we’ve seen already in the budget papers is a plan to fail’ Jane Hume appears to be following the Coalition line of wanting the government to do something about the cost of living, but it remains very unclear what that something is. Hume tells the ABC the Labor government inherited a good economy from the Coalition: Their inheritance has been low unemployment, a AAA credit rating, an improving budget bottom line and reductions to debt. So we want to make sure that they can consolidate on that. But we also want to see a plan … to reduce inflation down to that 2-3% band that the RBA work within. And that’s so that the RBA don’t have to do all of the heavy lifting. We don’t want the government to be working one direction and the RBA to be working in another – foot on the pedal and one side and foot on the brake on the other. We also want to see the government introduce a plan to help with the cost-of-living crisis right now. Not in two years – right now. Because we know that Australians are doing it tough, at the bowser, at the grocery checkout, and particularly when they’re paying their mortgage. And they’re looking to their government for help. And then in the medium term what we want to see is a plan for growth. A plan for productive capacity and for participation. Because unless your growth is outstripping your spending, then you’re in a consistently deteriorating economy. My concern is that what we’ve seen already in the budget papers is a plan to fail. You know, Labor have raised the white flag already. They’ve said that inflation is going to continue to rise for another two years. That growth is going to continue to fall. That real wages are going to continue to fall. So, what we want to see from Labor is a plan to address these issues, rather than just saying, “It’s inevitable.” And the only way to deal with that is to raise taxes. And that would be the worst possible thing that you could do right now. Because Australians are crying out for help and relief. It remains unclear what the Coalition wants. Judgement ordering VicForests to protect tree geebung a ‘win for the rule of law’ A little more on the supreme court judgment in Victoria which has ordered VicForests to protect an endangered tree species known as tree geebung. Warburton Environment, the group that brought the case, has described judgment as a “win for the rule of law”. The judgment orders VicForests to properly survey for tree geebung, to record the location of individual trees and apply a protective buffer zone of 50 metres. However, the court did rule that the survey and buffers would not be required if they were not “practicable”, with VicForests required to inform Warburton Environment and the Office of the Conservation Regulator when this occurred. Warburton Environment’s spokesperson, Nic Fox, said the Victorian government had “spent vast amounts of taxpayer money on this court case to allow its money-pit woodchipping company to send a great Victorian tree extinct”. She said “the verdict was a win for the rule of law”. The matter of public importance debate is being held … the topic: reversing the Morrison government decision to recognise West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. (The opposition picks the topics). Speaker reiterates budget speech rules Milton Dick tells the chamber that as is practice, Jim Chalmers gets to deliver his budget speech in silence and if anyone needs to leave the chamber, they have to give a hand-written note to ensure no interruptions. The same courtesy will be given to Peter Dutton when he does the Coalition’s budget in reply speech. And while the speech clock will be on, there is no time limit – Chalmers can speak all night if he wanted to. And at 3.51pm, after largely escaping questions, Anthony Albanese declares question time over. Catherine King defends the $2.2bn the federal government has committed to the Melbourne suburban rail loop, which she says will also benefit regional communities, and improve access to infrastructure such as hospitals. And then Chris Bowen once again talks about the government’s energy transition plan. You can read more about the case here: On the Lehrman trial For those asking, there are times when juries are dismissed after being unable to come to an agreement. But usually, the judge speaks to a couple of jurors and questions them, to make sure for themselves that they will be unable to come to a decision. Being asked to return to deliberations happens quite frequently, when juries report being unable to come to a verdict. Kristy McBain is giving an update on the support and assistance available for the floods. And Chris Bowen is answering another question about electricity prices. Question time is going a little bit longer because of the half hour which was dedicated to condolence motions at the beginning. The jury in the Bruce Lehrmann trial has been urged to continue attempting to reach a verdict after signalling to the court they were “unable” to agree unanimously. Opposition continues the energy prices time warp, again There are more questions from the opposition on energy prices, as if the Coalition had nothing to do with the energy policy for the best part of the last 10 years. And the fact that the energy regulator warned higher prices were coming, and then energy minister Angus Taylor delayed the announcement until after the election (changing a regulation in order to do it). We are stuck in a time loop where opposition MPs ask about electricity prices in their area and Chris Bowen responds with “talk to Angus Taylor” and then around and around we go. Labor has activated the national coordination mechanism on the Medibank hack Clare O’Neil continues: We are taking this seriously and the work that is being done is being undertaken by the smartest and toughest people who work for the Australian government. I want to thank the Australian Signals Directorate and the Australian Federal Police on the intensive work that is under way to hunt down the attacker. They are undertaking a very significant operation. The AFP are leading a criminal investigation into the matter. Services Australia and the Department of Health are working to protect the government information that may be exposed here. Services Australia has done an immense amounts of worker to protect their own network which has an interaction with Medibank. We are putting in place substantial to Australians should the worst [happen] and some of this information be made public. Because of the way this situation developed over the weekend through Friday and Saturday, on Saturday I asked my department to activate the national coordination mechanism to coordinate the work that’s being done on Medibank. It was set up by the former government as a crisis response mechanism to deal with the most difficult and complex aspects of managing the pandemic. We’re picking up that model. What we can see is Medibank is just as complex and urgent as some of what we dealt with there. … I’d say finally, combined with [the] Optus [data breach], this is an enormous wake-up call for the country here. Cybercriminals are the thugs of the 21st century, the bag snatchers and the armed robbers. We need to do more to step up as a country. This government is doing everything it can to protect Australians against this breach. Clare O’Neil, the home affairs minister, takes a dixer on Medibank but it is worth reporting so here is what she has to say: One of the reasons why the government is so worried about this is because of the nature of the data that’s been held here. In a lot of cyber-attacks, our big fears are around identity theft and financial crime and those are very difficult complex and important cases. Ultimately something can usually be done to protect consumers. We can replace bank cards. When it comes to the personal health information of Australians, the damage here is potentially irreparable. Australians who are struggling with mental health conditions, drug and alcohol addiction, with diseases that carry some shame or embarrassment, they are entitled to keep that information private and confidential. For a cybercriminal to hang this over the heads of Australians is a dog act. It is scum of the earth, lowest-of-the-low territory. More on power bills Angie Bell (LNP, MP for Moncrieff in Queensland) to Chris Bowen (minister for energy and climate change): 22,000 small businesses in south-east Queensland, including many businesses in my are currently on electricity standing offers. Instead of their electricity bills falling, as you promised, they’re set to increase by up to $1,700. Why is the government making the cost of living crisis worse for small business owners? Bowen: Thanks again, Mr Speaker. I welcome the honourable member’s interest in the energy costs of small business in Queensland. I imagine she was outraged by my predecessor hiding the increase in energy prices for Queensland businesses prior to the election. I imagine she’s outraged the minister changed the law by signing a regulation to hide this increase, which he was told was inevitable. I’m sure she shares my anger. I’m sure she shares my disrespect. I’m sure she shares my disdain for such a thing to be dishonest to Queensland small businesses. Paul Fletcher, interjecting: … it’s very clear that all imputations of improper motives to a member are highly disorderly. We keep hearing the minister attributing improper motives to the former minister for energy. He ought not to do ... (There is no point of order) Bowen: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The honourable member well knows the plan we took to the election was to take energy to renewables, 82%, by 2030, to put downward pressure on energy prices, to build the transmission network right across the country. She well knows that’s why we went to the election and that’s what we’re doing and we’ll continue to do. Andrew Wilkie (independent for Clark in Tasmania) to Julie Collins (housing minister) The housing crisis is getting worse, particularly in Tasmania. With increasing homelessness, too little crisis accommodation, unaffordable rents and attainable home ownership - clearly this is not good enough and we need to act now. Will the government commit to working with all levels of government to remedy things and to extend the national rental affordability scheme, increase Commonwealth rent assistance, and revisit investment property tax reform? Collins: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I want to thank the member for his question. I know he like many people in this place is concerned about those Australians who are struggling to find safe and secure housing, particularly affordable housing at the moment. Certainly we understand that safe and affordable housing is central to the security and dignity of all Australians. We want every Australian to have the security of having a roof over their head but we’re dealing with increasing housing affordability costs. Far too many Australians are being hit by increasing rents and far too many Australians are struggling to purchase a home still. And sadly far too many Australians are facing or at risk of homelessness today. The situation is completely unacceptable which is why we’ve hit the ground running to deliver on our ambitious housing reform agenda we took to the election … we want to make it easier for Australians to buy a home and want to increase the supply of housing to reduce overcrowding and reduce rents. We want to improve access to social and affordable housing and we want to address the needs of those who find themselves at risk of homelessness or who are indeed homeless. We want to ensure investments and reforms are both long-term and sustainable. To this end we have brought forward the start of the regional first-home buyer guarantee to 1 October and that will allow up to 10,000 eligible Australians into home ownership sooner. We’ve acted quickly to unlock up to $575 million through the national housing infrastructure facility. And of course we’re doing it while we wait for the Housing Australia Future Fund which is our significant $10bn investment that will build 30,000 new affordable homes in the first five ... Wilkie asks about relevance, but Milton Dick rules that his question was broad, so the minister resumes: Collins: We want to develop a national housing and homelessness plan and want to work with the other tiers of government. We’ve had two meetings already of state and territory housing ministers. The first we had in July was the first meeting in almost five years because we inherited a system where those on the other side did very little when it come to housing affordability across this country. We also are going to introduce a national housing supply and affordability council to ensure the commonwealth does play a leadership role in ensuring housing supply and improving housing affordability. There will be details on these reforms in the budget tonight. The initiatives and reforms need to be sustainable and lead to long-term permanent housing for those that need it most. We learnt the lesson the hard way from those when we saw important housing programs abolished. One was abolished by Tony Abbott back in 2014, the NRAS (the National Rental Affordability Scheme). The reports that we’re proposing will be permanently boosting the supply of affordable housing and take pressure off the rental market. When too many Australians don’t have a safe place to call home, we can’t afford to waste a day and we absolutely won’t. (An earlier version of this post incorrectly named Justine Elliott instead of Julie Collins. Entirely my fault. I am very tired) Court rules VicForests must protect endangered tree geebung The supreme court of Victoria has ordered VicForests to protect an endangered tree species known as tree geebung after it found the state-owned corporation’s activities had led to the loss of “many hundreds or even thousands of mature trees”. The judgment in a case brought by Warburton Environment was handed down today. The court found VicForests failed to conduct targeted surveys to detect mature tree geebungs before harvesting, failed to provide sufficient or any buffers to protect mature trees, and failed to protect mature trees from regeneration burning in coupes after harvesting. The judgment states that unless these problems were addressed, tree geebungs “will not be protected and will continue to be lost in considerable numbers during coupe harvesting and regeneration burning”. It says given the evidence presented to the court, it was highly likely significant numbers of tree geebung had been lost in the Central Highlands as a result of harvesting and regeneration burning. The judgment states: The precise extent of the loss will never be known, but on the basis of recent records is likely to amount to many hundreds or even thousands of mature trees. The court has ordered VicForests to conduct thorough surveys for tree geebung, to record the location of individual trees before harvesting, and to apply 50 metre protective buffer zones. More on power bills Terry Young (The LNP MP for Longman in Queensland) to Chris Bowen: RGS, a proudly Australian-owned and operated manufacturer in my electorate, had a power bill under the Coalition of around $39,000 last year. Their power bill under Labor will spike to around $73,000. An increase of $43,000. Just one of the many cost increases seen by businesses in Longman this year. When will the government deliver on its promise to cut power bills? Bowen: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I’m sure the figures provided by the honourable member are correct because they reflect the DMO, the default market offer, which outlined an increase on average of a Queensland small business of energy prices of $705 or 12.8%. That’s what the previous government knew about and wilfully misled Queensland businesses, small, medium, large, about. In a matter of fundamental, direct dishonesty. I welcome the fact they’re now somehow interested in energy prices. They weren’t interested when they were changing the law to hide energy increases for Queensland businesses. Queensland businesses will benefit from our policies to introduce renewable energy and introduce the transmission which apparently the Opposition is opposed to, the integrated systems plan, which we are getting on and delivering to reduce power prices for businesses in Queensland and around Australia. Bowen on renewables: we have a lot of catching up to do Ted O’Brien then delivers his question to Chris Bowen (as the climate change and energy minister) in a very angry voice – maybe because he is once again having to look into nuclear power, which his party had already rejected while in government, but now in opposition appears to be embracing. O’Brien (who really should be less cranky – the Sunshine Coast, which he represents, is a lovely part of the world): On 10 October the minister said in a speech: ‘we will need to install about 40 7- megawatt wind turbines every single month and 22,000 500-watts solar panels every single day to meet the government’s 82% renewable target by 2030’. How many wind turbines and solar panels have been installed since you’ve come to government? Bowen: I really do think the honourable member for that question, I really do, because it gives me an opportunity to remind the honourable members in the House of our plans to get to 82% renewables by 2030, [our] plans to reduce emissions by 2030. I thank the honourable member for quoting my speeches. He’s welcome to do it as much as he likes. I was … making the point in that speech we have a lot of catching up to do after a decade of denial and delay. We are walking out to the crease late in the match because we are making up for a decade of doing nothing when they were in office. So now we have to work faster to reduce emissions by 2030. Yes, those figures I quoted were correct. It underlines the size of the task. It underlines the size of the task of transmission. And I welcome questions on transmission because this government has actually delivered a deal with the government of Tasmania and the government of Victoria which they talked about for six years and we delivered in six months and you’ll see more of that type of action tonight and tomorrow and next week as well. And for the first time in a very long time, I just saw the coloured bar screen on the ABC – seems like the connection was cut for just a moment. That noise the no-signal signal makes is very annoying. And this used to be a regular happening? No stars. Treasury gets a dixer Assistant treasurer Stephen Jones got to be angry about the Coalition in a dixer, which is one of his favourite things. So that’s like a little budget day treat for him, with lots of “political bin chicken” insults hurled at the opposition. Jim Chalmers is in the lockup – he’ll be doing the rounds soon, speaking to each media outlet about the budget ahead of his press conference, which happens, in the lockup, just before the embargo lifts (it’s held in the second half of the lockup usually). David Littleproud to Chris Bowen: How many hectares of prime agricultural land and national parks will be impacted from the construction of 28,000km of poles and wires in communities as a result of the government’s energy policies? Bowen: I think the honourable member for his question. In relation to the announcement made by the prime minister and I last week, [the] Marinus Link goes under the Bass Strait, that’s the biggest investment we made in transmission and we will be working with ... Littleproud: Relevance, Mr Speaker. The question was very tight, it was around poles and wires on the 28,000km of them. That is above ground, not below it ... Milton Dick: The minister is 20 seconds into his answer. Order on my left. The manager of opposition business will cease interjecting, so will the leader of the Nationals. The minister is entitled to a preamble. I’ll ask him to return to the question and I give a call to the minister. Bowen: I thank the honourable member for his question and understand his sensitivity because they talked about Marinus Link for six years. We are delivering it in six months. That is the difference and Marinus Link is an important link between Tasmania and the mainland, the second and third links, because we believe Tasmania can become a 200% renewable economy. Paul Fletcher: Mr Speaker you made a very clear ruling the minister needed to return to the question, he is ignoring your ruling. Dick: You may resume your seat. Order. The minister is being relevant and I would like to hear what the minister is saying. Members on my left will cease interjecting. I give the call to the minister. Bowen: I am more than happy to deal with issues raised by the opposition because they are important ones. They are important because Marinus Link and other transmission projects, which it’s connected to like the north-west transition link, which the prime minister and I announced with the premier of Tasmania and the energy minister last week, as well as the Kerang link in Victoria, and we’re working with other states … I presume given the tone of questions from those opposite, they are very annoyed with the announcements from New South Wales in recent days, very annoyed by the announcement of the treasurer and energy minister in New South Wales and deputy premier about compensation for aboveground wires which have to be built in New South Wales by the New South Wales government as part of the Rewiring the Nation plan! We know transmission is necessary for transition. We made it very clear as part of our election commitment that we will roll out and we made this clear … We will reform the regulatory process for aboveground wires that they left in place for nine years because it is not fit for purpose, because it does not provide for adequate compensation for people who are impacted, as the member for Ballarat and the member for Hawk well know, because they’ve taken the time to engage in these issues and they actually understand these issues, unlike, it appears, the leader of the National Party! Mike Bowers caught a few pictures inside the chamber before heading into the lockup (you can go into the lockup late, but once you leave the lockup, you can’t re-enter it). Opposition continues questioning on electricity prices Sussan Ley to Chris Bowen: My question is to the minister for energy and climate change. The Labor party promised to cut electricity bills by $275. Now we are told prices will increase up to 50%. Minister, with the energy regulator saying people are using solar fairy lights in their houses and ice bricks in the esky because they cannot afford their power bills, why won’t you apologise to struggling Australians for shamelessly misleading them? (The promise was to cut bills by 2025, just fyi.) Bowen: I can confirm the Australian Energy Regulator is advising ministers, federal and state, that the energy market and prices continue to be under pressure because of the war in Ukraine and also, Mr Speaker, and also because of 10 years of denial and delay! (Lots of shouting at this point from both sides of the House. Dutton tries to raise a point on relevence but gets rejected). I can also confirm the Australian energy regulator gave the same advice to the now shadow treasurer – [they] advised that residential prices will go up $227. Or for a New South Wales small business, $130. The difference is, Mr Speaker, I confirm this government will not hide the facts from the Australian people like my predecessor did. I can confirm I won’t be changing the law to hide that fact from the Australian people like the member for Hume did. I will also confirm we will be getting on with the job of delivering cheaper energy. The cheapest form of energy is renewable energy, Mr Speaker. We will be getting on, like last week when the prime minister announced the largest investment in energy by a federal government since Ben Chifley was the prime minister when he announced the original Snowy Mountains Scheme. We know we need to upgrade the electricity grid. What can the opposition say about that? The shadow minister issued a release saying this was a sweetheart deal between us and the Victorian government. This was an announcement made by the prime minister and I in Hobart with the Liberal premier of Tasmania! (He makes some jokes about where the Victorian border ends according to the Liberals, who were apparently saying Dan Andrews was in on it.) I’m not really sure what they think. We don’t know what they think about many things. We know what this government is getting on with the task of rebuilding the energy system in this country after 10 years of denial and delay is what we are getting on with. There is a dixer about how brilliant the Labor budget will be. Moving on. Scott Morrison, the prime minister at the time the decision was made to recognise West Jerusalem, was shown during that answer and he did not seem happy. After the bipartisanship of the motions, we move into the questions and Peter Dutton opens with: I refer to the decision taken by the Labor government on a Jewish holy day to stop recognising Israel’s capital of West Jerusalem … a decision which deeply offended our closest ally in the Middle East and the Jewish community in Australia, but was praised by two violent terrorist groups. Has the prime minister spoken to or communicated with Israeli prime minister and offered an apology? Anthony Albanese: Australia was among the first countries to formally recognise Israel under prime minister Ben Chifley, and it occurred when Doc Evatt was head of the United Nations. Australia will remain a steadfast friend of Israel. We have reaffirmed Australia’s previous longstanding and bipartisan position that Jerusalem is a final status issue that should be resolved as part of peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian people. The same position that is held by the United Kingdom, France, Germany, by Spain, by Japan, by South Korea, by Singapore, by New Zealand, by Canada. The same position held by John Howard. The same position held by Tony Abbott. The same position that was held … Dutton: The Israeli prime minister has criticised this prime minister and this decision … There is no point of order. Albanese: The same position held by Menzies, Holt, Gorton, Fraser, Howard. The same position held by Tony Abbott. The same position that was held by Malcolm Turnbull. The same position that they sat there, up until 2018, and held. And what happened in 2018 was there was a byelection held in the electorate of Wentworth. And they said … that they would change what had been a bipartisan position since the creation of Israel in 1948. They said that, but once they got through the election, they did not follow it through … they did not move the Australian embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. … Say what you like about Donald Trump – at least he followed it through. At least he followed through the position. Those opposite did not … thereby showing that this was not a decision of substance, it was a decision of gesture. What we need in the Middle East to secure piste is substance, not just as. We need peace in the Middle East to be based upon a two-state solution which recognises the right of Israel to exist in secure borders and also recognises the rights of the Palestinian people. My government will not waver in our support of Israel or of the Jewish community in Australia. We also unwavering support of the rights of the Palestinian people. What we need is a solution to the Middle East, not playing domestic politics during a byelection in order to secure a so-called advantage. And to question time. Anthony Albanese: The treasurer will be absent from question time today. The assistant treasurer will answer questions on the Treasury’s behalf given we only have one treasurer. There is laughter at this Scott Morrison callback. Peter Dutton: For those Australians facing the prospect of rising waters, please continue to heed the advice of emergency services, especially when given rain forecasts and are likely wet summer ahead. Long after the waters have receded, the cleanup has commenced on the cameras have moved on, communities need ongoing support for the slow and costly recovery. I want to acknowledge the work of the former prime minister, prime minister Morrison and emergency services ministers [that] put in place the regime that prime minister Albanese … referred to before, the support we provide[d] to communities … in glove with our state counterparts and local government authorities. That support makes a real difference … in the hours, days, weeks, months in the aftermath of these natural disasters. Infrastructure and homes will need to be built, fences replaced, roads repaired and in the aftermath of this disaster, Australians can feel like they are on their own, that they’ve been forgotten by governments. The Coalition encourages government at all levels to be generous [in] the assistance they offer … delivered in an effective way to those [affected] by natural disasters. Not just in the current response phase [but] over the days, months and in some cases many years ahead. Anthony Albanese on the floods: ‘We stand in solidarity with those people going through this difficult time’ Mr Speaker, it’s an inescapable fact that natural disasters have become more frequent and more intense, it’s what the science told us would happen. That’s why it’s so important the disaster recovery funding also supports efforts for better planning, or building back in such a way that makes communities safer and more resilient. So that the next time disaster strikes, we are better prepared. Mr Speaker, I hope the rain stops soon and the waters recede. The briefings I’ve had an eye [on] – the opposition have received briefings as well – indicate that we are not at the end of this, we are more towards the beginning probably than we are towards the end. There are difficult weeks and perhaps even months ahead. The long-term consequences are severe for our economy, for agriculture that was anticipating a bumper season in the Riverina and the Goulburn Valley and other parts of Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and indeed Tasmania, so it’s been particularly heartbreaking for the farmers who were looking forward to something so positive – but some people of course have lost their homes and others of course have lost their lives. The most important thing that we can do to people is to stay safe, to make sure they follow the advice when it is given. If they are asked to evacuate, please do so, the authorities are acting upon the advice of the experts and we will continue to, as a government, continue to offer every support possible. I’m sure that will be offered in a bipartisan way and I think the opposition for that. All we can do is to do what we can as a parliament, to say that we stand in solidarity with those people going through this difficult time. Another reader question about lock ups: “How do you know if you have something wrong?” Treasury officials are on hand to ask questions to (each have their area) and to try and clear up any misconceptions, but if you are wrong, you usually don’t find out until after the lockup ends. It doesn’t happen too often though. But if it does, you find out fast. From the John Spender condolence motion, the House moves to a motion acknowledging the floods and what people are going through. Allegra Spender finishes with: I remember the day he lost his seat. Sitting together at breakfast, writing a list of things we could do now that he was out. It was a very difficult time for him, rebuilding his life outside this place. I learned from him then that when you are in parliament, make the most of it. You don’t have a second to lose. But remember, one day you will be out, that it will be over and be ready for that too. 35 years ago, my father gave a condolence speech in the house for his father, my grandfather, who also served in federal parliament. There is a certain poignancy and that, though if any of my children stand for parliament I know it will be time to get my affairs in order. (There is laughter at this.) But I would like to finish with a quote from the condolence motion, a favourite of my grandfather’s, which seemed apt for dad too: ‘I have tried to do my duty. No-one can do more and no-one should do less.’ I thank the House. Allegra Spender pays tribute to her father, former Liberal MP John Spender Allegra Spender, the member for Wentworth, has been listening to the tributes, laughing softly at some of the stories. She then rises to make her own speech: My father was a gracious man. He built relationships across the house and he would have been particularly gratified by the graciousness of the prime minister in proposing this motion and the leader of the opposition in speaking on it. He was many things. He was loving, he was extravagant, generous, droll and fun. But there are lessons that I take to his life in this place: our courtesy, originality, and standing for something. So many remembrances have noted that he was a gentleman, that he was gracious and gentle. Whether he was representing the union, as he so often did, or accepting the apology of a prime minister – [Bob] Hawke, who publicly mocked him for his accent, but later apologised. He was courteous. He played the ball, not the person. He took this gentleness home and he never shouted at us, but when he was very irritated he would take himself for a drive. Now, I think he just liked cars. He wasn’t afraid to think differently and was generally interested in alternative view. He and his father spent many Sunday afternoon debating events of the day with a whiskey and encouraged us as kids to do the same – without the whiskey. You could change his mind with a good argument. This is a rare quality and quite the opposite, I think, of Twitter. No doubt it was that open-mindedness that enabled him to support my campaign, despite being perhaps the first party person in a safe seat to be dislodged by a community independent, as he was. Ahead of question time there is a condolence motion for John Spender, a former Liberal MP for north Sydney – and Allegra Spender’s father. Zoe Daniel is pushing for the parliament to recognise what is happening in Myanmar: Here’s the latest on the widening violence in the country. More lockup questions: How do they stop internet access? We have to get our IT people to basically create an intranet for us, but we can’t look up websites. A Treasury official is in the room and checks we are all offline and will check as the day goes on. It would be pretty obvious if we leaked out information or broke an embargo and there are serious consequences if you do. We have to hand over our phones and don’t get them back until the lockup is over. What if the journos wish to look something up? You have to think ahead and bring things/articles/previous budget books in with you. Or ask a colleague in the lockup. Is there a briefing at the start? Since Covid, the lockups happen in our office, so we know where the bathrooms and emergency proceedings are. But there is a briefing from a Treasury official who makes sure we all understand that we are signing a document that says we can not break the embargo. Do you have to be registered with a media organisation to get into lockup, or could anyone go in, if they knew how to apply appropriately? You don’t have to be registered with a media organisation (and we can’t register people who don’t work for us) but you can apply to be part of the lockup through Treasury (months in advance) if you have a reason. Nick Evershed is a genius at data journalism – if you haven’t already, have a go at being the treasurer: First question about the lockup is in: “Who pays for the food?” We get this one a lot. Much like when the press gallery travels with the prime minister, we pay our way. So we pay for the food. You can either pay the Department of Parliamentary Services to cater, or you can just bring in your own food. (When the press gallery travels, even when it is on the PM’s plane, we still have to pay for our seats.) Budget lockup now on And the lockup is underway. Australia’s Auspol journalists are without internet access or phones for six hours. Enjoy. Medibank confirms former customers likely to be part of company’s data leak Former Medibank customers are likely to be caught up in the hack of the company’s data, with the insurer revealing it is required to retain customer data for at least seven years. The company is in the process of informing current and former customers about the extent of the breach following the disclosure to the market this morning that the breach could now affect all 3.9m customers, not just those who are with ahm health insurance or are international students. Medibank confirmed to Guardian Australia that within the first 100 records released by the hacker to the insurer there were records of former customers, so it is believed others who have left the insurer could also be caught up. The company said it is required to retain health information of adults for at least 7 years and for people below the age of 18, until that person is at least 25 years old, under health records legislation in NSW, Victoria and the ACT. Mike Bowers was in the senate for the Lidia Thorpe motion. Senator Thorpe did not flinch. Budget lockup about to begin And yes, Twitter is about to get very quiet. This is the time of year (well, the fourth time in two years) where all the political journalists are locked up, so social media spaces tend to calm down. Given I am usually in the lockup, this is a novel experience for me too. If you have a question about the lockup – how it works, what we do, that sort of thing, let me know at amy.remeikis@theguardian.com and I’ll answer some questions for you. For those who were asking – yes, there will be a question time today. There are now 30 minutes until the budget lock up begins Worry not though – the blog will continue. I (Amy Remeikis) will take you through to the afternoon and we will keep rolling on until the budget lockup ends, and Tory Shepherd will take you through the evening and bring you all the budget news. So you are all covered. The rest of that Adam Bandt statement can be found below: In making inquiries about this matter, I’ve also caused a search of the emails sent to my private and public parliamentary email accounts to be made. It appears in 2016, prior to [my] becoming Greens leader … Mr Dean Martin sent an email to our public inbox about the deportation of Mr Shane Martin, as part of an email chain that referenced both the former minister for home affairs and other members of parliament. As Mr Dean Martin was not a constituent of mine at this time, it does not appear that my office took any further steps on his behalf but I’m making further inquiries on this front. It appears that a number of people were advocating for Mr Shane Martin at the time and the emails were sent to a number of politicians. Matters have also been raised publicly about the handling of a complaint made to my office by former staff member about the government’s parliamentary complaint processes. In the initial ABC report last week, there was a suggestion that we have not followed our own rules [in] dealing with a complaint made by staff to our office … in respect of that complaint I’m advised the initial review of senator Thorpe’s office, auspiced by the Department of Finance, has commenced as requested by the complainant. We are awaiting the outcomes of that review which will then be dealt with according to our processes. I’ve also asked the PWSS to independently review the Greens’ internal compliance processes and recommend any changes. It is absolutely vital that current and former staff feel supported in coming forward and raising any issues they wish. We’re currently reviewing our processes including in light of recent events to ensure this is the case. Mr. Speaker, I want to assure anyone who wants to raise any issue with us and wants it to be dealt with by either us or an independent body, we will support you. The actions I’ve taken including the statement are based on inquiries I’ve made, searches in my private and public emails, of course, to be made, advice I’ve received and the facts as I understand them today. However, as I’ve made clear publicly, if any further information is provided to me or becomes apparent, I will of course consider it and act on it, including updating the House further if necessary. Greens leader gives explanation in House of Representatives about his knowledge of Thorpe’s relationship The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, has given a personal explanation in the House of Representatives about his knowledge of Lidia Thorpe’s relationship with the ex-bikie Dean Martin. Bandt said Thorpe was a member of the joint law enforcement committee at the time (2021) and has acknowledged it should have been disclosed, and as a result she resigned as deputy leader of Greens in the Senate. He repeated that he first became aware when contacted recently by the media. Bandt said that Thorpe’s then chief of staff raised the issue with his chief of staff, Damien Lawson, but he “did not inform me of these matters at the time”. Bandt said Lawson is a “very good and competent chief of staff” who makes many good decisions but “this wasn’t one of them”. He said: I should’ve been told, but I wasn’t. In failing to inform me, my chief of staff did not meet the expectations of my staff in such matters. I have counselled my chief of staff. Bandt said the “principal responsibility” to inform him lay with Thorpe, but backed her to continue her work because she had assured him information was treated in confidence and “nobody has suggested otherwise”. Bandt said his office had contact from Martin in 2016 to protest his brother Shane Martin’s deportation, but it is “not clear” his office took any steps to help him. Bandt also referred to a “complaint by a former staff member” suggesting the Greens had not followed its own rules for dealing with complaints against Thorpe. He noted an “independent review auspiced by the Department of Finance” has commenced into Thorpe’s office and the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service is reviewing the Greens’ procedures. The Greens leader Adam Bandt made an explanation to the house just after prayers: I want to address issues have been raised publicly last week. Senator Thorpe has advised she remains friends with Mr Martin. [Her] connection with him began in 2021. This means that she was the Greens justice spokesperson and also a member of the joint committee on law enforcement at the time. Senator Thorpe has acknowledged this should have been disclosed. Following my request, Senator Thorpe has resigned from the position of deputy leader [of the Greens] in the Senate. As I said last week, I first became aware of these matters after I was recently contacted by the media. After I made inquiries, and as it’s been reported, it has become clear that Senator Thorpe’s then chief of staff raised a connection with Mr Martin in 2021. My chief of staff tells me he advised … that the issue should be raised with [the] senator before. He’s also told me that after a subsequent conversation between the chiefs of staff, my chief of staff understood that the issue had been addressed. He did not inform me of these matters at the time, and I wasn’t aware of these matters until the media raised them. They’ve been a very good and competent chief of staff who makes many good decisions. The failure to inform me of this matter was not one of them. I should have been told that I wasn’t informed … my chief of staff did not meet the expectations of staff in my office. I’ve counselled my chief of staff. I’ve also since reinforced with my staff [to raise such issues with me]. I also bear in mind I consider the principal responsibility for disclosing these issues to me sat with senator Thorpe and she’s agreed that she should have disclosed this to me. Senator Thorpe assured me that committee information was treated in confidence. She completely rejects any suggestion she would do anything other than treat all such information confidentially. I also note that no one has suggested otherwise. ... Senator Thorpe is an incredible fighter … [and] has important work to do on First Nations justice, including on progressing truth-telling, treaty and voice, and I want her to be able to do that work. Lidia Thorpe referred to privileges committee This referral to the privileges committee (which Lidia Thorpe said she was already going to do) has sailed through the senate. Labor senator Anthony Chisholm moved it: That— (1) The Senate notes: (a) the matters canvassed in the media regarding a possible conflict of interest between an undeclared personal relationship of senator Thorpe and her role while a member of the joint committee on law enforcement; and (b) the importance of maintaining the integrity of parliamentary committees. (2) The following matter be referred to the standing committee on privileges for inquiry and report, whether senator Thorpe’s failure to declare the relationship: (a) obstructed the work of the joint committee on law enforcement; (b) if so, whether this amounted to an improper interference with the work of the committee; and (c) whether any contempt was committed in this regard. The Greens senator, Lidia Thorpe, has given a personal explanation to the Senate of her relationship with ex-bikie Dean Martin, adding little more detail than her existing statements. Thorpe said: Mr Martin and I met through blak activism and briefly dated, we remain friends and have collaborated on our shared interests advocating rights of first nations people. All confidential information I received … was treated in confidence. I strongly reject any suggestion that I would do anything other than comply with the committee’s requirements. I note: nobody has offered any evidence to the contrary. However, I accept that I should have disclosed this connection with Mr Martin to my leader and to the joint committee on law enforcement of which I was a member. In light of this I resigned as deputy leader in the Senate. Thank you to all who have sent messages of love and solidarity. The support has been overwhelming... I’m not going anywhere, especially while we don’t have a treaty in this country which I will continue to fight for. Having now given this explanation to the Senate, I turn my attention to important portfolio work especially fighting for first nations justice. Earlier, the Liberal Senate leader, Simon Birmingham, spoke in favour of referring Lidia Thorpe to the privileges committee. Both Anthony Chisholm and Birmingham called on Adam Bandt to give an explanation in the House of Representatives. Parliament begins budget day sitting The parliament has begun sitting (as you may have gathered from Paul’s post) and there is a feeling of anxiety in the air (there always is during budget day). The house is continuing the debate on the early childhood education bill – Angie Bell is pointing out the lack of plan to get more early childhood educators working in the sector, given there are already shortages. Senate president agrees to give precedence to debate on Thorpe referral to privileges committee The Senate president, Sue Lines, has agreed to give precedence to a Senate debate about whether Lidia Thorpe should be referred to the privileges committee over her previously undisclosed relationship with ex bikie Dean Martin. Lines said that it was “unusual” for a senator to refer themselves, and Thorpe’s letter requesting it “doesn’t go to her reasons for doing so, [nor] give additional details about allegations or her responses to them”. Lines noted that senators “should not sit on committee if the senator has a conflict of interest” and so the matter “meets the criteria I am required to consider”. “In those circumstances I have concluded precedence should be given at the earliest opportunity to determine if [the matter] warrants investigation.” Labor senator, Anthony Chisholm, sought leave to refer the matter to the privileges committee, telling the Senate the government believes it is “appropriate” to do so. ABS births data released Australia embraced the pandemic baby trend it seems. The ABS reports: Australia registered 309,996 births in 2021, an increase of more than 15,600 on registered births in 2020 and lifting the total fertility rate (TFR) to 1.70 babies per woman following a record low in 2020 (1.59). According to the latest births data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) today, women aged 30–34 years continued to have the highest fertility rate, followed by women aged 25–29 years. Emily Walter, the ABS’s demography director, said: “From 1991 to 2021, the fertility rate of mothers aged 35–39 years doubled, and for mothers aged 40–44 years, it has nearly tripled. In contrast, births to teenage mothers have reached an all-time low, with 5,102 babies born to teenage mothers in 2021. Both of these factors contribute to the continuing rise in median age of mothers (now 31.7 years).” The total fertility rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers was 2.3 babies per woman. In contrast to the total population, the fertility rate was highest among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers aged in their 20s. The Northern Territory recorded the highest fertility rate, with 1.82 babies born per woman in 2021. Queensland closely followed with 1.79 babies per woman, while the Australian Capital Territory recorded the lowest, at 1.45 babies per woman. (Seriously, if you made it through the lockdowns without purchasing an air fryer, making bread, or having a baby – let us know.) Everything, everywhere, all at once: I assume the prime minister is pointing at the spot where the infamous cigar smoking photo was taken. Also these are the sort of neat post-it tabs Patrick Bateman would approve of: Australia Institute pushes to close loophole in resources tax The Australia Institute believes closing some loopholes in the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) would help to raise revenue for the budget without creating a new tax. The Institute’s executive director, Dr Richard Denniss, said: Current loopholes in the PRRT mean that despite windfall gas profits of up to $40bn, companies are avoiding paying tax on these super profits with PRRT revenue projected to increase by less than $1bn in 2022-23. A new report, Reforming the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, suggests these loopholes could be closed by ensuring PRRT is paid when a super profit is earned instead of being exempt until after companies have paid down capital and “uplift factors”. Companies are making windfall profits and avoiding paying tax by using sophisticated accounting techniques and loopholes permitted in the current PRRT. The report also suggests that loopholes which allow revenue splitting practices between companies in gas extraction and liquification equates to a form of multi-national tax avoidance which could also be targeted. Taiwan welcomes Japan-Australia security declaration Taiwan’s representative in Canberra has welcomed Japan and Australia’s call for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, met with his Japanese counterpart, Fumio Kishida, in Perth last weekend. The two leaders signed a security declaration that committed Japan and Australia to “consult each other on contingencies that may affect our sovereignty and regional security interests, and consider measures in response”. While the deal does not explicitly commit the countries to respond jointly to a military crisis across the Taiwan Strait or in the South or East China seas, it appears to be a clear statement of intent of increasing closeness between Japan and Australia on security issues. Albanese and Kishida also “reaffirmed the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait”. Elliott Charng, representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Australia, said in a statement to the Guardian today: Regarding the recent statement between Japan and Australia to strengthen their security cooperation, Taiwan welcomes the leaders of Japan and Australia for reaffirming the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and encouraging the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. We believe that such joint efforts among the like-minded countries will help to maintain and enhance a free, open, resilient and rules-based Indo-Pacific region. Taiwan, as a responsible member in the international community, is committed to developing its deterrence capability and maintaining status quo of the cross-Strait relations, and also willing to deepen engagements with like-minded partners to address regional security challenges and to safeguard a shared vision of free and open Indo-Pacific. Parliament will sit from midday The Senate is not where the action is today, but it still has things going on! Transparency, it seems, has some caveats. Ley: It’s not about fault, it’s about dealing with the issues of the day Which leads to this question from Laura Jayes: Okay, Labor’s only been in power for six months. If energy prices are going up 50% that’s your fault isn’t it? Sussan Ley: It’s not about fault. It’s about dealing with the issues of the day. And budgets are about a government’s priorities. Unless there’s a plan to address the cost of living crisis, then this budget fails ordinary Australians. A 35% increase, you cannot say that a business can necessarily afford that. You certainly cannot say that they can afford an increase of 50%. So where is the plan? That’s the ultimate test. All of the factors that are challenges for the Australian economy were known as Anthony Albanese came into government and he still made the promise that he would leave no one behind. And this budget unfortunately, will I believe do that. I have seen nothing to indicate that millions and millions of Australians will be helped with the current cost of living crisis. Ley: Labor budget does nothing for your household budget The Liberal’s deputy leader, Sussan Ley, wants to wait and see what is in the budget, but also, says there is nothing in the budget. She told Sky News: Let’s see what comes down tonight, Laura. But the problem with this Labor budget is that it does nothing for your budget, for your household budget. We know this because power prices are forecast to go up 35% and even 50%, according to forecasts from the AER (Australian Energy Regulator). Mortgage payments are up hundreds of dollars each month and every time you go to the supermarket it’s more and more expensive to buy your weekly groceries. That’s the point … this Labor budget does nothing for your budget. Anthony Albanese promised, he promised, that he would leave no one behind, and five to six months in, millions and millions of Australians are being left behind. Meanwhile, in the parliament: The hours before budget are usually filled with last-minute calls from advocacy and lobby groups calling for the government to include something in the budget. The budget was printed on Sunday afternoon – it is now done. So now it is about whether or not those earlier calls were heeded. Consumer sentiment cools as higher inflation expectations set in As treasurer Jim Chalmers hones his lines ahead of the release of the 2022-23 budget later this evening, it’s worth a look at how “punters” are feeling about the economy. The ANZ and Roy Morgan’s weekly survey of consumer confidence sagged again, extending it to a month of softening sentiment. (And it’s already pretty low.) The concerns about inflation are not heading in a helpful direction, either. Perhaps it’s all the talk of how much more food might cost in the wake of the seemingly endless belts of rain soaking eastern Australia. Chalmers has talked about food prices being as much as 8% higher, but we won’t really know the impacts until we know how much more rain (and other wild weather) awaits. Against the cost-of-living gloom, it’s worth keeping in mind that some prices started to rise a year ago as economies began roaring out of lockdown. That means the “base” was already on the rise, hence why some economists think “peak inflation” might not be too far off. We’ll also get an important update about inflation tomorrow, when the ABS releases September quarter consumer price index figures. An annual rate of about 7.1% is expected but a big spike might make some of the budget figures a little dated. Anyway, investors are pretty sure the RBA has a lot more rate lifting to do. As of yesterday, they were all but set on a 25 basis point cash rate rise when the central bank board next meets on Melbourne Cup Day (1 November). Assistant RBA governor Chris Kent yesterday reminded a breakfast audience at CBA in Sydney of the point of those rate rises: ‘‘We do actually want it to have an effect on household spending to rein that in somewhat.” Chalmers’ challenge is to deliver a budget that doesn’t mean the RBA has to yank on that rein any harder or longer than necessary. Liberal senator takes aim at Labor over Medibank cyber-attack The shadow cybersecurity minister James Paterson appears to be blaming Labor for what Medibank customers are going through at the moment. Medibank customers will be very distressed to hear confirmation today that their personal medical information has been stolen in a cyber attack. Despite the company’s initial denials, customers worst fears have now been realised. After a slow and confused response to the Optus cyber attack, it is concerning that it took the Cyber Security Minister took a week to publicly respond to the Medibank hack. Ms O’Neil should explain why she accepted the company’s initial denial this was serious, delaying government engagement by a week. In a cyber attack, time is of the essence. Early engagement by the government allows the facts to be established, data theft to potentially be disrupted, and gives customers time to take any necessary steps to mitigate the consequences of the breach. Every day lost worsens the damage done. Medibank victims have every right to know what steps the Albanese government took, and when. The government should release a clear timeline of the actions they took following the initial disclosure of the attack on 13 October. The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre and members of the crossbench including Allegra Spender, Andrew Wilkie, Zoe Daniel and Kate Chaney have released a joint statement calling for the government to do more for refugees: There are 31,000 people who sought asylum by sea between August 2012 and January 2014, including children born to these families, who have been denied the ability to rebuild their lives in Australia. The time for action is now, with recent polling finding that three out of four voters from across the political spectrum support permanent protection for this group. Instead, women, men and children who are part of the community have been forced through the so-called ‘Fast Track’ determination process established by then Prime Minister Tony Abbott. This process is slow, defective, and has not provided procedural fairness for many subjected to it. We welcome the government’s commitment to abolish ‘Fast Track’ and temporary protection visas. However, the lack of timeframe for when people subjected to this cruel system will be provided permanent protection is concerning. As time drags on with no announcement, refugees are unable to properly rebuild their lives in Australia, and face significant barriers to access education, stable work and to see loved ones. The lack of an announcement or information has added significant distress to refugees in our community. As of September 2022, there were nearly 20,000 living on Temporary Protection Visas (TPV) and Safe Haven Enterprise Visas (SHEV), around 1,900 people who are still at the review stage and close to 10,000 who have been failed by the ‘Fast Track’ process. All people need a place they can call home and there needs to be clear information on when this will happen. And who does Angus Taylor think can take credit for the lower budget deficit? Well, we should look at what we saw today on the deficit, now we’ll see more tonight. So, I don’t want to pre-empt all the numbers we’re going to see, but Labor inherited a budget deficit for the last financial year, which was substantially lower, just around $50 billion lower than was expected at about $32 billion. What they’re saying today is it’s going to be higher this year, and higher again in future years. We want to see a clear and comprehensive plan that includes improvement in the budget position. We’re now beyond Covid, it is time to consolidate the budget. It is time for a responsible budget. We don’t want to see a bigger taxing budget. We don’t want to see a bigger tax take and higher tax rates. We want to see a budget that ensures that Australians are paying their fair share, but no more than their fair share and having the vast majority of Australians keeping 70 cents in the dollar. That is a way forward for a prosperous, active economy where people are investing in their jobs, their careers, their businesses, that’s what we want to see. Angus Taylor says superannuation is for retirement Despite the long campaign from some in the Liberal party to allow Australians to access their superannuation for a housing deposit, Angus Taylor now says super is for retirement. He is referencing how super funds may be called upon to invest in or build affordable and social housing: There has been a shortage of housing and we want to see more, and much of this lies with state governments, but there’s a role that the federal governments can play, and we certainly want to see it. I know, in my own electorate, we want to continue to see housing growth – that’s been an important source of jobs and opportunity for Australians, but it’s also important for young Australians to be able to get access to a home. What we don’t want to see is people’s superannuation being used for pet projects, that we don’t want to see that. Superannuation is there for people’s retirement, a nest egg that they can rely on so that they can have a prosperous retirement and we don’t want to see governments using that money as though it is theirs for their projects. But that doesn’t mean that Taylor is walking away from the ‘use super for a home deposit scheme’. Superannuation, it seems, remains a political football. Angus Taylor says Labor’s budget is a ‘test’ (of many things) The shadow treasurer Angus Taylor (who is also the next potential Liberal leader, depending on who you speak to) had this to say about Labor’s first budget, which will be handed down later tonight: A budget is a test of a government’s true intentions and this particular budget will be a test of whether Labor consolidates on the strength of the economy and the budget that they inherited when they came into government. It’s also a test of whether they deal with the challenges that Australian households and businesses are facing. Challenges with rising cost of living and rising the cost of doing businesses. It’s also a test of whether or not they create a platform for longer term growth for the economy, a fast-growing prosperous economy where there’s opportunities. Now, Labor made a lot of promises at the last election … and this budget is a test of whether they have a clear and comprehensive plan to deliver on those promises, and to deliver on the challenges that Australians are facing right here and right now. So far, I have to say, what we’ve seen has been disappointing. So far, what we’ve seen is that in the budget there will be a deteriorating jobs market, a deteriorating economy, a deteriorating deficit, no material gains in real wages in this term of government. And we know Labor is walking away from their promise to reduce electricity bills. All Australians want to see a clear and comprehensive plan to deal with those pressures they’re facing and to consolidate the position that Labor inherited. We want to see a successful budget, but ultimately, the test for Labor is whether they have that clear and comprehensive plan to deal with those pressures Australians are facing. He said all of this with a straight face, given it has been five months since his party lost the election after almost 10 years in power. Mike Bowers caught the busiest man in Canberra today, being busy: Murray River expected to peak in Victoria today as flood danger continues The Murray River is expected to peak today after several days of anticipation and high river heights for communities in the north of Victoria and border towns in southern NSW. In Echuca, the SES says that the town is still 20cm away from reaching its flood peak which is expected this afternoon or potentially tomorrow, according to the ABC who spoke to authorities on the ground this morning. Evacuation orders remain in place at Echuca, Echuca Village, Barmah and Lower Moira, Bunbartha and Kerang. Overnight, the Victorian SES have warned residents of Barmah and Lower Moira it is too late to leave. SES also issued a watch and act warning last night downstream of Euroa for Seven Creeks. Opposition searches for a line on Labor’s budget The opposition, who left office in May, seem a little all over the place trying to come up with a line for this budget. They don’t want to see any changes to the stage-three tax cuts. They want to see inflation come down. They want cost of living relief. They want Labor to address things like energy costs (the increase of which Angus Taylor delayed until after the election). They want people to know that the debt was previously just UNDER a trillion dollars, not actually a trillion dollars. But they don’t have a lot of answers, at this stage. Budget reply should be fun. Medibank CEO David Koczkar apologised to victims of the says the cyber-attack, which he said was “committed by criminals with a view of causing maximum fear and damage”. I unreservedly apologise to our customers who have been the victims of this serious crime. As we continue to uncover the breadth and gravity of this crime, we recognise that these developments will be distressing for our customers, our people and the community – as it is to me. This is a malicious attack that has been committed by criminals with a view of causing maximum fear and damage, especially to the most vulnerable members of our community. We continue to work closely with the agencies of the Federal Government, including the ongoing criminal investigation into this matter. We thank them for their ongoing support and assistance. Medibank will remain in a voluntary trade suspension: For the avoidance of doubt the voluntary suspension continues until the earlier of a release of a further announcement by Medibank and commencement of normal trading on Wednesday 26 October 2022. That statement from Medibank continues: What should customers do Medibank urges our customers to remain vigilant to suspicious communications received via email, text or phone call. We encourage customers to review the advice of:  The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) at cyber.gov.au  The Australian Government factsheet which has been developed for affected customers Medibank and ahm will never contact customers requesting passwords or other sensitive information. All Medibank and ahm customers can contact our cyber response hotlines by phone (for ahm customers 13 42 46 and for Medibank customers 13 23 31) or visit the information page on the website for any updates (https://www.medibank.com.au/health-insurance/info/cyber-security/). Our customers can also speak to Medibank’s experienced and qualified mental health professionals 24/7 over the phone for advice or support around mental health or wellbeing (1800 644 325). Ongoing investigation In addition to supporting the AFP criminal investigation, Medibank continues to work with specialised cyber security firms, the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) and government stakeholders. Medibank will continue to provide regular, transparent updates. Medibank has released a statement to the ASX giving more details of the data breach. The health insurer says it has received 1,000 policy records from the “criminal” and that these files include personal and health data. Medibank says it is “too soon to determine the full extent of the customer data that has been stolen” and the company expects the number of affected customers to grow. The company will also announced a customer support package that includes mental health and wellbeing support, support for customers who are in uniquely vulnerable positions and access to specialist identity protection advice. Medibank says: We have received a series of additional files from the criminal. We have been able to determine that this includes:  A copy of the file received last week containing 100 ahm policy records – including personal and health claims data  A file of a further 1,000 ahm policy records – including personal and health claims data  Files which contain some Medibank and additional ahm and international student customer data Given the complexity of what we have received, it is too soon to determine the full extent of the customer data that has been stolen. We will continue to analyse what we have received to understand the total number of customers impacted, and specifically which information has been stolen. We have taken the step of making this announcement as we believe it is important to notify our customers of this development. As we continue to investigate the scale of this cybercrime, we expect the number of affected customers to grow as this unfolds. What we are doing now Medibank is assisting the AFP in its ongoing investigation. Today we will announce a comprehensive customer support package, which will include:  24/7 mental health and wellbeing support  Support for customers who are in uniquely vulnerable positions  Access to specialist identity protection advice with IDCARE for all customers Given the distress this crime is causing our customers we will also defer premium increases for Medibank and ahm customers until 16 January 2023. Last week, we began directly contacting affected customers to provide support and guidance on what to do next. As a result of today’s update, we will begin contacting current and former customers to recommend steps they could take. We will also begin contacting customers whose data we now know has been compromised. Albanese says budget makes ‘sensible investments’ while removing waste Anthony Albanese started the morning at a childcare centre in Queanbeyan in NSW, near the ACT border. He says the budget will address cost of living pressures through programs like changes to the childcare subsidy, cheaper PBS medicines and infrastructure investment: You will see improvements in the budget bottom line tonight, compared with what was projected under the previous government at the pre-election fiscal outlook. You will see that because we have been diligent and gone through line by line to make sure that this budget makes sensible investments but also removes some of the waste that was there from the former government. Thorpe says she’s ‘made mistakes’ but she’s ‘not going anywhere’ until there is Indigenous treaty Lidia Thorpe self-referred herself to the privileges committee yesterday, over her short relationship with Dean Martin, a former Rebels bikie club president, which overlapped with her time on the law enforcement committee. The Greens senator then tweeted out this statement: We will be breaking into the political coverage today to keep you updated on the floods as well: Overnight, residents of the north west NSW town of Narrabri have been ordered to evacuate due to flooding, with the SES issuing the warnings for the town’s industrial and residential areas. The town hit the major flood level of 6.9 metres yesterday and is expected to reach 7.4m today, as the flood waters from the Narrabri Creek move through. Yesterday afternoon the NSW SES deputy commissioner Daniel Austin said 139 warnings were current across the state, including 18 emergency warnings where community members were told to evacuate or move to higher ground. Parts of Lismore are seeing flooding yet again, but not on the catastrophic scale seen earlier in the year. Lower north Lismore was ordered to evacuate before 8pm by the SES last night. The NSW emergency services minister Steph Cooke said this morning the threat of flooding remains and would continue “for days to come.” The rivers are very, very full and, of course, our dams are mostly at full capacity at present. So, even the smallest rainfall can cause an elevated risk of flash flooding and riverine flooding. We will see rivers decline, but the risk is real. We are bracing for another wet weather system into the state on the weekend. Jim Chalmers takes a moment to congratulate Rishi Sunak He is a friend of Australia as the UK is a friend of Australia. We congratulate him on his elevation to the Prime Ministership. The UK, like Australia, has no shortage of challenges and no shortage of economic challenges. So, we wish Rishi Sunak well. Some of us had the opportunity to work with him briefly when we first came to government. I was able to exchange messages with him when he was unsuccessful in the last leadership ballot. I think it says something about his commitment and his persistence, the way that he conducted himself in the interim. I don’t think it’s insignificant that a country like the United Kingdom has its first Prime Minister of colour. For those of us who are used to be at the younger end of the spectrum, his age is also quite a thing, but we wish Rishi Sunak well as he elevates to the Prime Ministership. He’s a friend of Australia, the UK is a friend of Australia Australia. We look forward to working with him as the new Prime Minister and I personally look forward to working with whoever he names as Chancellor of the Exchequer Australians are ‘incredibly engaged’ when it comes to the budget, Chalmers says The treasurer says he is not kidding himself that “every Australians is across every detail of the budget” but he says he believes they are “incredibly engaged when it comes to the fundamentals”. This budget will get the fundamentals right. It will nicely line up our efforts in the budget and the hard work of the independent Reserve Bank to make sure we can confront this inflation challenge together. I’ve been really heartened by the level of engagement from the Australian community when it comes to our efforts to make the budget more responsible and our economy more resilient. Australians know we can provide cost-of-living relief in a responsible but not reckless way. We can’t spray money around indiscriminately but that would impact inflation and could be counterproductive. I think Australians understand that. I think what happened when government changed hands five months ago is it wasn’t just a change of government but there was a change of mindset. There is a sense that the big challenges in our economy and budget, we need to begin to deal with them. We have had this wasted decade that gave us skills shortages and stagnant wages and aged care crisis and energy policy chaos and not enough to show for a trillion dollars in debt. I think Australians are up for a genuine conversation about how to address the budget and the economy. I’ve been heartened by the engagement. I look forward to this ongoing conversation in the weeks and years ahead. Jim Chalmers says one of the things in the budget will be more detail on the government, working with the states and the private sector, building up to 1m new affordable homes. Chalmers: As as I move around Australia consulting with local communities, workers and employers, one of the big challenges we have in our country and economy is that it’s harder and harder for people to grab the opportunities of low unemployment if they can’t live near where the opportunities are. I’ve made that a big priority. I have consulted widely. I want to thank the superannuation industry and the institutional investors, my counterparts in the states and territories. I want to thank the building industry for engaging with us over the course of recent weeks and months. It’s a high priority for us to get more affordable housing, closer to where the jobs and opportunities are. You will hear more tonight. Labor had promised to create a $10bn Housing Australia Future Fund at the election, with the promise to build 30,000 new social and affordable housing properties in its first five years. There is no detail yet on the time frame for the other homes, but I guess they need to save some things for tonight. Jim Chalmers has begun his first press conference of the day: There are Australians in flood affected communities doing it especially tough today. They are in our thoughts and in the thoughts of all Australians as they deal with these natural disasters which come with alarming regularity. Australians are there for people when they do things tough and the Albanese government will be there for them. This government will be solid, sensible and suited to the times. It will recognise in a time of extreme global uncertainty our best defence is a responsible budget at home. It will understand, that even these economic pressures are coming from around interest world, they are felt most acutely around the kitchen table. Inflation will be the primary influence on the budget I hand down tonight. The budget has three objectives: responsible cost of living relief, strengthening the economy, and beginning the hard yards of budget repair. Chalmers says there are “welcome and substantial improvements in the near term”. That will not make up for the persistent structural spending pressures on the budget. What we’ve been able to do with our responsible approach to these revenue upgrades is to ensure that there will be less debt over the forward estimates than our predecessors had, but we will have more to show for it. This budget will buffer us against global uncertainty, but it will also begin to lay the foundations of a stronger, more modern and more resilient economy as well. This budget will do more than batten the hatches against global uncertainty. It will back in families and begin to build a better future that Australians need, deserve. This budget is for Australians who battle through hard times and believe in a better future and we will keep faith with them tonight. Budget to feature wellbeing section for first time There will be a wellbeing chapter in this budget, in what will be an Australian first. What that means is that the government will no longer just be measuring GDP – it will also be measuring the wellbeing of the Australian people. This budget will outline how that will work, and what exactly the government will be measuring. Jim Chalmers is doing the media rounds this morning. He’s doing all the breakfast programs but his message is the same – this is a stable and responsible budget which is right for the times. Greens (again) call for stage-three tax cuts to be scrapped The Greens’ treasury spokesperson Nick McKim is on ABC radio RN Breakfast, making the case for scrapping the stage three tax cuts and introducing a corporates super profit tax. Labor went to the election promising no changes to stage three and a super profits tax was not part of the platform. Neither of these things will happen (in this budget) Welcome to budget day! It’s the second budget of the year but the first for Jim Chalmers who has come to the treasury portfolio determined to change things. And so, he has spent the months since the election laying out Australia’s economic position. There have been treasury updates galore as Chalmers sets out the case for why Labor won’t be doing all people expect in this first budget. What Labor will be doing has been announced ahead of time – changes to paid parental leave, the childcare subsidy changes, cheaper medicines. But there will be no raising the jobseeker rate beyond the indexation changes, no huge cost of living relief, and no big new social programs. And no changes to the stage-three tax cuts. In this budget, at least. So that’s the big show from 1.30pm, when the lock-up begins, before Chalmers gives his budget speech at 7.30pm tonight. Meanwhile, parliament will sit as normal and the government will introduce its industrial relations bill where a big fight is brewing with the Coalition and the business community over multi-employer bargaining. We’ll also see the privacy laws introduced, which will be less of a fight given how fresh Optus and Medibank’s data breaches are in everyone’s minds. We’ll cover it all off as it happens and keep you updated while the Canberra team enter the budget lock up. Ready? It’s going to be at least a five coffee day. Let’s get into it. Jim Chalmers is following in the grand tradition of naff budget social media photos."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/20/nuclear-is-not-the-way-to-a-clean-energy-future","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-20T18:38:14Z","webTitle":"Nuclear is not the way to a clean energy future | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/20/nuclear-is-not-the-way-to-a-clean-energy-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/20/nuclear-is-not-the-way-to-a-clean-energy-future","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear is not the way to a clean energy future","bodyText":"In Agneta Rising’s defence of nuclear generation (Letters, 19 September), she claims that nuclear plants have to occasionally stop for repair and maintenance. But jellyfish also get into seawater inlets, as at Torness in 2011, causing week-long shutdowns. Seaweed can block inlets shutting reactors, and operator incompetence shuts reactors and compromises radioactive cores. Torness was even narrowly missed by a crashing RAF Tornado jet. Most worrying are not such transient manageable events but risks of systematic flooding of nuclear sites. Nine UK plants are assessed by Defra as currently vulnerable to coastal flooding (Report, 7 March 2012), including all eight proposed new UK nuclear sites and numerous radioactive waste stores, operating reactors and defunct nuclear facilities. EDF claims on its website that “to protect the Hinkley Point C station from such events, the platform level of the site is set at 14 metres above sea level, behind a sea wall with a crest level of 13.5 metres”. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 produced a maximum storm surge of 8.5 metres. It is predicted that sea levels may rise by a metre by 2100. The UK government cannot actually have believed in climate change or surely they would not put future generations at such risk? I bet they believe in it now. The question is: do they care? Is it really too late to stop a retrograde, potentially catastrophic and already unaffordable UK nuclear future? Emeritus Professor Sue Roaf Oxford • I accept David Lowry’s critique that nuclear power generation is not uninterrupted or carbon-free (Letters, 18 September), and the need for back-up generating capacity. Gas cannot be the long-term, or even mid-term, solution, however. I am surprised that no mention is made of nuclear fusion as a long-term alternative to fission. A technology of profound challenges, nonetheless it is being actively researched around the world, with China allegedly investing billions in an attempt to lead the world in this. The UK has an admirable record of achievement in the field, culminating in the Joint European Torus (JET) project. However, costs are huge, hence the establishment of the European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) whereby EU nations and Switzerland can share costs, allow full participation and share benefits. Full-scale implementation of this technology is probably decades in development but offers a viable, non-carbon and sustainable support to the burgeoning solar and allied technologies. But will our muddled Brexit exclude the UK from such participation? David Bridgewater Pershore, Worcestershire • Professor Allen and colleagues’ predictions that global warming may be limited are qualified by the proviso that “other greenhouse gases such as methane are controlled” (Global warming goal of under 1.5C can be met, scientists say, 19 September). However, there is no room for complacency in the fight to reduce anthropogenic emissions and to keep warming to an absolute minimum, as recent and ongoing research suggest that any warming at all leads to disproportionately higher natural emissions of these other greenhouse gases (specifically methane and nitrous oxide). Dr Kevin Purdy Reader in microbial ecology, University of Warwick • Following the 2011 Fukushima disaster, Angela Merkel (Who’s the world’s leading eco-vandal? It’s Angela Merkel?, 20 September) closed eight nuclear power plants immediately and ruled that the remainder would close by 2022, instead of 2032. The premature closure of these plants means the construction of nine coal-fired power stations, burning dirty brown coal, with an expected life of more than 50 years. Dr John Doherty Vienna, Austria • In the letters you published about the place of nuclear power in our energy mix, there are no references to the disposal of nuclear waste. Have we forgotten so soon?

Claire Perry will face the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee on Monday afternoon to answer questions on the £1.3bn clean energy project, which has been left in limbo. Tidal Lagoon Power, the Gloucester-based firm that wants to harness the power of the tides across the UK’s west coast, has been forced to cut its headcount from 50 to 30 as a result of the delays. Downing Street had said an announcement was due on the clean energy project nearly a fortnight ago but nothing has materialised. Government sources have suggested the scheme will be turned down on cost grounds. A decision could come before the hearing with Perry on Monday but that is thought unlikely. Energy industry figures said the government’s slow process risked the UK losing out as global companies choose other countries in which to invest. “Clearly the more you delay decision-making, the more timetables slip, then the more uncomfortable people feel about making their own business decisions,” Louise Kingham, the chief executive of the Energy Institute, told the Guardian. “There is a danger that investment capital can go somewhere else.” Tidal Lagoon Power last week wrote to the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the first minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones, arguing that the lagoon would contribute more than £2bn to the UK economy over its lifetime. The firm said the project could be built for a guaranteed price of power, known as a contract for difference (CfD), at the same level as that awarded for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset. “Subject to a mutually agreed arrangement with the Welsh government, which is under discussion, the pathfinder tidal range project in the UK requires the same level of CfD support as new nuclear power station Hinkley Point C,” a company presentation said. The government, by contrast, has said it believes the lagoon would be twice as expensive as Hinkley."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/jul/07/fuelling-the-climate-crisis-why-lng-is-no-miracle-cure-for-australias-coal-addiction","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-06T22:00:38Z","webTitle":"Fuelling the climate crisis: why LNG is no miracle cure for Australia’s coal addiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/07/fuelling-the-climate-crisis-why-lng-is-no-miracle-cure-for-australias-coal-addiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/jul/07/fuelling-the-climate-crisis-why-lng-is-no-miracle-cure-for-australias-coal-addiction","fields":{"headline":"Fuelling the climate crisis: why LNG is no miracle cure for Australia’s coal addiction","bodyText":"On Thursday, Australia’s emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, told parliament the country’s thriving liquified natural gas (LNG) trade – a fossil fuel industry – was cutting global greenhouse pollution by 150 million tonnes a year. It was no small claim: equivalent to more than a quarter of what Australia emits every year. Two days earlier, an analysis by US-based researchers and anti-fossil fuel advocates the Global Energy Monitor found if all US$1.3tn worth of LNG developments planned across the globe went ahead they would do at least as much to drive the world into climate catastrophe as new coal investments, possibly more. Australia is a significant player in this drive, with $38bn in investments on the books – fourth behind only the US, Canada or Russia. As the prime minister, Scott Morrison, concedes, Australia’s emissions are rising – they have been since 2015. The government’s analysis blames much of that on LNG. Yet the idea the export gas industry is good for the planet – and Australia deserves credit for it – appears set for a serious workout in this parliament. Some uncontested facts: the Australian industry has surged across the Top End in the past five years to a point where the country rivals Qatar as the world’s biggest LNG exporter. Seven multi-decade developments have started production at Gladstone, Queensland, near Darwin and especially in northern Western Australia. Export earnings from LNG increased 61% in two years to almost $50bn, putting it behind only iron ore in value. The industry employs thousands of people. LNG developments often involve remarkable feats of engineering. For the giant Ichthys project in the NT, gas is extracted from an offshore well in the Browse Basin, between Australia and Indonesia, and sent 890km via subsea pipe to Darwin. There, the gas is cooled into liquid form. It is then shipped to Asia, converted back to gas and burned to generate electricity and heat and used in industrial processes, including making plastic. It is an incredibly energy intensive process and produces a large amount of heat-trapping emissions. Berlin-based researchers at Climate Analytics found the growth in LNG pollution in Australia between 2015 and 2020 would effectively wipe out that avoided through the 23% national renewable energy target. LNG emissions in Australia reach the atmosphere as methane, which leaks from wells and pipes as it is extracted and transported, and as carbon dioxide when gas is processed and burned. LNG emissions in Australia are significant but dwarfed by what is released when the gas is decompressed and burned in Japan, China and Korea. Taylor says these emissions are good because LNG is taking the place of coal and there are fewer emissions than there would otherwise be. He is yet to address the inconsistency in the government promoting gas exports as good for the climate while also enthusiastically backing coal exports including Adani’s controversial Carmichael mine. The 150m tonnes a year Taylor cites comes from a back-of-the-envelope calculation by the environment department – the difference between burning all the LNG Australia exported last year and burning an equivalent amount of black coal. No evidence has been given that LNG is displacing coal to that extent but the figure was included as evidence in the department’s latest report on national emissions. Taylor then claimed Australia’s emissions “had the potential” to lower global emissions by that amount; by the time parliament resumed it had become a fact. The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea) has made similar claims. Neither Taylor’s office nor Appea answered a question from Guardian Australia on what basis they assumed LNG was displacing coal. Based on the most recent advice from the government’s office of the chief economist, there doesn’t appear to be one. In a quarterly commodities report released on 1 July, the office says Japan – Australia’s biggest LNG market – has started reopening the large nuclear power fleet closed after the Fukushima disaster. The office says gas in Japan is expected to face increasing competition from nuclear and renewable power. Where it is preferred to these sources LNG is increasing global emissions. This marries up with a trend illustrated by the International Energy Agency: gas and coal use jumped after Fukushima, increasing global emissions. Now nuclear is starting to return. The picture is a little less clear in China, the second biggest market for Australian LNG. It wants the share of gas in the energy mix to rise from 7% to 15% by 2030, in part to help reduce air pollution caused by coal. It is also increasing its use of nuclear, solar and wind. Tony Wood, energy program director at thinktank the Grattan Institute, is annoyed by claims that gas is displacing coal. “It is a counterfactual – unprovable – but is speculative at best, highly questionable at worst.” Wood says there may be some instances where gas is preferred to coal but it is likely to also be competing with nuclear and gas from Qatar, which – due to fugitive methane emissions from wells on the West Australian North West Shelf and some Queensland coal-seam gas fields – could be cleaner than that from Australia. He objects to suggestions Australia deserves credit for its LNG exports while emissions are increasing at home. Frank Jotzo, an economist and professor at the ANU Crawford School of Public Policy, says: “What is certain is the expansion of the LNG industry is holding up the transition to zero carbon fuels.” He says any conversation about LNG emissions come with a significant caveat: we still do not have a good estimate of global fugitive emissions. Gas has about half the CO2 emissions of coal when burned but methane leaked during processing – while lasting in the atmosphere only about 12 years – is so potent it has a warming power about 28 times greater than CO2 when calculated over a century. A recent study found the level of atmospheric methane has increased significantly since 2007 after a relative flat period. Scientists say they are unsure why. But they are clear that methane emissions need to be reduced. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says they need to be cut by 35% between 2010 and 2050 under a path that gives the world a chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C. Despite this, a dramatic expansion of the LNG is proposed across the globe, mostly in North America but also Australia. According to the Global Energy Monitor, these plans put the LNG industry on a collision course with the goals of the Paris agreement. Ted Nace, the group’s executive director, says there is still time for a moratorium on new LNG developments. And he says the industry may yet face a wake-up call as the falling cost of renewable energy puts expensive fossil fuel investments at risk of becoming uncompetitive stranded assets. A paper in the journal Nature last week suggests something will have to give on LNG plans if the world is to stop the climate crisis pushing into more dangerous territory. Researchers from California and Beijing calculated if all existing fossil fuel infrastructure across the planet was allowed to run for its expected lifespan that alone would be enough to push global heating beyond 1.5C."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/may/02/this-report-will-change-your-life-what-zero-emissions-means-for-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-01T23:01:08Z","webTitle":"‘This report will change your life’: what zero emissions means for UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/02/this-report-will-change-your-life-what-zero-emissions-means-for-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/may/02/this-report-will-change-your-life-what-zero-emissions-means-for-uk","fields":{"headline":"‘This report will change your life’: what zero emissions means for UK","bodyText":"“Make no mistake, this report will change your life,” says Prof David Reay at the University of Edinburgh. “If the meticulous and robust expert advice here is heeded it will deliver a revolution in every facet of our lives, from how we power our homes and travel to work to the food we buy.” The government’s official advisers the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) said on Thursday that the UK’s net greenhouse gas emissions should fall to zero by 2050, emphasising that the transformation is necessary, affordable and desirable. Setting the legally binding target, which has wide political support, will be the easy bit. But the scale of transformation needed to meet the target is enormous. By 2050, petrol and diesel cars should be a distant memory, ideally banned from sale in favour of electric vehicles two decades earlier. “2030 would be my ideal switchover date, but we have said 2035 at the latest to be cautious,” said Chris Stark, the chief executive of the CCC. The current date is 2040, but switching sooner will save people money, he said, as electric cars are cheaper in the long run. The cars will need a lot of electricity, meaning clean power generation must quadruple by 2050, the CCC said. That certainly means more offshore windfarms, but the cheapest option – onshore windfarms – are effectively banned in England. Big storage will also be needed, but battery costs are plummeting. Homes heated by natural gas will also be long gone, with the CCC saying no new home should be connected to the gas grid after 2025. Electrified heating will be more common, but hydrogen could be an alternative to natural gas, if it can be produced cleanly at scale. Meat has a heavy environmental impact, but the CCC envisages only a 20% cut in beef, lamb and dairy consumption in 2050, far lower than in other studies and the 86% cut needed to meet UK health guidelines. “We absolutely don’t think there would be support for that [huge cut], or that it is necessary,” said Stark. “A 20% cut seems cautious and prudent to us, but it is true that if you were to shift more to plant-based diets, the [net-zero] target would be easier overall.” The UK landscape will also significantly change by 2050, if emissions are stopped. A fifth of all farmland – 15% of land – will have been converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops. This is essential because some activities, like cattle rearing and aviation, will still emit greenhouses gases in 2050. The CCC target is for “net zero”, with these residual emissions cancelled out by taking carbon out of the air. New trees are the simplest solution but tree planting must triple from today’s rate, the CCC said, meaning more than 107 hectares (267 acres) a day of new forests from now until 2050. That would be 1.5bn trees, according to Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the Woodland Trust, who said new woods would also help reverse huge losses of wildlife in the UK: “There is a potential win-win here.” Guy Smith, at the National Farmers Union, said it was working towards net zero greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture by 2040. Activity in the North Sea should also switch from pumping up carbon in oil and gas to piping down CO2 for burial. The CCC said carbon capture and storage (CCS) was “absolutely essential” to hitting zero emissions. However, the government cancelled a pioneering £1bn CCS competition in 2015 and has yet to establish a major new initiative, despite the potential world-leading role the UK could play. Flying is included in the net zero target of the CCC, which said there could be a limited expansion of aviation if airlines can cut their emissions per flight, potentially with electric planes for short-haul flights. A few nuclear power stations may still be running, if they can compete on cost, though they are not necessary to meet the target, the CCC said. “Fracking is largely an irrelevance,” added Dr Rob Gross, from Imperial College London. “But a massive expansion of renewables is perfectly feasible, particularly offshore.” With Brexit perhaps another distant memory in 2050, the UK will need greater links with the continent when it comes to power. “The biggest challenge is making good use of this cheap low-carbon power,” said Gross. “That means storing some as hydrogen and a lot more interconnection – it will be essential to share resources with our neighbours in the rest of Europe.” All these changes would provide new types of jobs for people. The UK is a world leader in offshore wind and technologies such as CCS could also become important industries for the UK. “We started the [first] industrial revolution and we have an opportunity of leading the new industrial revolution, based on a sustainable economy,” said Lord Deben, the chair of the CCC. “We will make money as a nation if we do it properly.” The nation would be healthier too, according to the CCC. Air pollution would fall as fossil fuel burning ends, while more walking and cycling and less meat-eating would cut the damage to people’s health. Furthermore, if the world’s nations follow the UK’s zero emissions lead and global warming is limited to well below 2C, the impacts of heatwaves, floods and storms will be much lower. “The only way to stabilise the climate is to achieve net zero emissions,” said Prof Simon Lewis at University College London. “[The CCC] shows that it is possible. The question now is if the political will is there to take on the vested interests that will try to stop it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/apr/25/russia-ukraine-war-us-pledges-return-of-diplomats-to-ukraine-after-blinken-visit-russian-oil-depot-on-fire-near-border-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-26T05:20:48Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Fate of Europe and global security being decided in Ukraine, Zelenskiy says– live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/apr/25/russia-ukraine-war-us-pledges-return-of-diplomats-to-ukraine-after-blinken-visit-russian-oil-depot-on-fire-near-border-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/apr/25/russia-ukraine-war-us-pledges-return-of-diplomats-to-ukraine-after-blinken-visit-russian-oil-depot-on-fire-near-border-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Fate of Europe and global security being decided in Ukraine, Zelenskiy says– live","bodyText":"Thank you for following today’s coverage of the war in Ukraine. We will be closing this liveblog but you can catch all the latest developments on our new blog launched below. Russia is strengthening its border security and checkpoints in the Bryansk, Kursk and Belgorod regions that border Ukraine, Ukraine’s general staff has said in its morning update. On Monday large fires broke out at two oil depots in the city of Bryansk, less than 100 miles from the border with Ukraine, in what was thought to be a potential act of sabotage by Kyiv. Russia was still blockading Ukrainian forces in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, the general staff said, and was also carrying out aerial surveillance in the region of Odesa, an important port on the Black Sea coast and the main base for Ukraine’s navy. It said six enemy attacks had been repelled in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine, and that four tanks and five artillery systems were destroyed among other equipment. Ukraine’s postal service says it plans to issue a new stamp to honour the Antonov-225 Mriya (Mriya means “dream” in Ukrainian), which was the world’s largest cargo plane before it was destroyed in an attack on Hostomel airport near Kyiv just after Russia launched its invasion. The stamp was designed by 11-year-old Sofia Kravchuk, who took part in a competition before the war in which children were asked “What is Ukraine for me?”, Ukrposhta said in a post on its Telegram channel. Two weeks ago Ukrainians began queuing up to buy the postal service’s latest stamp, showing a Ukrainian soldier giving the finger to the Russian Black Sea cruiser the Moskva. The stamp was inspired by Roman Hrybov, who infamously told the flagship “Russian warship, go fuck yourself!” when its crew asked him and his fellow border guards on Snake Island, south of the port of Odesa, to surrender in the early hours of the Russian innvasion. The phrase has since gone global. The US has launched a new web portal which will allow a US-based sponsor to apply for Ukrainian refugees and their immediate family members to stay in the US for up to two years. The programme, called Uniting for Ukraine, was announced by president Joe Biden last week and foresees the arrival of up to 100,000 Ukrainians. Would-be sponsors have to fill out a form and will then be vetted by US authorities to “protect against exploitation and abuse, and ensure that they are able to financially support the individual(s) whom they agree to support,” according to the web portal. It also warns that Ukrainians arriving in the country without a valid visa or pre-authorisation may be denied entry and told to apply through the programme. The 193 members of the UN General Assembly are to vote Tuesday on a resolution that would require the five permanent members of the Security Council to justify their use of the veto in future, AFP reports. The news agency writes: Discussions of veto reform are rare and controversial, but have been revived by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Directly targeting the US, China, Russia, France and the UK – who are the only holders of the veto right – the measure would “make them pay a higher political price” when they opt to use their veto to strike down a Security Council resolution, said an ambassador from a country that does not have the veto, and who asked to remain anonymous. Critics call the measure, introduced by Liechtenstein, a “simple procedural reform.” But it is not yet clear if the reform would push the five permanent members to use the veto less, or if it would create even more vetoes as permanent members propose controversial texts they know their rivals will to veto only to force them to justify their stance publicly. First proposed more than two years ago, the measure provides for the General Assembly to be convened within 10 working days after a permanent member uses a veto “to hold a debate on the situation as to which the veto was cast,” according to the text. Around sixty countries have joined Liechtenstein in co-sponsoring the reform, including the US – a rapid rally of support that caused widespread surprise at the UN. Britain and France will vote for the reform, even though they abstained from co-sponsoring it. Neither Russia nor China were among the sponsors of the text, either. A diplomat from one of the two countries, who asked not to be named, criticised the move, saying it will “divide” the UN even further. The head of Ukraine’s state rail company says that one railway worker was killed and four injured by Russian missile strikes on five Ukrainian railway stations on Monday, Reuters reports. Ukrainian forces had meanwhile repelled five Russian attacks and killed just over 200 Russian servicemen, according to the Ukrainian military command in the southern and eastern sectors. Five tanks were also destroyed, along with eight armoured vehicles, it said in a statement. Russia has accused Kyiv of preventing civilians trapped with Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks from leaving the besieged industrial centre despite a ceasefire announcement, AFP reports. The news agency writes: The defence ministry had said it would allow a civilian evacuation from Mariupol’s sprawling steel plant, which has been sheltering the remaining Ukrainian resistance in the southeastern port city, on Monday. But the Russian army on Monday evening said no one used the proposed humanitarian corridor. “The Kyiv authorities have again cynically undermined this humanitarian operation,” it said in a statement, accusing the Ukrainian government of “indifference” towards its citizens. Russian troops “from 14:00 Moscow time (1100 GMT) on April 25, 2022, will unilaterally stop any hostilities, withdraw units to a safe distance and ensure the withdrawal of” civilians, the defence ministry had said. It said the civilians – women, children and the Azovstal staff – would be taken “in any direction they have chosen”. It added that the Ukrainian side should show “readiness” to start the humanitarian evacuations “by raising white flags”. According to the ministry, this information would be communicated to those inside Azovstal “via radio channels” every 30 minutes. Russia last week said it had gained full control of the strategic eastern Ukrainian city, except for the huge Azovstal industrial area. President Vladimir Putin ordered a blockade of the steelworks, where hundreds of civilians are reportedly sheltering with Ukrainian troops. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, had earlier said the UN should be the “initiator and guarantor” of any agreement with Russia on evacuating civilians from the steel plant. Vereshchuk wrote on Telegram: Today, the Russian side once again announced the existence of a corridor for civilians to leave Azovstal. This could be believed if the Russians had not destroyed humanitarian corridors many times before. A humanitarian corridor must be opened “by the agreement of both sides”, Vereshchuk said. A corridor announced unilaterally does not provide security, and therefore is not a humanitarian corridor. She said Ukraine had “appealed” for the UN secretary general, Antonoi Guterres, to be “the initiator and guarantor of the humanitarian corridor from Azovstal for civilians”. Representatives of the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross should be present when any humanitarian corridor was established, she said. Officials from more than 40 countries are set to gather at Germany’s Ramstein airbase on Tuesday, for US-hosted talks expected to focus on how to arm Kyiv against a Russian onslaught in eastern Ukraine. The gathering will be led by US defense secretary Lloyd Austin following his meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday. US army general Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters traveling with him that a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition, according to Reuters. The next several weeks will be very, very critical. They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that’s really the purpose of this conference.” Driven back by Ukrainian forces from a failed assault on Kyiv in the north, Moscow has redeployed its troops into the east for a ground offensive in two provinces known as the Donbas. US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, assess that Russia will rely heavily on artillery strikes, trying to pound Ukrainian positions as Moscow moves in ground forces from multiple directions to try to envelop and wipe out a significant chunk of Ukraine’s military. But the United States also estimates many Russian units are depleted, with some operating with personnel losses as high as 30% - a level considered by the US military to be too high to keep fighting, officials say. US officials cite anecdotes like Russian tanks with sole drivers and no crew and substandard equipment that is either prone to breakdowns or out of date. British assessments showed that around 15,000 Russian personnel had been killed in the conflict while 2,000 armoured vehicles including some 530 tanks had been destroyed, along with 60 helicopters and fighter jets, defence secretary Ben Wallace said on Monday. Russia has so far acknowledged only 1,351 troops killed and 3,825 wounded. A suggestion by Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov that the world is at risk of descending into a third world war only means that Moscow “senses defeat in Ukraine,” his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba has said in a tweet. Russia loses last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine. Thus the talk of a ‘real’ danger of WWIII. This only means Moscow senses defeat in Ukraine. Therefore, the world must double down on supporting Ukraine so that we prevail and safeguard European and global security. Kharkiv, in north-eastern Ukraine, is the country’s second city and was among the first targets of Russian forces when they launched their invasion two months ago – it has been under constant attack since then. On Monday four people died and nine were wounded as a result of shelling in the Kharkiv region, Oleh Synegubov, the region’s governor told Ukraine’s public broadcaster, according to Reuters. Here are a selection of recent images from the city: The fate of Europe and of global security is being decided in Ukraine, president Volodymyr Zelesnkiy has said in his latest nightly address, which on Monday marked the beginning of the third month of the war. Everyone in the world - and even those who do not openly support us - agree that it is in Ukraine that the fate of Europe, the fate of global security, the fate of the democratic system is being decided. And above all, it is being decided what life in the center and east of our continent will be like and whether there will be life at all ... In all Ukraine’s cities and communities, Russia has shown what it really wants and can bring to Europe. What it can bring to Chișinău, Tbilisi, Helsinki, Vilnius, Warsaw, Prague, all the cities and countries that Russian state propagandists have long openly identified as alleged enemies for Moscow. Even as the war was ongoing he said, “we are demonstrating that we will give free Ukraine more opportunities for development than Russia can give not only to the occupied part of our territory, but also to its own territory, its own state.” We are accelerating our movement to the European Union as much as possible. We have already passed a historic moment, an important stage - with the receipt and answering a special questionnaire, which was provided to each country before they acquired the status of a candidate for EU membership. Even now, when the war is still going on, we are creating the necessary base for the reconstruction of Ukraine. These are international agreements of various levels, this is the creation of special funds for the reconstruction of our state. He added: Russia can spend enormous resources to support the war. To oppose even the whole free world. It can take away from its people everything that could develop Russia itself, and direct this potential to destroy the lives of neighbors. But the lessons of history are well known. If you are going to build a millennial Reich, you lose. If you are going to destroy the neighbors, you lose. If you want to restore the old empire, you lose. And if you go against the Ukrainians, you lose. He also said that 931 settlements had been de-occupied since the invasion. Many cities and communities are still under the temporary control of the Russian army. But I have no doubt that it is only a matter of time before we liberate our land. The Ukrainian grain harvest is likely to be down by 20% this year on last year due to reduced sowing areas following the invasion, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has warned in its latest intelligence update on the conflict. It noted: Ukraine is the fourth largest producer and exporter of agricultural goods in the world. Reduced grain supply from Ukraine will generate inflationary pressures, elevating the global price of grain. High grain prices could have significant implications for global food markets and threaten global food security, particularly in some of the least economically developed countries. Ukraine’s foreign minister is urging UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to press Russia for an evacuation of the besieged port of Mariupol when he visits Moscow on Tuesday, calling it something the world body is capable of achieving. But foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba also told the Associated Press in an interview Monday he was concerned that by visiting Moscow before travelling to Kyiv, Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin “trap”. Many other foreign officials were trapped visiting Moscow and played around just to show the supremacy of Russian diplomacy and how great they are and how they dictate the world how to behave,” he said. Guterres “should focus primarily on one issue: evacuation of Mariupol,” Kuleba said, referring to the the seaside city where an estimated 100,000 people are trapped while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces in a steel mill where hundreds of civilians also are taking shelter. “This is really something that the UN is capable to do. And if he demonstrates political will, character and integrity, I hope that will allow us to make one step forward,” he said. Kuleba spoke a day after US secretary of state Antony Blinken and defense secretary Lloyd Austin met Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv, the highest-level American visit to the capital since Russia invaded on 24 February. They told Zelenskiy the US would provide more than $300 million in foreign military financing and had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition. Kuleba praised the visit and called them representatives of “the country that did more than any other country in the world” for Ukraine. Kuleba emphasized the need for the West to speedily provide weapons needed by Ukraine to win the war and stop Russian President Vladimir Putin from going “deeper into Europe.” You know, every conversation about weapons starts with us saying ‘we need this.’ And the initial answer is ‘we don’t think you need exactly this ... Let us reflect on it.’ It takes some time for partners to reflect, but the problem is that the war continues here. In the end, we do get what we need, and then we start getting it in sufficient quantities. But time has been lost. This is the main issue that needs to be addressed, and we were very open with our in particular American counterparts and also with other countries on that. Start doing things fast. Although Ukraine and Russia have held talks on ending the war since its early days, Kuleba said he thought anything lower than discussions between Zelenskiy and Putin would bring little resolution. On his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, Kuleba said: “I don’t think he’s ready for a serious conversation.” He added that he didn’t think Russia is ready to find “solutions at the negotiating table.” But if I see that they change this attitude and they are ready to seriously look for mutually acceptable solutions, I will overcome my disgust and sit down with him and talk” Kuleba said. The sooner president Putin agrees to meet with president Zelenskiy, the more likely it will be to bring the moment of the end of the war closer. “I don’t give a 100% guarantee, but I have confidence in my president. I understand that he’s prepared for that conversation and he knows how to negotiate. The longer president Putin escapes this meeting, the (more) likely it is that he is focused entirely on the war scenario. He reiterated Zelenskiy’s position that an escalation in Mariupol would ruin chances of negotiating with Russia. We sent a very clear message: If you want to kill those people or you want to take them in as prisoners and humiliate, that will be it. That will be the red line,” he said. “But it’s not enough to keep things as they are. It’s really important to evacuate all of them, to save them. A series of precision strikes on five railway stations in central and western Ukraine within one hour on Monday was a “likely effort” to disrupt Ukrainian reinforcements and western aid shipments, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest analysis. The strikes, which the US-based think tank said were “an abnormal number of precision missile strikes for one day”, may also have been meant to demonstrate Russia’s ability to hit targets in western Ukraine after a surprise visit to Kyiv by US secretary of state Antony Blinken and secretary of defense Lloyd Austin, it said. However it also noted that: Russian precision strike capabilities will remain limited and unlikely to decisively affect the course of the war; open-source research organization Bellingcat reported on April 24 that Russia has likely used 70% of its total stockpile of precision missiles to date The think tank said that local Ukrainian counterattacks had retaken territory north of the southern city of Kherson while Russian forces continue to make “little progress in scattered, small-scale attacks in eastern Ukraine”. Ukrainian forces are successfully halting Russian efforts to bypass Ukrainian defensive positions around Izyum [in the eastern province of Kharkiv], and Russian forces are struggling to complete even tactical encirclements. Local Ukrainian counterattacks in Kherson Oblast are unlikely to develop into a larger counteroffensive in the near term but are disrupting Russian efforts to completely capture Kherson Oblast and are likely acting as a drain on Russian combat power that could otherwise support Russia’s main effort in eastern Ukraine. Other key takeaways from Monday include: Russian forces resumed ground attacks against Mariupol’s Azovstal Steel Plant in the last 24 hours. Russian officers may assess they will be unable to starve out the remaining defenders by May 9 (a possible self-imposed deadline to complete the capture of Mariupol). Russian forces will likely take high casualties if they resume major ground assaults to clear the facility. Russian forces are accelerating efforts to secure occupied Mariupol but will likely face widespread Ukrainian resistance. Russian forces are preparing for renewed attacks to capture the entirety of Kherson Oblast in southern Ukraine after minor losses in the past 48 hours. Russian forces likely conducted a false flag attack in Transnistria (Russia’s illegally occupied territory in Moldova) to amplify Russian claims of anti-Russian sentiment in Moldova, but Transnistrian forces remain unlikely to enter the war in Ukraine. If you’re just joining us, here’s a summary of the most recent developments in Ukraine, where the time is 2am: About 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since start of the invasion, the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace has said. Speaking in parliament on Monday afternoon, he added that alongside the death toll, 2,000 armoured vehicles had been destroyed or captured, including 530 tanks. Russia is believed to have lost more than 60 helicopters and fighter jets. Wallace also confirmed that the UK will send a small number of Stormer missile launching vehicles to Ukraine, and that the overall amount of military aid could rise to £500m. The UK has sent 5,361 NLAWs, 200 Javelins and will provide 250 Starstreak anti-air missiles. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has warned that there remains a “real” danger of a third world war, in interviews with Russian media. He also said that deliveries of western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the Nato alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia”. Russia’s foreign ministry said it had expelled 40 German diplomatic staff in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats. In a statement, Russia’s foreign ministry said it had taken the decision after Germany declared a “significant number” of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin “undesirable” on 4 April. A senior Russian diplomat has been quoted as saying that a ceasefire in Ukraine would not be “a good option” as Kyiv may use it to “stage provocations”. Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s first deputy permanent representative to the UN, said: “Ukraine is undermining our efforts to open humanitarian corridors so we don’t think a ceasefire is a good option now.” The Ukrainian Defence Ministry said the shelling of a government building in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria was a “planned provocation” by Russia. “Obviously, this case is one of a number of provocative measures organized by the FSB [the Russian security service] to instill panic and anti-Ukrainian sentiment,” the ministry’s defense intelligence department said, according to CNN. Sweden and Finland have agreed to submit simultaneous membership applications to the US-led Nato alliance as early as the middle of next month, Nordic media reports. The story was broken by Finnish newspaper Iltalehti, and Swedish government sources appeared to confirm the news to domestic media in the country. Five railway stations in central and western Ukraine were hit by Russian airstrikes in the space of one hour on Monday. Oleksander Kamyshin, the head of Ukrainian Railways, said five train stations came under fire causing an unspecified number of casualties, as most of Ukraine was placed under an unusually long air raid warning for two hours on Monday morning. Russia should be “weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine”, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said after he and the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, visited Kyiv and pledged a further $713m to help Ukraine in its war effort. Blinken said Russia was “failing” in its war aims, while Ukraine was succeeding. He added that the US had put in place a strategy of “massive support for Ukraine, massive pressure against Russia” across Nato members. A statue erected to show solidarity between Ukraine and Russia in Kyiv is to be taken down, according to the city’s mayor. The bronze statue showing two workers standing stand-by-side will be dismantled on Tuesday. A second sculpture will be covered up. They were both installed in 1982 and lie underneath the People Friendship Arch near the Dnieper River. The office of the prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC) has joined an EU-backed team investigating crimes in Ukraine in an unprecedented move. Karim Khan QC announced on Monday that the ICC had become a participant in the joint investigation team (JIT), whose members are Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine. The JIT involves international cooperation in criminal matters under the auspices of Eurojust, the EU agency for criminal justice cooperation. More from Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, who also spoke to state television in an interview that was posted on the Russian Foreign Ministry website. In it, he said that deliveries of western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the Nato alliance is “in essence engaged in war with Russia” and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, according to Reuters. “These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia’s military acting within the context of the special operation,” Lavrov said. “Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?” Lavrov said. “Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.” I’m Helen Livingstone, taking over the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine from my colleague Dani Anguiano. Sergei Lavrov told Russian news agencies that Russia’s peace talks with Ukraine will continue, but that there remains a “real” danger of a third world war. The Russian foreign minister was critical of the Ukrainian president’s approach to peace talks, accusing him of “pretending” to negotiate and calling him a “good actor”. “Good will has its limits. But if it isn’t reciprocal, that doesn’t help the negotiation process,” he said. “But we are continuing to engage in negotiations with the team delegated by Zelenskiy, and these contacts will go on.” He said he was confident that “everything will of course finish with the signing of an accord”, but that “the parameters of this accord will be defined by the state of the fighting that will have taken place at the moment the accord becomes reality”. The UK plans to send more medical aid to Ukraine, including ambulances, fire engines and medical supplies. Ukraine will receive 22 new ambulances, as well as more than 44 fire engines with rescue equipment, thermal imaging cameras and thousands of items of protective clothing, from the UK, Reuters reports. The aid is intended to help emergency services in Ukraine deal with the aftermath of Russian attacks. “We have all been appalled by the abhorrent images of hospitals deliberately targeted by Russia since the invasion began over two months ago,” Boris Johnson said. “The new ambulances, fire engines and funding for health experts announced today will better equip the Ukrainian people to deliver vital healthcare and save lives.” The UK has given £200m in military aid to Ukraine, and that figure could rise as high as £500m. The Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh has more on the UK’s military aid: Ukrainian officials said the shelling of a government building in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria was a “planned provocation” by Russia. CNN reports that the Ukrainian ministry’s defense intelligence department said the leaders of Transnistria “were already preparing for it and took care to install a secure and comfortable bunker” at the building, days before the explosions. “Obviously, this case is one of a number of provocative measures organized by the FSB [the Russian security service] to instill panic and anti-Ukrainian sentiment,” the ministry said. There were no immediate reports of casualties in the incident in which a series of blasts tore through a building belonging to the ministry of state security. A local TV station showed the windows and doors of the building in Tiraspol blown out and fire crews on scene. A senior Russian commander said last week that the goal of Russia’s new offensive was to seize control of southern Ukraine and gain access to Transnistria on the southern Ukrainian border. Russia seeks to reduce the “considerable” risk of nuclear conflicts, Sergei Lavrov, the country’s foreign minister, said in a TV interview that aired Monday. “This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable,” Lavrov told Russia’s state television, according to a report from Reuters. “I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real, and we must not underestimate it.” Russia recently tested its Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, a nuclear-capable missile, a move Putin said would give Moscow’s enemies “food for thought”. The Pentagon said Russia had notified it ahead of the test launch, which the US military viewed as a routine test and not a threat to the US. The US will probably impose further economic sanctions against Russia, the White House said on Monday. “No one is safe from our sanctions,” the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said, according to Reuters. Psaki did not comment about a recent report by the Wall Street Journal that the US had not sanctioned the reported mother of three of Vladimir Putin’s children to avoid angering the Russian president. I’m Dani Anguiano and I’ll be taking over our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for the next few hours. Russia said today that two people were injured in a shelling of a village on Ukraine’s border, reports Reuters. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the region’s governor, said today that two people were injured in bombing of a village in Russia’s Belgorod region that borders Ukraine. The US said today that new aid for Ukraine will likely be apart of a longer-term aid package that requires approval from US lawmakers, reports Reuters. US president Joe Biden said last week that he would seek approval from Congress for a larger aid package after giving more than $800m in military aid to Ukraine, with the White House confirming today that additional aid given would be a part of a longer-term package. The White House also said they could not confirm the maximum amount of aid that the US is willing to give Ukraine. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken tweeted about his recent trip to Ukraine and atrocities committed by the Russian military today. From Blinken via Twitter: On our trip, [Lloyd Austin] and I took a train into Kyiv from Poland. We saw people on the streets and clear evidence that the battle for Kyiv has been won. But we know that’s in stark contrast to other parts of Ukraine, where the Russian military continues to commit atrocities. Canada’s defence minister will travel to Germany and the US to discuss how to support Ukraine, reports Reuters. Canadian Defence Minister Anita Anand will travel to Germany and the United States this week to discuss support for Ukraine against Russia’s invasion, the Canadian government said on Monday. Chief of Defence Staff General Wayne Eyre and Deputy Minister of National Defence Bill Matthews will travel to Germany with Anand on Monday, the Canadian government said in a statement. The Canadian delegation will participate in meetings of the Ukraine Defense Consultative Group, hosted by U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Tuesday, and later in the week will visit Washington to meet with U.S. defense officials at the Pentagon. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation”. Here’s more on the US’ announcement of sending diplomats to Ukraine and reopening its embassy in Kyiv. The US will begin by only sending ambassadors to Lviv on short trips versus fully reopening its embassy in Kyiv. US officials have also confirmed that they hope to send diplomats to Kyiv, but have said that it depends on the security situation. From Foreign Policy’s Robbie Gramer: While speaking to reporters today, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said: “We will have American diplomats back in Ukraine starting next week. … They’ll then start the process of looking at how we actually reopen the embassy itself in Kyiv.” Blinken and defense secretary Lloyd Austin visited Ukraine over the weekend. They are the highest-ranking US officials to visit the country since the beginning of Russia’s invasion over two months ago, reports the Hill. US officials have promised to reopen the embassy in Ukraine following a visit to the country over the weekend, reported Reuters. From Reuters: Ukraine’s defence minister said today that Ukraine has started to receive 155mm calibre artillery from the US and other partners. From CNN’s Bianna Golodryga citing a report from the Financial Times: Ukraine’s Defense Minister says Ukraine is already starting to receive 155mm calibre artillery — the standard Nato size — from the US and from other partners, including France. He predicts that longer-range weaponry will ‘fundamentally’ change fight with Russia. Poland said today that it sent tanks to Ukraine, reports Reuters citing Poland prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki. When asked if Poland sent tanks to Ukraine, Morawiecki responded “Yes,” declining to provide additional details on the number of tanks provided. Morawiecki did respond to questions on if sending planes to Ukraine was still being considered, saying: “There is no such necessity, there are no such demands, there are no such requests.” Last month, Poland said it was ready to send all its MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the US, but that offer was rejected by US officials. French president Emmanuel Macron and US president Joe Biden agreed in a phone call today to “rapidly” have more detail discussions on a number of global issues, including the war in Ukraine, reports Reuters. During today’s congratulatory phone call following Macron’s recent re-election, the two world leaders agreed that they should increase discussions on a number of “major global issues … And in particular on global issues related to the war in Ukraine such as food security,” according to a readout of the phone call. “Biden conveyed his readiness to continue working closely with President Macron on our shared global priorities,” said the White House in a separate statement. Here’s an update on key developments this evening as we move into Monday night in Ukraine. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has confirmed that the UK will send a small number of Stormer missile launching vehicles to Ukraine, and that the overall amount of military aid could rise to £500m. The UK has sent 5,361 NLAWs, 200 Javelins and will provide 250 Starstreak anti-air missiles, Wallace told MPs. About 15,000 Russian troops killed since start of invasion, Wallace told UK MPs. Speaking in parliament on Monday afternoon, he said approximately 15,000 Russian personnel had been killed since the start of the war in Ukraine on 24 February. He added that alongside the death toll, 2,000 armoured vehicles had been destroyed or captured, including 530 tanks. Russia is believed to have lost more than 60 helicopters and fighter jets. Russia’s foreign ministry said it had expelled 40 German diplomatic staff in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats. In a statement, Russia’s foreign ministry said it had taken the decision after Germany declared a “significant number” of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin “undesirable” on 4 April. A senior Russian diplomat has been quoted as saying that a ceasefire in Ukraine would not be “a good option” as Kyiv may use it to “stage provocations”. Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s first deputy permanent representative to the UN, said: “Ukraine is undermining our efforts to open humanitarian corridors so we don’t think a ceasefire is a good option now.” Sweden and Finland have agreed to submit simultaneous membership applications to the US-led Nato alliance as early as the middle of next month, Nordic media reports. The story was broken by Finnish newspaper Iltalehti, and Swedish government sources appeared to confirm the news to domestic media in the country. A statue erected to show solidarity between Ukraine and Russia in Kyiv is to be taken down, according to the city’s mayor. The bronze statue showing two workers standing stand-by-side will be dismantled on Tuesday. A second sculpture will be covered up. They were both installed in 1982 and lie underneath the People Friendship Arch near the Dnieper River. The office of the prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC) has joined an EU-backed team investigating crimes in Ukraine in an unprecedented move. Karim Khan QC announced on Monday that the ICC had become a participant in the joint investigation team (JIT), whose members are Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine. The JIT involves international cooperation in criminal matters under the auspices of Eurojust, the EU agency for criminal justice cooperation. The Russian defence ministry said it would open a humanitarian corridor earlier on Monday for all civilians to leave the Azovstal steel plant in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said Kyiv had not reached an agreement with Moscow on creating a humanitarian corridor and said the UN should act as the “initiator and guarantor” of any agreement with Russia on evacuating civilians from the plant. Five railway stations in central and western Ukraine were hit by Russian airstrikes in the space of one hour on Monday. Oleksander Kamyshin, the head of Ukrainian Railways, said five train stations came under fire causing an unspecified number of casualties, as most of Ukraine was placed under an unusually long air raid warning for two hours on Monday morning. Russia should be “weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine”, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said after he and the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, visited Kyiv and pledged a further $713m to help Ukraine in its war effort. Blinken said Russia was “failing” in its war aims, while Ukraine was succeeding. He added that the US had put in place a strategy of “massive support for Ukraine, massive pressure against Russia” across Nato members. Ukraine’s defence minister has said US support is the sign of a “true brotherhood” after a meeting in Kyiv. Oleksii Reznikov said that support was not measured in money, but instead in “the saved lives of Ukrainians”. It came as another $713m in support was announced during the visit by US defence secretary Lloyd Austin and secretary of state Antony Blinken. Four people, including two children, were killed in eastern Ukraine on Monday. The governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said on Telegram that a nine-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were killed in the region where Russia is on the offensive. The office of the prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC) has joined an EU-backed team investigating crimes in Ukraine in an unprecedented move. Karim Khan QC announced on Monday that the ICC had become a participant in the joint investigation team (JIT), whose members are Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine. The JIT involves international cooperation in criminal matters under the auspices of Eurojust, the EU agency for criminal justice cooperation. Khan said: “As I have stated since taking up my position as prosecutor, the effective exercise of the mandate of my office requires us to deepen cooperation and collaboration with all relevant actors. The Ukraine situation, in particular, demands collective action so as to secure relevant evidence and ultimately ensure its effective use in criminal proceedings. “In recognition of this, my office takes a landmark step today in joining a JIT under the auspices of Eurojust for the first time. “The JIT aims to facilitate investigations and prosecutions in the concerned states as well as those that could be taken forward before the international criminal court. Through its participation in the JIT, my office will significantly enhance its ability to access and collect information relevant to our independent investigations. “Critically, we will be able to conduct rapid and real-time coordination and cooperation with the JIT partner countries.” A statue erected to show solidarity between Ukraine and Russia in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv is to be taken down, according to the city’s mayor. The bronze statue showing two workers standing stand-by-side will be dismantled on Tuesday. A second sculpture will be covered up. They were both installed in 1982 and lie underneath the People Friendship Arch near the Dnieper River. The arch will be renamed and lit up in the colours of the Ukrainian flag. According to CNN, Vitali Klitschko, retired boxer-turned politician said: “This week we will dismantle a bronze sculpture of two workers, erected in 1982 ‘to commemorate the reunification of Ukraine with Russia,’ “The eight meters of metal of the so-called ‘friendship of two peoples’ will be removed from the center of Kyiv.” Sweden and Finland have agreed to submit simultaneous membership applications to the US-led Nato alliance as early as the middle of next month, Nordic media reports. The Finnish daily Iltalehti said on Monday that Stockholm had “suggested the two countries indicate their willingness to join” on the same day, and that Helsinki had agreed “as long as the Swedish government has made its decision”. The Swedish newspaper Expressen cited government sources as confirming the report. The two countries’ prime ministers said this month they were deliberating the question, arguing that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had changed Europe’s “whole security landscape” and “dramatically shaped mindsets” in the Nordic region. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said then that her country, which shares an 810 mile (1,300km) border with Russia, would decide whether to apply to join the alliance “quite fast, in weeks not months”, despite the risk of infuriating Moscow. Her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, said Sweden had to be “prepared for all kinds of actions from Russia” and that “everything had changed” when Moscow attacked Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly warned both countries against the move. The Kremlin said it would be forced to “restore military balance” by strengthening its defences in the Baltic, including by deploying nuclear weapons, if the two countries decided to abandon decades of military nonalignment by joining Nato. A government building in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria was shelled by a hand grenade launcher on Monday, the press service of the Russian-backed unrecognised state said on its Telegram channel. According to Transnistrian officials, a building belonging to the ministry of state security was hit in the region’s capital of Tiraspol on Monday evening, with no immediate reports of injuries. A number of images circulating on social media appeared to show smoke coming out of the broken windows of the government building. It was not immediately clear who was behind the apparent attack. Last week, a senior Russian commander said the goal of Russia’s new offensive was to seize control of southern Ukraine and to gain access to Transnistria which lies on the southern Ukrainian border. While military experts have said it was unlikely that Russian forces would be able to stage an offensive towards the border with Moldova at this moment, the statements nevertheless raised fears in Moldova over Russia’s intentions towards the small impoverished Eastern European nation. With Moscow’s support, Transnistria fought a war against Moldova in the 1990s that left the territory with de facto independence and a garrison of around 1,500 Russian troops. If confirmed to be linked to the war, it would be the first spillover of the conflict into another European country. Speaking to MPs earlier this afternoon, the UK’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said approximately 15,000 Russian personnel have been killed since the start of the war in Ukraine on 24 February. Wallace said: It is our assessment that approximately 15,000 Russian personnel have been killed during their offensive. Alongside the death toll are the equipment losses and in total a number of sources suggest that to date over 2,000 armoured vehicles have been destroyed or captured. This includes at least 530 tanks, 530 armoured personnel carriers and 560 infantry fighting vehicles. Russia has also lost over 60 helicopters and fighter jets, Wallace added. The offensive that was supposed to take a maximum of a week has now taken weeks. A senior Russian diplomat has been quoted as saying that a ceasefire in Ukraine would not be “a good option” as Kyiv may use it to “stage provocations”, the Russian state-owned news agency Ria reports. Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s first deputy permanent representative to the UN, was quoted as saying: Ukraine is undermining our efforts to open humanitarian corridors so we don’t think a ceasefire is a good option now. A ceasefire would only “be an opportunity for Ukrainian forces to regroup and stage more provocations”, he claimed. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, earlier denied reaching a deal with Russia on evacuating civilians from the Azovstal steel works in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Russia’s foreign ministry said it had expelled 40 German diplomatic staff in a retaliatory move after Berlin expelled the same number of Russian diplomats. In a statement, Russia’s foreign ministry said it had taken the decision after Germany declared a “significant number” of officials at the Russian embassy in Berlin “undesirable” on 4 April. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said the expulsion of German diplomats from Russia was “not justified”. Writing on Twitter, she said: Despite the increasingly adverse circumstances, our colleagues have worked in Russia with openness, honest interest and great commitment. Russia is thus further damaging itself. In contrast, the expelled Russian diplomats in Berlin “did not spend a day in diplomatic service”, she said: Their work threatened all who seek shelter with us - we could no longer tolerate this and will not do so in the future. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has confirmed that the UK will be sending a small number of Stormer missile launching vehicles to Ukraine. From our defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh: In a statement to MPs, Wallace said: Some of us in this House knew that behind the mask the Kremlin was not the international statement it pretended to be. With this invasion of Ukraine all of Europe can now see the true face of President Putin and his inner circle. His intention is only to destroy, to crush, to rub out the free peoples of Ukraine. He does not want to preserve, he must not be allowed to prevail. Ukrainians are fighting for their very lives and they are fighting for our freedoms. The president of Ukraine himself said it as much. If Russia stops fighting there will be peace, if Ukraine stops fighting there will be no more Ukraine. He said Russia has so far “failed in nearly every one of its objectives”, adding: In recognition of this failure the Russian high command has regrouped, reinforced and changed focus to securing Donetsk and Luhansk oblast. Russia’s president Vladimir Putin should leave all occupied territory in Ukraine including Crimea for true peace to be achieved, Wallace also suggested. It’s just past 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The Russian defence ministry said it would open a humanitarian corridor earlier on Monday for all civilians to leave the Azovstal steel plant in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said Kyiv had not reached an agreement with Moscow on creating a humanitarian corridor and said the UN should act as the “initiator and guarantor” of any agreement with Russia on evacuating civilians from the plant. Five railway stations in central and western Ukraine were hit by Russian airstrikes in the space of one hour on Monday. Oleksander Kamyshin, the head of Ukrainian Railways, said five train stations came under fire causing an unspecified number of casualties, as most of Ukraine was placed under an unusually long air raid warning for two hours on Monday morning. Large fires broke out early on Monday at two oil depots in the Russian city of Bryansk, less than 100 miles from the border with Ukraine, in a potential act of sabotage by Kyiv. Russian state media said the first fire occurred at a civilian facility in Bryansk holding 10,000 tons of fuel, followed by a second fire at a military fuel depot holding 5,000 tons. Forensic doctors carrying out postmortem examinations on bodies in mass graves north of Kyiv say they have found evidence some women were raped before being killed by Russian forces. One doctor who has been carrying out autopsies on residents from Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka, said he had seen “a few cases which suggest that these women had been raped before being shot to death”. Russia should be “weakened to the point where it can’t do things like invade Ukraine”, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said after he and the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, visited Kyiv and pledged a further $713m to help Ukraine in its war effort. Blinken said ‘Russia is failing’ in its war aims, while Ukraine is succeeding. He added that the US had put in place a strategy of “massive support for Ukraine, massive pressure against Russia” across Nato members. Russia has warned the US against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, told Russian state television. Antonov said Russia had “stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine”. Sweden and Finland have agreed to submit applications to join Nato at the same time, a Swedish newspaper has reported. Both countries have agreed to announce their applications in the week of 16 to 22 May, during Finland’s president Sauli Niinistö’s visit to Stockholm, according to reports. Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the FSB spy agency had foiled what he cast as a Western plan to kill a prominent Russian journalist. Without providing evidence to support his claim, Putin accused the West of having “turned to attempts to kill Russian journalists”. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you as we unpack all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. A team from the UN nuclear watchdog is due to arrive tomorrow at Ukraine’s Chornobyl nuclear power plant. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), will head up a mission of experts to “deliver equipment, conduct radiological assessments and restore safeguards monitoring systems”, it said. Sweden and Finland have agreed to submit applications to join Nato at the same time, the Swedish newspaper Expressen reports. Both countries have agreed to announce their applications in the week of 16 to 22 May, during Finland’s president Sauli Niinistö’s visit to Stockholm, according to Swedish government sources. Here are the video clips of the plumes of smoke seen after fires break out at Russian oil depots. Videos posted on social media and satellite images on Nasa’s fire-tracking website appeared to show large fires in at least two locations in Bryansk. No immediate information was given as to the cause of the fires. Russian president Vladimir Putin on Monday said the FSB spy agency had foiled what he cast as a Western plan to kill a prominent Russian journalist. “This morning, the Federal Security Service stopped the activities of a terrorist group that planned to attack and kill one famous Russian TV journalist … We have indisputable facts,” Putin said during a meeting with the country’s top prosecutors. “After experiencing an information fiasco in Russia, the West has now turned to attempts to kill Russian journalists,” Putin added, without providing evidence to support his claim. Shortly after Putin’s statements, Russian news agency Tass said that the security services had arrested Russian members of a neo-nazi group called National Socialism/White Power that was allegedly plotting to kill popular pro-Kremlin state television host Vladimir Solovyev on “orders” of Ukraine. Tass said that the security services seized a number of weapons as well as eight Molotov cocktails and six pistols during the arrest of the group. The FSB frequently claims to foil terror acts plotted by what they say are far-right groups acting on behalf of Ukraine, without providing much evidence to support their allegations. Days prior to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian security services also accused Ukraine of a number of attacks on Russian territory and the separatist-held Donbas, claims which were later debunked by independent journalists. Putin on Monday further said that the West was attempting to destroy Russia from the inside. “The task of splitting Russian society, destroying the country from the inside has come to the fore for the West, but their efforts will fail,” Putin said, adding that Russian society has “never been more united.” Putin also accused the West of using foreign media organisations and social media to organize “provocations” against Russia’s armed forces. Rebecca Solnit has filed her latest column for us, saying that Ukraine has taught us all a lesson in moral courage: Ukraine matters for its own sake, of course, and there is a very direct war between imperialism and authoritarianism and self-determination being fought. But Ukrainians, even as they receive aid from around the world, are giving us all something, a crash course in human capacity and in other versions of human nature than we are usually offered. We in the US face our own neofascists and would-be authoritarians, as we around the world face a climate crisis brought on by fossil-fuel interests’ selfishness and shortsightedness. Reminding us of who human beings can be, what it looks like to stand on principle, why it’s worth fighting whether or not you believe you can win, is a gift Ukrainians have given us. They remind us who we can be, and in facing the other crises of our time, who we need to be. Read more here: Rebecca Solnit – Ukraine has taught us all a lesson in moral courage Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said the United Nations should be the “initiator and guarantor” of any agreement with Russia on evacuating civilians from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. Vereshchuk wrote on Telegram: Today, the Russian side once again announced the existence of a corridor for civilians to leave Azovstal. This could be believed if the Russians had not destroyed humanitarian corridors many times before. A humanitarian corridor must be opened “by the agreement of both sides”, Vereshchuk said. A corridor announced unilaterally does not provide security, and therefore is not a humanitarian corridor. She said Ukraine had “appealed” for the UN secretary general, Antonoi Guterres, to be “the initiator and guarantor of the humanitarian corridor from Azovstal for civilians”. Representatives of the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross should be present when any humanitarian corridor was established, she said. Three Nato warships have arrived in the southwestern Finnish port of Turku to train with Finland’s navy, Reuters reports. The Latvian minelayer LVNS Virsaitis and minehunters Estonian ENS Sakala and Dutch HNLMS Schiedam will train with two minehunters from Finland’s coastal fleet, Finland’s defence forces said in a statement today. The two-day exercise will prepare the Finnish ships to take part in Nato response forces and focus on “mine countermeasures and working in a multinational framework”, the statement said. It comes as Helsinki considers the possibility of joining the military alliance amid increased tensions with neighbouring Russia. Earlier this month, the Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, said her country would take a decision in the next few weeks about whether to join Nato. Large fires broke out early on Monday at two oil depots in the Russian city of Bryansk, less than 100 miles from the border with Ukraine, in a potential act of sabotage by Kyiv. Russian state media said the first fire occurred at a civilian facility in Bryansk holding 10,000 tons of fuel, followed by a second fire at a military fuel depot holding 5,000 tons. Bryansk, which is less than 100 miles north-east of the Ukrainian border, serves as a logistics base for Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine. Images posted on Russian social media showed columns of smoke rising from the facilities in the Russian city on Monday morning. Military analyst Rob Lee said that the footage suggested the fire was “probably” caused by Ukrainian sabotage. “It sounds like something is flying through the air before the explosion. I think it was probably a Ukrainian attack, but we cannot be certain,” Lee said. “The fact that it was two separate sites not far from the border is important,” Lee said, adding that the fires may have been caused by a Tochka-U tactical ballistic missile, which he said had the range to reach both targets if deployed near the Russian-Ukrainian border. Lee added that if Ukrainian involvement was confirmed, the strikes were likely to have been conducted to “disrupt fuel supplies for the Russian military”. In a statement on its website, the Russian emergency ministry only mentioned one of the fires, saying that a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 2am local time caught fire and there had been no need to evacuate any parts of the city of 400,000 people. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has criticised world leaders for their “excuses and half-measures” and called for an EU embargo on Russian oil. Writing on Twitter, Kuleba said: If world leaders and businesses are serious about ending Russian war crimes, they must first deprive Putin of oil revenues. Enough excuses and half-measures while Ukrainians are being bombed, killed, tortured, and raped. Russian oil is full of Ukrainian blood. Stop buying it! The European Union needs a “real embargo” on Russia oil, Kuleba added. Russia desperately tries to bypass the already imposed restrictions. Let’s be clear: any blend containing any Russian oil should be treated as 100% Russian oil. Don’t let Russians cheat their way around restrictions. Ukraine has not reached an agreement with Russia on creating a humanitarian corridor for civilians to leave the besieged city of Mariupol, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. It comes after Russia announced a ceasefire to allow for civilians sheltering in the besieged Azovstal steel plant to leave. Vereshchuk said on Telegram: It is important to understand that a humanitarian corridor opens by the agreement of both sides. A corridor announced unilaterally does not provide security, and therefore is not a humanitarian corridor. Forensic doctors carrying out postmortem examinations on bodies in mass graves north of Kyiv say they have found evidence some women were raped before being killed by Russian forces, Lorenzo Tondo and Isobel Koshiw report. “We already have a few cases which suggest that these women had been raped before being shot to death,” said Vladyslav Pirovskyi, a Ukrainian forensic doctor who with a team of coroners has carried out dozens of autopsies on residents from Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka who died during Russia’s month-long occupation of the area. “We can’t give more details as my colleagues are still collecting the data and we still have hundreds of bodies to examine,” he said. Pirovskyi’s team has been examining about 15 bodies a day, many of them mutilated. “There are many burnt bodies, and heavily disfigured bodies that are just impossible to identify,” he said. “The face could be smashed into pieces, you can’t put it back together, sometimes there’s no head at all.” He said the bodies of some women they had examined showed signs that the victims had been killed by automatic gunfire, with upwards of six bullet holes in their backs. Oleh Tkalenko, a senior prosecutor for the Kyiv region, said details of alleged rapes had been forwarded to his office, which is investigating circumstances such as locations and the ages of victims. “Rape cases are a very delicate and sensitive matter,” Tkalenko said. “Forensic doctors have a specific task of checking the genitalia of female victims and looking for signs of rape.” A foreign coroner working north of Kyiv who asked to remain anonymous said some bodies “are in such bad shape that it is not easy to find signs of rapes and sexual abuses. But we are collecting evidence in a few cases of women we believe had been raped before being murdered.” The Russian defence ministry said in a statement on Monday it was opening a humanitarian corridor at 2pm (11am GMT) Monday for all civilians to leave the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. The defence ministry said in a statement posted on its official Facebook page: The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the formations of the Donetsk People’s Republic from 14:00 (Moscow time) on April 25, 2022 unilaterally cease any hostilities, units are withdrawn to a safe distance and ensure the withdrawal of the specified category of citizens in any directions they choose. Ukrainian officials have said that up to 1,000 civilians are sheltering at the giant steel plant, and earlier blamed Russia for not holding their fire during previous attempts to establish humanitarian routes out of the city. The Russian defence ministry on Monday also repeated its claims that “nationalists” were holding civilian hostages as “human shields” at the Azovstal plant: If civilians are still at the metallurgical plant, then we demand that the Kyiv authorities immediately give the appropriate order to the commanders of nationalist formations for their release. Here’s more from the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, following his meeting with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv. Speaking to reporters from an undisclosed location in Poland near the Ukrainian border, Austin was asked what the US now sees as success in Ukraine. Austin replied: We want to see Ukraine remain a sovereign country, a democratic country able to protect its sovereign territory. We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine. It has already lost a lot of military capability. We want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability. Austin said he believed Ukraine could win the war if it had the “right equipment” and “right support”. In terms of their ability to win – the first step in winning is believing that you can win. And so, they believe that we can win. We believe that we – they – can win, if they have the right equipment, the right support, and we’re going to do everything we can and continue to do everything we can. A Ukrainian refugee has been left homeless days after moving in with a host in Brighton who demanded money from her to pay for utility bills. Olha, 36, who asked for her real name not to be used, moved in with her host who had registered with the government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme. But she was told to leave when she said she was unable to pay the money her host demanded. A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities source said it was not acceptable for hosts to demand money from Ukrainian guests. Hosts can claim £350 a month from a government fund to cover the costs of hosting Ukrainian refugees. The deputy leader of Brighton and Hove city council, Hannah Clare, confirmed the council was aware of the case and condemned the government hosting scheme. “The government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme has been badly put together. Among its flaws is the fact that there is no mechanism for councils to transfer a Ukrainian guest to an alternative sponsor when something like this happens,” she said. Olha, who was working in finance and economics before the war started, matched with a British woman in her 60s via a Facebook group and had registered with the government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme. She fled her home in Dnipro on 28 March and began a dangerous and harrowing journey out of Ukraine by car. She arrived in Brighton about two weeks later. At first Olha thought things would go well with her host. She provided her with an evening meal when she arrived, but told her she would be expected to provide her own food after that. But soon the host started demanding money and said Olha was costing her a lot in utility bills. “She contacted the utility companies, asked them how much she had spent that week and told me that since I had arrived her energy bills had gone up a lot and that I needed to pay her £50 per week for energy bills. She said if I didn’t want to pay her I had to leave,” said Olha. “I felt so upset I thought it would have been better for me to stay at home in Ukraine so that I wouldn’t experience anything like this.” US secretary of state Antony Blinken has said ‘Russia is failing’ in its war aims, while Ukraine is succeeding. US president Joe Biden’s top diplomat was speaking at the Poland-Ukraine border after making a visit to Kyiv on Sunday to meet Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and other officials. Blinken was accompanied by US defence secretary Lloyd Austin, who said the Ukrainians “can win if they have the right equipment, the right support”. The US pledged more assistance. American diplomats will begin returning to Ukraine this week, the US state department has said. Russia has warned the US against sending more arms to Ukraine. Washington ambassador Anatoly Antonov said “We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice.” The Russian defence ministry has claimed that its armed forces have struck the Kremenchug oil refinery, to the north-west of Dnipro. The ministry claims the Russian air force struck 56 military infrastructure targets overnight. Russia is also claiming to have downed two Ukrainian drones flying over Russia’s Kursk region. Russia fired rockets at two towns in Ukraine’s central Vinnytsia region on Monday, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries, regional governor Serhiy Borzov reported. The head of Ukraine’s railways has said five train stations have come under fire in western and central Ukraine, and that casualties have been reported. Russian authorities have confirmed that oil storage tanks have caught fire at an oil depot in Bryansk, about 100km north of the Ukrainian border. The cause is unclear. Russia’s ministry of defence has suggested compensation for the families of dead servicemen be overseen by military rather than civilian officials, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has written in its latest intelligence update. “This likely reflects a desire to hide the true scale of Russia’s losses from the domestic population,” it wrote. Dozens of civilians who died during the Russian occupation of the Ukrainian city of Bucha were killed by tiny metal arrows from shells of a type fired by Russian artillery, forensic doctors have said. Fléchettes are an anti-personnel weapon widely used during the first world war. Russian president Vladimir Putin has sent his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron a message of congratulations after Macron won re-election to the French presidency. An active-duty South Korean marine who made an unauthorised overseas trip – reportedly an attempt to reach Ukraine – has been arrested after arriving back home, Seoul’s military has said. Latest UNHCR data reveals almost 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country. The OSCE, the world’s largest security body, has said it is “extremely concerned” after several of its Ukrainian members were believed to have been arrested in Russian-controlled territories in the country’s east. Russia’s defence ministry said its troops would halt hostilities to allow civilians to leave the Azovstal steel works in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Russian troops “from 14:00 Moscow time (1100 GMT) on April 25, 2022, will unilaterally stop any hostilities, withdraw units to a safe distance and ensure the withdrawal” of civilians, the defence ministry said in a statement. It said the civilians will be taken “in any direction they have chosen”. The ministry added that the Ukrainian side should show “readiness” to start the humanitarian evacuations “by raising white flags” at the plant. It said this information will be communicated to those inside Azovstal “via radio channels” every 30 minutes. Last week, Russia said civilians and Ukrainian fighters could leave the Azovstal plant on the condition that Ukrainian forces “raise white flags”. Hello. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The assault on Ukraine has resonated around the world, and scattered refugees in its wake. Here are some of the images we’ve been sent on the newswires today showing the global impact. Russia has warned the US against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington told Russian state television. “We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,” Reuters reports Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel. Antonov said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia’s concerns following US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s visit to Kyiv. Here is a video clip from US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s media briefing earlier today on the Polish border with Ukraine. He had just returned from Kyiv, where he had become the most senior US official to visit President Volodymyr Zelenskiy since Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine began. The secretary of state said: “When it comes to Russia’s war aims, Russia is failing. Ukraine is succeeding.” Blinken was accompanied by US defence secretary Lloyd Austin, who said the Ukrainians “can win if they have the right equipment, the right support”. Russia fired rockets at two towns in Ukraine’s central Vinnytsia region on Monday, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries, regional governor Serhiy Borzov reported. “Today, Vinnytsia region is once again under rocket fire (in) the towns of Zhmerynka and Kozyatyn. The enemy is attempting to hit critical infrastructure,” Reuters reports Borzov said in a video released on the Telegram messaging app. Russia did not immediately comment on his remarks. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian defence ministry has claimed that its armed forces have struck the Kremenchug oil refinery, which is to the north-west of Dnipro in Ukraine. Reuters also reports that the ministry claims the Russian airforce struck 56 military infrastructure targets overnight. Despite the war in Ukraine, some diplomatic norms remain. Reuters is reporting that Russian president Vladimir Putin has sent his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron a message of congratulations after Macron won re-election to the French presidency yesterday. On Telegram, the governor of Luhansk Oblast Serhiy Haidai has posted details of damage he claims was caused by Russian military activity in the region yesterday. On the Orthodox feast, a shell hits an apartment – from the Orthodox. This is a peculiarity of “Russian peace” – to kill and destroy without thinking, only by carrying out orders. On Sunday, the entire region was shelled heavily by the Russians. Three high-rise buildings and four private houses were burned down. Several cars, including trucks, got into an accident or caught fire through enemy shelling. Thus, people were rescued not only from underneath the rubble, but from the crushed vehicles as well. The Russian army shelled an oil refinery in Lysychansk for the third time. The claims have not been independently verified. There is a snap report from Reuters that the head of Ukraine’s railways has said five stations have come under fire in western and central Ukraine, and that casualties have been reported. Oleksander Kamyshin, the company’s chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked. In the long, narrow basement underneath Litsey 20, a school in Ivano-Frankivsk, western Ukraine, Serhiy Korneliyevych Hamchuk stands before a row of women and lays a Kalashnikov assault rifle down on the desk in front of him. The 10 women, aged between 18 and 51, watch attentively as Hamchuk demonstrates how to load ammunition into the gun’s magazine, sliding the bullets into place one after another with his thumb. “Dobre,” he says. “Good. Who wants to try?” The concrete walls of Litsey 20, one of the largest schools in Ivano-Frankivsk, are normally filled with the chatter of more than 1,200 students aged between six and 18. But with in-person teaching banned across Ukraine because of the war, the school is providing a different sort of education. At the end of March, the mayor of Ivano-Frankivsk, one of the largest cities in western Ukraine, announced that shooting ranges at five schools in the city – normally used by pupils in the Ukrainian equivalent of the Combined Cadet Force – would be reopened in order to teach civilians how to use firearms. Although open to all, the courses are primarily aimed at women. Read more of Antonia Cundy’s report here: ‘Women need to be ready’ – the Ukrainian city where mums and daughters are learning to shoot Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted some images from his meeting with US secretary of state Antony Blinken and US defence secretary Lloyd Austin on his official Telegram channel. Zelenskiy says: The visit of a delegation of high-ranking US officials to Kyiv at this crucial moment for the Ukrainian state is very valuable and important to us. We discussed with secretary of state Antony Blinken and secretary of defence Lloyd Austin defence assistance, strengthening sanctions against Russia, financial support for Ukraine and security guarantees. Thank you to the United States for your unprecedented help! There are reports that Russia is claiming to have downed two Ukrainian drones flying over Russia’s Kursk region. The reports are from Reuters, which is citing the Russian Tass state news agency. The claim has not been independently verified. Russia’s Kursk region is to the north of Kharkiv in Ukraine. The US secretary of state Antony Blinken has been speaking at the Poland-Ukraine border about his meeting in Kyiv with US defence secretary Lloyd Austin and officials from Ukraine including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba. Blinken told the media: We had the opportunity to demonstrate directly our strong ongoing support for the Ukrainian government and for the Ukrainian people. This was, in our judgment, an important moment to be there. An important moment for Ukraine, for the war. An important moment to have face-to-face conversations in detail about the extraordinary support that we’ve provided – security, economic, humanitarian – as well as the massive pressure that we’ve been exerting on Russia, and then to talk in detail about how we carry that forward across all of those fronts. I would say that, without putting words in his mouth, President Zelenskiy expressed a deep appreciation for President Biden’s leadership and for the incredible generosity and support of the American people. In turn, we expressed deep admiration for his leadership and for the extraordinary courage of Ukrainians in standing up to and pushing back this Russian aggression. Blinken went on to say: We had an opportunity as well to talk about where this goes from here. With the success that Ukraine has had, it’s also true that Russia continues to try to brutalise parts of the country. And the death and destruction that we continue to see is horrific. But Ukrainians are standing up. They’re standing strong. And they’re doing that with the support that we have coordinated from literally around the world. The strategy that we’ve put in place, massive support for Ukraine, massive pressure against Russia, solidarity with more than 30 countries engaged in these efforts, is having real results. And we’re seeing that when it comes to Russia’s war aims, Russia is failing, Ukraine is succeeding. The visit of US secretary of state Antony Blinken and US defence secretary Lloyd Austin to Kyiv had been kept tightly under wraps in advance for security reasons. Some images from the meeting have been sent to us via the newswires. The US defence secretary Lloyd Austin has just been speaking to the media at the Poland-Ukraine border. He has been meeting officials from Ukraine. He told reporters: Our focus in the meeting was to talk about those things that would enable us to win the current battle and also build for tomorrow. We talked about security force assistance. And we talked about training. He said that he will now be going on to a meeting tomorrow at Ramstein Air Base in Germany with other ministers and chiefs of defence. This is Martin Belam taking over the blog now from my colleague Helen Livingstone. You can email me at martin.belam@theguardian.com An active-duty South Korean marine who made an unauthorised overseas trip – reportedly an attempt to reach Ukraine – has been arrested after arriving back home, Seoul’s military has said, according to AFP. More from the news agency: The serviceman, whose identity was withheld, left South Korea without permission while on duty on 21 March, the Marine Corps said in a statement, adding that he was arrested immediately after returning home. South Korea banned its nationals from travelling to Ukraine shortly before conflict broke out this year, citing safety concerns. Active duty servicemen are specifically banned from any overseas trips without prior approval and leaving without permission is considered desertion, which is a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison. “We will take stern measures in accordance with laws and regulations after investigating why he had left his duty,” the Marine Corps said. According to the Yonhap news agency, the man flew to Poland in an apparent attempt to join the Ukrainian army in its fight against Russia. He was not, however, able to enter the war-torn country as access was denied at the Polish-Ukraine border, Yonhap reported. The unidentified marine is widely believed to have uploaded a YouTube video on 9 April in which he said he had a “difficult time” in the South Korean armed forces. “But I couldn’t help but act when I heard about Ukraine, where people are faced with a much more difficult situation,” he said in the footage, his face hidden from view. Ukraine marked Orthodox Easter Sunday yesterday, here are a selection of images from around the country: After prime minister Boris Johnson announced that the UK would reopen its embassy in Kyiv this week, Sky News correspondent Deborah Haynes has evidence the operation is under way: Russia’s ministry of defence has suggested compensation for the families of dead servicemen be overseen by military rather than civilian officials, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has written in its latest intelligence update. “This likely reflects a desire to hide the true scale of Russia’s losses from the domestic population,” it wrote. It also said Russia’s decision to besiege rather than attack Mariupol’s Azovstal steel plant “means many Russian units remain fixed in the city and cannot be redeployed. Ukraine’s defence of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness.” In the Donbas, meanwhile, Russia had made”minor advances” since shifting its focus to the region but, the update noted, “without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough”. Russian authorities have confirmed that oil storage tanks have caught fire at an oil depot in Bryansk, around 100 kilometres north of the Ukrainian border. The Emergency Situations Ministry in Bryansk said they received a fire report at 2 am Moscow time, the Russian news agency Tass reported, adding that first responders were at the scene. No information was given as to the cause of the fires. Videos posted on social media and satellite images on Nasa’s fire tracking website appeared to show large fires in at least two locations in Bryansk. Zaporizhzhia is the only large city in south-east Ukraine under Ukrainian control but with 70% of the wider Zaporizhzhia region under Russian military control, there are fears that Moscow’s forces will attempt to take it. Guardian reporter Isobel Koshiw went to visit the city as it prepares for a Russian advance: Ukrainian reinforcements are moving towards the city and active fighting has begun in earnest. Ukrainian soldiers told the Guardian they had recently retreated from one town in the Zaporizhzhia region. Villages and towns about an hour’s drive from the city that were visited by journalists three weeks ago are no longer safe, according to the regional military administration. “You can see for yourself people are out, going to work – the city is prepared but it won’t come to that,” said Ivan Ariefiev, the press secretary of the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, at one of a series of war-related training courses being offered to the city’s teachers and journalists. Attenders, who are then expected to train the wider community, were taught how to load a gun, administer first aid and do a basic medical evaluation. Despite the proximity of Russian troops, Ariefiev said, the regional military command was confident it could keep Russian forces at bay. “No one is being evacuated from the city itself,” said Ariefiev. “It’s only the evacuees from the south who are leaving for other places.” In the newly dug maze of trenches outside Zaporizhzhia, the Guardian heard frequent incoming shells that soldiers said were landing 3km to 5km away. The group of soldiers who dug the trenches said they hoped these lines of defence would never be used and that Ukrainian soldiers farther south would withstand the attacks. The soldiers who were not on the frontlines said they had a fraction of the medical and protective equipment they needed. For the whole platoon, they had just six tourniquets – a first aid essential that prevents blood loss. When asked if they thought the Russians would advance soon, they would only say they expected to fight. “We just need arms from our western comrades and we’ll do it. The [Russians] have too much old Soviet equipment,” the platoon commander said. “In case you hadn’t noticed, they reached Kharkiv, Kyiv, encircled Sumy and Chernihiv – four huge regions – and we kicked them out. They were considered a powerful army, but we pissed on them.” Read on here: US diplomats will begin returning to Ukraine this week, the US State Department has said, after secretary of state Antony Blinken and secretary of defense Lloyd Austin returned from a secretive visit to Ukraine to meet president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The top US envoys also promised more $300m in foreign military financing and have approved a $165 million sale of ammunition, according to Associated Press. The news agency reported: They also said Biden would soon announce his nominee to be ambassador to Ukraine and that American diplomats who left Ukraine before the war would start returning to the country this coming week. The US embassy in Kyiv will remain closed for the moment. Zelenskiy had announced Saturday that he would meet with the US officials in Kyiv on Sunday, but the Biden administration refused to confirm that and declined to discuss details of a possible visit even though planning had been underway for more than a week. Journalists who traveled with Austin and Blinken to Poland were barred from reporting on the trip until it was over, were not allowed to accompany them on their overland journey into Ukraine, and were prohibited from specifying where in southeast Poland they waited for the cabinet members to return. Officials at the State Department and the Pentagon cited security concerns. Austin and Blinken announced a total of $713 million in foreign military financing for Ukraine and 15 allied and partner countries; some $322 million is earmarked for Kyiv. The remainder will be split among NATO members and other nations that have provided Ukraine with critical military supplies since the war with Russia began, officials said. Such financing is different from previous US military assistance for Ukraine. It is not a donation of drawn-down US Defense Department stockpiles, but rather cash that countries can use to purchase supplies that they might need. The new money, along with the sale of $165 million in non-US made ammunition that is compatible with Soviet-era weapons the Ukrainians use, brings the total amount of American military assistance to Ukraine to $3.7 billion since the invasion, officials said. Zelenskiy had urged the Americans not to come empty-handed. US officials said they believed the new assistance would satisfy at least some of the Ukrainians’ urgent pleas for more help. New artillery, including howitzers, continues to be delivered at a rapid pace to Ukraine’s military, which is being trained on its use in neighboring countries, the officials said. On the diplomatic front, Blinken told Zelenskiy that Biden will announce his nomination of veteran diplomat Bridget Brink to be the next US ambassador to Ukraine. A career foreign service officer, Brink has served since 2019 as ambassador to Slovakia. She previously held assignments in Serbia, Cyprus, Georgia and Uzbekistan as well as with the White House National Security Council. The post requirements confirmation by the US Senate. Blinken also told Ukraine’s foreign minister that the small staff from the now-shuttered US embassy in Kyiv, which has relocated to Poland from temporary offices in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, would begin making day trips to Lviv in the coming days. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the latest developments of the war in Ukraine, where the time is just after 7am. Here are the latest developments: US diplomats will begin returning to Ukraine, the State Department has said, after secretary of state Antony Blinken and secretary of defense Lloyd Austin returned to Poland from a visit to meet president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Ukraine. The US envoys also promised $322m in military financing for Ukraine, and agreed to the sale of $165m in non-US made ammunition compatible with Soviet-era weapons used by the Ukrainians. Russian officials have confirmed that oil tanks at a depot in the city of Bryansk, around 100 kilometres from the border with Ukraine, have caught fire. It is not clear what caused the fires, videos of which posted on social media showed huge flames and plumes of smoke against the night sky. Russia is planning a “staged referendum in the southern city of Kherson aimed at justifying its occupation”, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence report. “The city is key to Russia’s objective of establishing a land bridge to Crimea and dominating southern Ukraine,” the ministry said. Igor Zhovkva, a top diplomatic adviser to Zelenskiy, has criticised UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres’ upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, saying that Guterres does “not really” have the authority to speak on behalf of Ukraine. Zelenskiy has tweeted his congratulations to Emmanuel Macron for winning the French presidential election. He called Macron “a true friend of Ukraine”. Dozens of civilians who died during the Russian occupation of the Ukrainian city of Bucha were killed by tiny metal arrows from shells of a type fired by Russian artillery, forensic doctors have said. Fléchettes are an anti-personnel weapon widely used during the first world war. Latest UNHCR data reveals almost 5.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country. More than 1,151,000 Ukrainians have left during April so far, compared with 3.4 million in the month of March alone. Beyond that, the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) estimates more than 7.7 million people have been displaced within Ukraine. The OSCE, the world’s largest security body, has said it is “extremely concerned” after several of its Ukrainian members were believed to have been arrested in Russian-controlled territories in the country’s east. In his Easter Sunday message, Zelenskiy said the religious festival “gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win”. Pope Francis has used the Orthodox Easter weekend to once again appeal for a truce in Ukraine “to ease the suffering of exhausted people”. Ukraine says hundreds of its forces and civilians are trapped inside the Azovstal steel plant in the city of Mariupol, which Russia has been trying to take for two months. Although Moscow had earlier declared victory in Mariupol and said its forces did not need to take the factory, the Ukrainian authorities say Russian forces have resumed air strikes and are trying to storm the plant. Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdoğan and Zelenskiy have discussed Mariupol during a telephone call. Turkey is ready to give all possible assistance during negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, the Turkish presidency said on Sunday. The UN has called for an “immediate stop” to fighting in Mariupol so that civilians trapped in the city can be evacuated today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/dec/06/australia-lobbies-infrastructure-bank-to-invest-in-coal-and-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-06T07:50:26Z","webTitle":"Australia lobbies infrastructure bank to invest in coal and nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/06/australia-lobbies-infrastructure-bank-to-invest-in-coal-and-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/dec/06/australia-lobbies-infrastructure-bank-to-invest-in-coal-and-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Australia lobbies infrastructure bank to invest in coal and nuclear power","bodyText":"The Australian government is lobbying for the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to put more emphasis on coal and nuclear after concerns renewable energy projects were being prioritised. Draft guidelines were circulated by the bank that suggest it should prioritise investments in renewable energy projects across Asia while the Turnbull government has argued fossil fuels will play a significant role in energy generation in the region for decades to come.. Australia joined the AIIB in June 2015, with then-treasurer Joe Hockey pledging an initial $930m to the bank. The AIIB has been working with the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, and a range of other banks to satisfy an estimated US$8tn infrastructure shortfall across Asia. The bank is still in the process of creating its identity, but its founding members, including Australia, have declared the AIIB should be a “green bank.” The draft guidelines suggest the AIIB should not consider financing nuclear plants at this stage, because the bank would “have to develop the capacity to be involved in such complex and capital-intensive projects”. It says this decision could be revisited if justified. It also suggests the AIIB should prioritise renewable energy generation over fossil fuel power. It says gas projects should be considered during the transition to a lower carbon intensity power mix, while coal and oil-fired power plants should be exceptionally considered “if cleaner technologies are not available for well-founded energy security or affordability reasons”. Members of the AIIB board will meet in Beijing on Thursday and Friday to talk about the draft strategy. Australia will be represented by Treasury official Chris Legg. Australia has a $3.7bn stake in the AIIB, making it the sixth-largest member (with voting power worth 3.8% of all members). China is the largest member, with a $28.8bn stake (and 28.8% voting power). But the Australian government’s desire to have the AIIB’s investment strategy give more priority to fossil fuel projects runs contrary to Australian public opinion. According to an online poll from Market Forces, taken between 15 and 19 August by Essential Research, 62% of Australians would prefer multilateral banks like the AIIB and World Bank to use taxpayer dollars to fund renewable energy projects. The poll, of 1,017 respondents, found just 13% of Australians would prefer money to fund fossil fuel projects (with 26% unsure). It also found that people aged 55 or over were more likely to indicate that they would prefer Australia to be funding renewable energy (66% compared to 59% of people aged 30-55, and 57% of people under 30). The treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the government’s energy market policies, for Australia and the region, had to ensure that energy prices were more affordable, while reducing cost-of-living pressures and promoting growth. “We must have a national energy strategy, and a real national energy market, with the strategy and infrastructure in place to support a new energy advantage and energy security for Australian companies and householders now and in the future,” he told Guardian Australia. A spokesman said the government originally invested in the AIIB to support stronger regional development, saying economic growth was “vital to our region and Australia’s national prosperity”. The AIIB has received submissions from governments, energy companies, non-government organisations and civil society groups about its draft energy investment strategy. According to the Australian, the Minerals Council of Australia has argued in its submission that the draft fails to address “the central role that adequate access to secure and affordable energy plays, and will continue to play, in providing economic opportunity and better living standards for hundreds of millions of people in east and south Asia”. “[The proposal] rightly endorses the notion of technology neutrality but then proposes the exclusion of some energy technologies and explicit preferment of others,” the MCA submission said. Guardian Australia has contacted the Minerals Council. Julien Vincent, the executive director of Market Forces, said he was concerned the government was trying to create opportunities for an industry that was in structural decline globally. “We’ve got banks walking away from funding huge coal projects … so you’ve got less commercial credit available,” he said. “[But] the government’s trying to push into an area where more credible lenders and financial actors are actually moving away from. And it’s with public money as well.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2021/nov/10/australia-news-updates-live-scott-morrison-climate-covid-coronavirus-cop26-labor-nsw-victoria-","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-10T07:54:51Z","webTitle":"Scott Morrison says ‘can do capitalism’ will lead climate action – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/nov/10/australia-news-updates-live-scott-morrison-climate-covid-coronavirus-cop26-labor-nsw-victoria-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2021/nov/10/australia-news-updates-live-scott-morrison-climate-covid-coronavirus-cop26-labor-nsw-victoria-","fields":{"headline":"Scott Morrison says ‘can do capitalism’ will lead climate action – as it happened","bodyText":"And with that, we will wrap up the blog for today. Here is what went down: Former prime minister Paul Keating was at the National Press Club, and said Australia “has lost its way” and that the government’s submarine deal was ‘a handful of toothpicks at the mountain.’ The Theraputic Goods Administration announced it has granted provisional determination to Moderna, to allow it to apply to have its vaccine used in children aged 6-11 years old. Accused Sydney drug smuggler and fugitive Mostafa Baluch has been re-captured after more than two weeks on the run. Prime minister Scott Morrison doubled down on his climate action plan, saying his government’s policy will be “can do capitalism” not “don’t do” government policy. He also told the Victorian chamber of commerce that international students should be able to return to Victorian by the end of the year. Labor’s Chris Bowen called the government’s proposed new emission reduction fund “all spin and politics”. Victoria recorded 1,003 new cases today and 14 deaths. NSW recorded 216 new cases and three deaths. Queensland recorded three new cases. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners called for urgent action to ramp up vaccination rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The parents of the man shot dead by NSW police yesterday have spoken out, saying they are “shocked and appalled” by the shooting. Gomeroi man Stanley Russell, 46, a father and grandfather, was shot yesterday after what a police spokesperson described as a “physical confrontation” at the house, where they had gone to execute a warrant. His parents, Ted and Helen Russell, spoke out about their grief and loss: We are shocked and appalled by the shooting by New South Wales police of our second son Stanley Russell yesterday morning when he was inside his Aunty Pam’s house in Seven Hills. It is terribly painful for us to learn suddenly that we will never see Stanley’s smile again. His children will suffer from never seeing him again. There are many questions about the killing of our son Stanley by police that we will seek to have answered through the coronial inquest. We will keep going in our struggle for justice, to ensure that deaths in custody must stop. You can read more on the story from Lorena Allam and Nino Bucci at the link below: The Victorian anti-corruption commission is calling for anyone with information about the alleged sharing of a photograph of the former AFL coach Dani Laidley to come forward. The Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission, which oversees the Victorian police force, made the call after the Age published a story on Tuesday that revealed allegations of officers sharing an image of Laidley attending a country race meeting. The image was accompanied by transphobic comments, the article said. Victorian police officers have been charged in relation to sharing a separate photo of Laidley when she was in custody last year. Ibac said in a statement that it was: Appealing to anyone who may have information in relation to allegations a photograph taken of former AFL coach Dani Laidley at Geelong Racecourse was shared by Victoria Police officers via text message alongside transphobic comments.The unsolicited photograph was allegedly taken at the Ballan Cup, held at Geelong Racecourse on Saturday 6 November. Ibac is asking any member of the public or police personnel who witnessed the photo being taken, or has information about the photo in a text message being sent or received, to contact Ibac. Cases involving high-risk family violence are far more common than previously thought, according to data released by the federal circuit and family court. Half of cases triaged as part of a pilot project included four or more risk categories, the court says. Chief justice Will Alstergren used the release of the data to call for national funding of the program that helped uncover it, which is known as the Lighthouse Project. Alstergren said in a statement: The increased prevalence of risk in family law cases makes it critical that the project be extended nationally to ensure risks are appropriately managed in all locations, including regional Australia to ensure safer outcomes for all vulnerable parties and children involved in family law disputes. Alstergren singled out Launceston, Newcastle, Wollongong and Townsville, where more than two-thirds of litigants said they had been exposed to family violence, as places where the project should be permanently funded. Initial court data taken at the point of cases being filed showed: 54% of parties allege a child has been abused or is at risk of abuse 64% of parties allege they have experienced family violence 57% of parties allege a child has experienced family violence 39% of parties allege that drug, alcohol or substance misuse has caused harm or poses a risk of harm to a child 40% of parties allege that the mental ill-health of a party has caused harm or poses a risk of harm to a child Hayley Foster, the CEO of Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia, said: There is now undeniable evidence that the majority of family law matters involve high risk family violence and abuse. The Lighthouse [Project] is changing the way in which the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia is handling these matters, putting safety first in family law. But it’s not uniformly available across Australia. It’s time we expanded the pilot to make it national. More information about the project is here. The Bureau of Meteorology is urging people across Victoria to prepare for severe weather toward the end of the week, with Friday and Saturday expected to see the heaviest rainfall. Western Australia has recorded no new cases today, with 66.4% of the state’s eligible population now fully vaccinated. Following on from Matt Kean’s comments, NSW opposition leader Chris Minns also appeared on the ABC this afternoon, and largely backed the state government’s climate policies. Asked if there needs to be a more ambitious target for state government, Minns gave a diplomatic answer: We support it, we think it is appropriate. Australia has been pretty terrible at electric vehicle uptake, we required no lease operators or large purchases of electric vehicles to have any particular requirements when they go about their purchasing strategy, and as a result it’s often been dumped on the Australian market over the last 10 years. So it’s good the New South Wales government has got an incentive in place, they’ve already rolled out about half $1bn for electric vehicle charging stations particularly in the regions which is important as people move towards electric vehicles. And I think that in some ways, and a small way we are seeing changes from the federal government, we need to keep going further, [but] states have obviously led the way, in New South Wales in particular. Asked if the federal Labor party should release its midterm targets, Minns was more avoidant: I don’t want to, I guess, jump in front of what will be the federal Labor policy proposal. I’m sure it will be in keeping with the obligations that every political party has to meet these climate change goals and to ensure that we’ve got realistic targets but ambitious targets that can be met over the coming decades. We need these things entrenched not just in law but obviously in a ranges of policy decisions because it is not just going to have to be the heavy lifting of the NSW government or the state Government in Victoria, it will require federal leadership for us to meet our obligations. New South Wales treasurer and minister for energy and environment Matt Kean was on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing earlier, and had some choice words about the commonwealth’s EV plan. Asked about the federal government’s EV “plan”, and if it was a “chance missed”, Kean tried to keep it economical: Put it this way. We are spending $600m to ensure that New South Wales consumers can enjoy all the benefits that this new technology has to offer. Compare that to the commonwealth who are spending $250m across the entire country. So the proof is in the pudding. Asked what he thought of the PM facing questions about his own rhetoric about EVs in the leadup to the 2019 election, Kean tried to dodge the question without dodging the question: Look, what I do know as someone that drives an EV is it won’t ruin their weekend, they will make it even better. That will revolutionise not just the weekend but every single day of the week. That is a matter for the prime minister, but what I say as someone that drives an EV is that they are a great product, they are good for the environment and cheaper to run and we want to see those advantages rolled out so everyone who wants one can afford one. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) is recommending mandating vaccines for all disability support workers, adding that all first doses should be administered by the end of November. In a statement that also details their recommended national definition of a disability support worker, the AHPPC recommended the vaccine be mandate for all workers delivering at-home services as well. AHPPC notes mandating of vaccination for disability support workers providing services and supports to people with disability provides an important protection for people with disability during this emergency. The committee also recommended that exemptions be “limited” and “consistent with the national framework endorsed by AHPPC for residential aged care workers.” The group, which is made up of the country’s chief medical officers, said vaccinations should become a condition of entry into the homes of NDIS recipients. The Theraputic Goods Administration has announced it has granted provisional determination to Moderna, to allow it to apply to have its vaccine used in children aged 6-11 years old. The granting of the determination means Moderna can apply for provisional approval for the vaccine use in children, not that its use has been approved immediately. In a statement, the TGA said it considered both the clinical data in relation to the use of the vaccine in children, as well as the impacts the pandemic was having on children’s education: In making its decision to grant Moderna a provisional determination, the TGA considered evidence of a plan to submit comprehensive clinical data in relation to use in children. The TGA also considered infections in children and the impacts of COVID-19 in relation to children’s participation in school and sporting activities. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) are warning that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and communities are facing elevated risk as the country opens up. The RACGP said that vaccine rates among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities continue to “lag behind non-Indigenous populations”. They said only 54.5% of eligible adults among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are fully vaccinated, and 66.2% have received one dose, compared to the double-vaccinated rate of all Australians, which sits at 80.6%. RACGP Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health chair, Prof Peter O’Mara said it was essential that governments ramp up outreach and vaccination programs: The fact that there remains a serious gap in vaccine coverage between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Indigenous people in our country is a national shame. We urgently need to ramp up vaccine access and education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, particularly for younger community members and certain jurisdictions, including Western Australia, Queensland, South Australia, and the Northern Territory, which we know are really lagging behind. We have already seen devastating outbreaks in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, particularly in the eastern states, despite the considerable work that went into ensuring these communities were isolated from the virus. So, earlier today, the Australian government has ranked dead last by the Climate Change Performance Index for its response to the climate crisis. The assessment looked at the climate response of 60 countries, and the current government’s lack of policies, high per capita greenhouse gas emissions, weak targets, low levels of renewables and high levels of energy use. Australia slipped four places on the index from last year, and was the only country allocated a score of zero in the climate policy category. You can read more on the assessment in the story from Graham Readfearn, linked below: WA police have confirmed the arrest of two men after they allegedly drove through a border checkpoint. In a statement, police say a 17-year-old male driver and his 24-year-old male passenger were attempting to return to WA by road from NSW, via Victoria and South Australia, but his G2G pass had been rejected multiple times for “failing to meet the threshold to be granted entry from an ‘Extreme Risk’ location”. A subsequent G2G Pass application was accepted on 7 November, suggesting he had been in South Australia for the previous fortnight. They attempted to cross the border on Monday and were turned around. Police say the car returned later that day, and attempted to drive through the checkpoint. About 6:25pm the same vehicle re-attended the checkpoint and it will be alleged the vehicle was driven through the checkpoint at high speed, failing to stop for police. The vehicle was later located about 20km east of Norseman. The two occupants were arrested without incident and have been tested for COVID-19. Both men have been charged with three counts of Fail to Comply with a Direction. The Australian Aged Care Collaboration (AACC) is urging the Victorian government to rethink its decision to allow unvaccinated visitors to residential aged care homes. The state government eased the restrictions on visitors on 29 October, allowing each aged care resident up to five visitors per day, as well as allowing unvaccinated visitors, as long as they avoided common areas and visited outdoors or in the resident’s room. But the AACC, along with Leading Age Services Australia (LASA) and Aged and Community Services Australia (ACSA) have raised concerns at the decisions. The AACC said in a statement they had written to chief health officer Brett Sutton, seeking a meeting on the matter. The AACC has written to the Victoria Chief Health Officer, Professor Brett Sutton seeking a meeting as a matter of urgency. The AACC is a group of six aged care peak bodies representing more than 1000 aged care providers delivering care to nearly a million older Australians. None of us want to experience the high rate of disease in facilities again given the traumatic experience in Victoria last year. There are still high rates of community transmission in Victoria and even though the workforce and a high proportion of residents are vaccinated the presence of unvaccinated visitors poses too much of a risk particularly to vulnerable older residents. Vaccination is one of the most important defences available to protect our older Australians. We therefore, urge the Victorian Government to reconsider this position. NSW, the ACT and South Australia only allow fully vaccinated people to visit at aged care facilities. Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you this afternoon, taking the blog into the evening. Before we dive in, a quick thanks to Josh Taylor and Matilda Boseley for their work this morning. And with that, I will hand you over to my excellent colleague, Mostafa Rachwani, who will take you through the next little while. Canberra hospitals are now free of active Covid-19 patients for the first time since the beginning of the Delta outbreak in the ACT, AAP reports. It comes as the national capital recorded nine new cases in the latest reporting period. ACT health authorities reported there were no Covid-19 patients in the territory’s hospitals, the first time the milestone has occurred since Canberra went into lockdown in mid-August. Vaccination levels have risen to 95.6% of over-12s being fully vaccinated. The territory’s high vaccination rates have led to the easing of restrictions being brought forward by two weeks. From Friday, visitor limits to households will be scrapped, density caps will be lowered in hospitality and retail, stadiums and entertainment venues will be able to open at 100% capacity, and nightclubs will be allowed to open their doors. There are now 150 active cases in the Canberra community. Testing levels remained relatively high, with 1,910 tests conducted on Tuesday. The federal government is attempting to lead new “super-secret” evidence against Bernard Collaery in the Timor-Leste spying case, prompting fury from Collaery and warnings from a supreme court judge that it may cause a “perpetual vortex” of delay and secrecy. Collaery, a barrister charged for his role in exposing Australia’s bugging of Timor-Leste, won a major victory last month, when the ACT court of appeal overturned orders shrouding much of his looming trial in secrecy. The court found the risk posed to national security by hearing the case in public was minimal, while open justice was crucial in deterring “political prosecutions”, among other things. On Wednesday, however, lawyers for attorney general Michaelia Cash told the ACT supreme court that they wanted to introduce “updated” evidence about the national security risks posed by hearing aspects of the Collaery case openly. They argued the national security situation had changed significantly in the 20 months that it has taken for Colleary’s appeal to be heard and resolved. The government now wants to produce new “court-only evidence” – evidence only the judge can see, and not Collaery – on the security risks. It wants to appoint its own special counsel, paid for by the commonwealth, to examine the material on behalf of Collaery. Collaery’s barrister, Christopher Ward, SC, criticised the move as a “carte-blanche” attempt to reopen the case by leading fresh evidence. “It’s described gently as being updated evidence, but it’s fresh evidence, your honour,” he said. The process that the commonwealth want to take to get the new evidence before the court would take months and may trigger another appeal, extending the timetable further. Justice David Mossop questioned whether there would ever be an end to the case, if the attorney general wanted to continually produce new evidence updating the court on new developments in national security. “Is there any prospect of this matter ever being completed? Or will we be stuck in a perpetual vortex of updating,” he said. “You may not want to answer that but I’m just telling you what I think, and perhaps thinking out loud a little too much.” Outside of court, Collaery slammed the move, saying he was wholly opposed to the commonwealth relying on new “super-secret evidence” that was kept from him and his lawyers. This takes the commonwealth’s hypocritical obsession with secrecy to new heights when one considers recent events. I strongly object to the court being given and relying on evidence we can’t see. It’s a shameful mockery of open justice. Pretty wet across much of Australia today, as hinted by this recent satellite image from Japan’s Himawari satellite. Flooding is possible across five states and territories in coming days, as we have already seen in those pics of flooding near Alice Springs earlier today on this blog. Emergency services are gearing up for quite a lot of flooding, according to internal details circulated to staff about “potential adverse weather”. The deep low pressure system moving across the continent is interacting with very humid tropical air, and watch out behind it because some chilling winds are coming and snowfalls in alpine areas of southern NSW are possible. For NSW at least the ranges, western slopes and plains and the north-east are likely to cop the heaviest falls. Some areas will top 150mm and require some record refreshing for November totals, the internal information states. Mind you, there’s a lot in the public domain too, including a lengthy list of areas in NSW facing the prospect of widespread flooding, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. BoM’s national warnings include flood risks in the Northern Territory, South Australia and Queensland, along with the ACT and NSW. The risks have been amplified by previous falls making catchments pretty saturated to start with, and more than a few major inland dams close to full if they are not already. Thunderstorm activity, which is harder to predict precisely, carries the threat of flash flooding but also hailstones, if you’re unlikely enough to be under one. And we mentioned here yesterday, most of us can expect a wetter than usual few months to come. Keating then stated the US misunderstands its role in our region: The US is still pretending to be the security guarantee of Asia, not just the Atlantic, despite the fact that China is already 1.25 times larger and will soon be two times larger. What it should be is this, the United States should be the guarantor and the leader of the west, it should be the balancer and consolidator. I’d bring you more, but the ABC just cut away from the Keating interview to analyse the Keating interview. My colleague, Daniel Hurst, who was there, should have more soon. When asked whether Australia should be concerned that Chinese president Xi Jinping is effectively president for life, Keating says he would like to see Chinese leaders have 10-year term limits, but stresses that western nations do not understand the mindset in China: China is broadly a Confucian society that believes in harmony, in authority and it is with this background that it accepts, I think broadly, the role of the Chinese Communist party. I mean, the idea that we have, if you don’t vote local ballot box, that is, if you are not a Jeffersonian liberal, then you are a savage, it belies the fact that China has a 4,000-year history which has these characteristics about it. He says Xi has been at war against corruption, but says that does not excuse the use of facial recognition technology or attempts to control the internet and the content on the internet. But nevertheless, there is a background in Chinese society which is about harmony, which has a Confucian basis to it, we don’t understand in the west and we have never had in the west. Does all that add up to mean, this guy is better with another term? I don’t think it does. Keating was asked about the destruction of sacred sites, with regard to the Native Title Act, but he didn’t want to go into too much detail except to say he was proud of the legislation. I’m proud of the Native Title Act and every political skill and heft I had took every effort to get that through. Indigenous Australians now have, correct me if I’m wrong, but about 67% title to the landscape of Australia. And through that title, they enjoy autonomy and overtime wealth. 200 years after we stole the titles from them. There is no doubt, I mean, I’ve made speeches in the past about reversing the onus on native title, native title groups not having to prove that they have unbroken association with the land, is a more literal translation of this by the high court since is said, by and large, we did make a lot of progress with the Native Title Act but I don’t think this is the time for me to discuss it, thank you. In response to a question from my colleague, Daniel Hurst, on how Australia can have a sensible relationship with China while also speaking up on human rights issues in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Xinjiang, Keating says Australia should always reserve its right to speak out on human rights issues, but it can’t be the only conversation: You can speak powerfully about the rights of citizens of these countries, but it can’t be the whole conversation. That doesn’t displace the wider country to country nation to nation conversation about the states. In other words, you can’t let human rights discussions completely supplant the relationship between the countries. Keating says while there is no doubt that China is more authoritarian with surveillance, but at the same time it wants to be part of the world, and contrasted it with the ongoing fracturing in the US. He says China is seeking to have the extremes of wealth moderated, and have platforms like Facebook, Google and others “operating in a socially good way.”. He says he believes, authoritarianism aside, that China “will become a more civil society than the United States.” There were 83 school shootings in America since 2018. Eighty-three. Eighty-three people carried guns around. I mean, it is a crazy land. Twenty-four schools get attacked by shooters every year in the United States. It is not civil. You saw what Donald Trump did, trying to overturn the election. You still have a big bowl of Republicans that still believe that the current president was not legally elected – a big bunch of Republicans. A great challenge for the United States is for its re- modernisation. Keating says Australia treated France, the only European nuclear power “appallingly” and suggests the government had other reasons for not continuing with France and seeking nuclear submarines. This is all about, what young guy that works ... Andrew Shearer? This is Andrew Shearer? Well, can’t wait to get the staplers back onto the Americans and you have the ambassador, a local Sydney genius telling us now, no. Why would we need submarines in defence of Australia that are able to stand off the Chinese coast 13 flying hours away if it is not to attack Chinese naval assets? When you start attacking Chinese assets you are a different state. The Chinese, is hard nosed as they are, Australia have these Collins submarines, but they are not in our field, we are not going down there. We don’t care. No, no, no, no, we have a better story for you. We are going to get nuclear attack American submarines and we will hunt your submarines down into the shallow waters of your continental plate. Beauty. Beauty. Former prime minister Paul Keating has called the federal government’s planned submarine project under Aukus “a handful of toothpicks at the mountain” and will be “very old boats” when they’re ready by 2040: Eight submarines against China in 20 years time, a handful of toothpicks at the mountain. Kim Beazley and I ... built the Collins. I built the Anzac frigates, they were built for the defence of Australia. Their range was to stop any incoming vessels, military vessels against us. What Arthur is talking about is our attack class submarines to contain Chinese submarines, hunter killer submarines and knock them out. What has that got to do with the defence of Australia and what possible impact could we have militarily with eight submarines Arthur Sinodinos? These submarines were designed in the 1990s. By the time we have half a dozen of them, it will be 2035, they will be 60 years old. In other words, our new submarines will be old tech, like buying an old 747. And here we are, we’re going to wait 20 odd years to get the first one and 35 to 40 years to get the lot. For what will be then very old boats. He says the French nuclear submarines would have been the newest in the world. If we were unhappy with diesels, the obvious choice was the most modern submarine in the drawing board, which is the French nuclear submarine. No no, we are rushing over, this has the Liberal party fingerprint all over it, they’re going to rush back to the Americans, to a data design but the whole point of these hunter killer submarines is to round up the Chinese nuclear submarines and keep them in the shallow waters of the Chinese continental shelf before they get to the Mariana Trench and become invisible. To stop them having nuclear capability towards the United States. Keating also referred to ABC’s Insiders as “a peak-a-boo show for insomniacs”. Just so you know. What should be done to repair the China relationship? Keating says China wants acknowledgement of the validity of how far it has come. What do we leave them with? Do we hang around in poverty five families to a little house, one toilet, bad sanitation, no education for 20% of humanity? Twenty percent of humanity drags themselves out of poverty and we say ‘No, no, this is not right, you’ve got to stay in the mud. Know your place, stay down there in the mud’ and the Chinese say, ‘Hang on, it’s taken us 40 years to get the $10,000 per head, isn’t that good for you, isn’t it good for us, isn’t it good for Australia and the world? Cheaper goods, buying your iron ore, selling a cheap, flatscreen TVs, all the rest, isn’t that good? Isn’t it better the 20% of humanity is dragged out of poverty?’ We should say yes. I think what the Chinese want is acknowledgement of the validity of what they have done and what they have created. The legitimacy of the rise of China from its colonial past and from poverty. Keating says Taiwan is “not a vital Australian interest” and Australia should not be involved in military engagement over Taiwan. The first point is, Taiwan is not a vital Australian interest, let me repeat that, Taiwan is not a vital Australian interest. We have no alliance with Taipei, none. There is no document you can find. We do not recognise it as a sovereign state right? And under Anzus, Anzus commits us under an attack on US forces but not by US forces. We are committed under Anzus to an attack on US forces but not an attack by US forces which means Australia should not be drawn in my view into a military engagement over Taiwan, US sponsored or otherwise. As Xi Jinping said otherwise recently, we will try to resolve this harmoniously. He says the only time China attacks or gets involved with Taiwan is if the Americans and Taiwanese try to declare a change of status of Taiwan, and if it stays as is, then things will be harmonious. Keating says China will do a great deal to bring stability into the Asia region, and the US must be a part of that – the US cannot do it alone. He questions when the “ning-nongs” at the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age will notice this. Keating says the debate about China in Australia is not the full view because it is “informed by spooks”: It’s informed, our foreign policy debate now in Canberra is informed by the security agencies. You are not getting a macro view. A macro view of what China really is. China wants its front doorstep and front porch, that is Taiwan, the sea, it doesn’t want American naval forces influencing. Keating slams the G7 meetings, and the Glasgow conference for the absence of China and Russia, and reiterates his point that Australia is losing its way in seeking security through other parts of the world: My point is that, China is now so big and it is going to grow so large, it will have no precedents in modern social economic history and is therefore our challenge is to have the United States remain as a balancing and conciliatory power in Asia which I’ve said over and over again but haven’t come to a point of accommodation where it acknowledges China’s preeminence in East Asia and the Asian mainland, in which case, we can start to move towards a sensible relationship again with China. If they are in the root phase, they are in the adolescent phase of their diplomacy, they have testosterone running everywhere, the Chinese, but we have to deal with them because their power will be so profoundly in this part of the world. So, you know, here we are, running to Cornwall, to find our security in Asia. I mean, really. We are at odds with our geography and we have lost our way. Keating makes the point Australia is the central part of Southeast Asian Nations, and cannot pretend otherwise: The thing is ... The area that matters most to Australia, the area which should be our strategic habitat is the Indonesian archipelago. Across the northern reaches of Australia, a central part of Asean. This should be and in my time as prime minister is where I focus in particular, and others as well but particularly myself. This is where we matter most but instead of that we have got this sort of fiction, this thing called the Indo-Pacific like a big rectangular box, India, Japan and another was we are not focusing on the middle of the box which is Indonesia and Asean. It is like a see-saw in the park. We are not in the pivot at the middle but on the wobbly ends. This is just a fiction. There is no way India is going to fight itself with any naval military flotilla in the South China Sea to protect us from China, unless the Chinese somehow turn in a big position in the Indian Ocean. If the Chinese are not in the Indian Ocean, there is no way the Indians will be in the South China Sea. Former prime minister Paul Keating is at the National Press Club for the first time in 26 years, in conversation with Laura Tingle. The focus of his discussion is on Australia’s place in our region, which was something he was very focused on as prime minister. He says Australia “is now very much at odds with its geography and it has lost its way.” He said: We are still trying to find our security from Asia rather than in Asia so here we have the prime minister going back to Cornwall, where James Cook had left 245 years earlier and where Arthur Phillip and the first fleet had left 233 years earlier. Here we are, they, to find our security from Asia. The ignominy of it speaks volumes. We have the capacity to enjoy the region, be part of the region and to celebrate the fact we have been here. Progressive activist group GetUp is releasing a poll on Wednesday afternoon that shows overwhelming support for a robust federal integrity commission. The UComms poll of 1,472 voters found more than 85% of voters support a national anti-corruption watchdog, including more than 74% of Coalition voters. The polling found that recent political scandals, such as Christian Porter’s resignation from the ministry over a blind trust that funded his legal fees, had seen support for a national anti-corruption watchdog increase among more than 50% of voters, including more than 31% of Coalition voters. The Coalition has pledged to pass a national integrity commission in this term of government, and the attorney general is currently refining an earlier proposed bill that was slammed as a “toothless tiger”. Critics, including some Liberal MPs, want the legislation toughened up to include public hearings and to allow members of the public to refer matters for investigation. At the same time, a separate federal integrity commission bill being backed by independent MP Helen Haines and senator Rex Patrick has also been introduced to parliament. The GetUp poll finds more than 77% of voters support a national anti-corruption watchdog being able to hold public hearings, while more than 83% of voters agree that members of the public should be able to refer cases to a national anti-corruption watchdog. Overall, 46% of people say supporting a federal integrity commission would be “very important” at the next election, including 28% of coalition voters. With that, I shall hand you over to the amazing Josh Taylor who will take you through the rest of the day’s news. See ya, everyone! Tweet me if any other politicians don a hard hat while I’m away. The premier is speaking from Cherbourg, an Indigenous community north of Brisbane. Cherbourg mayor, Elvie Sandow, says social media misinformation has been a significant obstacle when trying to get vaccination rates up. There’s a whole heap of reasons why. Religious reasons, social media doesn’t help. And you know, it’s our job to make it happen here and change the mindsets of our people. One of Queensland’s deputy chief health officers has confirmed that the infected Warwick man was unvaccinated and active in the community potentially for 10 days. The gentleman at the Gold Coast, a 32-year-old man, is in a hospital now and he was possibly infectious in the community for up to six days. The contact tracers are working very hard to identify any locations, any exposure and to contact anyone who may be a close contact. What we know so far is that three family members who are close contacts and one of those is a health worker, those people so far have tested negative... Similarly for the case in Warwick, unfortunately, that person was not vaccinated and that person identifies as First Nations and they were infectious in the community for up to 10 days and again we will be posting if there are any exposure sites that you need to be concerned about. If you have been to those locations, please do go and get tested. If you’re in the Gold Coast or in the Warwick area or have been south of the border into that Moree area, if you have any symptoms at all. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has confirmed that the state has recorded not just one, but three new local Covid cases. The first is an infected 32-year-old Gold Coast man. He may have been in the community while infectious for up to six days and is currently unlinked to any known outbreaks. The second case is detected in Warwick. Now, we need to make sure that the residents of Warwick are also getting vaccinated and getting tested. They have been potentially infectious in the community for 10 days and they attended the event in Moree. So we know where that link is. We do not know at this stage where the case from the Gold Coast has come from... The third case is detected in hotel quarantine and we are not concerned about that. Recent travel from Melbourne and not infectious on the flight and was fully vaccinated. Okay, but Tasmania/Western Australia rivalry wasn’t something I had on my 2021 bingo cards. Federal opposition leader Anthony Albanese is about to start his press conference in Sydney today. I’ll bring you any noteworthy updates! New Zealand has announced 147 new cases of Covid-19 today, as the country inches closer to its 90% vaccination target. According to the ministry of health, 89 percent of New Zealanders aged over 12 years have now had their first dose of the vaccine and 79 percent are fully vaccinated. When district health boards across the country hit the 90% fully inoculated target, Ardern has said most restrictions will be eased for the vaccinated in a new “traffic light” system. So far 75% of Maori have had at least one dose and 58% are fully vaccinated. New Zealand is now averaging 154 cases a day. All of today’s cases were based in the North Island, with 131 in Auckland, 14 in Waikato, and 2 in Northland. The country has 81 people in hospital with the virus, and 11 in ICU. Days after returning from the Cop26 climate summit, the prime minister Scott Morrison has released his long-awaited policy on electric vehicles. Morrison, who in 2019 said Labor’s EV policy would “end the weekend”, on Tuesday said his plan was “built on the back of the core principles. Technology, not taxes. Choices, not mandates”. The release of the future fuels and vehicles strategy represents the first substantive announcement from the government on electric vehicles. So here is an introductory guide to what’s in it – and what’s not. To find out all the answers, check out the explainer below: And a little more: Here’s some more footage of the flooding Todd River in Alice Springs - you know, that city in the middle of the desert. Hard helmet alert! Hi-vis alert! Everyone take two big sips of their coffee. A man has been trapped, surrounded by floodwaters in Alice Springs after his car was swept off the road last night. Luckily, according to the ABC, rescue teams have secured him with ropes and a harness, but the operation is ongoing. NSW Health has also released a bit more detail on the three Covid-19 deaths recorded in the state in the last reporting period. One of the fatalities was an unvaccinated man in his 30s. Sadly, NSW Health is today reporting the deaths of three men with Covid-19. A man in his 30s from south-western Sydney died at Royal Prince Alfred hospital. He was not vaccinated and had underlying health conditions. A man in his 40s from south-western Sydney died at Liverpool hospital. He was not vaccinated and had no significant underlying health conditions. A man in his 80s from south-western Sydney died at Royal Prince Alfred hospital. He had received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and had underlying health conditions. NSW Health expresses its sincere condolences to their loved ones. The Victorian department of health has confirmed that the ages of the 14 people who died from Covid-19 yesterday ranged from 50 to 90. These deaths bring the total state death toll since the pandemic began to 1,206. Of the total number of deaths in the current outbreak 83% were not fully vaccinated. A flood watch has been issued for large parts of NSW, with heavy rain expected in the afternoon. NSW’s Bureau of Meteorology says major flooding possible around the North West and South West Slopes. By the way, we will be hearing from Annastacia Palaszczuk at 10.30am, Brisbane time, 11.30am, Sydney and Melbourne time. As I mentioned previously, there are reports that she will announce a new Covid-19 case on the Gold Coast, unconnected to any recent outbreaks. However, this has not yet been confirmed. Queensland’s premier reckons the state will hit 80% first-dose vaccination of its over 16 population tomorrow morning. This will spell the end of face masks being required to be worn inside, but likely not for another day. While speaking this morning, Scott Morrison told the Victorian chamber of commerce that clean technology companies apparently do not want subsidies from the government. When I was speaking to the cleantech entrepreneurs and financiers in Glasgow, I said, “What can we do?”. They didn’t ask for subsidies ... not at least at that occasion. It was, simply, ‘can you please ensure that when we develop these technologies and we seek to establish manufacturing and we seek to do all these things that we will not be tied up in all these approval processes that put cost on to these things that do not have to be there?’ This is your hourly reminder, across this very wet weekend, to NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER DRIVE ACROSS A FLOODED ROAD! DO NOT DO IT! NOT EVEN ONCE! The Gold Coast Bulletin is reporting there are been a new Covid-19 case in the city overnight. They say it will be announced by the premier at her press conference today and is not linked to any of the recent clusters. This has not been independently confirmed by Guardian Australia but we should learn for sure, one way or the other when Annastacia Palaszczuk stands up. The New Zealand prime minister has been interrupted by a persistent heckler: her three-year-old daughter, who had “escaped” and was up past her bedtime while Jacinda Ardern was trying to give a live update on the country’s Covid response. The prime minister was conducting a livestream about shifting public health restrictions when she was interrupted by an apparently wide awake Neve. Midway through discussing increased certainty for businesses under a new Covid-framework, Ardern was distracted by something happening out-of-shot, and a faint voice could be heard off-screen asking: “Mummy?”. “You’re meant to be in bed,” the prime minister replied. “It’s bedtime darling – pop back to bed and I’ll come and see you in a second.” You can read the full, adorable report below: Alice Springs has recorded its heaviest 24 hours of rainfall for more than a decade, with 95.8mm coming down since 9am yesterday. As promised, more details on the crocodile: A Queensland man has escaped the jaws of a crocodile by stabbing it in the head with a pocket knife as it dragged him into a river on Cape York, reports AAP’s Marty Silk. Parks and Wildlife officers said the 60-year-old had been fishing on his property on the banks of a remote part of the McIvor River, near Hope Vale, last Wednesday. He saw a bull standing on part of the bank he wanted to fish from so he shooed it away. As he prepared to cast his line, a crocodile lunged out of the water and knocked him over. The reptile then clamped its jaws around his boots and started dragging him down the bank and into the river. The man grabbed a mangrove tree branch held on as the animal pulled him toward the water. Eventually he lost strength and let go, with the crocodile pulling him into the river. The man used his pocket knife to stab the crocodile in its head repeatedly before he went into the water. The reptile suddenly let go and the man scrambled back up the bank to safety. He then drove himself to Cooktown Hospital and from there he was flown to Cairns, where he is still recovering from his injuries. Department of Environment and Science experts spoke with the man in hospital on Tuesday and found his injuries consistent with a crocodile attack. They believe the animal was attracted to area by the bull. The department said due to the remote location of property and lack of public access they won’t attempt to catch the crocodile. Uh-oh! Chris Bowen has discovered Canva! OK, I will be bringing you updates ASAP on this story from Queensland, which saw a man save himself from a crocodile by stabbing the creature in the head. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners is calling for urgent action to ramp up vaccination rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as the Australian summer holiday season approaches. They say increased domestic travel brings a real risk of potentially deadly outbreaks occurring in vulnerable communities. The RACGP says Indigenous communities are critically underrepresented in the vaccination rates. 80.6% of all Australians aged over 16 are fully vaccinated with 89.4% having received at least one dose. In comparison only 54.5% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are fully vaccinated and 66.2% have had one dose. This difference is exacerbated in areas, like WA and Queensland, that have avoided wide-scale outbreaks and lockdowns. The RACGP Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health chair, Prof Peter O’Mara, is calling on governments and communities to act urgently to correct this before the Christmas travel period. As Australia opens up and we move to a new normal of living with Covid-19 in the community, we are going to see many more positive cases. As Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people already face considerable health inequities and higher rates of chronic disease they are more at risk of severe illness and death from this virus. The fact that there remains a serious gap in vaccine coverage between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Indigenous people in our country is a national shame. We urgently need to ramp up vaccine access and education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, particularly for younger community members and certain jurisdictions. We have already seen devastating outbreaks in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, particularly in the eastern states, despite the considerable work that went into ensuring these communities were isolated from the virus. We know so many more people will be travelling and visiting regional and remote Australia; while the tourism is needed, it brings enormous risk to communities not protected by vaccination ... We cannot leave anyone behind. In 2019, a 29-year-old Yamatji woman – known as JC – was homeless, suffering from poor mental health and walking through Geraldton holding a kitchen knife when the police were called. Sixteen seconds after a police officer began to approach her, she was shot and later died. Last month a jury found the officer not guilty of both murder and manslaughter. In today’s episode of the Full Story podcast, Laura Murphy-Oates speaks to ABC reporter Rebecca Trigger and Noongar human rights lawyer Hannah McGlade about the life of JC, and what happened in those 16 seconds. You can listen by searching “Full Story” where ever you get your podcasts, or using the link below: The truck driver carrying the container Baluch was found inside has also been detained, the spokesman for NSW police has confirmed. The truck was stopped at Grafton just recently, just before we started this conference, in fact. That gentleman has been detained by police. He will be charged in relation to conveying the wanted person out of the jurisdiction. He will also face further inquiries about other related offences. We’re going through that trucking company with a fine-toothed comb. We understand there will be very few trucks left on the road tomorrow when we finish. Mr Baluch has a number of charges from our partners in the AFP, arising from Ironside and other inquires. NSW police spokesman: You may be aware we searched a number of houses last week and seized several hundred thousand dollars and other items connected with drug trafficking. We know for sure he had been at some of those addresses. We were close behind him all the way. We’ve identified what we will allege is a drug trafficking syndicate, which we’re now dismantling as a result of this investigation. A member from NSW police is answering questions about the logistics of Mostafa Baluch’s arrest. Spokesperson: We received information he was likely to be travelling in a truck to escape New South Wales but it came down to the diligence of the Queensland Police Service to check trucks coming through Tweed Heads and they made that discovery. They noticed some suspicious items with the container that wasn’t properly locked and other things that brought their attention. Famously, there was a knock on the side of the truck and he knocked back. He was a bit shocked and ultimately good police work secured his arrest. Reporter: So Queensland officers over the past week had been tipped for trucks? Spokesperson: No, this is a recent development. This information was quite fresh and was acted upon as soon as it came in. Reporter: They knew it was a truck, but not specifically this truck? Spokesperson: We knew there was a truck. There was a lot of police work and diligence to find it. Reporter: How many trucks were checked? Spokesperson: Several. It was a large operation. Dozens. It was a large operation. Elliott: But this is such a very, very happy day for policing, for all of the work that’s been done, the critics of the way that they’ve been responding to the work that Critchlow particularly has done, that thought Mostafa would never be brought to justice, can now he reflect on the fact that first-class, world resourcing policing will never see a bad guy get away. To say that government is thrilled would be an understatement. To say that it’s come at the right time because of the way that the international drug trade will probably evolve over the end of the Covid lockdown means that we can now go back to the world, our international agencies and the other state jurisdictions to say that policing is back when it comes to drug enforcement. The NSW police minister has also issued an apologies to international law enforcement agencies, slamming the decision to place Mostafa Baluch on bail, before commending that “ruthless” policing that lead to his recapture. David Elliott: Can I also apologise to the international law enforcement agencies whose work led to the arrest, assisted us in the arrest originally of this individual. And of course, the anxiety that’s been caused over the last two weeks because of the very questionable decision to give him bail in the first place. Credit of course to Superintendent Rob Critchlow and his team who have been ruthless over the last two weeks in making sure that they did not miss a beat when it came to monitoring and, of course, eventually capturing Mostafa. I have already been in touch with my counterpart, the minister for police in Queensland, and I’m tracking down the constable that did the famous knock on the side of the truck. He’ll get a beer and a hug from me when the borders open and if that’s not an enticement for Queensland to open the borders, I don’t know what is. NSW police minister David Elliott is out and about this morning talking about the arrest of alleged drug smuggler Mostafa Baluch who had been on the run for a number weeks. Elliott appears to be attempting to link this police operation to the rescue of four-year-old Cleo Smith in WA by saying the arrest of the alleged smuggler was protecting “the kids”. It is an absolute pleasure to be able to announce that overnight, Superintendent Critchlow and his team, alongside the Queensland police and with the support of the Australian federal police and the wonderful work that they’ve done, the New South Wales Crime Commission, we have brought back into custody a man who was seriously going to do harm to our children. And the work that’s been done over the last two weeks, the way that the police and law enforcement agencies have embraced technology. They’ve worked within their own organisations seamlessly with the other agencies, has seen this ruffle result and I think on the back of last week’s work by the West Australian police with little Cleo, we can say that these are wonderful times for policing in this country and it’s proof positive to anybody that wants to do harm to our children, who wants to be involved in the drug trade, who wants to trade in the type of activities that we’ve seen both here and overseas, you are not safe in Australia. Australia could soon be getting a new antiviral drug to fight Covid-19 after it was recently approved in the United Kingdom, reports AAP. British health authorities will soon roll out the pill molnupiravir from manufacturer Merck later this month as part of a drug trial. Australia has put out a contract out for the treatment, but it has not been approved by the country’s medical regulator. However, infectious diseases expert at the Australian National University Prof Peter Collignon told Seven Network on Tuesday that the drug looked promising. I think we will get it here. It looks like they decrease the chance of you dying and decreasing hospitalisation if you get it early. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca will ask regulators to approve an antibody treatment to give vulnerable adults extra protection against Covid-19. The company’s Evusheld has been granted provisional determination by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, meaning the company can apply to have the treatment registered for use in Australia. The long-acting antibody is not a vaccine. AstraZeneca cites data showing treatment with Evusheld led to a reduction of up to 67% in severe illness or death in mild-to-moderate infections. It also estimates its vaccine given to 585 million people has prevented more than 105,000 deaths and 620,000 hospitalisations. NSW has also published their numbers. The state recorded 216 new local Covid-19 cases. Sadly three people infected with Covid-19 have died in the last reporting period. Victoria has recorded 1,003 new Covid-19 cases today, with 14 people infected with the virus dying in the last reporting period. Scott Morrison has told the Victorian chamber of commerce that international students should be able to return to Victorian by the end of the year. Some unbelievable scenes coming from the protests across the Tasman yesterday. The Australian government’s policy response to the climate crisis was ranked last in an assessment of 60 countries released at the global climate summit in Glasgow. The Morrison government’s lack of policies, high per capita greenhouse gas emissions, weak targets, low levels of renewables and high levels of energy use, saw the country given an overall ranking of 54 among individual countries. As a major fossil fuel exporter, Australia’s resources minister, Keith Pitt, said this week the country would continue to produce as much coal as other countries will buy. You can read the full report below: Scott Morrison is doubling down on his “capitalism will solve climate change” rhetoric today, as he speaks at the Victorian chamber of commerce. OK, let’s have a chat about the weather. Basically, if you are in the eastern states, expect some heavy rain, wild winds and general misery for a decent chunk of the week. Prime minister Scott Morrison is speaking this morning at the Victorian chamber of commerce, where he is making it clear that Australia won’t be heading back into rolling, month-long lockdowns as long as he can help it. Accused Sydney drug smuggler and fugitive Mostafa Baluch has been re-captured after more than two weeks on the run. The 33-year-old was found in the early hours of Wednesday, hiding in a car on a truck travelling from NSW to Queensland, reports AAP. Acting on a tip-off, Queensland police stopped the truck as it crossed the border into the state at about 1am. Officers searched inside a container on the back of the truck and found Baluch hiding inside a grey Mercedes. He was arrested and taken to Southport Watch House, where a warrant was executed for breaching bail. NSW police organised crime squad detectives are travelling to Queensland to seek his extradition when he appears at Southport magistrates court later on Wednesday. Baluch was last seen in Bayview on Sydney’s northern beaches on 25 October, just days after he was granted bail and released from custody under strict conditions. He had been charged with a string of drug offences related to a 900kg shipment of cocaine into Australia that had a street value of $270m. The technology in the Coalition’s cut-down version of the NBN cost up to three times more than originally forecast and was closer to the initial estimated cost of a revised version of Labor’s full-fibre plan, according to figures the government has sought to keep secret for almost a decade. The previously redacted 2013 figures detailing the estimated cost of the Coalition’s alternative model – relying on trouble-plagued pay-TV cables and fibre-to-the-node technology – show the true scale of the NBN cost blowout over the past eight years. When the Coalition won government in 2013, then communications minister Malcolm Turnbull commissioned a strategic review into the national broadband network to validate switching from rolling out fibre-to-the-premises for 93% of homes to a mixture of older technology using Telstra and Optus cable networks and fibre-to-the-node which then utilised existing copper lines to premises. You can read the full, exclusive, report below: Now, speaking of the government’s proposed new emission reduction fund, wouldn’t it be great to see what the shadow energy minister has to say about it? Well, we are in luck because Chris Bowen has just appeared on ABC News breakfast to chat about just that! And he says he isn’t convinced this scheme is anything more than just a PR exercise. Firstly, of course we’ll look at the detail. Our objections have been the diversion of money for renewable energy into other technologies. The government’s spin says this is new money, but we’ll look at the details. This is all about politics. When you see the prime minister’s comments in the newspapers and the government’s backgrounding, it’s all about some sort of fight with Labor, not about doing something for the climate. It’s all spin and politics. They setting it up as a fight with Labor. Every time the government tried to change the CEFC legislation, it’s failed. They dropped it because of the National party, trying to put coal and nuclear into the CEFC legislation. This is a test for Matthew Canavan and Gerard Rennick. Are they going to make attempts to put coal and nuclear in? Thirdly and finally, just two weeks ago the prime minister said he didn’t need any new policies, it was all based on existing policy and technology, because of political pleasure, we’re seeing a policy a day. All this comes after Glasgow because the government’s feeling the pressure. David Littleproud says the government has difficulties getting workers on international agricultural visas to come “forward and being prepared to name and shame these farmers” who are exploiting their workforce. But ABC radio host Fran Kelly has questioned whether government rhetoric has contributed to that. Kelly: You talk about the cultural difficulties of not coming forward and naming and shaming. I mean, as we discussed with border force yesterday, the government has launched a campaign to try and dissuade the farmworkers ... from quitting the farm that they’re tethered to. It includes a warning, that they’re bringing shame on their families, and if they do this the scheme might be stopped, and that would harm their countrymen and women. I mean, you know, doesn’t that sound like part of the problem? They’re being told, within their cultural heritage, that things are at risk if they behave differently and step out and name and shame. Littleproud: I would suspect what that is trying to achieve is to keep those workers within the boundaries of the scheme where there are those protections. Where those workers have gone outside that scheme, then we don’t have the oversight that we should have and that’s where they can be exploited. And that’s what puts in jeopardy, our reputation internationally. And that’s why we have to continue to look at these programs. If we can’t tidy this up, then there is going to be reputational damage and that’s what we’re trying to fix and that’s what we’re working through. What we’re saying to these workers is, “Please don’t step outside the program because once you step outside the program we have less sight over your safety, over your security and it’s important you stick to that program because that’s the best way to keep you safe and it gives you a framework in which to come forward and to name and shame anyone that abuses.” Federal agricultural minister David Littleproud is speaking with ABC radio about the new agricultural visa scheme, which the ACTU has warned could place international crop workers at a higher risk of exploitation. But Littleproud isn’t happy with that characterisation: I think what the ACTU has done is a disgraceful generalisation and demonisation of Australian farmers ... Whether they come in under the agricultural visa or under the pacific schemes, they will be under the same industry awards as Australians ... The reality is, we are ramping up the accountability through the Fair Work Commission to ensure they are doing the checks, they are making sure the approved employers have been vetted. Days after flying into Glasgow to catch the opening of the Cop26 climate summit, Santos CEO Kevin Gallagher headed over to Edinburgh to watch the Wallabies play Scotland from a corporate box. The oil and gas company’s logo may have stood pride of place at the Australian pavilion at the summit, but it was the company’s sponsorship of the Wallabies that would prove a public relations coup. The deal with Rugby Australia will see the team sport the Santos logo on the top-back of their jersey at every game. Former Wallabies captain David Pocock, a strong voice within sport calling for meaningful action on climate, says: It’s hard to stomach. You can read the full report below: Good morning, everyone, its hump day here on the blog and we are starting the morning talking about climate policy. (It’s Matilda Boseley with you this morning, by the way.) Energy minister Angus Taylor says the government’s new climate billion-dollar funding announcement is “starting with the solutions”, as others raise their eyebrows at the focus on carbon capture and storage. The Morrison government is once again trying to amend the law to allow Australia’s green bank to invest in the controversial tech. Scott Morrison has just announced plans to spend $500m to help fund small-scale startups considered too risky for private finance. This would then notionally be matched by the private sector, doubling the investment. The fund will be administered by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation after the Coalition legislates new rules allowing it to invest in CCS, a controversial technology experts warn can’t be relied on to do the heavy lifting of Australia’s emissions reduction. Carbon capture and storage has been criticised by the likes of mining magnate Andrew Forrest as an unproven failure. Unsurprisingly, Labor has been critical of this new move, but Taylor has accused the opposition of picking and choosing what technologies are acceptable based on “some kind of ideological basis”: “Lots of people when it comes to climate policy want to wipe industries out. They started this position where they said we want to see resources industries gone or agriculture impacted. That’s not where we start. We started the solution. Low emissions technologies that can bring down emissions, and if any technology can contribute to that we should be looking at that ... It’s a sensible proposal, but the truth is that Labour has decided that there are some types of emissions reduction they like, and there’s some they don’t. This of course comes as Morrison’s policy response to the climate crisis was ranked last in an assessment of 60 countries released at the global climate summit in Glasgow. OK, with that, why don’t we jump right into the day?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2019/feb/06/house-democrats-hold-climate-change-hearings","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-06T22:59:30Z","webTitle":"House Democrats hold hearings to increase pressure on climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/06/house-democrats-hold-climate-change-hearings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2019/feb/06/house-democrats-hold-climate-change-hearings","fields":{"headline":"House Democrats hold hearings to increase pressure on climate change","bodyText":"Newly empowered Democrats in the House are trying to increase the political pressure on climate change, as multiple government reports on Wednesday warned of rapidly increasing temperatures. But they do not have an exact plan for how they would cut greenhouse gases across the US economy to match what scientists say is necessary and even if they did, they face stiff resistance from Republicans who control the Senate and the White House. In twin climate change hearings, GOP lawmakers questioned the science of manmade global warming and said the transition away from fossil fuels would be too expensive, technologically infeasible and bad for the poor. “The majority of Americans consider climate change to be a moral and economic imperative, and they’re absolutely right,” said the House natural resources committee chairman, Raúl Grijalva, from Arizona. Committee Democrats are devoting the month of February to climate change. But Representative Rob Bishop, the committee’s ranking Republican from Utah, jokingly thanked Grijalva for picking the shortest month of the year, saying lawmakers should be focusing on Black History Month, wildfires or a maintenance backlog at the National Park Service. “Are these hearings designed for that group that’s sitting at a table in the corner so they can write cute stories?” he said, referring to the press. The natural resources committee has jurisdiction over the public lands handled by the interior department. Public lands and the fossil fuel development on them account for a significant portion of US greenhouse gas emissions. North Carolina’s governor, Roy Cooper, a Democrat, testified his state has suffered from more intense hurricanes, mudslides in the mountains and drought that has killed crops. Charlie Baker, a moderate Republican who is governor of Massachusetts, joined him. Some Republicans at the hearing raised doubts about the science that shows humans are worsening extreme weather and triggering sea-level rise. That comes as government reports find the last five years were the warmest stretch on record and that global warming could exceed a 1.5C increase within the next five years. Judith Curry, the retired chair of earth and atmospheric sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology who is often called on by Republicans to highlight uncertainties about climate change, said there have been worse droughts and weather events in the past. In one bizarre moment congressman Louie Gohmert, a Republican from Texas, asked Curry if humans are also causing the polar ice caps on Mars to melt, adding “that’s probably the sun”. Gohmert also suggested proposals for a Green New Deal to limit greenhouse gases would eliminate all overseas military bases and cut the military in half, leaving the country vulnerable to Russia, China and the Islamic State, he said. Those cuts are not part of the Green New Deal framework that congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is drafting with Senator Ed Markey, which many 2020 Democrat presidential contenders have said they could support. The Republicans’ comments come in stark contrast to Democrats who told of climate change impacts in their own districts. The New Mexico congresswoman Deb Haaland was tearing up when apologizing to youth climate activist Nadia Nazar for the problems her generation is inheriting. Nazar, 17, testified that she will be 28 years old in 2030 when scientists say the world will need to have already made major efforts to avoid the worst of climate change. “I have to decide my future career right now. I have to decide what college I want to go to. I have to make major decisions that impact my life significantly for the rest of my life,” Nazar said after the hearing. “So if they gave us the responsibility to make decisions like that, then why are they saying you’re not mature enough?” Republicans at a simultaneous energy committee hearing on climate change also took aim at the Green New Deal. The Illinois representative John Shimkus, the ranking Republican on the energy panel’s climate change subcommittee, said the Green New Deal would be “radical” and include “wealth transfer schemes”. He said fossil fuels and nuclear power will remain dominant and that a top-down strategy for reducing emissions “may not be the most realistic way to address the climate change problem”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/dec/02/cinema-journalism-defence-peterloo","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-02T19:00:40Z","webTitle":"Could cinema play a starring role in journalism’s defence? | Paul Chadwick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/02/cinema-journalism-defence-peterloo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/02/cinema-journalism-defence-peterloo","fields":{"headline":"Could cinema play a starring role in journalism’s defence?","bodyText":"I asked a few cinephiles to name some popular movies that had raised public awareness about an important issue. Before we come to their suggestions, some context. The stories of journalism and of democracy are entwined. Agitation for universal suffrage, pressure for better representation, coverage of campaigns, scrutiny of vote counts and a chronicle of the action and inaction of those who win elections – all are threads in the development of journalism, just as the details form the fabric of democratic governance itself, in every country where it survives. At this time of challenge to journalism – commercially and otherwise from social media; rhetorically and otherwise from some politicians – it might help for the story of journalism/democracy to be told afresh, and in a way that reminds us of the indispensability of journalism to democracy. Cultures are supple. They can inform, persuade, shift opinion by means other than headlines and bulletins. A new film, Peterloo, made me wonder whether the links between journalism and democracy might be reaffirmed for our times through a movie, a really good and popularly accessible movie or TV series. Peterloo is not that, though it is in many respects fine film-making. It tells the story of how democratic sentiments simmered in industrialising, post-French revolution England, and it climaxes at a reform rally at Manchester in 1819 that was broken up with lethal violence by the authorities. The film touches on the journalism of the day, but it is not the focus. Near the end the reporters disperse to spread their accounts of the repression they have witnessed. We don’t see the outcome, but we can anticipate the role newspapers played in the years that led to the reform acts of 1832, which expanded the franchise, though not to those without property, or to women. Democracy is a long, unfinished story. John Edward Taylor, who was among those to report Peterloo, founded the Manchester Guardian in 1821. Along with other newspaper voices – including the Observer, established in 1791 – the Guardian helped to spread the information and arguments that pressed reluctant authorities to take important democratic steps. The paintings and prints of those days show the power and shared excitement of news circulating. The illiterate gather to hear others read aloud. Laughing faces gaze together through the windows of shops displaying the latest satirical prints. I hope a film or TV producer (the BBC? Netflix?) will tap the talent – and the costume department – and tell some of that great story, mixing the love interest, over-reach, courage, obduracy, wit, frailty, redemption and other ingredients into a popular success. Asked for examples of movies (and TV) that affected public opinion, film buffs mentioned: To Kill a Mockingbird, confronting the US with its racial prejudice; Cathy Come Home, homelessness in the UK; The China Syndrome and Silkwood, the nuclear power industry; and Born Free, the environment.

Iran said it was acting in response to Donald Trump’s decision a year ago to withdraw the US from the deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, imposing a wave of sanctions not just on Iran but on any company that seeks to trade with it. While Pompeo was in Britain, Trump announced a new layer of sanctions, this time targeting Iranian metal industries. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said Iran’s decision on Wednesday was unwelcome. “They need to be very clear that if they do not comply with the JCPOA, there will be consequences,” he said. “This is a very big moment for Iran. Their economy is a state of severe distress. The last thing they they should be doing is investing money in re-nuclearising. It will make them less secure, not more secure.” But Hunt’s aides said Tehran’s move did not itself represent a breach of the agreement, nor warrant sanctions. Senior British diplomats are due to travel to Tehran this weekend to urge restraint. Pompeo described the announcements made by the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, as “intentionally ambiguous” and designed to make the world jump – and probably aimed at reducing the “breakout time” by which Iran could secure a nuclear bomb. Speaking in London, Pompeo minimised differences between the US and the UK over Iran. “There is no daylight between our two countries on the threat emanating from the Iranian regime,” he said. “We agree they are operating in defiance of UN ballistic missiles resolution. We agree they fund terror across the Middle East and across the world. We agree they take hostages and repress their own people.” But Pompeo added: “I urge the UK to stand with us to rein in bloodletting and lawlessness, not to soothe the ayatollahs angry at our decision to pull out of a nuclear deal.” He implied that if the UK’s true motive in cooperating with Iran was access to new markets, the US and UK could cooperate to find alternatives. Iran’s phased departure from the deal centres on a threat to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels in 60 days’ time if European powers fail to deliver on previous trade promises. The announcement came against a background of military escalation in the Middle East. The US dispatched an aircraft carrier and bombers to the region earlier this week, claiming it had intelligence of a “credible threat” from Iranian forces. The US stepped up its pressure on an already reeling Iranian economy. Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday sanctioning the country’s iron, steel, aluminium and copper industries. “We are successfully imposing the most powerful maximum pressure campaign ever witnessed, which today’s action will further strengthen,” Trump said in a written statement. The president held out the prospects of new negotiations, but in the framework of 12 wide-ranging conditions the US has laid down for Iran. “I look forward to someday meeting with the leaders of Iran in order to work out an agreement and, very importantly, taking steps to give Iran the future it deserves,” Trump said. The US has also blocked the sale of Iranian oil on the global market, depriving Tehran of 40 % of its annual revenue. The value of the Iranian rial has collapsed, fuelling unemployment and inflation. Meanwhile, the Rouhani government has come under political pressure from hardliners who have long maintained that Iran gave up too much in the nuclear deal. Rouhani said in a televised address: “We felt that the nuclear deal needs a surgery, and the painkiller pills of the last year have been ineffective. This surgery is for saving the deal, not destroying it.” The first step, Rouhani said, was to end the sale of excess uranium and heavy water, a move that will increase Iran’s stocks of both above levels stipulated in the deal. The move was partially forced on Iran by the US decision last week to end waivers allowing Iran to exchange its enriched uranium for unrefined yellowcake uranium from Russia, and to sell its heavy water – used as a coolant in nuclear reactors – to Oman. If no new deal is in place within 60 days, Iran will increase its enrichment of uranium beyond the 3.67% permitted in the accord, which can fuel a commercial nuclear power plant. Rouhani did not identify the level to which Iran would be willing to enrich, although the head of Iran’s nuclear program again reiterated that it could reach 20% enrichment within four days. Scientists have said that once a country enriches uranium to about 20%, the time needed to reach the 90% threshold for weapons-grade uranium is halved. Rouhani also said that if the 60 days pass without action, Iran will halt a Chinese-led effort to redesign its Arak heavy water nuclear reactor. Such reactors produce plutonium that can be used in nuclear weapons. Iran notified Britain, Russia, China, the European Union, France and Germany of its decisions earlier on Wednesday. Iran said it will not need to take the steps if countries “join negotiations and help Iran to reach its benefits in the fields of oil and banking”. It is not clear if Europe has either the means or the will to engineer a mechanism that truly protects European traders dealing with Iranian banks from the threat of US sanctions. Pompeo said it would be legitimate for Europe to trade humanitarian supplies with Iran since they are exempt from sanctions, but they remained the only items exempt from US treasury oversight. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, a fierce opponent of Iran and the nuclear deal, said: “I heard that Iran intends to continue its nuclear program. We will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. “We will continue to fight those who seek to take our lives, and we will thrust our roots even deeper into the soil of our homeland.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/nov/29/french-nuclear-power-worst-situation-ever-former-edf-director","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-29T12:53:18Z","webTitle":"French nuclear power in 'worst situation ever', says former EDF director","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/29/french-nuclear-power-worst-situation-ever-former-edf-director","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/nov/29/french-nuclear-power-worst-situation-ever-former-edf-director","fields":{"headline":"French nuclear power in 'worst situation ever', says former EDF director","bodyText":"The French nuclear industry is in its “worst situation ever” because of a spate of plant closures in France and the complexities it faces with the UK’s Hinkley Point C power station, according to a former Électricité de France director. Gérard Magnin, who called Hinkley “very risky” when he resigned as a board member over the project in July, told the Guardian that with more than a dozen French reactors closed over safety checks and routine maintenance, circumstances for the state-owned EDF had deteriorated since he stepped down. The closures have seen Britain this week exporting electricity to France for the first time in four years. An industry report on Tuesday also warned that the offline reactors could lead to a “tense situation” for energy supply in France, in the event of a cold snap this winter. The situation is likely to be exacerbated by damage during Storm Angus to the main cable that carries electricity back and forth between the UK and France. It is believed a boat dropping anchor during the storm may have been responsible but National Grid is investigating the cause and working to repair the Interconnexion France-Angleterre, which is buried in the seabed and heavily armoured. The operator said that four of the eight cables in the interconnector had been damaged, reducing its capacity from 2,000MW to 1,000MW until February next year. It added that due to the French reactor closures, it had already factored in a reduction in energy supplies from France this winter. Magnin said that instead of backing new nuclear, the UK and France should capitalise on falling wind and solar power costs and help individuals and communities to build and run their own renewable energy projects. He founded an association of cities switching to green energy, joined the EDF board in 2014, and is now director of a renewable energy co-op in France. “The most surprising [thing] for me is the attitude of the UK government which accepts the higher cost of electricity ... in a time where the costs of renewables is decreasing dramatically,” he said. “In 10 years [when Hinkley Point C is due to be completed], the cost of renewables will have fallen again a lot.” Of the Hinkley C design, known as the European Pressurised Reactor (EPR), Magnin said: “A lot of people in EDF have known for a long time the EPR has no future – too sophisticated, too expensive – but they assume their commitments and try to save the face of France.” The UK’s business department conceded in September that by the time Hinkley is operational the price of electricity guaranteed to EDF will be above the comparable costs for large-scale solar and onshore windfarms. Officials argued that using renewables instead would cost more in grid upgrades and balancing the intermittent nature of wind and solar. But in a comment article for the Guardian, Magnin said renewables would still be able to match new nuclear. “Renewable energies are becoming competitive with fossil fuels and new nuclear, such as Hinkley Point, where EDF will try to build the most expensive reactors in the world and provide electricity at an unprecedented cost,” he wrote. A spokesman for EDF said the company was confident its reactors in France would restart soon after tests were complete. He added: “EDF has full confidence in the EPR design which is why we and our Chinese partners CGN have invested £18bn (£14.4bn) in our project at Hinkley Point C. Final testing is underway for our EPR unit in Taishan in China which is due to be operational next year. As our chairman Jean-Bernard Lévy said recently, the EPR is a technology of the future, combining performance, safety and predictability.” On Wednesday the European commission is due to publish plans on how it will support an increasing amount of renewable energy on Europe’s grids, and how it will meet its climate change commitments under the Paris Agreement. Approximately seven or eight draft pieces of legislation are expected in the “winter package”, plus funding for cleaner energy, but green groups fear renewables will lose the priority they get on electricity grids. Magnin said that the EU’s climate targets are used in France as a way to maintain a status quo which sees nuclear – a low-carbon power source – provide around three quarters of the country’s electricity. “Climate change issues are used as arguments to maintain the current system,” he said. Wind and solar provide less than 4% of France’s electricity, but Magnin said the European commission and governments should support community-owned green energy projects to grow that share. Such an approach would overcome opposition to renewable power sources, and secure funding, he said. Separately on Tuesday, the EU association of national grids issued a warning that France was faced with its lowest supply of power from nuclear in a decade because of plants being taken offline for safety checks. Entsoe (the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity) said that further reactors would be taken offline, potentially leaving France dependent on imports in December and February, depending on how cold the weather is. But it said that Europe as a whole had sufficient power plants to cope with normal and severe conditions over the winter. “Identifying the problems facing France and the UK this winter only goes to highlight the importance of investing in new capacity. Events across the Channel have shown that relying on old capacity is risky, with France’s nuclear plants proving as unreliable as our coal-fired ones,” said Dr Jonathan Marshall, an energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a UK-based thinktank. “At home, turning to old and dirty coal plants is not a long-term solution, so encouraging investment in new lower-carbon kit – solar, wind and a small amount of new gas capacity – should be at the top of the government’s list of priorities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/mar/11/fukushima-toxic-soil-disaster-radioactive","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-03-11T08:25:57Z","webTitle":"Fukushima grapples with toxic soil that no one wants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/fukushima-toxic-soil-disaster-radioactive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/mar/11/fukushima-toxic-soil-disaster-radioactive","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima grapples with toxic soil that no one wants","bodyText":"Not even the icy wind blowing in from the coast seems to bother the men in protective masks, helmets and gloves, playing their part in the world’s biggest nuclear cleanup. Away from the public gaze, they remove the latest of the more than 1,000 black sacks filled with radioactive soil and unload their contents into giant sieves. A covered conveyor belt carries the soil to the lip of a huge pit where it is flattened in preparation for the next load. And there it will remain, untouched, for almost three decades. It is repetitive, painstaking work but there is no quick way of addressing arguably the most controversial physical legacy of the triple meltdown that occurred eight years ago at the nearby Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In the years after the disaster, about 70,000 workers removed topsoil, tree branches, grass and other contaminated material from areas near homes, schools and public buildings in a unprecedented ¥2.9tn (£21bn) drive to reduce radiation to levels that would enable tens of thousands of evacuees to return home. The decontamination operation cleaned generated millions of cubic metres of radioactive soil, packed into bags that carpet large swaths of Fukushima prefecture. Japan’s government has pledged that the soil will moved to the interim storage facility and then, by 2045, to a permanent site outside of Fukushima prefecture as part of a deal with local residents who do not want their communities turned into a nuclear dumping ground. But the government’s blueprint for the soil is unravelling: so far, not a single location has agreed to accommodate the toxic waste. While workers inside the ruined nuclear plant struggle to contain the build-up of more than 1m tonnes of radioactive water, outside, work continues to remove, process and store soil that will amount to 14m cubic metres by 2021. The task is expected to take another two years, according to Jiro Hiratsuka, an environment ministry official who is guiding a small group of foreign journalists, including the Guardian, around the interim storage facility. “We are required by law to find a final storage place outside Fukushima, so it can’t be kept here indefinitely,” Hiratsuka said. “It’s true that we have yet to find an appropriate location, but a lot will depend on how much space we need and the level of radioactivity in the soil.” There is opposition, too, to the idea of using soil with lower radiation levels – or less 8,000 becquerels per kilogram – as the foundation for roads, embankments and other infrastructure in Fukushima. The storage facility straddles the towns of Okuma and Futaba, located west of the power plant, where radiation levels are still too high for residents to return. So far, 2.3m cubic metres of soil – about 15% of the total – have been brought to the site. The operation involves thousands of workers, including drivers who make 1,600 return trips every day. So far, 355,000 trucks have been used – and officials say they need more. “I am aware that some people are saying it would be better to keep it here, but the people of Okuma and Futaba have had a really tough time, and they agreed the soil could be kept here on the condition that it would eventually be moved out of Fukushima,” Hiratsuka said. Despite the decontamination efforts, only a small number of residents who were ordered to leave after the triple meltdown have returned to neighbourhoods where evacuation orders have been lifted, according to local government data. A poll by the Asahi newspaper and a local broadcaster found that almost two-thirds of evacuated residents felt anxious about radiation despite official claims that decontamination work had been a success. As Japan marked the eighth anniversary on Monday of the magnitude-9 earthquake and deadly tsunami that triggered the Fukushima meltdown, environmental groups warned that some “safe” neighbourhoods still contained radiation hotspots. A Greenpeace investigation revealed high levels of radiation in areas that had been declared safe, and accused the government of misleading the international community about the risks faced by returning evacuees and decontamination workers. “Some areas still have significantly high levels of radiation,” said Shaun Burnie, a senior nuclear specialist at Greenpeace Germany who is based in Japan. “They are much higher than background radiation before the accident.” Minoru Ikeda, who took part in the decontamination effort, said workers cut corners to meet strict deadlines. “There were times when we were told to leave the contaminated topsoil and just remove the leaves so we could get everything done on schedule,” he said. “Sometimes we would look at each other as if to say: ‘What on earth are we doing here?’” He was sceptical of official claims that a permanent home would be found the for soil. “I don’t believe for a minute that they will be able to move all that soil out of Fukushima,” he said. “The government has to come up with a plan B.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/oct/13/country-diary-explosion-wildlife-old-nitroglycerine-plant-gwynedd","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-13T04:30:23Z","webTitle":"Country diary: an explosion of wildlife at an old nitroglycerine plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/13/country-diary-explosion-wildlife-old-nitroglycerine-plant-gwynedd","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/oct/13/country-diary-explosion-wildlife-old-nitroglycerine-plant-gwynedd","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: an explosion of wildlife at an old nitroglycerine plant","bodyText":"Between downpours on an early October evening, I walked into the Gwaith Powdwr – “powder works” – nature reserve. Black powder in this context: this site was once home to Cooke’s Works, a subsidiary of Nobel and one of the world’s most advanced explosives factories. On a June morning in 1988 I stood in my garden a mile downriver at Abergafren, felt the ground shake, saw an enormous mushroom cloud ascend thousands of feet into the air. My first thought was that the inland nuclear power station at Trawsfynydd (which there is now talk of reopening) had gone up. But it was an explosion in a nitroglycerine mixing shed at Cooke’s, which killed two workers. Their bodies were never found. With demand for explosives in the local quarries declining, the factory closed in 1995, and the site, with its enviable location above the Dwyryd estuary, with views to Snowdon and the Rhinogydd, was given to the North Wales Naturalists’ Trust. With careful work by researchers from Bangor University, and funding from the EU Life initiative for environmental and climate protection, it was detoxified, cleared and planted. It is now flourishing native woodland and heath, with birch, ash, alder, willow, oak and rowan covering the rubble, paths threading through, and hides well positioned to view the abundant birdlife on the river below, in the heather, and among the young trees. To escape a flurry of rain I ducked into the pendulum hut, where the massive cannon once used to test the explosives remains. Outside, late second-brood red admiral butterflies clung to sodden blooms of buddleia in the underbrush. A wren scolded from a drystone wall. Heather and gorse were still in flower. Rain had beaten down this year’s dying bracken. No lure of sunshine brought out the basking adders. Nightjars that have colonised here departed south weeks ago. I wish them safe passage, safe return, and am so glad for once to have a success story to impart from the natural world. • The annual William Condry memorial lecture, in honour of the late country diarist, on the wildlife of mid-Wales, will be given by Iolo Williams at Tabernacle/MoMA, Machynlleth on Saturday 13 October at 7.45pm"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2023/feb/16/australia-politics-live-dreyfus-privacy-miners-labor-coalition-greens-albanese-dutton-health-interest-rates-housing-economy-defence-climate-safeguard-mechanism","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-16T07:37:09Z","webTitle":"Bodies of missing men found – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/feb/16/australia-politics-live-dreyfus-privacy-miners-labor-coalition-greens-albanese-dutton-health-interest-rates-housing-economy-defence-climate-safeguard-mechanism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2023/feb/16/australia-politics-live-dreyfus-privacy-miners-labor-coalition-greens-albanese-dutton-health-interest-rates-housing-economy-defence-climate-safeguard-mechanism","fields":{"headline":"Bodies of missing men found – as it happened","bodyText":"With that, we’ll wrap up our live coverage of the day’s news. Here’s a summary of the main developments: The bodies of two miners who went missing at Dugald River underground mine yesterday have been found. The New South Wales Liberals are facing internal pushback from senior women in the party who are furious that an upper house MP has avoided any formal sanctions despite admitting he circulated explicit photos of a female rival. Former Morrison government ministers Josh Frydenberg and Greg Hunt are backing rival candidates in the Liberal party preselection battle for the seat of Aston, after the retirement of Alan Tudge. Police have labelled last year’s shooting of two police officers and a neighbour in the Queensland town of Wieambilla as Australia’s first fundamentalist Christian terrorist attack. Dominic Perrottet has lashed out at allegations his younger brother tried to orchestrate a $50,000 branch-stacking operation to unseat the federal Coalition MP Alex Hawke, demanding the inquiry running the probe “leave my family out of it”. The world is at risk of descending into a climate “doom loop”, a thinktank report has warned. Thanks for tuning in, we’ll be back tomorrow to do it all over again. The shadow Indigenous Australians minister, Julian Leeser, says the Liberal party is still not satisfied with the voice to parliament proposal and has concerns about the success of the referendum, even after a second meeting with the government’s internal working group. Leeser and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, met with the group (which includes Linda Burney, Pat Dodson, Megan Davis, Pat Anderson and other Indigenous leaders) for a few hours this afternoon. In a brief press conference afterwards, Leeser thanked the group and government, calling it a “respectful meeting, a good discussion”. “But we said at this point in time, we don’t think the referendum is on track for success,” Leeser said. He again reiterated Dutton’s earlier concerns about wanting more detail on how the voice would work, but raised a fresh criticism about minor changes to the proposed constitutional alteration. Two weeks ago, the working group released legal advice from its constitutional expert group that suggested an introductory line (“In recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples as the First Peoples of Australia”) could go before the three previously-suggested lines that would enshrine the voice. Leeser claimed “those words keep changing”. He said he and Dutton asked questions in the meeting but did not expect to get answers to the 15 questions the opposition leader had previously proposed. Leeser said discussions would continue. Dutton had earlier said “for us to be here with you is important and we’re keen to continue the discussions”. But at this stage, to sum up, basically no change in the Liberal position. The bodies of two miners who went missing at Dugald River underground mine yesterday have been found. Mining services firm Perenti says that following a significant search and rescue operation the Barminco employees Trevor Davis and Dylan Langridge were discovered fatally injured. The CEO of Perenti, Mark Norwell, says it is a “devastating outcome” and sent his deepest sympathies and condolences to the “families, friends, colleagues and loved ones of Trevor and Dylan, both of whom should have come home safely from work yesterday”. Yesterday morning, approximately 125 metres below the surface, an incident occurred resulting in three Barminco employees, one in a drill rig and two in a light vehicle, falling around 15 metres into a void within a previously backfilled stope. The drill rig operator was rescued and received medical treatment for minor injuries but Davis and Langridge did not survive. Langridge was 33 and joined Barminco in 2020 as a truck operator at Savannah before joining the service crew at Dugald River later that year and taking up the role of operator. Davis was 36 and joined Barminco in 2020 as a shotcrete operator at Rosemont, before transferring to Dugald River as a charge up operator in November 2021. Norwell said: Our immediate and ongoing focus is on providing support to the families, friends and colleagues of Trevor and Dylan. This tragic incident is devastating and will have a lasting impact on not only the families and friends of Trevor and Dylan but also on the workforce of Dugald River, the Cloncurry and Mount Isa communities and the entire Perenti workforce. The safety of our employees is an absolute priority for Perenti, as it is for the industry more broadly. I am devastated that the families and friends of our two workmates have lost their loved ones. This outcome is simply not acceptable. Norwell said in collaboration with relevant authorities the company would work to understand the circumstances behind the incident and what measures needed to be implemented. Senate estimates hears update on Australians detained in China Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have also given updates on two particularly high-profile consular cases: Australians Cheng Lei and Dr Yang Jun, who are detained in China. Consular officials were able to visit Cheng in January for the first time since September, after visits were deferred by Chinese authorities on Covid grounds. Officials were also able to have a video meeting with Yang in January. Ian Gerard, an assistant secretary in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said it had been 10 months now since Cheng had been subject to a closed trial, and Australia would continue to advocate for her rights, welfare and interests at every opportunity. Gerard said that Australia was informed in January that the latest deadline for a verdict in Cheng’s case had been extended by three months to 19 April this year (this is the fourth time the verdict has been deferred). He said there had still been no clarity provided to Australian officials on the precise charges she was facing. Gerard said Australia continued to provide consular assistance to Yang, who faced a closed trial on 27 May 2021 “and is yet to learn the outcome”. Gerard said the ongoing delays were “troubling” and the Australian government would continue to advocate for him. Yang’s verdict deadline was also deferred, once again, to 9 April this year. The minister, Penny Wong, said the trade minister, Don Farrell, again raised the cases in his video meeting with China’s commerce minister last week: Because these two cases are such a priority for us, I ensure and the prime minister ensures they are raised in our bilateral engagements with [Chinese] counterparts ... We are deeply troubled by the ongoing delays in both cases. We have made representations in relation to procedural fairness, standards of justice, consular visits and so forth, and we will continue to advocate for both Ms Cheng and Dr Yang to be reunited with their families as soon as possible. The Coalition’s Simon Birmingham replied that the opposition, all MPs and all Australians “hold them in their thoughts and wish the government every success in their advocacy and securing outcomes”. Victorian Bar Council emails members about search of barristers’ accounts in homophobia investigation More information has emerged about the search of barristers’ email accounts that occurred as part of an investigation conducted by the Victorian Bar Council. Guardian Australia reported last week that the accounts had been accessed as part of a probe into the production of a homophobic notice that had been posted in a legal chambers. The search alarmed lawyers, who were concerned it may have compromised highly confidential information it had shared in relation to clients and their cases. The bar council president, Sam Hay KC, sent a further update to members on Thursday afternoon, saying that he hoped to answer a number of questions that had been raised since the access was revealed. The email to members, which was obtained by the Guardian, says that the search was conducted by two council employees under the instruction of the council chief executive, Paul Clark, following a discussion Clark had with Roisin Annesley KC, the former bar president. “The question of ‘authorisation’ is complicated,” Hay wrote in the email. Hay continued: Mr Clark was simply doing what he could to assist the president with the investigation, and the president was acting in good faith to respond to the notice. At the time the search was conducted in August last year, neither the then bar council, nor the bar council executive, were consulted as to the deployment of the search software prior to its use. Hay said Annesley and Clark believed the search of the email accounts was permitted under the bar council’s terms and conditions. He said: Those terms and conditions are being amended to make clear that a search of the type that occurred is not permitted in future, and to enshrine the clear and shared understanding that electronic environments used by members are to be maintained in the strictest confidence and will only be interrogated under the compulsion or authorisation of the law. Earlier this week, Hay declined to answer further questions from the Guardian about the case. The Victorian legal services board received a referral relating to a barrister who was alleged to have made the notice last August. It has declined to comment on the status of its investigation into the barrister. Sean Turnell a ‘free citizen’ and should be able to travel freely, Dfat says Still at Senate estimates, and the Coalition’s Simon Birmingham has thanked all Australian officials who successfully worked for Prof Sean Turnell’s release from detention in Myanmar since the previous round of estimates hearings. Ian Gerard, an assistant secretary in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is asked about Myanmar’s subsequent decision in December to annul Turnell’s amnesty and issue a subpoena for him to appear in a Myanmar court. Gerard reiterates that this is a “deeply concerning development”. He says it is particularly concerning that Turnell had now been asked to answer for an undetermined accusation following his release. Birmingham asks whether this action puts Turnell at risk if he visits other countries. Gerard replies: Due to our ongoing support to Prof Turnell it’s difficult to expand on this out of privacy considerations, but certainly we consider Prof Turnell to be a free citizen and we’re working hard with him to support him on this so he can travel overseas should he wish to. Universities will not open any new Confucius Institutes, Penny Wong says The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, says she expects Australian universities will not establish any new Chinese government-linked Confucius Institutes on their campuses. A Senate estimates committee has been told that Wong has not torn up 56 existing arrangements under the foreign veto laws, after receiving advice that “risks” have been “mitigated against”. But Wong made clear new institutes would not be approved: Obviously, we will keep the arrangements under review and the government’s expectation is that Australian universities will not establish new institutes and I understand this has been communicated to the sector. Australia may extend sanctions on Russia Officials have kept open the possibility of announcing further sanctions against Russia next week to coincide with the first anniversary of Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine. Friday 24 February will make the anniversary of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, although the war began in 2014 with the invasion and annexation of Crimea and parts of the Donbas region. In response to questions from the Coalition’s Simon Birmingham at Senate estimates this afternoon, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said a range of countries were expected to coordinate announcements to mark the anniversary. Chris Cannan, a first assistant secretary, said officials would “not be in a position to announce here today” measures that Australia might take. Speaking generally about the need to not give time for individual named targets of sanctions to shuffle their assets, Cannan mentioned “the importance of not announcing them prior to them taking effect”. Birmingham offered bipartisan support for further sanctions and also further assistance to Ukraine. Westpac halts planned branch closures The bank has said it will pause plans to close regional bank branches while a Senate inquiry into the affect of regional bank branch closures takes place, joining the Commonwealth Bank as the second of the big four to promise a temporary stay on closures. It comes just a week after Westpac announced it would close 20 branches this year, including eight in regional Australia. On Wednesday, a Westpac spokesperson said no decisions on the future of other branches would be made during the inquiry.

Peter Poulos has apologised for making “a regrettable mistake” by forwarding photos of a fellow NSW Liberal party MP from a 1980s Penthouse modelling shoot during a preselection battle five years ago. This week the premier, Dominic Perrottet, stood by Poulos, admitting his actions were “incredibly inappropriate” but that “people make mistakes”. Exclusive from Michael McGowan and Tamsin Rose: Victoria’s quarantine centre to return to federal control The facility, which is currently being used to house flood victims, will be transferring back to federal operations at the end of March. The state minister for emergency services, Jaclyn Symes, on Thursday confirmed the remaining flood victims staying at the centre, located in Mickleham in Melbourne’s north, will be supported into their own homes or into alternative accommodation in the coming weeks. She said: Now the flood waters have receded and it’s safe to return, we’re helping everyone who’s staying at the centre to return to their communities and we’ll keep providing support to everyone who needs it once they’re back in their communities.” The Centre for National Resilience was established as temporary emergency accommodation on 18 October to house those displaced by flood waters. So far, 255 flood victims have been supported by Emergency Recovery Victoria (ERV) to either return to their own homes or into alternative accommodation closer to their hometown. There are 44 people still staying at the centre who will be paired with a recovery support worker, who will help with housing and access services like mental health support, financial aid and job services. If residents cannot return home, they will be helped into a private rental, social housing or supported accommodation such as hotels and caravan parks. ERV is also working on a range of options including a pilot program where people are able to stay in caravans and modular homes placed on their own properties while their homes are repaired or rebuilt. The $580m facility was used for quarantine purposes for about eight months last year. It had only been closed for one week before it reopened to house flood victims. International students returning to Australia The university sector has welcomed new data showing a boom in the return of international students to Australia. New Australian Bureau of Statistics data released on Thursday showed approximately 59,480 international students arrived in Australia in January. This was more than double the number of students who returned in the same period last year. Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, said: These students make a significant contribution to our cultural fabric and economic prosperity, adding $40.3bn to the economy pre-Covid. There is still a way to go in reaching pre-Covid numbers, but we are pleased by the progress to date.” Jackson also said “it’s important to note that this data would not capture any increase in numbers of Chinese students after Beijing’s decision to return to its pre-Covid position of recognising only face-to-face study for students enrolled at overseas universities”. “More students coming from China – our largest source market – will be a welcome boost as we work back to the position of strength we held prior to the pandemic,” she said. Penny Wong’s UK speech caused ‘no sense of discomfort’ The Australian foreign affairs minister’s speech in London about Britain’s colonial history caused “no sense of discomfort or diplomatic tension” with the UK, a senior official has said. The Coalition opposition used a committee hearing in Canberra on Thursday to suggest that Penny Wong’s remarks caused an unnecessary “distraction” during annual high-level talks between Australia and the UK. During a wide-ranging speech in London two weeks ago, Wong welcomed the UK’s “tilt” to the Indo-Pacific region but also reflected on different experiences of British colonisation. Read more: The House is wrapping up, Senate estimates still going That is pretty much it for the first sitting fortnight of the year – a very big thank you to each and every one of you for helping me get through it. We could not have done it without you. The Canberra team are still working away for you, and Elias Visontay will take you through the rest of the afternoon of news here, but it is a short farewell from me, as I return to the general political pool until the next sitting week. Mike Bowers should be back from his other projects by then, so the whole band will be back together. Thank you again for choosing to spend your day with us – you truly do make it bearable. You’ll have a general news blog from tomorrow and Politics Live will be back with you at the next sitting, which I think is early March. Until then, take care of you Ax More types of identification accepted for voting enrolment The government has made a regulation expanding the types of ID that can get someone on the electoral roll to include Medicare number or a notice of a person’s Australian citizenship. The explanatory statement for the regulation notes this is “one of a range of measures being pursued by the Australian Electoral Commission to help close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous enrolment”. It said: This expanded list of identity documents will allow those individuals who have previously been ineligible to enrol on the electoral roll due to not having the required identity evidence, to enrol and participate in House of Representatives and Senate elections, by-elections and referendums ... This will mean any person who has a medicare card and access to the internet can enrol to vote or update their enrolment easily online, regardless of their location.” What does that mean? The CPA’s Elinor Kasapidis says keep records of everything: Before the pandemic, taxpayers who worked from home could claim 52 cents an hour and required a dedicated work from home area. The revised method does not require you to have a separate office. When the nation went into lockdown the ATO introduced a shortcut method for work from home expenses. You could claim 80 cents for each hour worked from home and did not need an ongoing diary or calculations of running expenses.” The shortcut method that was used by millions of people over the last few years to make their deductions is no longer available. So from March 1, you can’t claim the shortcut method. Which means – keep a work diary. Australians will need to keep an ongoing diary for each day of the year they work from home from March onwards. A four-week diary representative of the year isn’t going to cut it. They also need to keep some records about their expenses incurred while working from home, such as copies of utility bills.” The ATO has announced some changes to how you can make some claims, if working from home We reported this was under consideration in November last year The ATO has confirmed it: Revised fixed rate method The revised fixed rate method can be used from the 2022-23 income year onwards. The changes are: Rate • The cents per work hour has increased from 52 cents to 67 cents. The revised fixed rate of 67 cents per work hour covers energy expenses (electricity and gas), phone usage (mobile and home), internet, stationery, and computer consumables. No additional deduction for any expenses covered by the rate can be claimed if you use this method. What can be claimed separately • The decline in value of assets used while working from home, such as computers and office furniture. • The repairs and maintenance of these assets. • The costs associated with cleaning a dedicated home office. Home office • The revised fixed rate method doesn’t require taxpayers to have a dedicated home office space to claim working from home expenses. Record keeping • Taxpayers need to keep a record of all the hours worked from home for the entire income year. – the ATO won’t accept estimates, or a 4-week representative diary or similar document under this method from 1 March 2023. • Records of hours worked from home can be in any form provided they are kept as they occur, for example, timesheets, rosters, logs of time spent accessing employer or business systems, or a diary for the full year. • Records must be kept for each expense taxpayers have incurred which is covered by the fixed rate per hour (for example, if taxpayers use their phone and electricity when working from home, they must keep one bill for each of these expenses). A second month in a row of falling employment and the highest jobless rate since May have not been enough to dissuade ANZ from lifting its forecast for how high the RBA will go in lifting interest rates. The ANZ has just elevated its prediction by an additional quarter-point increase, and now expects the central bank to reach a peak rate of 4.1%. Nearly 70% of mortgage debt has already been impacted by higher variable rates, and to date there is little evidence of a material impact on overall spending,” ANZ economists said. Persistence in inflation pressures suggests that the cash rate will remain in restrictive territory for some time,” they said. ANZ expects the RBA will add to its ninth consecutive rate increase in February with a 10th, 11th and 12th increase in March, April and May, respectively. The rate would then hold at 4.1% and not start retreating until November 2024 - an 18-month pause, in other words. So far, Westpac and CBA, the other two of the big four banks, are sticking with their RBA peak rate forecasts of 3.85%, perhaps not for long. Northern Territory’s new alcohol restrictions begin In the Northern Territory, the new liquor restrictions are now in effect and will be enforced from now on. The NT parliament passed amendments to liquor laws introduced late on Monday, in the first sitting for the year so liquor restrictions announced earlier this month, in remote communities and town camps can now be enforced. The Territory has been facing pressure over rising crime and antisocial behaviour in Alice Springs in recent weeks after liquor bans lapsed at the end of July. The NT government says it will be taking an “educative approach” to let communities know that these restrictions are in place. The laws mean that for the next three months town camps and remote Indigenous communities will revert to being dry areas and communities will develop Community Alcohol Plans. Areas wanting to have alcohol will need to have a community vote with at least 60% of people aged over 18 supporting it and then it must be approved by the territory Director of Liquor Licensing to reverse the dry zone, the NT government said this is to ensure it is in the public interest and will not have significant adverse impacts. The majority of all 96 major communities across the Territory are already dry zones, which means about a dozen communities will be affected by these laws. The chief minister, Natasha Fyles, said the laws are a new approach and will be coupled with community investment, that is referring to the nearly $300m in federal funding announced recently for anti-crime measures, community safety, and more funding for Aboriginal health and family and domestic violence prevention groups. These restrictions are also temporary, providing us time to invest in new, smarter, long-term reforms required to break the cycle of alcohol, crime and disadvantage. People in the Territory want safer communities now. They also want us to address the issue at its source so that our communities continue to be safer in the future.” Dr Monique Ryan asks for support for Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry The Kooyong independent MP wants the government to support the Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry (ABMDR) “in its efforts to recruit much-needed donors”. From the release: The ABMDR is the peak body for bone marrow and stem cell donations in Australia. These are used for treatment of life-threatening conditions like leukaemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma and bone marrow failure. Every 31 minutes, an Australian is diagnosed with a blood cancer. Almost 6000 Australians lose their lives to blood cancers every year. Dr Ryan says she wants the government to allow the ABMDR “to use $12.8m it already has in the bank - money it could use for donor recruitment and tissue-typing”. This money is in the bank already. The government could free it up with the stroke of a pen, allowing the ABMDR to do its job and help save Australian lives. We could be finding new donors, and treating gravely ill patients, within weeks. I ask the government to share the sense of urgency felt by patients and their families. We have to support this vital service in its efforts to help Australians.” Peter Dutton meets government’s referendum working group for second time Their first meeting a few weeks ago didn’t significantly change the thinking of the Liberal party on its position regarding the voice to parliament (they’re still reserving their position, pending their requests for more detail on the proposal) but today is Dutton’s first in-person meeting with the group, after he dialled in by video last time. In brief remarks at the start of the meeting, Dutton said there was “a lot of passion” around the referendum. Every Australian shares the desire to see an improved outcome for Indigenous Australians. There can be debate about the pathway to get there and the next steps, but for us to be here with you is important and we’re keen to continue the discussions We’ll bring you more news, if more comes to light this afternoon, from the meeting and Dutton’s response. Earlier, most of the House crossbench joined the meeting to discuss their own electorates. Goldstein MP Zoe Daniel has just released a statement, describing the meeting as “a taste of the direct, practical information and guidance that a First Nations voice would provide.” As an independent crossbencher I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this important process as we seek to enshrine an indigenous voice in our constitution,” she said. We will begin our campaign to help the Goldstein community understand the voice with forums and information next week.” Defence media have released a statement: Today the Royal Australian Navy and Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) have strengthened the relationship between military and civilian maritime jurisdictions to support safety at sea and delivery of naval capability. Chief of Navy, Vice Admiral Mark Hammond AM, RAN and Chief Executive Officer AMSA, Mr Mick Kinley, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which provides the process to move vessels from Australia’s civilian regulation authority (known as Flag administration) to operate under a Defence Flag administration. Vice Admiral Hammond said the MOU provided greater agility for Defence and partner agencies to quickly respond to a variety of needs and contingencies in the maritime environment. …The Pacific Support Vessel, ADV Reliant is an example of what this MOU will enable. ADV Reliant was procured from the commercial market via a rapid acquisition process. It was quickly transferred from civilian to Defence Flag administration, enabling its timely and flexible employment in support of Australia’s Pacific partners. Greens senator on stage three tax cuts Over at Senate Estimates, Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi has paid a nod to the elephant in the room - $254bn in approved tax cuts - when rebuffed over her calls for universal early childhood education. The Productivity Commission commenced a review this year to consider the impacts of a universal 90% subsidy. Faruqi: The first five years of a child’s life are the most critical … research shows the importance of high quality early childhood learning on children’s development, especially disadvantaged children. Why haven’t you asked the Productivity Commission to make early learning universal and free?” Assistant minister for education, Senator Anthony Chisholm, said he understood Faruqi’s “passion” but it came in the midst of a “difficult financial environment”. I don’t think anyone in the community doesn’t think the government has an ambitious agenda when it comes to early childhood education. We understand there’s much more we need to achieve … we have an ambitious agenda but we also have difficult financial environment we confront which I’m sure you’re well aware of … we are committed to doing what we can within the budget constraints that we have.” Faruqi: Perhaps if you can the stage three tax cuts you’ll have less budget constraints … that was just a comment, not a question.” The Greens senator Janet Rice has been asking the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) why men who have sex with men still face barriers to donating blood. There is a three-month abstinence period requirement for men who have sex with men to donate blood. Prof John Skerritt, of the TGA, said the regulator can’t make any changes “unilaterally” and that moves to remove these barriers would need an application from Lifeblood (a branch of the Australian Red Cross). Skerritt said he was aware of other approaches taken overseas, including in the UK, where rather than using a “population-based approach” officials undertake an “individual risk assessment”. He said: We have been discussing [this] with them and coincidentally we’re meeting with them tomorrow afternoon, and that will be on the agenda. But in many ways ... we are responsive to a submission [from Lifeblood]. We’ve also been discussing the potential of removing all controls on plasma donations, irrespective of sexual history. Skerritt told the inquiry that one of the reasons they’d been told that Lifeblood was reluctant to consider the “individual risk assessment” was because it required donors to be asked how often they practised anal sex. “And they’re actually worried that in an Australian context there would be a number of people offended by that question, and it would negatively affect the number of donations. But these discussions are ongoing.” Rice pointed out that recent Canadian research found that the introduction of individual risk assessments “would not reduce the amount of blood available”. She said it appeared the public was being “held to ransom by the attitudes of Lifeblood, who aren’t accountable to us, like the government”. Mary Doyle is expected to be Labor’s candidate for the byelection in the federal seat of Aston, in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs. Nominations for potential Labor candidates for the seat are due to close at 4pm on Thursday and Guardian Australia understands Doyle is the only nominee. Doyle, a mother of three, former union organiser and breast cancer survivor, slashed outgoing Liberal MP Alan Tudge’s margin from 10.1% to 2.8% in the May 2022 election. Sally Rugg and Monique Ryan to return to court Sally’s Rugg’s fair work litigation against her boss, independent MP Monique Ryan, will return to court on Friday after mediation on Thursday failed to settle the matter. In January Rugg launched federal court action against Ryan and the commonwealth, alleging a breach of the Fair Work Act’s adverse action provisions over an attempt to dismiss her for refusing to work “unreasonable” additional hours. At a hearing on 3 February Rugg and Ryan’s lawyers revealed they had agreed to delay Rugg’s application for an interim injunction to get her job back by a fortnight pending mediation in an attempt to settle the matter. The commonwealth agreed to extend Rugg’s employment to 17 February on “miscellaneous leave”. Justice Debra Mortimer ordered that the matter go for mediation before judicial registrar Alison Legge. That mediation was held on Thursday, but failed to settle the matter, which will now return to the federal court at 10:15am on Friday. The hearing will consider Rugg’s application for an interim injunction to keep her job pending final determination of the case. That will require her lawyers to show there is a serious question to be tried and the balance of convenience lies with the chief of staff keeping her job. The case could become a test case of the Fair Work Act’s right to refuse unreasonable additional hours, which has rarely been litigated in white-collar professional contexts. The Act specifies that matters to be considered in judging reasonableness of additional hours include: health and safety, personal circumstances, the needs of the workplace, extra payments for additional hours, notice given to require or refuse the hours, the usual patterns of work in the industry, and the level of the person’s responsibility. On 3 February Rugg’s lawyers, Maurice Blackburn, said in a statement: The issues at the core of Ms Rugg’s substantive complaints are deeply important to her. She notes that the 2021 Human Rights Commission’s inquiry into commonwealth workplaces and the subsequent Set The Standard Report demonstrated that these issues are important to many staff across commonwealth offices of the federal parliament.” Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton both add their words to Bob Katter’s statement. The chamber then holds a moment of silence and reflection for the two men. Bob Katter has asked for a moment of indulgence to speak about the missing miners in north-west Queensland. Mr. Speaker, our miners create three quarters of Australia’s income. Mining is intrinsically dangerous occupation, I represent Mount Mulligan. 72 human beings cease to exist in 15 seconds, the entire male population of a town 23 died in 15 seconds at Mount Leishan at Charters Towers where I live, where my son worked in the mines. My hometown of Cloncurry where I once was a miner myself, Dylan Langridge, and Trevor Davis are two boys trapped underground in Cloncurry’s Dugald River Mine. In such times when I faced darkness I turned to Slim Dusty and Stan Costas’ very sad song, When life is going easy, God is far from our mind but when the bad things and sad things do darken our day, we call out to Jesus in the most selfish way. And so my ask for the parliament to give one minute of prayer and reflection for these Australian boys in the gravest of danger. Question time ends. But wait, there is more. One more dixer for Anthony Albanese The PM takes what I think is the last dixer of the week, in order to deliver the sort of speech he used to give when Labor was in opposition, during the matter of public importance debates: I am asked about what we are doing this year with legislation to make a difference and… there is three pieces of legislation that are before this Parliament. The housing Australia future fund, affordable housing, housing for women escaping domestic and family violence, housing for frontline workers. The national reconstruction funds. Supporting Australian manufacturing, secure jobs, dealing with supply chain challenges. On the safeguard mechanism providing businesses with certainty and in the climate was which is why it is supported by the business community across the board. All of those policies are supported by the sectors. Those opposite come here and ask about the challenge that we are facing. Welcome back. They say no to every solution… having presided over the creation of the problems… they say no to the solutions. No to affordable housing. No comeback to housing for veterans and women escaping domestic violence. No to secure jobs. No two industries in our region. No to energy price relief. No to ending the climate wars. Though don’t have amendments. They don’t have ideas. They just say no. At a time when Australians want us to come together and offer real solutions those opposite offer nothing but cynical, negative politics making Tony Abbott look positive is what they are doing. Now we are investing in making things here in Australia - in evaluating. Those opposite are determined to add no value at all… either in industry or in this Chamber. We are investing to make sure that Australians have a roof over their head. Those opposite are determined to slam the door on them. We are investing in ending the climate wars, moving Australia forward… giving businesses certainty that it needs. Those opposite us stuck in the past and they want us to all go back there to join them. The leader in the Senate of the opposition has a different view though. He said this this week - I think it is in Australia’s interest for us to have greater policy certainty in the long run there. He argued for the safeguards mechanism. He says this come back we need to make sure that we in a country leading in terms of our work around omissions reduction that we as a Parliament are trying to provide greater certainty for Australian business for the long run. He had to say that after the election The shadow energy minister, Ted O’Brien is up next and wants to know this from Chris Bowen: Can the Minister guarantee that no businesses will close and no jobs will be lost as a result of Labor’s changes to the safeguard mechanism? Bowen: Thank you very much, and I thank the honorable member for his question and welcome him back to Australia after his highly successful tour of nuclear success stories that he conducted just last week. I tell you what I will guarantee. I guarantee you that the safeguard mechanism reforms that we are putting in place will put Australian industries in the best possible position to make the most of the decarbonisation that is occurring around the world. I guarantee this...the reforms that we put in place for which I have always given due credit to the member for Hume like I do… always give due credit to the member for Hume for the Safeguard credits which he said will provide business for the lowest cost. I guarantee it will provide the basis for the lowest cost. That is what I guarantee. I guarantee that the support from the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry reflects the views of industry, that finally, after 10 years, the denial and delay of government without one energy policy, one climate change policy, [seek to oppose] which we are implementing... He decides he has also completed his answer, after what looks like a point of order is about to be raised. Google still thinks that Ken O’Dowd is the member for Flynn, so Col Boyce might need to up his media menchies. Boyce asks Mark Butler: Regional health services in my electorate are under enormous pressure. Can the Prime Minister explained to the communities of Central Queensland why Labor has broken its key election promise to have an urgent care clinic up and running within 12 months? Butler: I need to check my calendar for 2022, pretty sure the election was in May. (it being February means it has not been 12 months as yet) We are very proud of the policy we talk to the election to deliver 50 urgent care services over the course of this year, I say to the member and all people in the house and have an interest in making it easier to see a doctor and cheaper… that there has been absolutely terrific buy in from every single state and territory governments. Liberal and Labor alike. The last few months, we have been engaged very closely with them on the locations of these services that will be in their jurisdiction, on protocols between the urgent care service and the local hospitals, on protocols between the urgent care service and local ambulance services... This is a really important reform for Australia. We know, many members of this house will know that primary care services have been trying to get up an urgent care service model in Australia for years, and the truth is that the Medicare system alone doesn’t support it, which is why we took a model to the last election. …I would like to think that those opposite will get behind a model that would make it easier to see a doctor after being responsible for 10 years of cut and neglect to Medicare that had put Medicare in its worst shape in a 40-year history. I think the member should talk to his leader who bears more responsibility than any single person in this country for the condition of general practice after trying to force a GP tax on every single Australian, pensioner, concession cardholder, child, and when that couldn’t get through the Senate and freezing the Medicare rebate for six long years, a practice continued by the deputy leader of the opposition when she was the minister for health as well. I am happy to take questions about the fact that we were the only party who went to the last election, promising more investment in Medicare, promising to strengthen a model we have such pride in as the creator of that great universal healthcare system, and promising... There is almost a point of order, but Butler feels he has concluded his answer. Zali Steggall has the next crossbench question She asks whether the Labor government will stop the Pep-11 decision, after the federal court overturned Scott Morrison’s decision to not allow it. Anthony Albanese: The member asked a question, which invites an answer, that is in breach of the law. That has been determined, in a court case of which is why we are in this circumstance in the first place. The minister for resources will make a decision according to the law. Back to question time and Paul Fletcher wants to know: My question is to the prime minister and I refer to his previous answer. If he is happy to claim credit for increases in employment since the election why is he not prepared to take responsibility for the eight consecutive increases in interest rates on his watch? Anthony Albanese: Thanks very much Mr Speaker. They are very predictable every day, every day question one from the leader of the opposition, question two from the deputy leader then we have question three and we go to the crossbenches. Question three from the shadow Treasurer not to the treasurer but to me then we go to the back then I think about what they will do. I say to the Member for Bradfield, congratulations... Peter Dutton: On relevance Australian families are hurting in this prime minister, his arrogance... That is not a point of order. Albanese: Certainly, it is a fact that inflation is causing pain to people, and interest rates, interest rates when they are 3.35%, compared with where they were placing pressure on families, just as the leader of the opposition’s watch they were 6.75%, 6.75% compared with 3.35% But those opposite who come this chamber decide their tactics, the manager of opposition business, who asked this question is in charge of the tactics in this place. And they come in and they voted against every piece of legislation that would make a difference to people. It would make a difference. They vote against housing package. They vote against the national reconstruction fund. They vote against energy price relief, a vote against industrial relations changes which are aimed at lifting wages. They vote against every initiative that is put forward. But this afternoon... don’t be alarmed if the oxygen masks drop from above, it is because the member for Bradfield is speaking. Back in Queensland and police deputy commissioner, Tracy Linford, says the attack was the first of its kind in Australia, likening it to the Waco massacre in the US in 1993. The Trains’ belief system, she says, is based on the theory that “Christ will return to the Earth for a thousand days, but it will be preceded by an era, or a period of time of tribulation and widespread destruction and suffering.” Linford says the Covid pandemic, climate crisis, global conflict and social disparity had seen them spiral into increasingly radical theological beliefs. Clare O’Neil takes a dixer on national security The minister for home affairs is able to repeat her message from earlier in the week: It’s no secret that we face enormously difficult geopolitical challenges, in fact the most difficult our country has faced since the Second World War and how we manage those challenges as a parliament will define the Australia my children enjoy as adults. Our ability to shape the nation’s future is depending on how free and fair our democracy is and how Australians engage with it, the stronger our democracy the more choices we have on how our future look. The Member for Adelaide asked about the biggest challenge to Australia, the threat of foreign interference. Countries can quite legitimately influence what happens in other countries in legitimate ways, we do it with our embassies, but we will not tolerate attempts to engage in our policies or interfere with our communities in ways that are coercive, corrupt being, deceitful or clandestine. We will not tolerate attempts by foreign powers to harass, watch and coerce Australian citizens. Foreign interference is real. It is relentless and it is happening in all of our communities every day and our Government stepping up efforts to fight. Earlier this week I spoke publicly for the first time about how one country, Iran is attempting to influence Australian democracy in deceptive ways and trying to harass, watch and control the activities of Iranian Australians. Earlier this week I held a roundtable with other ministers and community leaders to talk about how we can work together on these problems. Asio is very focused on these issues, I shared on Monday some detail about a plot that was foiled recently by our security agencies with an Iranian Australian family were put under surveillance by the Iranian government, in their own home, in our country. And my message to regimes seeking to interfere with Australia and Australians is - don’t. We are watching you and we will catch you. To tackle this problem somethings will need to change. Speaker, I really hope we will have bipartisan support for these initiatives, I’m getting some backchat here and I’m not sure why that would be the case because these are serious problems we are only going to be able to tackle that we work together across the aisle as one country. The independent MP for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie has a question for Tony Burke: The National Library of Australia’s online platform provides all of the world’s largest digital archives of local history, but its funding is set to expire in June. This news is causing concern among historians, family researchers and students. Will the government commit to funding Trove beyond June, keeping its status free for all Australians? Burke: I thank the member for Mayo for the question. She is among many members raising this issue with me. I’m not in a position to announce a decision going through the budget process at the moment in terms of Trove allow me to say this first of all: Trove is something when we were last in government we were committed to with the funding. That funding was stripped away when we lost office. When the previous government recommitted funding to Trove, the funding was time-limited and that is why we are confronting an expiry date of 30 June this year. To those not familiar with Trove, this is how what is available on our collecting institutions becomes available to the whole of Australia. A whole lot of people whether searching family history or academics, are able to get access to what’s in our collections even if it is not on display, and can find out a good deal not just of Australia’s story but of their own personal story in the background of their own areas. The government is very much aware of the significance of Trove, you will not find us showing a lack of commitment to it, if I can put it in those terms, but decisions on exact funding profiles are made in the current budget process and I’m looking forward to being able to provide more to the House as those decisions progress. Breaking in to question time for a moment: Queensland police have announced last year’s fatal shooting of two officers and a neighbour on a remote property was an act of terrorism. Speaking at a press conference in Brisbane, deputy commissioner Tracy Linford said the conclusion was reached after detectives examined a diary, text messages and social media postings by three members of the Train family who died in a shootout with police. Our assessment has concluded that Nathaniel, Gareth and Stacey Train acted as an autonomous cell and executed a religiously motivated terrorist attack. The Train family members subscribed to what we would call a broad Christian fundamentalist belief system, known as premillennialism. It’s a belief system that comes from Christian theology.” The shadow home affairs minister Karen Andrews has the next question and is backed to being INCENSED The last time Labor dismantled the Coalition’s strong border protection policies over 800 boats arrived and tragically 1200 people died at sea. Now it has been revealed that the Australian Navy has had to divert resources to provide assertive extra patrols in anticipation of an increase in illegal boat arrivals. Doesn’t this prove that Labor’s policies to end the deterrent of temporary protection visas provides an incentive to people smugglers to restart their evil trade? Anthony Albanese: I thank the member for her question. The government is fully committed to Operation Sovereign Borders, we have made that very clear, and.. this government will be tough on borders without being weak on humanity. And that is the position that we took to the election, and that is the position that we are implementing. It might seem obscure to those opposite, the idea of a government implementing the policies that they took to an election, but that is precisely what we are doing. And when when the secretary of the Department of Home Affairs was asked about whether the department advised against the changes has announced today, he announced as crisply as he could in one word... ‘No’. …but I am asked by the member opposite about the potential for boats attempting to get here. I seem to remember millions of Australians getting a text message on election day, but when we were the government, when they were the government. Getting a text message... It is true that perhaps the minister wasn’t the one who authorised it, perhaps the other minister for home affairs was the one who authorised it. One of the most disgraceful, manipulations that we have seen in Australian politics on your watch. The Liberal MP for Flinders, Zoe McKenzie, has a question for the PM: My question is to the prime minister. According to KPMG analysis, Australians will face a $16,500 increase in mortgage repayments this year following eight consecutive interest rate rises on the government’s watch. Where are the cheaper mortgages the prime minister promised to deliver, and why do families always pay more under Labor? Anthony Albanese: I am asked about our shared equity scheme that we announced during the election campaign. I have got... I do say that the New South Wales treasurer had this to say when they of course announced their own shared equity scheme. Thousands register for shared equity homebuyer helper ahead of launch the treasurer said this ‘I understand the federal Liberal party opposed prime minister Albanese’s scheme but I think it makes sense. He was then asked if they can change their term, if they can come to their senses, and he said this... They will see the light. I think it makes sense.’ Turn the light on.” Angus Taylor has a question for … the prime minister. (The usual he-didn’t-ask-the-treasurer groans sound.) In the job figures today we see the dangerous combination of stubbornly high inflation and job losses. Labor’s only answer is to spend more money when history tells us this is exactly the wrong approach. Why does Labor always get the big economic calls wrong? Anthony Albanese: It is [a] very broad [question], Mr Speaker. Every day the treasurer sits there and he expects a question and it just never happens. But maybe when we get back that will happen. I live in hope. Well of course, it was an increase in the unemployment rate to 3.7%, up from 3.5%. I do note that that is still lower than the unemployment rate that we inherited when we came to office. I do note also that there were more jobs created on our watch in our first six months than in any government in history … I’m asked as well about debt, from the mob that left us $1tn of debt. We have nothing to show for it! And then you have our programs, like the national reconstruction fund which is supported by industry, which is supported by workers, which will be a great example of new industry policy creating new industries, particularly in the regions, allowing us to deal with the constraints that are there in supply chains, but those opposite are opposing it. And then you have the safeguard mechanism where, once again, they are just opposing it. Well, this is what the chief executive of Ai Group Manufacturers said today: A form of political extremism is at play here. It has cost us before and it could cost us again. That is what the Australian Industry Group have had to say. Andrew McCullough, again, not an affiliate. This is not the time for another [climate war] or once again, being negative. For the sake of certainty and the achievement of our emissions reduction goals, the safeguard mechanism must pass parliament. Past failure to deal with this reality has crept certainty for industry and investors and lift our energy set in disarray. I wonder who the energy minister was? Australian businesses and households are now paying the price. Indeed they are. Plibersek says best thing Greens can do for emissions reduction is to back the safeguard mechanism Max Chandler-Mather gets the first crossbench question, but he doesn’t get to hear the whole answer from Tanya Plibersek, as he is thrown out for abusing a point of order (not that it matters, because he has heard this answer many, many times before): Q: The Greens have offered to pass your government’s climate legislation in full with one amendment, no new coal and gas mines. There is no ultimatum, just an offer to pass the bill this afternoon if you stop opening coal and gas mines but this morning you said on Sky TV “of course” you would approve new coal mines. Are you seriously willing to dump your whole climate plan because Labor wants to open new coal and gas mines? Plibersek: I really want to thank the member for his question. And I can tell you that I am so very delighted to have a question from the Greens about practical action on climate change and the environment. We are the only government that has a plan to bring down emissions in Australia, an emissions reduction target of 43% by 2030 with a clear path to net zero by 2050 enshrined in law. And I would like to see you back that, because what happened when you lined up with the Liberals last time to block the carbon pollution reduction scheme … What we saw was more emissions for longer because you voted with them. (DRINK! – Amy) I am proud of what we are doing on this side to bring down carbon pollution. It’s not just the safeguard mechanism, it’s the $20bn for rewiring the nation so we can get more renewables into our electricity grid. It’s the legislation I took through this parliament on reducing ozone-depleting gases, it’s the methane pledge, it’s the $3bn in the national reconstruction fund to... Chandler-Mather rises on a point of order, but as he does, Dick rules that Plibersek is being relevant. Chandler-Mather: Mr Speaker, I understand that reasoning but on relevance... Dick: I want to be clear with everyone – my rulings and respect for standing orders applies to everywhere, everyone, no matter where you sit in this chamber. I was specifically told the member for Griffith that the minister was being relevant. He has abused the standing orders and he will leave the chamber under 94(a). Plibersek: Thank you. Thank you Mr Speaker and I’d like to say to the Greens that the best thing they can do to see emissions reductions in this country is to back the safeguard mechanism. This is a legislated path that sees us reducing emissions by 43% by 2030 on a credible path to net zero but I would add that what I would also like to see from the Greens’ political party is their support for our environmental ;aw reform when it comes before this parliament, because those environmental laws will see faster, clearer decision-making for business and much stronger protections for our environment because we know … we have to protect our environment. We have to do better at protecting what is precious, we have to do better at repairing what is damaged and we have to do better at managing our natural environment for the future. So back us on the safeguard mechanism, back us on the national reconstruction fund, back us on housing affordability and back us on our environmental law reform. Liberal attack lines on cost of living continue That seemed like a very long three minutes, but Sussan Ley just got her latest question in: One month before the election, the prime minister promised he would deliver on reducing cost-of-living pressures or Australian families because he had a plan. Because of Labor’s policies, interest rates are rising higher than they otherwise would and Australian families are paying an extra $18,000 a year on a typical mortgage. The prime minister is failing Australians because he doesn’t have a plan. Why do Australian families always pay more under Labor? Anthony Albanese: Thank you. The governor of the Reserve Bank has made a number of appearances this week, and one of the things that he has said is that our policies are taking pressure off inflation. He has indicated that monetary policy is working hand-in-hand with fiscal policy. That is what he has said. And, indeed, what we are seeing is the measures that we have put in place making a difference. This is what the Origin statement to the Australian Stock Exchange declared today … the announcement in December 2022 by the federal government of price gas and coal is in response to global and domestic shocks. But more recently we have seen prices decline. That is what Origin have said. Dr Steven Kennedy of the Treasury, [who] has served both the former government and the current government with distinction, said this. Following the December announcement, national illiteracy rises have declined significantly. Lower futures prices will be reflected in the default market offer announced by the regulator around the middle of the year. Over the year, two June 2024. Treasury expects the coal and gas caps to reduce inflation by half a point. That is what they had to say. But not everyone supports... Sussan Ley: Point of order on tedious repetition. Tony Burke: That standing order applies to debate. If it applied to questions, none of her questions would be in order. (There is laughter at that) Milton Dick rules that it just manages to be a relevant point of order. Albanese: Those opposite oppose every action in which we put forward to try to reduce inflationary pressure and to deal with the challenges which arise from, at a time when we have acknowledged the struggle that is going on, of the people of Ukraine. The Ukrainian war unfortunately [is] having an impact on global prices. They are feeding into inflation globally. That is just a fact. But those opposite oppose price caps, they oppose the safeguard mechanism legislation, they oppose [the] housing Australia future fund, they oppose the national reconstruction fund, they oppose this increase in the wages for the lowest-paid workers in Australia. What is it? What is it about the last election where they didn’t get the memo? People are over conflict fatigue. We want to look for solutions and a positive agenda, and all those opposite, having created the problem is, they now stand in the way of all of the solutions. Ed Husic has fun with a dixer but is made to withdraw after this bit: The biggest threat we have got happens in the Coalition party room, which I am genuinely concerned is a massive hypnosis event where they bring in the RSL entertainment and the person says, when I click on my fingers, you will forget 10 years ... I’m more surprised Husic didn’t make reference to Biggie. Peter Dutton starts off with the current economic situation, ending with “why does everything cost more under Labor”. Anthony Albanese: Australians are paying the price for a decade of Liberal and National governments. No economic plan, they had 22 energy policies and didn’t land one. The leader of the opposition raises a number of issues. On wages, he says they are not rising fast enough. But he was a part of a government that [saw] low wages as part of their economic architecture. It wasn’t bad luck, it was bad policy. Bad policy. And then … just after, on the day that they voted against the housing Australia future fund, [he spoke] about housing. Well, we have a plan to deal with housing, we have legislation, which includes the $10bn housing Australia future fund that includes specific programs for veterans, specific programs for women and children escaping domestic violence, and they voted against it. And if you look at the comments of the Reserve Bank governor, he has spoken very clearly about supply chain issues and pressures as being a major cause of inflation in this country, and yet they have indicated they are going to vote against a national reconstruction fund. A program that will assist business going forward. Now, we on this side will stand up for Australian jobs and we’ll stand up for Australian families, which is why we have a plan that came in on 1 January that is already making a difference for cheaper medicines. The first decrease in the price of medicines in 75 years since, once again, a former Labor government, only Labor governments do the big reforms, introduced the PBS. And then we have cheaper childcare comes in on the 1 July, we have got fee-free Tafe, 180,000 places in areas of skills shortage, taking the pressure off the cost [of living], but also at the same time, helping to fill those skills shortages and those supply chain issues. We have our energy price relief plan where they came in here and they voted against $1.5bn of support ... $1.5bn. The truth is that those opposite just say no to everything. They used to be the Coalition, now they are just the no-alition. They say no to absolutely everything. Into question time! It’s the last one, so let’s goooooo! Royal commission into robodebt extended to 30 June The royal commission into robodebt is being extended, after a request from the commissioner: The governor general, His Excellency General the Honourable David Hurley AC DSC (Retd), has amended the Letters Patent to extend the royal commission into the robodebt scheme. Royal commissioner Catherine Holmes AC SC advised the government that a short extension was needed and the government has agreed. The royal commission will now deliver its report on 30 June 2023. The royal commission has been examining, among other things: The establishment, design and implementation of the robodebt scheme, who was responsible for it, why they considered it necessary, and any concerns raised regarding legality and fairness, The handling of concerns raised about the robodebt scheme, including adverse decisions made by the administrative appeals tribunal, The outcomes of the robodebt scheme, including the harm to vulnerable individuals and the total financial cost to government, and Measures needed to prevent similar failures in public administration. The government acknowledges the considerable work of commissioner Holmes and her team to date and looks forward to receiving the royal commission’s final report. Further information on the royal commission, including the terms of reference, is available at https://robodebt.royalcommission.gov.au/ Crossbench meets with voice referendum working group Nearly the entire House crossbench is currently meeting with the voice referendum working group, in a bid to boost cross-party support for the vote. But the Indigenous leader Pat Anderson warned the meeting that negative campaigning on the referendum is “getting ugly now and will get worse”. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, will join the meeting later today, his second meeting with the group, where he’s expected to get a chance to ask some of the questions he’s been calling for detail on. The meeting, chaired by Linda Burney and featuring Indigenous leaders like Megan Davis and Pat Turner, was joined today by a clutch of crossbenchers including Allegra Spender, Andrew Wilkie, Helen Haines, Dai Le, Kylea Tink, Zoe Daniel and Monique Ryan. In the opening remarks, which were open to media, Anderson – the co-chair of the Uluru statement – backed the support of the crossbench. “We’re going to need all the friends we can possibly get. This is getting ugly now and it’ll get worse. Hang in there and hold the line,” she told the crossbenchers. Spender, who this week was among a cross-party group of co-chairs to launch a support group for the Uluru statement, said many people in her community were “passionately in support of” the voice concept. She called it a “unique moment” in Australia’s history and pledged the support of those crossbenchers to the campaign. An “unprecedented” collapse in the number of new homes on the market, especially in Sydney and Melbourne, is outpacing even the shaky listing rates recorded during pandemic lockdowns, Domain Holdings chief executive Jason Pellegrino said on Thursday. The falls are weighing on the real estate company, which reported a drop in net profit of almost 38.9% to $15.9m in the six months to December. While revenue increased across the various business units of the listed company, which is 60% owned by publisher Nine, its residential division was down and business costs were up sharply, dragging down the overall result. Shares in Domain rose in trading on Thursday as the result was stronger than previously forecast. Pellegrino said the scale of listings declines during the last three months of 2022 eclipsed pullbacks recorded during the pandemic and the banking royal commission, which scrutinised lending practices. It is telling that the scale of the listings declines during the latest December quarter eclipsed both those events, with Sydney and Melbourne recording listings declines double the market average. Despite this challenging market environment, we remain optimistic about the longer-term prospects for the market with upsides from the return of immigration, encouraging auction clearance rates and the increasing attraction to investors of rising rental yields. Foreign affairs roundup from Senate estimates A few points other points highlighting from the pre-lunch session of foreign affairs Senate estimates: 1. Diplomatic footprint under review The Dfat secretary, Jan Adams, refused to rule out cutting back Australia’s diplomatic representation in some countries as a result of an internal review that still remains private: I don’t think we’re going to be ruling in or out anything. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, added that it was normal for a new government to “make sure we are optimised” and spending scarce money in a way that provides the “best return on investment for the country”. 2. Rudd to advance ‘the policy of the Australian government’ There were some fireworks when the Coalition’s Simon Birmingham asked when the appointment of Kevin Rudd as ambassador to the US went from “complete nonsense” as Anthony Albanese said prior to the election to “complete truth” now. Birmingham also asked Wong: When did the prime minister tell you, minister? Wong said she did not discuss conversations with colleagues but said “I think technically it’s my decision.” Wong said consultation with the prime minister “particularly in relation to very senior appointments is par for the course”. Wong also tried to brush away Albanese’s pre-election comments by asking Birmingham: When did the deputy prime minister stop being a Manchurian candidate? That may be the easiest response. Asked about Rudd’s previous criticism of the Aukus deal, Wong said the former prime minister “will advance the Australian interest and the policy of the Australian government”. 3. Nuclear weapon ban treaty Officials were tight-lipped on the timing of any decision on Australia’s position on the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The Labor party platform include a position to sign and ratify the treaty, but subject to a number of conditions including working for universality and an effective verification regime. Jeff Robinson, an assistant secretary for disarmament issues, said there was not a formal “review” but said agencies “in anticipation of being asked to provided formal advice have been looking afresh at Australia’s position, particularly in regard to those conditions”. But he added it was up to the government to decide on a process and timing for any such review. Wong added: Universality and verification - in a world where you have nuclear weapons - is central to making steps to lessen the number and hopefully reduce and remove nuclear weapons from the globe. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has raised concerns about Israel’s decision to authorise nine settlements in the occupied West Bank, declaring that “settlements are an obstacle to peace”. In response to questions from the Greens senator Jordon Steele-John, Wong also expressed support for a statement issued by France, Germany, Italy, the US and the UK that criticised the settlement plans. Marc Innes-Brown, a first assistant secretary at Dfat, began by saying Australia was “closely monitoring the situation in areas in the West Bank and elsewhere. It’s quite a tense situation”. He told Senate estimates: Generally we are concerned about the overall situation, Senator. And we have registered our concerns with both the Israeli government and also the Palestinian authority about the increase in tensions in the area. Steele-John: Minister, are you concerned about Israel’s decision to push ahead with the construction of mass settlements across the green line against international law? Wong: Yes – I mean, we do not support unilateral actions which reduce the prospects of a just two-state solution. Settlements, I’ve said in here previously, I think other ministers have said – settlements are an obstacle to peace. I note that the foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy, the US and the UK issued a statement two days ago ... which stated that the ministers were deeply troubled by the Israeli government’s announcement that it is advancing nearly 10,000 settlement units and intends to begin a process to normalise now nine outposts previously deemed illegal ... I would like to associate Australia with the joint statement made by those members of the G7 and I understand that Australia’s views were communicated to Israeli counterparts. Pressed on when those representations were made, Innes-Brown said Australian ambassador Ralph King “took up this issue” with the Israeli foreign ministry on 13 February. Asked by Steele-John whether the Australian government had made representations to the Israeli government condemning violence against Palestinians, Innes-Brown said: We’re concerned about the escalating violence in the West Bank and also in Israel – there have been terrorist attacks in Israel during this period. And we have taken the issues up including very recently both in Israel and via the Israeli embassy here in Canberra both to the ambassador and the deputy head of mission. Innes-Brown also confirmed that Australia had raised in November the case of Mohammad el Halabi, the former Gaza director for World Vision International, who is appealing his conviction: We have raised his case, including his appeal, noted our ongoing interest in the case and also raised our hope that the appeal process be conducted expeditiously. 33 health practitioners face action for Covid-related issues There are 33 health practitioners in Australia currently subject to compliance actions from the healthcare watchdog for Covid-19 related issues including spreading misinformation about the pandemic, Senate estimates has been told. The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency’s (Ahpra) chief executive, Martin Fletcher, told Senate estimates 16 of those individuals were facing action due to making claims about a “fake pandemic”, claims about government-led mind control, other false claims about the vaccine and for issuing fake vaccination certificates or exemptions. In some cases practitioners were suspended from practice, while others can only work under supervision. Amy’s analysis on stagflation claims Stagflation is when you have high inflation and high unemployment. Inflation is high, yes, but there are expectations that it has peaked. That doesn’t mean that the pain is all over – it takes time for inflation effects to flow through the economy and it will take some time for inflation to drop back down to the RBA’s target rate of 2-3%. Unemployment though, is at historic low levels. 3.5% to 3.7% is an uptick, but it is still lower than before the pandemic. The RBA is talking about a full employment rate of 4.5%. Full employment as defined by monetary policy issues aside, 4.5% is still considered a low unemployment rate (despite the harm it causes to those caught within it). I don’t think there is anyone seriously suggesting Australia is heading towards stagflation just yet. Liberals warn of stagflation as unemployment rate jumps Michaelia Cash and Angus Taylor are holding a press conference on the unemployment rate. But it is mostly about how terrible it thinks the government’s economic plan is. Taylor: Today we saw ominous signs in the jobs data, the early signs of a very dangerous combination. Stubbornly persistent inflation alongside job losses … the last time we saw an extreme version of this, known as stagflation – stubbornly persistent inflation alongside job losses and unemployment – was back in 1975 under the Whitlam government. We know from history just how dangerous this combination is. We also know what governments should and shouldn’t do, and top of that priority is to avoid borrowing more money. Just this week we have seen Labor crowing about borrowing an extra $45bn at a time of stubbornly persistent inflation and [the] real risks of stagflation emerging, as we have seen in the data today. Question time looms … The last question time of this first two weeks of sittings is less than half an hour away. There is a lot to talk about, but also expect to hear dixers that could be a press release and questions about energy prices from the people who voted against market intervention. So there we have it – the tools used to combat high inflation, in this case, nine consecutive interest rate rises, also mean higher unemployment. And that means people pay the price in more ways than one. ‘We expect it to be difficult for a little while longer’ And then the final question: Q: The RBA is forecasting the economy to grow in line with population growth in the next two years at about 1.6% so no real per capita growth in the economy. The figures show today two consecutive months of a fall in total employment. The ABS’s retail figures showed a fall in the amount of spending and consumption over the last three month. The HIA figures today point to a real downturn in housing. Are you getting worried that the economic canary is looking a bit sick? (That is from the Nine newspapers’ Shane Wright, who is maybe also the best baker in the gallery as well. The more you know.) Jim Chalmers: I think any treasurer is worried about the prospect of a slowing economy, and I am of course. When the economy slows, when the unemployment rate picks up even if it still remains at or near historic lows, there are human consequences for that, just as there are human consequences for the decisions that the Reserve Bank takes and so obviously as we enter what we expect will be a really difficult year for the economy and for our people, clearly the prospects for a slowing economy and high inflation than we would like for longer than we would like – obviously that is a turn. But obviously we have the ability had to put in place the right economic plan which invests in growth and fixes our supply chains and gets that wages growth at the same time as we get on top of the inflation challenge and I remain optimistic about the future of our economy, in the future of our country, but as I have said for some time now, others have said for some time now, we expect it to be difficult for a little while longer. Our job is to make life easier for people where we can and to also make sure that we are putting in place the right economic plan to deal with these pressures in our economy in the medium term as well and that is what we are doing. ‘Sometimes that is a difficult balance to strike’ Q: Given that at least half of Australia’s inflation outbreak is supply driven, are you at all worried about the prospect that unemployment will increase as expected but high inflation will be entrenched? Jim Chalmers: I’m certainly concerned that we will have inflation in our economy which is higher than we would like for longer than we would like and even as the unemployment rate most likely ticks up a bit more, obviously that is a concern for us and the balance that we have to strike as a government is not dissimilar to the balance that the Reserve Bank has to strike, which is getting on top of this inflation challenge while being cognisant of the fact that our economy is expected to slow considerably throughout the course of this year, as a consequence of those high interest rates and the slowing global economy as well. We have to rebalance all of those considerations up. Sometimes that is a difficult balance to strike at but I am confident we have got the right plan. ‘Haven’t changed our position’ on stage-three tax cuts And then we get a question on the stage-three tax cuts, which are legislated to begin from mid next year. Q: The RBA has inflation staying above the top of its target until mid2025. The stage-three tax cuts pick up in mid-24. Presumably they are going to add to some aggregate demand in the economy. Is that the right time to be bringing those tax cuts in even the RBA inflation forecast? Jim Chalmers: As you know we haven’t changed our position on those tax cuts. In every budget we consider the conditions at the time and our expectations for the economy but our priorities lay elsewhere in some of the things they have been talking about. ‘We won’t be messing with the independence of the Reserve Bank’ Why doesn’t Jim Chalmers talk to RBA governor Philip Lowe about interest rates? Chalmers: I’m so pleased you asked me about that, because I thought what Governor Lowe said yesterday was a really important affirmation of the appropriate role between the government and the Reserve Bank. Governor Lowe and I talk frequently about the economy. We talk frequently about the bank itself. We spoke last night, for example. We speak frequently. And the point that Governor Lowe was making, which I agree with 100%, is that I don’t ring up the Reserve Bank governor on the morning of the board meeting and say this is the outcome that the government want. What I’m saying is, we do talk about the pressures on the economy, these steps that the government is taking and the steps that the Reserve Bank is taking, but when I’d look at what Governor Lowe said yesterday about this, he said there is no pressure from the Treasury, he said we talk about the economy, not just this treasurer but treasurers before him. They don’t give me views about what interest rates should or shouldn’t do and that’s because we respect and cherish the independence of the Reserve Bank. And one demonstration of that is by no that no matter what the Reserve Bank review says when I received it on the 31 March, we won’t be messing with the independence of the Reserve Bank, it is an important feature of our system. ‘Making good progress on most recommendations of jobs and skills summit’ Q: Last night’s Senate estimates heard that up to 36 action items out of the jobs and skills summit, 16 haven’t been implemented. What is the holdup there and when do you expect the full 36 to be implemented? Jim Chalmers: I didn’t see that evidence last night but if those numbers are correct then that sounds like we are making good progress on most of the recommendations of the jobs and skills summit. And not all of them were recommendations for immediate effect. Some of them involved further work, some of them crossed multiple levels of government. I thought the jobs and skills summit that was promised and I hosted here last year was an important demonstration of our willingness to bring people together around some of our big economic challenges and I was absolutely delighted with the spirit in the room and the work that has been happening since the jobs and skills summit. We said at the time that we would implement what we could as fast as we could and that some issues would be matters for considering in subsequent budgets and that is the approach that we have taken. No decision on whether Philip Lowe will keep helming RBA Q: Would you like to see Philip Lowe remain as governor beyond September? Jim Chalmers: As I have said before, the decision that the government takes on Governor Lowe’s reappointment or otherwise will be made closer to the middle of the year and the reason for that is that I want to see what the Reserve Bank review says about the structure and processes and objectives of the Reserve Bank going forward and I want to make sure that whoever we appoint governor has the ability to put in place the directions that we agree after having received the report. I think you all know and we have talked about it in this room a number of times: I have a good respectful relationship with Governor Lowe. He has a hard job to do, which is to try and get on top of this inflation challenge without crunching the economy and we have a hard job to do in the government as well, which is to provide that relief and repair those supply chains and show that restraint in the budget so my time is best spent focusing on my job, which is to focus on those things. I have said repeatedly and I mean it, the government hasn’t taken a decision when it comes to Governor Lowe’s position. We will genuinely consult on that with my cabinet colleagues, with the prime minister and others and resolve that closer to the middle of the year. ‘Coalition’s pigheaded approach has dealt the Greens into the game’ Does unemployment have to rise in order to tackle inflation and what would be the economic consequences of what the Greens want in return for its support on government bills (safeguards, housing fund) in the Senate: Jim Chalmers: First of all I think it is broadly accepted that the interest rate rises which are in the system are about taking some of the heat out of the economy and that has consequences for the unemployment rate. I suspect we are seeing the beginning of that in the number that is released today. Our job, our objective, our aspiration, is to try and grow the economy as fast as we can with unemployment as low as it can be without adding to these inflationary pressures and obviously there is a relationship between all of those object is in the economy. Now, when it comes to the various pieces of legislation before the parliament, what the Coalition’s pigheaded approach has done is it has dealt the Greens into the game. When the Coalition takes the absurd decision to oppose, for example, the safeguard mechanism that they designed and supported nine months ago, then that makes the Greens more relevant than they would otherwise be. One of the implications of the obstructionism that we see from the opposition is that it makes the Greens relevant. At the same time it is effectively a vote for higher inflation for even longer. And so they should reflect on that. When it comes to the safeguard mechanism, for example, the business community is crying out for certainty so that they can invest. And these characters in the opposition wandering around pretending to be the party of business. The business community right across the board, or the peak organisations, they want to see this past. They want the stability, they want the certainty, they know that the safeguard mechanism is the best way to make sure that our economy is increasingly powered by cleaner and cheaper energy, at the same time as we don’t damage the competitiveness of our industries. That is agreed broadly across the business community. And the opposition turning their back on that makes the Greens more influential than they would otherwise be. ‘The May budget won’t be identical to the October budget’ Why does Jim Chalmers think a neutral budget position (in terms of its impact on inflation) is better than a contractionary budget position? Chalmers: Where we are committing public funds, that has an economic dividend, not every dollar that you spend in the budget is inflationary. A lot of the investment we have been making – in early childhood or fixing supply chains or or because of other ways – are about expanding the capacity of the economy so it can grow faster without adding to this inflation. And so, as I think I might’ve said to you on the weekend, to David [Speers] or on other occasions, the magnitude of the spending matters but so does the nature of the spending and what you actually investing in. Whether it’s the IMF or others, they know that our plans to deal with labour shortages in our workforce, our plans to make early childhood education cheaper and some of the other things we are doing – our important investments in growing the economy without adding to inflation and also, we need to recognise that the May budget will be delivered in circumstances which are little bit different to October, when the inflation peak was ahead of us. In May, we hope that the inflation peak is behind us. We are entering what we expect to be much slower economic growth as a consequence of these rate rises and global conditions and so, we need to weigh all of that up. The May budget won’t be identical to the October budget. It will have some of the same guiding principles but every budget has to factor in the economy as it is evolving and that’s what we will do. ‘Our plan to build more affordable homes’ How would you achieve the housing goals and improve housing supply at a time when climate rates are hitting the construction industry? Jim Chalmers: We’ve got a number of indications that the housing market has often become one the obvious consequences of rising interest rates, as you say and as the data commentary around the data this week has said. Our plan to build more affordable homes is one that recognises the pressures on the industry and one of the reasons why I’ve got the building industry together within traditional investors, state governments, local governments is because we want be able to understand from the industry one of the pressures, whether it’s workforce pressure, the cost of building materials, some of the issues around planning and zoning of inland releases. And that intel that we got from the industry go out in our housing policy. We don’t have enough homes in this country. We’ve got vacancy rates incredibly low, rent inflation is much higher than we would like, so we need to build more homes. That’s what the housing Australia future fund is all about. ACCC has ‘important role’ looking into savings accounts interest rates What does the treasurer think about banks who pass on interest rate increases very quickly, but are slow to increase the interest rates on saving accounts? Jim Chalmers: I understand that people are furious when mortgage rates go up and they got much lower or not at all [for saving accounts]. This is the reason why I asked the ACCC to do some work in the space because you want to make sure that banks are doing the right thing here. I think there is a lot of community anger about this. I show people’s concern about … savings interest rates when they’re on the way up and the ACCC has an important role to play looking into it. Inflation challenge because of ‘global conditions and weaknesses in our supply chains’ Given the RBA governor was speaking abut a “central target” of full employment sitting at 4.5% (it is currently 3.7%, up slightly from 3.5%) what does Jim Chalmers think full employment is? Chalmers: I think our expectation for employment have changed over the course of recent years. I think if you would ask most economists, maybe a decade ago or around then, they would have considered full employment to be in the 4 or 5% and I think that the fact that we’ve been able to maintain unemployment rate with the three in front of it is recalibrated people’s expectations. When it comes to the interaction of the labour market and what we expect to see in interest rates, I’m not going to get in the business of predicting or otherwise future movements in interest rates but it’s very clear that we’ve gotten an inflation challenge in our economy because of global conditions, because of weaknesses in our supply chains. And what I mean by that is this inflation threat that we have in our economy is not because of workers doing the wrong thing or too much wages growth or anything like that. We’ve had stagnant wages growth in the best part of the decade so we know what the cause of this inflation challenge are. I think the experience of the last couple of years has taught us a lot about our expectations for full employment. [It] is one of the reasons why I’ll be releasing with my colleagues the employment white paper later this year. It’s because I think we do have a lot to learn from the last couple of years about the nature of our labour market and where the opportunities lie. We want to learn those lessons and want to set aside for the future. ‘We’ve still got unemployment with a three in front of it’ To the questions. Would the treasurer expect rising unemployment to slow interest rate rises? Jim Chalmers: Obviously, the Reserve Bank board will factor this into the decisions that they take in subsequent months, but in terms of expectations, I been saying for some time in this room and another occasions that we expect unemployment to take up a little bit but we need to remember that the unemployment rate is still near historic lows and so we need a bit of perspective when it comes to this number. We’ve got unemployment with the three in front of it. We’ve had an amazing period of six months of new of jobs growth throughout the course of last year and that’s one of the things that we have going for us. Despite all of the difficulties in thrown at us from around the world and despite these rate rises, we’ve still got unemployment with a three in front of it and I think it’s important to remember, we will impose, we will hear than here and then here. Chalmers acknowledges families of two missing Queensland miners The treasurer, who is a Queensland MP, also takes a moment to acknowledge what the families of two missing mine workers in Cloncurry are going through, as well as the community at large: Our hearts go out to the families and the workers and the community in north-west Queensland. As they seek to locate these two miners that have gone missing, Dylan and Trevor, I know that this will be a really difficult time and I know that that is a wonderful town, really terrific part of Australia. Really wonderful community. I know they will be doing a tough right now as the search continues and our hearts go out to them. Opposition ‘voting for even higher inflation for even longer’ Jim Chalmers then uses the last third of his opening statement to this press conference to give the opposition a serve: We already saw the end of last year, the opposition vote against a bit of relief for families and pensioners and small businesses, when it comes to their energy bills. They have learned absolutely nothing from their diabolical decisions that they took in December and now, they are shaping up to oppose us on safeguards, housing fund, the national reconstruction fund fund as well. And I think we do need to shine a light on the fact that in voting against manufacturing jobs, [boosting] a supply chain, voting against more affordable jobs, the opposition is voting for even higher inflation for even longer. That is the inescapable conclusion from the way that the opposition is playing politics with the government’s economic plan. Inflation ‘the biggest threat to our economy’ On inflation, Jim Chalmers says: Inflation is the biggest threat to our economy and dealing with it is the government’s highest priority. And we’ve made that clear on multiple occasions and our three-point plan, as you know, is relief, repair and restrain. Cost-of-living relief where we can do that without adding to inflation. Repair our supply chains, including our workforce, because broken supply chains and labour shortages have been a big part of the story. As the governor said, when it comes to inflation in our economy and spending restraint as well in responsible budget, we saw a lot of that in October. These three things relief, repair and restrain are the guiding features of the budget in October and there will be the guiding features of the budget in May as well. That’s because it’s the right strategy in an economy where inflation is expected to have peaked but will be higher than would like for longer than would like. The government strategy is the right one. And this was a point made yesterday by [RBA] governor [Philip] Lowe, presenting his evidence and taking questions here in front of the parliamentary committee. The treasurer is in the blue room (the second fanciest press conference location, after the prime minister’s courtyard) for his first Canberra press conference in a while. He is addressing the “uptick in the unemployment rate” from 3.5% to 3.7% and says it is what the government had expected. The unemployment rate today was a bit softer than it has been but it is still around historic lows. It moderated today but coming on the back of what was the fastest jobs growth of the first six months for a new government on record so we started from very strong foundation and very strong base when it comes to job creation in the first six months of this government and it’s come off a little bit when we’re talking about January this year. The outcome today was completely consistent with what the budget anticipated in October and also what my predecessor’s budget anticipated in March as well. We have been expecting an uptick in the unemployment rate as the economy slows a bit as the obvious consequence of a slow global economy mixed with the impact of interest rate rises here in our own economy. This is the expected outcome, expect the consequence of global turbulence and rising interest rates playing out in our economy. And our current expectation, expectation of the Treasury and the Reserve Bank is that our economy will slow a bit more and unemployment will take up a bit more in the coming months. Bob Katter is claiming a (temporary) win, after Westpac told his office it would hit pause on its plan to shut some regional branches of its banks, while a senate inquiry into bank closures is carried out. We’re deeply appreciative that we, the KAP, have achieved a pause,” Mr Katter said. There’s real danger for the major banks with the KAP’s determination to proceed with the postal bank, following the courageous initiative taken by Christine Holgate, who was sacked by the Liberal-Nationals when she was trying to do this. Whilst this is a small battle in a big war, we thank Westpac for its concisions.” ‘Economy may be beginning to finally buckle’, says economist Economists are sharpening their quills and are paring their forecasts about how soon and how high the RBA will need to go with its cash rate given the softish jobs numbers for January. David Bassanese, economist with BetaShares (and a former journalist), reckons the labour figures along with weak retail sales and a slump in consumer confidence suggest “the economy may be beginning to finally buckle under the weight of interest rate increases”. As such, it suggests the RBA may not need to raise rates too aggressively in coming months. He is sticking with his prediction the RBA will lift its cash rate in March and April, bringing it to 3.85%, before pausing. (That’s the peak rate for ANZ, Westpac and CBA, while NAB this week lifted their estimate to 4.1%.) However, Sean Langcake, head of macroeconomic forecasting for BIS Oxford Economics, is more circumspect. He notes the ABS’s caution in highlighting that while more people were unemployed in January some of them were expecting to start in a new jobs shortly. This will boost employment and weigh on unemployment in the February data. In other words, the data is not conclusive. “But it is clear the market is tracking sideways, albeit in a very tight position,” he said. We’ll have treasurer Jim Chalmers offering his view shortly. Pathway to consultation on veterans compensation claims Veteran affairs minister Matt Keogh has asked for input into how the department should streamline compensation claims for veterans (and the legislation that goes with it). From his release: The pathway for consultation anticipates: New claims under existing schemes will cease after a transition period, from which point all new veteran claims will be dealt with under an improved Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act (MRCA) as the sole ongoing act. The MRCA currently services the majority of claims. All benefits under existing schemes will continue unaffected, with only new claims or claims relating to deteriorated conditions to instead be covered by the single ongoing act. The consultation process will inform the way forward for government to simplify veterans’ legislation. The Albanese government is committed to a thorough and considered process which will deliver a better future for veterans and their families. More information on the pathway, and an opportunity to provide feedback can be found here. So many reasons to act on renewable energy – including economic competitiveness and the economy, as Peter Hannam reports: Australia’s natural renewable energy advantage in the race to create a green hydrogen industry is at risk of being overwhelmed by ‘huge and aggressive’ policy support in the US and the Middle East, according to Fortescue Future Industries’ Guy Debelle. Debelle, formerly FFI’s chief financial officer and now serving as a director, said the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act was mostly aimed at accelerating decarbonisation and was ‘one of the largest pieces of industrial policy we’ve ever seen’. Without a formal spending cap, it could eventually top US$1tn ($1.44tn). ‘It’s not just money,’ Debelle told a gathering of business economists in Sydney on Wednesday. ‘It’s actually people, it’s expertise and knowhow, which [are] migrating to the US.’ Slowing jobs growth hints at impact of rate rises The ABS’s jobs data combines both seasonally adjusted and trend terms which, among other things, can offer slightly different signals. For instance, in seasonally adjusted terms, the economy shed about 11,000 jobs but in trend terms, it added the same amount. The seasonally adjusted jobless rate was 3.7% (as opposed to 3.5% in December) and 3.5% in trend terms (unchanged for the month). Headline writers will go with 3.7% but the trend numbers are also looked at closely by economists. Trend employment was up 0.1% for the month, with hours up 0.2%. As the ABS’s Bjorn Jarvis says, the underlying trend pointed to a slowdown in growth. The latest monthly increase in trend employment was around half of the monthly average for the 20 years before the pandemic, having been above the average for most of 2022. As noted previously, markets viewed the latest numbers as being on the weak side, implying higher borrowing costs are doing their intended job of lowering demand in the economy. As a result, the RBA may not need to be so twitchy when it comes to lifting its cash rate. The benchmark ASX200 was almost 0.9% higher for the day in recent trade, close to doubling the size of the advance it had made prior to the jobs figures. RBA governor Philip Lowe will no doubt be asked for his view about the jobs market when he fronts a house economics committee tomorrow. Australia ‘doesn’t seek to dominate’ region following Aukus, says Wong Penny Wong has given an insight into the position she puts to south-east Asian and Pacific counterparts when defending Australia’s plans for nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus deal. The foreign minister told a Senate hearing today that Australia “does not seek to dominate” or “impinge on sovereignty – quite the opposite”. She said Australia “does not seek to acquire this capability for anything other than contributing to the peace”. Her defence came in response to a question from the Greens senator Jordon Steele-John, who noted Wong had been active in travelling around the region and asked what feedback she had received from neighbours expressing concern about Aukus. Wong replied: There is no doubt that there were aspects of the previous government’s announcement in relation to the Aukus partnership which I think were not well handled and which enabled narratives which are unhelpful to how it is perceived in the region and we are managing that. It has been a feature of my discussions with many countries in the region. And if I may articulate in summary what I say. I say this is a partnership which reflects a long-standing and deep technical cooperation with the United States and the United Kingdom. Secondly, in relation to submarines it is logical and rational that Australia would seek to replace an ageing capability. And I make the broader point, which is the point that many countries particularly in the Asean region are focused on, Australia does not seek to acquire this capability for anything other than contributing to the peace. We see this as an important part of contributing to a strategic equilibrium, which is the context for a region which is peaceful, stable, prosperous and respectful of sovereignty. That is the way we approach this. Steele-John asked for a list of countries that had raised the Aukus issue. Wong said she would not go into such detail, but added that she was “happy to say in this forum it has been a feature of most if not all of my bilateral and regional engagement”. Wong said it was not the only thing discussed in those talks, but it it was “something I have proactively addressed given some of the issues which have been raised publicly”. Wong said the submarine plans were rational “particularly in a context of a region where we are seeing others substantially grow their military capability”. (That clearly includes China, but she didn’t name China explicitly.) Steele-John focused on the nuclear power and whether nations had raised concerns about “increased nuclearisation and militarisation of the waters of our region”. Wong replied: We don’t accept – and neither do existing international treaties including the NPT [non-proliferation treaty] and the Rarotonga treaty [the South Pacific nuclear-free zone treaty], that nuclear-propelled equals nuclearisation. Australia has, under this government, under previous governments as a matter of how Australian government operates, we have no intention of ever acquiring a nuclear [weapon] capability. Secondly, in terms of militarisation, I’d invite you to consider some of the public discussion about the relative militarisation and investment in military hardware and we are a very minor player in terms of that process. But we all want a peaceful region. We seek to acquire this capability in order to contribute to that. Australia does not seek to dominate, we don’t seek to impinge on sovereignty - quite the opposite. We seek a region - because we are a middle power - where sovereignty is respected. Greens continue to hold firm on blocking new coal and gas projects The Greens have held a press conference, continuing to press on their concerns about blocking new coal and gas projects (the sticking point in the safeguards bill), the national reconstruction fund and the housing bill (which they think doesn’t add enough to housing supply). Leader Adam Bandt said: The government has to explain to the Australian people why it wants more coal and gas mines in the middle of a climate crisis. The Greens have offered to pass the government’s climate legislation tomorrow on one condition: the government stops making the problem worse and stops opening new coal and gas mines. You can’t put the fire out while you’re pouring petrol, on it ... Coal and gas pollution can continue to go up under the government scheme, as long as they buy enough tree-planting permits ... At the moment, the government is simply adopting the untenable position that they want to keep expanding coal and gas ... One project, just one of the over 100 projects that are on the books at the moment, just one of them in the Beetaloo basin could lift Australia’s pollution by up to 11% ... If the Northern Territory gas stations go ahead, we are talking about unleashing 68 years’ worth of Australia’s pollution across the country. These are mega climate bombs that we are trying to stop that Labor wants to open. Bandt suggested the Greens demand could be accommodated in a few ways: specifying that fossil fuel projects can’t be “new entrants” to the safeguard mechanism scheme or by inserting a climate trigger in environmental legislation so greenhouse gas emissions are considered for approvals. Asked if there could be a grand bargain, trading the coal and gas demand for better support for renters and housing supply, Bandt suggested the Greens are currently treating them separately. We’re up for good faith negotiations with the government on the ... the reconstruction fund, their housing legislation and the climate legislation. And we’re having discussions across separate portfolios with the government. Minister’s tribute to Ash Wednesday 40th anniversary Emergency management minister Murray Watt has given a statement on the 40th anniversary of the Ash Wednesday bushfires. The fires, which swept across Victoria and South Australia, were widespread and devastating. They remain one of the most significant emergency events in our nation’s history. As we reflect, our thoughts are with the families and friends of the 75 people who lost their lives. We recognise the impact the fires had on entire communities, with 2,600 homes and buildings destroyed, vast numbers of livestock lost and the devastating environmental impact of 310,000 hectares burned. We thank the thousands of firefighters, volunteers, emergency and ADF personnel who responded to the Ash Wednesday fires, and we remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving to protect their communities. Today will be difficult for all whose lives were impacted by the bushfires. We encourage people to seek the support needed, as we observe this anniversary. After arriving in Australia with nothing, my grandmother lost everything once again when her home in Macedon was lost in the Ash Wednesday fires. But it was what she saw, rather than what she lost, which stayed with her. For those who remember, for those who were lost, for those who are still haunted – we are thinking of you. Top leagues under pressure to protect players from head trauma On Full Story today, inequality reporter Stephanie Convery tells us contact sports bodies like AFL and NRL are under growing pressure to protect their players from concussions and head trauma linked with a neurodegenerative disease called CTE. I do think that this is an existential crisis for sporting organisations and leagues, because it means that the thing that used to be so characteristic of their game may not be the characteristic thing anymore. And that is scary for them. Kathy Strong, whose husband Terry Strong suffered from severe CTE after playing semi-professional rugby for years and died in 2021, says sporting bodies should be responsible for looking after their players in the long term. I think for players, all players – grassroots, elite professionals – there should be some form of insurance, so these players, if it happens to them, there is that support. And not just financial support, but, you know, emotional support, all kinds of support. Jobless rate rise is higher than expected Australia’s jobless rate lifted last month to a seasonally adjusted 3.7%, higher than the 3.5% level expected by economists. The economy added about 11,400 jobs, 9,200 of them full time. That too was worse than predicted, with forecasts eyeing a 20,000 net gain. Labour market numbers can jump around a bit, including if the participation level moves. Last month, that rate edged lower by 0.1 percentage points to 66.5%. The dollar dropped a tad against the US dollar after the jobs figures, implying investors are betting the slightly weaker-than-expected employment numbers mean the RBA won’t have to lift its key interest rate quite as high to cool the economy. More to come. NAB reports $2.15bn profit for last quarter After the Commonwealth Bank announced a $5.1bn profit for the last six months yesterday, NAB has reported $2.15bn in cash earnings for the last quarter. That’s an increase from the last quarter (which was about $1.8bn) with interest rate increases playing a pretty big role: 1Q23 cash earnings rose 18% compared with the 2H22 quarterly average. The higher interest rate environment, resulting from central bank actions to curb inflation, has benefitted our revenue this period. But this is also causing economic growth and house prices to soften, and loan repayments to increase. We know these changing circumstances, combined with cost-of-living pressures, will create difficulties for some of our customers and we have a range of options available for those needing support. Overall though, continued strong employment conditions and healthy savings buffers mean most customers look well placed to manage through this period The ABS has just released the last month’s employment data – the jobless rate rose to 3.7% In seasonally adjusted terms, in January 2023: unemployment rate increased to 3.7% participation rate decreased to 66.5% employment decreased to 13,721,900 employment-to-population ratio decreased to 64.0% underemployment rate remained at 6.1% monthly hours worked decreased to 1,836m. full-time employment decreased by 43,300 to 9,567,800 people part-time employment increased by 31,800 to 4,154,100 people Perrottet accuses Labor of attacking his family following branch-stacking allegations New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet has accused Labor of “playing games with my family” after an upper house inquiry heard allegations his brother sought $50,000 to fund a branch-stacking operation to oust federal Liberal MP Alex Hawke. On Wednesday an inquiry probing links between developers and councillors in the Hills Shire in Sydney’s north-west heard allegations from businessman Frits Mare that Jean-Claude Perrottet, along with Liberal party powerbroker Christian Ellis, asked for a $50,000 contribution from him in 2019 to “get rid of” Hawke and “stack his seat”. The inquiry has taken the extraordinary step of hiring private contractors to issue a summons to Jean-Claude Perrottet and another of the premier’s brothers, Charlie Perrottet, in order to force them to give evidence at the inquiry. Dominic Perrottet repeatedly refused to answer questions about the allegations raised at the inquiry on Thursday, saying Labor were “playing politics a month out from an election”. He said: I think the public can see through it. He said he had not spoken to either of his brothers about the allegations and did not know where they were or why they had refused to answer the summons. But he became visibly frustrated by repeated questions about the probe during a press conference on Thursday. He said: The Labor party are playing games with my family. Leave my family out of it. The inquiry was sparked by a speech given by state Liberal party MP Ray Williams to parliament last year in which he alleged several senior members of his party were “paid significant funds” install new councillors who would be friendly to the Sydney developer Jean Nassif. But Perrottet said Williams had “never mentioned any of my family members”, saying Labor were “attacking [my] family members to cover the fact they don’t have an economic plan. Australia considering more sanctions against Iran, Wong reveals The foreign affairs minister Penny Wong has signalled that she is considering further use of sanctions against Iran. She made the comments while also taking a swipe at the Coalition over its accusations that the Australian government has been slow to act on Iran. The Liberal senator Claire Chandler, who chaired a recent Senate inquiry into human rights in Iran, asked during an estimates committee hearing today why, given the urgency of the situation, the government had waited until human rights day to announce the first round of sanctions and then waited until the eve of her Senate inquiry report for the second tranche. Wong: Senator Chandler, I have to say in this context, given what is happening in Iran, given how much we are seeking to do, I regret the tone of partisanship with which you approach these issues and including through the Senate inquiry. It’s a matter for you. This government has worked more than any previous government – we’ve done more work in relation to human rights in Iran than any previous Australian government. It doesn’t appear that briefings to you or your party change the partisan tone of your questions. We make judgments about sanctions. We’ve made the judgements. Responding to the Chandler-led inquiry’s call for Australia to scale back diplomatic relations with Iran, Wong said successful Australian governments – since 1968 – had maintained diplomatic relations with Iran, “not because it’s a reward [but] because it’s a channel for Australian interests to be prosecuted, it’s a way of engaging”. Wong added: I have asked the department to look at expanding our autonomous sanctions regime in relation to Iran … As I said to members of the Iranian community yesterday, the brutality of the regime which we all stand against is at a threshold which is devastating and tragic. The Iranian people have been and are courageous in the face of the brutality. I regret we live in a world where we can’t change that but what we can do is speak with one voice to try to put pressure on the regime and that’s what this government is seeking to do. Chandler: Thank you for those comments, Senator Wong. I do disagree with your assertion that my questions are partisan in nature. These are concerns that have been raised with me directly by the Iranian community. Wong: The whole way in which you have dealt with this has been partisan. This is regrettable. People are dying and I find some of the way you dealt with this really regrettable. Chandler: I regret the fact that you have characterised my concerns in that way. That is all from me, chair. Wong: For example: I hope you are going to be consistent. The TPV [temporary protection visas] decision that you and your colleagues are very opposed to. Do you know how many Iranians will stay as a consequence of that? 6,000. So if you are really serious about protecting Iranian Australians and those who are here and not sending them back to a brutal regime then maybe you might acknowledge that that decision protects 6,000 people. We’ll get the ABS’s labour market figures shortly. The market consensus is for the economy to have added about 20,000 jobs last month, though some, such as ANZ, forecast the tally will be twice that. The jobless rate is predicted to remain at December’s level of 3.5%, or close to the lowest since the mid-1970s. (Cue: what bands were popular back then.) Labour market numbers will be closely watched by the RBA, with a strong outcome reinforcing its view that demand in the economy remains too strong and that higher interest rates will be needed. As things stand, investors have pencilled in three more 25-basis-point rises in the RBA’s cash rate before it hits a peak and slowing subsides. The RBA is banking on the jobless rate remaining sticky at about 3.5% by June even as borrowers get pummelled by higher debt costs and edge gradually towards 4.5% by mid-2025. If RBA governor Philip Lowe (and his fellow eight board members, he reminded us yesterday) is wrong, unemployment might shoot up a bit faster than that. General password sharing won’t be considered unlawful activity After the release of the latest copyright infringement survey from the attorney general’s department last week, which we reported here, tech news sites raised concerns that the department had redefined what it considers to be piracy to include account sharing. Given Netflix’s recently announced crackdown on the practice of people sharing accounts between households, it caused some concern that there might be some government intervention here. Guardian Australia asked the department about the change and the department said the “credential sharing” referred to as unlawful activity in the survey was where people pay a small fee to access a shared/unknown account of someone else online and was not referring to multiple households sharing logins. The separate question in the survey about general password sharing was not meant to indicate it was considered unlawful activity but to gather some initial data on a topic emerging in public debate and were not factored into what the survey counted as unlawful activity. The department did consult with a number of stakeholders on the survey in advance, but Guardian Australia understands that questions about password sharing were not directly requested by any streaming service. A spokesperson for Netflix told Guardian Australia it did not request the inclusion. Wong’s colonialism comments ‘unexceptional’: Dfat secretary At Senate estimates, the Dfat secretary, Jan Adams, also weighed in on Penny Wong’s comments about colonialism in the UK: Really it certainly was not the mainstay of the discussions both formally and informally. We spent a lot of time together. Frankly it was, in the context of modern Britain, an unexceptional comment ... There was no sense of discomfort or diplomatic tension whatsoever. I can say that with complete confidence. We were very focused on the main issues actually of the speech, which actually were the subject of the questions at that event... the realities in the Indo-Pacific and major power competition and the responsibility of all countries in addressing that. We were talking about strategic equilibrium in the region, management of the tensions in a way that is going to ensure communications, guardrails if you like. As the minister has said, another issue that actually we spoke quote a lot about was Russia-Ukraine. Wong adds that she is happy to offer the Coalition’s Simon Birmingham “a briefing on some of the disinformation that we seek to challenge”. She offers that such a briefing “might be useful” on “this side of the optimal pathway decisions” (that’s the nuclear-powered submarine plans). Birmingham says he has never declined a briefing from Wong. But he argues that aspect of Wong’s speech in the UK seems to have been a “distraction”. He mentions comments by the Australian newspaper’s Greg Sheridan that this was the “worst and strangest speech” of Wong’s life. Wong: I have a lot of regard for Mr Sheridan. On this obviously I would tell him to relax and I maintain my view that working how we maximise Australian influence including in how we speak about who we are and recognise where others are is a central part of the job of anyone in this role. Wong adds that some had claimed she had “confronted” the UK on its colonial past, but she says but at no point did that appear in the speech. Chief medical officer Prof Paul Kelly has provided the latest figures for deaths with Covid-19, revealing 892 people have died so far this year, including 308 in aged care. Kelly told estimates 18,190 people had died with Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, including 14,855 in 2022 and 892 in 2023, as at 8 February. In total, 5,075 people died in residential aged care throughout the pandemic, including 3,855 in 2022 and 308 in 2023. The data was sought by the opposition’s health spokesperson Anne Ruston, who said she was trying to understand why the situation in aged care had “deteriorated” in the latter half of 2022. It seems there’s been a massively increased number of people who have died in aged care from Covid at the end of 2022, but I don’t think I’ve heard what you’re doing to try and deal with that. It almost seems like no one’s really taking much notice of the fact that so many people died in aged care at the end of 2022. Kelly said the department was not “ignoring the issue”. He said the fact there had been more deaths in 2022, including in aged care, was because “we are living with Covid” and there had been large numbers of infections. Kelly said the worst months in aged care had been in early 2022. Kelly said the case fatality rate has dropped dramatically from the “dark days” early in the pandemic, when there was a one in three chance of dying from Covid among those who caught it in aged care. Kelly said deaths from any cause was a “sad but unfortunately inevitable event”. “It’s a very common daily event in aged care.” The hearing was told the aged care vaccination rate was currently about 85% and the department was rolling out a further booster. Antivirals were also available to those in aged care. Home insurance dropping in northern Australia, industry chief says Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation chief executive Christopher Wallace has told estimates that insurance customers are benefiting from a 13% price reduction for home insurance in northern Australia and 32% in high risk areas. Labor’s Deborah O’Neill noted there appears to be a “vast difference” between these figures and Morrison government promises of savings of up to 58% from the reinsurance pool. Wallace said ARPC wasn’t part of the original Treasury modelling, but it was “very confident” it can reduce premiums. He said: The average cyclone insurance in Townsville will be $624. In Cairns $427. Darwin $457. These are really good solid prices for home insurance. We want to wait a bit longer for lived experience. These are quite important numbers. Asked if anyone will experience price increases, Wallace said the principle is to have a “subsidisation from low-risk to high-risk areas” to achieve greater access to insurance. He accepted that some insurance consumers might face price increases in low-risk areas like Brisbane, Perth and northern NSW, but said these would be “small percentages” as a result of a “different view of risk” once insurers join the reinsurance pool. Plibersek brings up Greens’ blocking of carbon pollution reduction scheme Chris Bowen has been careful not to criticise the Greens overly much in his public comments over the safeguards legislation negotiation. But other Labor ministers have been very quick to bring up the spectre of 2009 and the CPRS. Tanya Plibersek was one of those ministers in question time yesterday. And she repeated it on Sky news this morning: I think Greens voters, Greens supporters in the community would be shocked to see the Greens walking over to sit next to Peter Dutton and Barnaby Joyce and vote against a safeguard mechanism. And it would take them right back to when the Greens voted with the Liberals to block the CPRS, the carbon pollution reduction scheme, out of the previous Labor government. What we know is that the Greens and the Liberals voting together to block the CPRS meant more emissions for longer and I would be shocked if, at the end of the day, the Greens were prepared to do that again, to stop an emissions reduction plan from Labor that would be the equivalent of taking two-thirds of Australia’s cars off the road by 2030. This is a substantial reduction in carbon pollution emissions. It might not be everything the Greens want, but the idea that they would vote against it and block action on climate change, I think, would appal their supporters. Wong: colonialism comments in UK ‘opportunity to find more common ground’ The foreign affairs minister Penny Wong has dismissed suggestions from Simon Birmingham that her comments about colonialism while in the UK had caused an unnecessary “distraction”. During a wide-ranging speech in London two weeks ago, Wong reflected on different experiences of British colonisation. She said her father was descended from Hakka and Cantonese Chinese and many from those clans “worked as domestic servants for British colonists, as did my own grandmother”. She said such stories “can sometimes feel uncomfortable” but understanding the past enabled leaders to better shape the present and the future, adding: It gives us the opportunity to find more common ground than if we stayed sheltered in narrower versions of our countries’ histories. It helps open the world to us. It helps open the Indo-Pacific to us. Birmingham asked a series of questions about the speech – and how it was received – at a Senate estimates hearing today. Wong replies: If we recognise our history and we recognise how we have changed, we find more common ground and we deal with some of the ways in which others seek to constrain us. And in the context of the Aukus and the Quad that is about Australia’s influence and power in the region and if you can’t see that I’m surprised.* Because I would have thought you understand that, unlike some. Birmingham: I might understand many things, but also I understand the importance of balance, the importance of respect where you are, the importance of how you put your messages. Are there positive aspects ... of the UK’s historical contribution around systems of democracy, systems of justice? Wong: Of course there are. * China has branded both Aukus and the Quad as exclusive “cliques”. Chinese diplomats have sought to portray the Aukus deal among Australia the US and the UK as an “Anglo-Saxon clique”. Victoria may go it alone on raising minimum age of incarceration Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, has made his strongest indication yet that the state will abandon a national process to raise the age of criminal responsibility to go it alone. Speaking to reporters in Heidelberg West, in Melbourne’s north-east, Andrews said it was his intention to bring legislation before parliament to address youth justice, child protection and bail reform in the “first half of the year”: That’s subject, obviously, to a range of cabinet processes. Some people have been very focused on the age issue. We’re giving that one more go to try and get a national consensus and if we don’t, as we said some time ago, we won’t hesitate to do our own thing. We’d prefer not to do that, I think a national law would be better but at some point you have to call time on national processes that just don’t deliver. Across Australia, children as young as 10 can be arrested by police, remanded in custody, convicted by the courts and jailed. It is estimated almost 600 children aged between 10 and 13 were in custody last financial year. More than 60% were Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. Federal, state and territory attorneys general have been examining the issue for some time. In December they released a draft report that was commissioned in 2020, which recommended raising the age of criminal responsibly to 14 without exception. But at this stage it is is working on a proposal to raise the age to 12. Some jurisdictions have already abandoned the process, with the Northern Territory raising the age to 12 from next year, the Australian Capital Territory to 14 by 2026 and the Tasmania government will lift the minimum age of incarceration to 14 while leaving the age of criminal responsibility at 10. The councils of attorneys general will meet in April but Andrews said the government may not wait until then to move on the issue: I’m not necessarily keen to wait that long. The attorney [general Jaclyn Symes] … speaks to her colleagues quite often so it wouldn’t necessarily be a formal meeting. You can get on the phone to talk to people. Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, says he expects further Covid-19 waves throughout the year. Kelly is appearing with his health department colleagues at Senate estimates this morning. Kelly said there had been a “number of waves” in the last 12 months, including Omicron, though the most recent wave was “settling”. But he added: I predict there will be at least another couple this year. He said the world was still in a pandemic and the World Health Organization had determined again recently that Covid-19 “remains a public health threat to the world”. And we’ve seen what’s happened in China recently in terms of very large rates of infection and deaths in that country, as they’ve opened up and accepted living with Covid. The secretary of the department of health, Prof Brendan Murphy, reiterated that the prime minister Anthony Albanese and health minister Mark Butler had committed to a “deep inquiry” into the pandemic. The details of that inquiry are yet to be determined. Asic officials questioned about complaints In Treasury estimates, the Liberal senator Andrew Bragg has been probing whether there have been any complaints about the leadership of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. At first, Asic officials took these questions on notice, leading to a warning from Bragg that it is “not a very good look for you to be looking as if you’re covering up” complaints made about the agency. Asic chair Joe Longo then revealed that he had received correspondence from the Treasury secretary about deputy chair Karen Chester. Chester told the committee she takes accountability and transparency seriously. She said: Given Senator Bragg’s questions, I think it’s important I share I am aware in early 2021 some allegations were made about myself. These were referred to Treasury, which undertook and oversaw an investigation. No adverse findings were made. Bragg asked for a copy of the letter, which Longo took on notice. House passes affordable housing fund bill Speaking of housing, the affordable housing fund legislation passed the house last night and the legislation streamlining some of the other aspects (like establishing the national housing supply and affordability council) has also just passed. It still has to get through the Senate though, which will not happen until at least next month. Housing minister Julie Collins, though, was taking a moment: This is a turning point for housing in our country, but it has sadly been blighted by those who voted no to more social and affordable housing. This is vital investment in the future of housing in our country. We know it is desperately needed, and we will continue to work hard to deliver it. The Greens are holding a press conference at 11.30 to talk safeguards mechanism and affordable housing and other balance of power issues. That is the same time as the unemployment rate comes out, so we will bring you what we can. Malcolm Roberts quizzes Wong on gender equality ambassador The One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts has been asking in Senate estimates about Australia’s gender equality ambassador, Stephanie Copus Campbell, and about the salary and whether she intends to travel to countries like Saudi Arabia. In a back and forth, Roberts volunteers the observation that his party leader, Pauline Hanson, is a woman. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, talks about the broad principles behind having this ambassadorial position: We want a world where girls can aspire to do what women can do in this country and we don’t have such a world, so the ways in which we try to work with others to achieve that include through this ambassador. It leads to this exchange in which Roberts is keen to put his views on the record: Roberts: There’s a battle going on. I can tell you a story of meeting with an executive in northern West Virgina in 1981 – I was fairly young … She was telling me that she was appointed to her position … because she was a female to meet affirmative action quota ands she said it’s highly embarrassing to be that way, whereas my mother took the opposite position. You treat women as women, meaning two things – they are different and they bring secondly they a raft of characteristics that men don’t have and that’s wonderful for diversity. My belief has been that we should be employing women and other minorities – women are not minorities they’re a majority actually, but you know what I’m getting at – other groups that are minorities because they bring a diversity of views, not because of their gender. My office currently has exactly 50/50 female/male [split]. Not because we want to comply with the ratio but because those women are damn good and we want their views. I’m thinking wouldn’t it be better to show by our actions that we value women? I mean, you’re the foreign affairs minister. When you go visiting a country you are showing that Australia values women. Wong: Yes, but you know, you need lots of ways you in which you try to tackle a problem. Inequality, development is a multi-faceted problem. So we also have thematic ambassadors, who, as I said, they do things that I wouldn’t be able to do. We don’t have ministers engaging at some of the levels at which ambassadors can work, being able to spend the time on one particular issue. There are extraordinary women through our region, in south-east Asia and the Pacific, who are doing extraordinary things … Roberts: Well, minister, with respect, and I sincerely mean that because I have enormous respect for … Wong: One thing: you always are respectful in how you deal with me, Senator Roberts. Roberts: And I sincerely respect your abilities. However, I think that some of these positions – and going back to 2011 doesn’t justify having these positions. So I hear your arguments, I acknowledge them. So often these days positions like this and other ambassadors are created to tick a box and they’re not meaningful. I’m just making sure – part of my role is to make sure funds are spent properly. Wong: Sure and you’re entitled to ask the questions and I appreciate how you have asked them. What I would say is Ambassador Copus Campbell is absolutely not a tick-a-box kind of person. And if you want to meet her, I’m sure she’d be very happy to engage with members of parliament and senators. Roberts: Australia was the second country in the world to give women the vote and we were better off for it. Wong: South Australia was the first place in the world where women could stand for parliament. Wong on China: ‘importance of engaging with one of the great powers’ The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, says her trip to Beijing in Beijing was the first ministerial visit to China in years. She says she put the case that Beijing should remove trade tariffs and other impediments on the trading relationship. On why the Australian government has been pursuing dialogue, Wong says: We also recognise the importance of engaging with one of the great powers and encouraging continued dialogue between the great powers as well. Wong speaks again of the importance of encouraging the US and China to put in place so-called guardrails to avoid competition spiralling into conflict. She says the aim is to “avoid miscalculation, which is always a risky thing”. Wong says she discussed a range of issues with China’s state councillor, Wang Yi, including the war in Ukraine: On Russia my consistent position has been to encourage – and I’ve done this publicly – China to use its particular status as a member of the P5 [the veto-holding permanent members of the UN security council] and its relationship with Russia to seek to facilitate the end of that conflict. We also went to the consular issues I’ve discussed earlier. Asked about the next steps on stabilising the relationship with Beijing, Wong says whoever is in government in Australia “will always have to manage differences in our relationship with China”: And we always also, in my view, have to seek to continue to engage given China’s place in the world and place in our region. In part I think this next phase in the relationship – what I’ve described as stabilising, because I don’t think it was useful to Australia to have the relationship where it was, nor have this as a domestic political issue in the way it was. It’s a challenging relationship to manage. It’s not assisted by the heat of election campaigns and the relationship being used in that context. One of the key things obviously is the trade impediments. We have consistently said we think it’s in both countries’ interests for those trade impediments to be removed. Wong says one of the things she and Wang agreed was that there were a number of areas “where officials would continue to work”. While a lot of the focus is on ministerial meetings, Wong says it is also important to “re-establish a working architecture in the relationship”. She says the relationship is also about what happens at lower levels than ministers: In part we need to try to get in the structures and dialogues which previously existed working again. We’re not going to agree on everything. In fact there may be many things we don’t agree on, but it is better for us to have a capacity to engage about those issues. Department of Social Services: 3.1% of age pensioners in work over December Just rounding up some notable things we learned out of Senate estimates late last night. Over in the community affairs committee, the Department of Social Services was asked about the Labor government’s plan to allow age pensioners to earn more before their payments are cut. The policy allows age pensioners to earn an additional $4,000 over this financial year without losing any of their pension. The policy came into effect in November but it appears to have little effect so far. Quizzed by the Greens senator Janet Rice about pensioner employment figures, Troy Sloan of the department said 3.1% of age pensioners were in work over December, the first month where the policy was in effect. Sloan stressed the figures were “very early”, but said that compared with the 3.1% of age pensioners in work in November 2022 and 3% in December 2021. We also learned that the government has made some progress improving waiting times for the escaping violence payment, which was introduced by the Coalition and is administered by Uniting Vic.Tas. The payment includes up to $5,000 in financial assistance including $1,500 in cash for people fleeing domestic violence. The latest figures show the average time a person has waited for the payment has fallen from 33 days to 24 days. Under questioning from the Greens’ Larissa Waters, Liz Hefren-Webb, of DSS, noted that applicants could get an initial $500 up front when they applied. But she said the aim was to get the waiting times down to 10 days. It’s hoped they will achieve that target by the end of the financial year. Dreyfus establishes Nacc joint commission Mark Dreyfus isn’t the most flashy of politicians, but he certainly has a bit on his plate at the moment. In the last day the attorney general has established the joint committee on the national anti-corruption commission – with ALP senator Linda White chairing and independent Helen Haines serving as deputy chair. That’s the oversight committee on the Nacc, which now means the Nacc commissioner and senior officers can be nominated for the committee’s approval. The whistleblower protections legislation went through the house on Wednesday, so will go to the Senate and a vote after the committee report into it is handed down. The hunt for the new AAT president started and the privacy review was released. So a big 24 hours for Dreyfus, who will most likely go through this list in a very dignified dixer delivery. Wong: Labor taking ‘more calm and consistent tone’ with China Senate estimates is looking into Australia’s diplomatic thaw with China. The foreign affairs minister Penny Wong says Labor “came to government with a very clear view about seeking to stabilise the relationship”. The government sought to engage “but to do so in the context in our national interests”. Wong says: I think we’ve sought to take a much more calm and consistent tone and approach in our relationship with China. Obviously that became quite a heated topic of domestic political debate under the previous government, which we didn’t regard as being in our national interest. Wong says the government has maintained Australia’s necessary policy positions but to manage differences “wisely”: The overarching approach is to not shift from those things which are about Australia’s interests and about who we are, but at the same time seek to manage those differences and not seek to prosecute a domestic political agenda with them. So, for example, Australia’s not shifted its position, nor how we articular our view, in relation to international law and the South China Sea. Australia has, on human rights, continued to press, articulate [human rights] in our engagements, including at my level, on matters of human rights. [On] consular matters – we obviously have put our views at the prime minister’s level, my level, and at other levels including the department and at post level, about in particular [imprisoned Australians] Dr Yang [Hengjun] and Ms Cheng Lei. Bowen: ‘All negotiation must be in keeping with election mandate’ So what is the government willing to negotiate on with the Greens (and the other crossbench senators it needs) when it comes to the safeguards mechanism? Here is what Chris Bowen told ABC’s RN Breakfast this morning: Everything that we consider will be in keeping with our government’s approach in our election mandate, nothing more, nothing less. We went to the people seeking a mandate. That’s what we’ll implement. Now, just as with the other things that we’ve done that we’ve gotten through the parliament, like the Climate Change Act, where there are suggestions or requests which I think make sense and are in keeping with our mandate and add or complement to what we’re trying to do, then I’m all ears. Where somebody says, ‘look, we really want you to break this election commitment’, then sorry, no, we’ll move on to the next topic because we won’t be doing that. And I think, as I’ve said, I think our track record as a government under Anthony [Albanese]’s leadership of mature, sensible adults willing to talk to people of good faith, I believe that’s our track record and I believe that track record will continue. Veterans’ affairs minister Matt Keogh will make an announcement on the government’s response to the royal commission into defence and veteran suicide interim report this morning. We will bring you that very soon. Significant drop in bulk billing revealed If you haven’t seen this investigation from health editor Melissa Davey, Nick Evershed and Natasha May, it is well worth your time: The number of Australians who are fully bulk-billed by their GP has dropped significantly in just three years, with one electorate experiencing a decline of 18%, a Guardian Australia investigation reveals. Experts say the decline of bulk billing – where the full cost of a consultation is paid for by Medicare without any additional gap fees – is putting serious strain on overstretched emergency departments and other health services. Data obtained exclusively by Guardian Australia reveals a 4% decline across the country, with a far bigger drop in some areas, including the northern suburbs of Perth, the central coast of NSW, and areas between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. In WA, there was a decline across all electorates between 2019 and 2022. New Zealand has requested Australia’s help for disaster response, Elizabeth Peak from Dfat has just told Senate estimates: Yes, I can confirm we have received a formal request from New Zealand less than an hour ago. We set up yesterday a national management coordination function to be able to respond very quickly when the request came through, and, and we will certainly do that. Dfat says no Australians still unaccounted for after Turkey-Syria quake The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is up at Senate estimates this morning. It begins with an update on the devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria. Jan Adams, the head of Dfat, describes it as a disaster of “horrendous proportions”: We are deeply saddened that three Australians have died in the earthquakes and again extend our condolences to the families. Adams says Dfat has been provided consular assistance to about 80 Australians and their families. Kate Logan, head of consular, says this consular assistance typically involves help with travel documents, travel out of affected area and welfare checks. She says Dfat is also “in touch with all three families” of the Australians who died and offering support. She says no Australians were still unaccounted for. There are some questions about whether the Australian search-and-rescue team to Turkey could have been sent sooner (the foreign minister approved the mission on Wednesday morning last week; the team was dispatched early on Friday morning; they arrived on Sunday). Officials said Australia provided humanitarian funding in first instance to allow organisations in area to provide life-saving support (the initial package was announced on 7 February). It was seen that teams from Europe were “better placed at the time to respond to the immediate call”. That was consistent with Turkey’s disaster plan, which seeks European assistance in the first instance. Dfat official Beth Delaney said the situation in Syria, meanwhile, was “extremely complex” and Australia continued to “call on all actors to provide humanitarian access to those in need”: We’re very aware of the access issues. We have called on all parties to improve access for those needing humanitarian support in Syria. What I would say is the early actions we took on Tuesday meant our contribution through Unicef they were actually able to provide supplies immediately. They have pre-positioned funding ... They had staff on the ground in north-west Syria. That meant they were able to purchase and deliver those supplies immediately. Australia’s first guidelines for supporting autistic children Amanda Rishworth and Mark Butler have announced Australia’s first “national guideline for supporting the learning, participation and wellbeing of autistic children and their families”. It has been developed by the commonwealth-funded Autism CRC in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council’s framework for best practice guidelines. From the ministers’ joint release: Autistic children deserve a childhood full of love, family, fun, learning and personal discovery. They should be safe, have their rights respected and be supported. Many autistic children experience challenges to their learning, participation, and wellbeing. The recent announcement of $2m in commonwealth funding to the Autism CRC and commencement of work on the national autism strategy will also support the implementation of this guideline. This guideline is an important step, outlining 84 recommendations to support consistent, effective and efficient delivery of evidence-based supports for autistic children up to 12 years of age. The evidence-based and inclusive development of this guideline is a demonstration of how the government will develop its national autism strategy More information about the guideline here. The house sitting has started – it is the last one of this sitting fortnight, so it is business, business, business at the moment. War memorial head grilled on sponsorship from arms manufacturers The Australian War Memorial appeared before Senate estimates late last night. Director Matt Anderson was grilled on the memorial’s acceptance of sponsorship and donations from arms manufacturers. The Guardian revealed on Wednesday that the memorial had accepted more than $830,000 from arms manufacturers since 2020-21. But Senate estimates heard that figure rose to $1.8m when counted from 2018-19. Donors and sponsors included Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Thales. Greens senator David Shoebridge asked whether the memorial was aware that Thales was currently facing prosecution in South Africa for the alleged corruption of government officials to influence defence procurement. Anderson said he was not aware of that fact. Shoebridge: Do you think that might be an issue you’d take on board in terms of the reputation of the war memorial in receiving money from a corporation like that? Anderson: I think you said they were allegations, senator? Shoebridge: They’ve been charged and they’re facing criminal prosecution. Do you think that might be an issue you’d take on board? Anderson: Senator, whenever we consider sponsorship arrangements with defence industry or any sponsor, we have a partnership arrangement, partnership agreement and framework, where we consider any number of things. That of course includes the reputation of the company and the record of the company will be considered as part of any sponsorship agreement. Submissions uploaded for inquiry into buy-now-pay-later sector The submissions for the government’s inquiry into the buy-now-pay-later sector have been uploaded. The government plans on regulating the sector, which, unlike credit cards, doesn’t require any checks for people to sign up to, resulting in many becoming financially overwhelmed. There haven’t been a lot of eyes on the sector – assistant treasurer Stephen Jones says that is going to change. Given BNPL schemes have been set up for people to buy everyday staples like groceries, it is probably beyond time. Opposition not yet briefed on proposed green card lottery The shadow home affairs minister Karen Andrews was asked about Labor’s proposed green card lottery this morning: Let me answer that very generally by saying we know that there is a need for skilled and unskilled workers in this country here. We hear stories every single day of how many businesses are struggling to find the workers that they need. Now I have not received a briefing on that policy, but I would be very happy to be briefed on that policy position and how the government proposes that that will work. I am open to looking at whatever solutions the government actually has to make sure that we continue to look at how we are going to meet the skilled workforce, the unskilled workers that are needed here in Australia, because it is critical. Speaking of Mark Dreyfus, if you haven’t seen the upcoming privacy reforms he is leading, Paul Karp has you covered: Government seeking new Administrative Appeals Tribunal president Attorney general Mark Dreyfus says the government is now officially looking for the new president of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and additional members while it works out what will eventually replace the AAT. Whoever ends up leading the AAT will then end up leading the new body, once it is established. Dreyfus announced the end of the AAT after declaring it a “disgraceful exhibition of cronyism” by the former Liberal government. So who is the government looking for? It is essential that the new president has the skills, expertise and personal qualities to lead the AAT during a period of significant and exciting reform. The appointment is full-time for a period of up to seven years. To ensure the recruitment process attracts the strongest possible field of candidates, appropriately qualified individuals can apply for the role directly or be nominated by a third party. And as for the additional members? The government has committed $63.4m over two years for at least 75 additional members to address the current backlog of cases in the AAT and reduce wait times. This is an exciting opportunity for appropriately qualified individuals to make an important contribution to the most significant reform of the federal system of administrative review in decades. All new appointments will be made in accordance with the new AAT appointment guidelines. This transparent and merit-based selection process is an integral part of the Australian government’s commitment to providing the community with a trusted federal administrative review body that serves their interests. Applications will close at 11.55pm AEDT on Wednesday 8 March 2023. Details here. The minister for international development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, has revealed that the government will introduce an American green card-style lottery for permanent residency for 3,000 people from Pacific countries. Conroy told ABC News Breakfast: The intention is to start the scheme after 1 July this year. This is a change in our permanent migration system to allocate 3,000 permanent migration spots to families from the Pacific each year is a critical way of improving and building our people to people links with the Pacific family. It is revolutionary and it will deepen our ties to a region that is critical to our future. Conroy noted this will add to the Pacific Australia labour mobility scheme, which provides work placements of nine months to four years. He said: We have ramped up that since coming to government. It was 24,000 when we won power in May. We set a goal of 35,000 by 1 July this year and we hit that in December. That is filling labour shortages, skilling up Pacific workers for when they go home and sending $500m of income back home. The Pacific engagement visa, which we’re introducing into parliament today, is different. That is about permanent migration. This is allocating 3,000 spots to Pacific families each year to make a new life in Australia, to deepen the Pacific diaspora in Australia and deepen our people-to-people links. There is no one in the parliament who knows more about energy policy (yes, this includes the MPs) than Katharine Murphy. And she’s also very adept at cutting through the noise to what is actually going on. In this case, it’s the negotiations on the safeguards bill. If you missed her this morning on ABC radio’s RN Breakfast, here you go: Lowe: RBA wants to see unemployment rise to 4.5% The ABS will release the latest unemployment data today at 11.30am. During the RBA governor Phil Lowe’s appearance in front of the Senate estimates committee, he said the bank’s “central scenario” was seeing the unemployment rate rise to 4.5%, as that would help to lower inflation to 3% in coming years. The unemployment rate is currently 3.5%. The tight labour market has meant people who struggled to get a job because of age or disability or lack of skills are now finding it easier to find employment (not in all cases, obviously – employers have still not worked out how to work with chronic illnesses, or people who can not work “normal” shifts because of physical or other limitations) but under Lowe’s “central forecast”, Australia’s “full employment” level of unemployment would increase to 4.5%, once again closing off the job market for many. A certain level of unemployed people is built into the economic infrastructure as a way of lowering inflation. Under this thinking, Australia’s leaders seem incapable of balancing actual full employment with inflation, meaning some people are always made to suffer. Officials know this and yet they don’t pay unemployed people above the poverty line, even though by being unemployed, they are essentially taking one for Team Australia. Economic inclusion committee a ‘sham’, says Antipoverty Centre The economic inclusion committee was set up as part of the government’s negotiations with David Pocock to get its IR legislation across the line last year. The Antipoverty Centre, which is run by people with lived experience of welfare and poverty, says the detail on the committee has only confirmed its fears it is a tick-and-flick exercise that won’t actually help lift people above the poverty line. Antipoverty Centre spokesperson and DSP recipient Kristin O’Connell said the committee “has no power [and] no people who are economically excluded”: It has no credibility whatsoever. No one who claims to value the voices and lives of people in poverty should associate themselves with this sham committee. If you support the exclusion of unemployed people you are contributing to our demonisation. Any person who thinks the “sustainability” is a crucial question while we endure a welfare system that is killing people is rejecting the humanity of people who can’t afford to live. We are sick and tired of endless inquiries, reports, consultations and advisory bodies that always reach the same conclusions but are too cowardly to insist on obvious solutions. The government does not need new information or advice from so-called experts who know nothing about our lives. It knows what’s needed as well as we do: poor people need money. And that’s why it can’t have the real experts in poverty on its committee – the prime minister needs an excuse to hide behind when he refuses to increase welfare payments to the poverty line in the federal budget. Details of the economic inclusion committee revealed During social services estimates yesterday, the department tabled the details for the economic inclusion committee, which has been set up to review the adequacy of social services payments ahead of each budget. The committee can make recommendations, but the government does not have to take those recommendations up. According to the tabled document, the committee will consider and provide advice and proposals on: a) Economic inclusion, including approaches to boost participation through policy settings, systems and structures, in the social security system and other government programs and policies b) The adequacy, effectiveness and sustainability of income support payments, including options to boost economic inclusion and tackle disadvantage c) Options to reduce barriers and disincentives to work, including in relation to social security and employment services d) Options for tailored responses to address barriers to economic inclusion for long-term unemployed and disadvantaged groups, including place-based approaches at the local level e) The impact of economic inclusion policies on gender equality, including consideration of work being undertaken by the women’s economic equality taskforce f) The trends of inequality markers in Australia and any other relevant advice The committee’s report to government should include supporting discussion and analysis. In providing advice on these matters, the committee will have regard to the government’s fiscal strategy, existing policies and the long-term sustainability of the social security system. The committee’s report to government should include supporting discussion and analysis. In providing advice on these matters, the committee will have regard to the government’s fiscal strategy, existing policies and the long-term sustainability of the social security system. Where the parties stand So the Greens are pushing hard against new coal and gas but have not indicated they are willing to kill off the legislation. The government is saying it won’t move on that line but it does see some wriggle room. So there is plenty of room left in this one – there is no imminent vote in the Senate, but this can not drag on forever. Chris Bowen on what the government is willing to negotiate on: We’re willing to negotiate on everything that we consider will be in keeping with our government’s approach and our election mandate. Nothing more, nothing less. We went to the people seeking a mandate. That’s what we will implement. So Chris Bowen’s line here is “we’ll do anything for safeguards, but we won’t do that”. ‘We will get things done’ Chris Bowen is taking a conciliatory tone in this interview. Asked if Labor is willing to see the legislation fall over, if it won’t meet the Greens’ “no new coal, no new gas” line, Bowen says: Well, I don’t believe it’ll get to that point. I welcome Adam’s confirmation this morning, in his words that this is an offer, not an ultimatum. I think that’s the spirit in which they should be approached. That’s the spirit in which it should be dealt with. And that’s the spirit in which we’ve dealt with everything in the climate change space since last May. I mean, this is a common situation. I’ve come on this show. And you said to me, Chris, you’re not going to get your climate change bill through because the Liberal side goes too far and the Green side doesn’t go far enough. And I say we’re a government of adults, mature people working in good faith across the parliament. We will get things done. Same with our EV tax cut. It didn’t originally have support. Same with our energy bill relief package. It originally didn’t have the numbers. We worked through it. We get it done … I would be astounded if the Senate with the numbers that it has … would say no to the biggest emissions reduction, the only chance for big emissions reduction from our big industrial emitters. Bowen on breakfast radio Chris Bowen is about to deliver his message for the day on ABC radio RN Breakfast. It will all be about the safeguards mechanism. The Greens say their “no new coal or gas projects” isn’t an ultimatum but an offer to the government. Bowen says: We won’t be doing that. A very big thank you to Martin for kicking us off today. Welcome to parliament Thursday – it’s the last sitting day of this first fortnight and while there is no legislation being passed (the Senate is tied up in estimates) there are all sorts of negotiations going on. The safeguard mechanism. The national reconstruction fund. The affordable housing fund. It’s all happening. You’ll have Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Paul Karp to take you though it, with me, Amy Remeikis, on the blog for most of the day. It’s going to be at least a four-coffee day. I have two running at once. Ready? Let’s get into it. Plastic pollution About two-thirds of the rubbish volunteers plucked from the environment last year was plastic, a jump of almost 20% in one year, Australian Associated Press reports. Clean Up Australia’s national rubbish report for 2022, released today, says 366,144 pieces of rubbish were picked up by the organisation’s volunteers last year. Of those, 63% was plastic of some sort. That’s up 17% on 2021, driven by a rise in finds of soft plastic, hard plastic and polystyrene. Soft plastics topped the list at 18%, followed by cigarette butts at 14%. Then came single-use plastic bottles, takeaway food containers, drink cans, and pieces of glass and plastic packaging at 5% to 6% each. The top 10 were rounded out by chips and lolly bags, bottle caps and lids, and face masks – counted for the first time in this report – at 3%. Volunteers found about one-third of what they recovered on roadsides and footpaths, one-third in waterways and 20% in parks. Queensland bushfires rage on Efforts to contain bushfires in Queensland’s Western Downs have stretched into a fourth day with emergency warnings in place for residents north of the town of Miles, Australian Associated Press reports Residents of Kowguran and Guluguba were told to prepare to leave last night as a large, fast-moving fire travelled from Welshs Road and L Tree Creek Road towards the Leichhardt Highway. The Queensland Fire and Emergency Service warned conditions could get worse quickly. Multiple warnings were also in place for Myall Park and Hookswood. Toowoomba residents vent anger about crime Youth crime is a huge issue in Queensland and last night police minister Mark Ryan, youth minister Leanne Linard and the state’s police commissioner Katarina Carroll attended a community forum in Toowoomba’s Armitage Centre to hear the concerns of locals. A packed audience told harrowing stories about crime levels and called on the ministers and police chief to take action, some admitting that they had considered vigilante action themselves. Eden Gillespie was there for Guardian Australia and has the full story: Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of what promises to be another lively day in Canberra and beyond. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll bring you some of the main overnight stories before Amy Remeikis takes over. The big political question question is whether the Greens will back the government’s reform of the safeguard mechanism to help reduce industry emissions. Tanya Plibersek says Greens voters would be shocked if the party goes ahead with its threat to “sabotage” the government’s plan and votes alongside the Coalition to torpedo the scheme. The Greens, who want the government to ditch all coal and gas projects in exchange for their support, say their stance is more an offer than an ultimatum. We’re setting the news agenda today with an excellent investigation that shows the number of Australians who are fully bulk-billed by their GP has dropped significantly in just three years, with one electorate experiencing a decline of 18%. A former senior federal health official says the data shows that where you live matters but also that bulk-billing practices can be successful. Australians would be able to opt out of targeted ads, erase their data and sue for serious breaches of privacy, under a proposal to be unveiled today by attorney general Mark Dreyfus. He will argue that our privacy laws have not kept pace with the changes in the digital world and need reform. And two miners were missing in Queensland after their ute plunged into a huge hole after a “ground collapse”. The accident happened at Dugald River near Mount Isa yesterday. Drones are being used to find the men and we’ll keep you updated with the search effort.

Hinkley Point – no thanks","bodyText":"Yes, I still believe that nuclear power can make a useful contribution to low-carbon energy. No, I do not believe that the new plant the government has just approved at Hinkley Point is part of that useful contribution. Far from it: this preposterous white elephant could scarcely be better designed to persuade people that nuclear energy is an expensive and dangerous distraction from the decisions we have to make. Let’s start where all such discussions should start: at the most important place. The overwhelming priority for those who make decisions about energy must be to avert climate breakdown. They need to keep the lights on, but not by sacrificing the future welfare of humanity and Earth’s living systems. It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness. It is also better to curse the darkness than to burn your house down. Nuclear power, whatever its detractors might claim, is a low-carbon energy source, roughly comparable to renewables in terms of total emissions. To shut down viable nuclear capacity in the midst of a climate change emergency (now, in other words), as Germany and Japan have done, is a refined form of madness, especially when at least some of that capacity is likely to be replaced by gas or coal, whose carbon emissions are much higher. Replacing fossil fuels with renewables, on the timescale in which we need to act, is hard enough, without setting yourself the additional, unnecessary challenge of also replacing nuclear power. Atomic energy is far less dangerous to human beings and the living world than fossil fuels. The dangers of radioactive discharge and nuclear accidents have been systematically exaggerated by campaigners. As a result, the dangers of fossil fuel burning have been implicitly downgraded. Remember that even the Fukushima disaster, a level 7 nuclear accident (the highest category), caused by a massive earthquake and tidal wave hitting an antiquated reactor, has so far killed no one as a result of radioactive discharge, and is unlikely to do so in the future. Fossil fuel burning, by contrast, kills hundreds of thousands of people every year through air pollution, and presents a possibly existential threat to civilisation through climate change. But keeping viable plants open and replacing a superannuated nuclear fleet with new plants are slightly different decisions. In the latter case, governments have to decide two things: whether nuclear power is the best means of replacing the low-carbon energy the old plants were producing and, if so, which nuclear technology should best be adopted. It’s not just that Theresa May’s government has taken the wrong decision – it does not appear to have made a decision at all. It has simply adopted the proposal on the table, without subjecting it to a serious comparison with the alternatives. There are several problems with the Hinkley C proposal but the most immediate is this: it could be unbuildable. We all know by now of the delays, debacles and disasters that have beset attempts to construct the only two plants of the same kind, at Olkiluoto in Finland and Flamanville in Normandy. The evidence suggests that these are not just bad luck but an inherent outcome of the fabulously complex design. As Tony Roulstone, who runs the masters programme in nuclear engineering at Cambridge, has argued, the plan for Hinkley C is like “building a cathedral within a cathedral”. If this is true, not only will Hinkley C leave us with a gigantic bill and nothing to show for it, it will also have stymied – through the misallocation of both financial and political resources – other contributions to the low-carbon economy, in the form of renewable power and energy-saving technologies, which could be deployed immediately with minimal risk of failure. In other words, it is likely to cause energy blight. And it presents a longer-term risk to rational energy policy. The government currently has no idea what to do about the UK’s massive legacy of nuclear waste. Neither of the primary proposed solutions – burial and mixed oxide processing (another expensive fiasco) – are politically acceptable. But there are several potential technologies that raise the possibility of addressing three problems at once: safely disposing of nuclear waste; meeting the country’s energy needs at low cost; and replacing high-carbon electricity with a very low-carbon source. I’m talking about small modular reactors that use nuclear waste as fuel. The late Professor David MacKay, the brilliant and exuberant chief scientist at the previous government’s climate change department, endorsed an estimate suggesting that one of these potential technologies, the integral fast reactor, could supply all the UK’s energy needs for 500 years by consuming the nuclear waste stockpile. I suspect that May’s unintelligible decision to build the new plant at Hinkley will kill nuclear power in Britain, including technologies far more promising than the proven formula for chaos she has just chosen. You might welcome that prospect. If so, you should ask yourself what else should be done about our mountain of nuclear waste."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/jul/31/allow-nuclear-waste-disposal-in-national-parks-say-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-31T05:01:45Z","webTitle":"Allow nuclear waste disposal under national parks, say MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/31/allow-nuclear-waste-disposal-in-national-parks-say-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jul/31/allow-nuclear-waste-disposal-in-national-parks-say-mps","fields":{"headline":"Allow nuclear waste disposal under national parks, say MPs","bodyText":"Highly radioactive nuclear waste could be permanently buried under national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty (AONBs), under government plans backed by a committee of MPs. Deep geological burial is seen as the only permanent solution for nuclear waste that will remain radioactive for many thousands of years and is currently stored at surface sites across the UK. Ministers’ attempts to choose a site in Cumbria for the £12bn facility were foiled in 2013 when the county council rejected the proposal. New plans by ministers were published in January and have now been backed by the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) select committee of MPs, who said the safest site should be chosen, regardless of location. “We decided against adding an exclusionary criterion for national parks and AONBs as in our view it is right for safety matters to prevail over environmental concerns in this case,” said the committee, chaired by Labour’s Rachel Reeves. However, the Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said: “It’s outrageous to think of companies burying nuclear waste and fracking for gas in some of the most beautiful places in the country. Tussles over which communities have to put up with this toxic material bring us all to shame.” Fracking under national parks was also approved by the UK government in 2015. The BEIS committee did criticise ministers for being unclear about how much nuclear waste would be produced by plans for new reactors, including at Hinkley Point in Somerset. It also said ministers made a “spurious” link between the geological disposal facility (GDF) and the government’s industrial strategy as the plans do not contain enough requirements to train and use local people. Fifty years of nuclear power in the UK has generated 750,000 cubic metres of waste but the nation has still not developed a permanent disposal solution. Following the 2013 failure, ministers have proposed up to £2.5m a year for communities that consider hosting a GDF, funding dismissed as bribes by opponents. The facility would be 200 to 1,000 metres below the surface. The BEIS MPs said: “We support the government’s view that it is conceivable for a GDF to be designed in a way that would be acceptable to communities, preserve the socioeconomic benefits that national parks and AONBs currently bring them and avoid any intrusive surface facility in conservation areas.” The energy minister Richard Harrington, giving evidence to the committee on 10 July, said: “I am not saying we should have them on national parks, but it would be very wrong to exclude them at the moment.” He said the government wanted to “ensure that the siting process has sufficient flexibility to identify the safest location for a GDF over the lifetime of the facility”. Harrington has said construction of the GDF would create 1,000 jobs and running it would create 600 more. Ruth Bradshaw at the Campaign for National Parks said: “Our national parks are precious national assets with, at least theoretically, the highest level of protection through the planning system. The proposed nuclear storage facility is completely contrary to the purposes of national parks.” Emma Marrington at the Campaign to Protect Rural England said: “Where such major development takes place we destroy beautiful landscapes and ruin our opportunity to pass on a beautiful piece of countryside to the next generation.” “Radioactive byproducts are yet another reason the government must stop building dirty, dangerous and expensive nuclear power stations,” said Lucas. “The future is in clean, renewable energy like wind and solar.” Greenpeace UK’s Kate Blagojevic said: “It’s mystifying why the UK, alone among major western nations, insists on propping up this obsolete 20th-century technology.” In the 1980s and 1990s the UK spent £400m examining a proposed GDF site near Sellafield that was eventually abandoned due to the highly complex and fractured nature of the geology."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/nov/22/centrica-shares-british-gas-customers-numbers-fall","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-22T17:17:25Z","webTitle":"Centrica shares sink to near 15-year low as customers numbers fall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/22/centrica-shares-british-gas-customers-numbers-fall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/nov/22/centrica-shares-british-gas-customers-numbers-fall","fields":{"headline":"Centrica shares sink to near 15-year low as customers numbers fall","bodyText":"Shares in Centrica, the owner of British Gas, have tumbled to a near 15-year low after it revealed it was losing more than 90,000 customers a month and faced a £70m hit from the forthcoming price cap. The UK’s biggest energy company has also been affected by two nuclear power stations being taken offline and outages at its oil and gas fields. Centrica shares have fallen 18% since July, and are down 57% since the former BP executive Iain Conn was appointed chief executive in July 2014. Conn insisted cost-cutting targets were on track to make £200m of savings this year. Amid intense competition, British Gas lost 372,000 customer accounts in the four months to October, a period when it hiked its default tariff for the second time this year. However, analysts said the figures showed a slight slowdown in the number of households taking their custom elsewhere. In the year to date, the number of customers leaving per month had reduced from 100,000 a month to 90,000, Jefferies bank said. British Gas is still comfortably the largest energy supplier, with 12.16m customer accounts, dwarfing the other big five. It has reduced its exposure to the government’s default tariff price cap, which takes effect on 1 January, by about a quarter. The number of customers on such default tariffs is 3.1 million, down from 4.3 million at the start of 2018. Despite that shift, the company admitted it still faced a one-off hit of £70m in the first three months of next year, owing to the way the energy regulator, Ofgem, had set the final level of the cap. The cap is set at £1,137 for a household with typical consumption, compared with £1,205 for British Gas’s default tariff. Peter Earl, the head of energy at comparethemarket.com, said people were “getting wise” to how poorly priced the company was compared with rivals, and the price cap was not the real problem. “Centrica blaming the price cap is a red herring,” he added. In the short term, Centrica has been affected by closures at the Hunterston B and Dungeness B power stations, owing to inspections of cracks in graphite bricks at the reactors’ core. The company is trying to sell its 20% stake in the UK’s nuclear plants. In a trading statement, Centrica said oil and gas output had also fallen 5% for the year because of outages. It was also waiting to hear from government on the “full implications” of the UK’s capacity market being suspended last week, it added. Payments from the government, designed to ensure winter power supplies, were ruled illegal state aid by the European court of justice. Experts at USB bank believe the company was expecting £14m of payments under the scheme this year, or 2% of expected net income. The negative reaction from investors appears to have been driven by earnings per share for the year now being expected at 11.5p, down from a previous consensus of 12.8p."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/25/government-rejects-plan-for-tidal-lagoon-in-swansea","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T18:06:56Z","webTitle":"Government rejects plan for £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/25/government-rejects-plan-for-tidal-lagoon-in-swansea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/25/government-rejects-plan-for-tidal-lagoon-in-swansea","fields":{"headline":"Government rejects plan for £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea","bodyText":"The government has rejected plans for a £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay, dashing industry hopes of Britain leading development of a new source of renewable energy and sparking widespread criticism. Ministers said the project, which would have been subsidised through household energy bills for decades, was too expensive compared with alternatives such as offshore windfarms and nuclear power. The business secretary, Greg Clark, told parliament he had “left no stone unturned” in considering whether to support the scheme. “The inescapable conclusion of an extensive analysis is, however novel and appealing the proposal that has been made is … the cost that would be incurred by consumers and taxpayers would be so much higher than alternative sources of low-carbon power that it would be irresponsible to enter into a contract with the provider,” he said. Clark said backing a series of lagoons would cost the average consumer £700 more by 2050, compared with a mix of offshore wind and nuclear power. The capital cost for the lagoon, per unit of electricity generated, would be more than three times as much as the Hinkley Point C power station, he said. The minister said the government’s analysis had concluded there was little potential for cost reductions from future lagoons and limited local economic benefits. However, the long-awaited decision was condemned by the renewable energy industry, green groups and MPs. Mark Shorrock, the chief executive of the company behind the project, Tidal Lagoon Power, accused Clark of being misinformed. “This is a vote of no interest in Wales, no confidence in British manufacturing and no care for the planet,” he said. Labour said it was “remarkably ironic” that the announcement came on the same day as a vote on Heathrow airport expansion. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: “Once again the Tories have defied all logic and failed to make the right decision for our economy, the people of Wales and the future of our planet.” Carolyn Harris, the Labour MP for Swansea East, where the lagoon would have been based, told Clark: “You will never understand the frustration and anger felt in our city today.” Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, formally tabled a vote of no confidence in the secretary of state for Wales, Alun Cairns, at the Welsh assembly. The Plaid assembly member Simon Thomas said: “The UK government has time and time again failed to invest in Wales. “The failed electrification of Wales’ railways, and now the rejection of the tidal lagoon prove that the secretary of state for Wales has no credibility and is not fit to represent Wales in public office. He must resign at once.” The trade body RenewableUK said it was disappointed by the rejection, while the Green party co-leader Caroline Lucas said it was “a double blow” because jobs and green energy production would be lost. Clark defended the government’s stance, saying it believed in renewable energy. He disclosed that he had more than 10 meetings this year alone with the Welsh government, which had offered a £200m equity stake or loan to make the project viable. Clark’s statement comes nearly 18 months after an independent government review strongly backed the scheme. Charles Hendry, the report’s author and a former energy minister, said the Swansea project would add the cost of only a pint of milk to annual energy bills and provide predictable, low-carbon electricity. Hendry told the Guardian that the government had failed to recognise the longer lifetime of lagoons compared to alternatives. “The offshore wind turbines will have to have been replaced three or four times during the lifetime of a lagoon; a nuclear plant would only last half as long,” he said. The project’s dismissal comes shortly after ministers said they were considering taking a multibillion-pound stake in a new nuclear power station at Wylfa in Wales. That reversed a decades-long policy of avoiding direct state ownership and will have made it possible to aim for a subsidy price much lower than the lagoon’s. The Swansea scheme’s planned generating capacity is about a 10th of Wylfa but backers said it could be followed by five large-scale lagoons, providing a home-grown source of renewable energy, jobs and an export opportunity. Gloucester-based Tidal Lagoon Power had hoped to agree a guaranteed power price with the government – known as a contract for difference – for the “pathfinder” lagoon at Swansea. The Swansea project envisaged a U-shaped breakwater built across the bay and the tide passing through 16 turbines, generating power for 155,000 homes. First proposed in 2011, the lagoon won backing from the then chancellor George Osborne, who used his 2015 budget to announce the government was commencing negotiations with Tidal Lagoon Power for the plan. Clark insisted that if future tidal lagoons could demonstrate value for money, the government would consider them. However, industry observers think Monday’s rejection is likely to kill off prospects for any future lagoons in the UK. Other technologies that harness the power of the tides are still seen as having potential."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2019/dec/07/frankie-boyle-election-countdown-praying-prorogue-next-parliament","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-07T08:00:06Z","webTitle":"Frankie Boyle’s election countdown: 'You’ll be praying they prorogue the next parliament'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/07/frankie-boyle-election-countdown-praying-prorogue-next-parliament","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2019/dec/07/frankie-boyle-election-countdown-praying-prorogue-next-parliament","fields":{"headline":"Frankie Boyle’s election countdown: 'You’ll be praying they prorogue the next parliament'","bodyText":"As the body politic convulses, as the abyss avoids our gaze, we near the end of another election at the behest of a political class that has paid as much attention to David Cameron’s fixed terms as he did to people with emphysema slowly dying over a wood lathe. Christmas seems a strange time for a Tory government to call an election; possibly they guessed that it would be hard for Labour to sell hope in winter; possibly they judged that goodwill to all men would be at its lowest after people had endured a December of accidentally answering the door to a canvasser because they thought it was an Amazon package. Then again, Conservatives would say that the story of Christmas chimes with their values, as it involves a pregnant refugee being treated quite badly. Brexit supporters are surely among the most likely to get out and vote, especially now Jeremy Kyle isn’t on in the daytime any more. It was impossible to predict that the whole country would be thrown into crisis by middle-aged men outraged about Europe making decisions for them (these are people whose wives buy their socks), but I can understand their subsequent disillusionment. If 434 MPs vote for a general election, we instantly get one; if 0.14% of the populace vote for Boris Johnson, we instantly get him; but if 52% of the electorate vote for Brexit, they get three years of what feels like trying to shit out a pool table. Essentially, Brexit has proved impossible to deliver: turns out it’s tricky for English voters to take back control of their borders when one of them is in someone else’s country. Many people wish David Cameron had never called the referendum in the first place. It says a lot about how badly the last couple of years have gone, that there’s a guy who destroyed Libya, presided over needless austerity and fucked a pig, and we wish that he’d just used his own judgment. Let’s begin with the Tories. The cabinet is Dickensian in the purest sense: the sort of people who would need more than two ghosts to change their behaviour. After an uncertain start, Jacob Rees-Mogg has had a pretty good campaign, onboard an Arctic clipper ship, nailed into a coffin of earth from his constituency. It’s interesting that someone who thinks ordinary people lack common sense is so heavily invested in upholding the result of a referendum, but like so many lesser ironies in this election, we simply don’t have the time. When people say “The mask has slipped!” after various cabinet gaffes, there must be a moment when the minister wonders whether they have accidentally come out wearing one of the actual masks they wear to the various Eyes Wide Shut-style parties that dot their social calendar at this time of year; their fingers moving reflexively towards their face to see if they’ve worn the head of a golden ibis to talk to Phillip Schofield. The Conservatives seem to have focused on the phrase “Get Brexit Done”, which has all the conviction of your dad hitting the arms of his chair and saying, “Right…” We also seem to be hearing a lot about “Unleashing Britain’s potential”, despite most of our potential being for food riots, and perhaps some kind of race war. The Conservative manifesto contains elements of both Thatcherism and Reaganism, in that it seems to have been written by someone with dementia. There was probably a discussion about whether to release a manifesto at all or simply airdrop scratchcards over key marginals. Boris Johnson, who looks like something you’d keep your pyjamas in, and who no reasonable person would choose to lead them into a chorus, has a strangely hunched demeanour; perhaps from all the time he spends crammed inside married women’s wardrobes, like a randy jack-in-the-box. This confused sex yeti has been booed by nurses: people who can remove a dressing, examine a festering wound, and still look up at you with a smile. Has any party ever elected a new leader so tired and dated? With a delivery best approximated as a living checklist of stroke warnings, his bumbling posho shtick almost resembles buffering, a kind of 3G Wodehouse. He doesn’t even seem to enjoy it; throughout the campaign he’s sported a face that looks as if it’s been kneaded by a baker going through a particularly bitter divorce, and the irony that comes into his eyes every time he crowbars in a catchphrase means that he breaks the fourth wall more than Deadpool. We thought the office of prime minister was what he lived for, his consuming ambition. It’s all been a bit like hearing Tony The Tiger talk about his diabetes. Johnson’s deep investment in democracy is highlighted by the fact that his government has been dominated by an unelected special adviser. Usually people with levels of mental activity as low as Johnson’s aren’t surrounded by advisers, but their weeping parents and a member of their favourite boy band. Dominic Cummings looks like he works in television (which I think might be the worst thing you can say about anyone), has the air of a startled testicle, and the name of a character in a porn parody of The Talented Mr Ripley (“The Talentless Fister Ripped Me”). Everyone who’s bored with Johnson pretending to be an idiot should look at Cummings and realise these people are far more dangerous when they pretend to be clever. It’s perfectly obvious why Johnson has been able to take power: he has an instinctive grasp on Brexit as rightwing eschatology, and he’s used to getting his own way, be it in the halls of Westminster or elbowing siblings off of nanny’s nipples. It’s only when you look at the hideous Tarot formed by his cabinet that you get a true picture of the depravity into which we are sinking. Take Michael Gove, a revanchist endorsement of the science of physiognomy. In any other era Gove would be seen as a uniquely unctuous, unlikable and profoundly talentless figure. Now he’s hardly even remarkable. Gove – looking like someone took all the flesh out of a serial killer’s drains and forced it into some brogues; like Davros fell out of his Dalek; like a rushed cartoon of a horny snail – is somehow not the worst person in cabinet, or even his own marriage. Against pushback from Sajid Javid and Priti Patel, Dominic Raab is attempting to get up to 60 British children back from camps in northern Syria before they freeze to death over the winter. That Raab, the flesh suit of a sentient virus with a forehead vein like a B&amp;B kettle-cord, is somehow the moral heart of this enterprise tells you all you need to know. In all likelihood, you’ll be praying that they prorogue the next parliament. Someone else who will still be here after the Rapture is the Brexit party’s Nigel Farage. I thought one of the advantages of the Brexit vote was that he might disappear; having him back in public life is a bit like watching a suicide bomber doing a comeback tour. Of course, it would have been nice to see him actually running in the election, particularly from a pack of wild dogs. As for the Lib Dems – well, I thought we’d really miss Tim Farron, bumping around the country on a deserted coach and performing Blue Peter tasks in front of people terrified that he might start talking about gay sex. Jo Swinson has grown on me, and seems to exist as a satisfying, subtle and damning satire of humanity. Swinson’s election started out relatively positively, possibly because people hadn’t heard her speak yet. It quickly became clear that she had the gravitas of a re-education camp supply teacher, and was launching a kind of charm retreat that seemed to involve loans for renting flats and permanent austerity. Some might see misogyny in this reaction to her, but I’m fairly sure I just hate her for being from Milngavie. Labour’s idea to run an election campaign on policy in the middle of all this is a little bit like reciting your poetry at an orgy. Jeremy Corbyn, perhaps weighing up whether he could have more influence by simply dying and haunting his successor, has benefitted from becoming slightly calmer over the course of the campaign. Aggression isn’t a good look for him, shifting Corbyn from Rabbit in Winnie the Pooh towards the territory where you’d expect his face to be captioned with “police suspect the real figure may be much higher”. Labour’s campaign initially struggled to find the right note of warmth or optimism. Normally in a general election, there’s so little mention of Scotland it’s like watching coverage of a major football tournament, but Labour seemed pointlessly determined to get across the message that they would deny a second independence referendum. The Corbyn project started out as a piece of moralising – a token candidate standing in a Labour leadership election to remind the party of its principles – and his Labour is at its weakest when these roots show: it can come across as patronising and entitled. I think Labour presents itself better during elections because it is forced to be more practical. The whole Corbyn thing, at its best, is a sort of Ealing comedy about some old bloke who gets called off his allotment to try to form a government, but it needs to promise a third act where something actually happens. Labour’s campaign also demonstrates the limits of social media compared with establishment media power. If polls at the time of writing are to be believed, owning several TV stations and newspapers still seems to be more important than the democratisation of the ability to troll celebrity Jews. Before the campaign, there seemed to be a belief among Labour party members that it fared better in elections because of rules about electoral media balance, perhaps because they misconstrued the establishment complacency at the last election. Of course, Labour has been monstered in the media throughout the campaign, and largely been judged by different standards than the Conservatives. Even the gold standard of scrutiny that Johnson dodged was just being interviewed by his former boss at the Spectator. Media plurality is an issue we need to address in this country: the alternative is living in a timeline where, because Corbyn has wonky glasses, in a couple of years you’ll be living in a tent city outside an Amazon warehouse trying to GoFund a tonsillectomy. The Tories calling Corbyn a communist and a threat to national security after handing nuclear power plants to the Chinese is a bit like getting a bollocking off Charles Manson for putting down slug pellets. Perhaps in a few years our troops will reflect on what a harmless enemy Corbyn actually was, as they stare up at an AI minotaur, pinning them to the floor with a stainless steel hoof and holding their extracted vascular system aloft like a Ford Focus wiring-loom. You won’t be surprised to learn that I won’t be voting Tory on Thursday, for much the same reasons that I won’t be spending the day kicking children and pensioners into traffic. It’s depressing to think how many polling stations are in schools, and how many people will vote Conservative after walking past a motivational rainbow. As we saw in Stanley Johnson’s Pinocchio gaffe, there is a problem with our elites programming their traumatised children with the idea that they are born to rule. It becomes almost impossible, as a class, to hide your contempt. It’s difficult to keep lying convincingly about things you’ve convinced yourself your audience are too stupid to notice. This current iteration of Conservatism, a kind of mutant nationalism that insists all our infrastructure has to be owned by other countries, has nowhere to go but into an asset-stripped, deregulated wasteland. I don’t know how anyone votes for that, or what happens after they do. British people don’t get on well enough to form militia. I don’t want to end on a note of pessimism. Instead, I’d like to share with you my two favourite quotes. The first, is a really famous one. Kurt Vonnegut asked his adult son what he thought the meaning of life was, and his son replied: “We are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is.” The second is what David Chase, the creator of The Sopranos, said about the ending of the final episode: “Well, what Tony should have been thinking, I guess, and what we all should be thinking – although we can’t live that way – is that life is really short. And there are good times in it and there are bad times in it. And that we don’t know why we’re here, but we do know that 20 miles up it’s freezing cold, it’s a freezing cold universe, but here we have this thing called love, which is our only defence, really, against all that cold, and that it’s a very brief interval and that, when it’s over, I think you’re probably always blindsided by it.” Twenty miles up, it’s a freezing cold universe, we only have the human connections we make here, nothing is permanent, and love is our only defence. I suggest we all vote accordingly, and try to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is. • If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/nov/13/tell-us-what-issues-will-decide-the-election-where-you-live","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-14T14:15:21Z","webTitle":"Tell us what issues will decide the election where you live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/13/tell-us-what-issues-will-decide-the-election-where-you-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/13/tell-us-what-issues-will-decide-the-election-where-you-live","fields":{"headline":"Tell us what issues will decide the election where you live","bodyText":"Over the course of the general election campaign, Guardian reporters will be spending significant amounts of time in constituencies across the country to report on the local currents that will shape the national future. We would like to find out what issues matter to voters on the ground, so if you live in any of the constituencies we’re reporting from, tell us what you think. We will be updating the following list of places we are visiting during the election campaign. Belfast East Traditionally a unionist seat, Belfast East is facing deep political uncertainty. It’s held by the DUP which supports Brexit but is not happy with Boris Johnson’s deal in case it weakens Northern Ireland’s position in the UK. Several pro-remain parties such as Sinn Féin, the SDLP and the Greens have stepped aside in the constituency to give Naomi Long, leader of the centrist Alliance party, a chance at winning the seat. So this election will also be a test of whether the Alliance can rally enough voters who have previously voted along unionist or nationalist lines. Let us know what issues will decide your vote here. Bishop Auckland Bishop Auckland, apart from a brief hiatus in the 1930s, has voted Labour for over a century. But it also voted by a big margin for Brexit. Will lifelong Labour voters who voted leave turn to the Conservative Party to “get Brexit done”, as Boris Johnson hopes? Or will the Brexit Party split the leave vote? If the Tories are to win a majority they must win northern towns like this, where Labour’s Helen Goodman has a majority of just 502. If you live in Bishop Auckland, you can share your views with us here. Camborne and Redruth Camborne, Redruth and Hayle make up an urban area, pockets of which are ranked among the most deprived in the country. The constituency also has a rural spread. It voted Leave in the EU referendum. Employment, affordable housing and social isolation are among concerns highlighted in the area. Conservative George Eustice has held the seat since it was created in 2010. In 2017 he saw his majority reduced from 7,004 to 1,577. Labour now sees it within grasp, and will be hoping it provides a breakthrough in Cornwall where all six constituencies are currently Conservative. We would like to know what factors are key to determining your vote. What are the local issues? And will they trump Brexit and national politics at the ballot box? Tell us what you think by here. Canterbury Are you a young voter in Canterbury? The Guardian is reporting on the battle in one of the most interesting constituencies in the country, which showed the unexpected strength of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party in the 2017 election. Two years later, we’re keen to hear from voters in the Kent city about their views on the election. We’re particularly interested in hearing from young people and students who were crucial in helping Labour win the historically Tory seat in 2017. Are the young people in Canterbury who swung the election last time still motivated or are they split? With the decline of Facebook, how are volunteers and organisers from the main parties getting their message across online? Let us know what you think here. Chingford and Woodford Green The constituency has been represented by Iain Duncan Smith for 27 years, but his majority has fallen sharply and the Labour candidate Faiza Shaheen hopes to oust him by focusing on the cuts he helped implement as a Tory minister. Will the contest be driven by the legacy of austerity? Or will Brexit, which divided this area almost 50:50, dominate this election too? We’d like to understand the big issues facing you and your family and which policies matter to you. If you live in the constituency tell us about your views here. Cities of London and Westminster In the constituency of Cities of London and Westminster, which ranges from wealthy neighbourhoods such as Mayfair and Belgravia to more socially mixed areas such as Soho, Paddington and Pimlico, issues range from homelessness, air quality and local development to the role of the Square Mile. If you live in the area, share your thoughts with us here. Darlington If you live in Darlington, how happy are you with the state of housing, work, community relations, policing and health services? Who has an impact on your community that we should meet? Are there issues in your family that create division? Are you thinking of switching your vote? Or perhaps you feel disengaged from national politics altogether. Get in touch with us here. Dudley North Dudley North is the fourth most marginal seat in the UK. In 2017 Labour’s Ian Austin won by just 22 votes and the previous year 71% voted to leave the EU. This you would think would make it prime Brexit party territory however in the past few weeks there have been some surprises. Rupert Lowe, the West Midlands MEP and former chairman of Southampton football club, announced he would no longer be standing for Farage’s party. Meanwhile, Austin, who was the Labour MP for the constituency for 14 years dramatically quit the party in February, telling voters to support the Conservatives in the election instead as he believed Jeremy Corbyn was “completely unfit” to be prime minister. We’re keen to hear from voters in Dudley North about their views on the election. We’re particularly interested in hearing from people who feel that Dudley North may have been a target for a far right movement? Whether people in the area feel an affinity with the Brexit party and/or the EDL? Anyone that has experienced any far right racism or come across any far right political rallying? Let us know what you think here. Glasgow North East Glasgow North East is a key Labour-SNP marginal, which has twice changed hands in the last two general elections. It has some of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK, with amongst the lowest life expectancy rates. Given how popular the SNP is in Scotland overall, this seat is a key test of whether Jeremy Corbyn’s anti-austerity platform can cut through. If you live in Glasgow North East, can you tell us what will decide your vote? We’d like to understand the big issues facing you and your family and which policies matter to you. How happy are you with the state of housing, work, community relations, policing and health services? Share your views here. Morecombe and Lunesdale The seat is considered a bellwether and has been Conservative throughout its history, except for during the Tony Blair years, with the Tories winning by a 1,399 majority in 2017. There is great wealth but also significant poverty. There is a higher proportion of young people not in education, employment or training than local averages. We’re particularly interested in hearing from people who live or work in Heysham, a large coastal village that has huge strategic importance for the north-west. It is home to two nuclear power stations and a port, a major distribution hub between the UK and Ireland, which will be affected significantly by Brexit. Share your views with us here. Norwich North In Norwich North, Conservative MP Chloe Smith’s majority was trimmed to just 507 over Labour in 2017. Smith, who won the seat from Labour during a byelection in 2009, would have lost had every Green party voter (or Lib Dem) backed Labour. Norwich has a reputation for being one of the country’s most environmentally-minded cities. The Green party’s nine city councillors make it the second-largest party after Labour on the council. The Norwich South MP, Labour’s Clive Lewis, was the co-author with the Greens’ Caroline Lucas of the Green New Deal bill. The city has lost hundreds of manufacturing jobs this year, with factories closing including local icon Colman’s (the mustard-makers), a print works and, in Norwich North, an electric heater manufacturer. Patrick is particularly interested in hearing from Norwich North residents who have lost their jobs, and finding out how their experiences are shaping their political views and voting intentions. Does Labour’s version of a Green New Deal offer them any hope? You can get in touch with us here. Peterborough The Guardian will be reporting from Peterborough, where people have seen public spending fall by £262 a year per person since the start of austerity in 2010 – typical of the UK as a whole. We’d also like to know how you following this election whether traditional media such as TV and newspapers or online news sites or social media. Do you belong to local Facebook or WhatsApp groups? If you live in Peterborough, let us know about the issues affecting you here. St Albans St Albans is a prosperous constituency, with a historic cathedral town at its heart, which regularly pops up near the top of lists of ‘best places to live in the UK’. It has been mostly Conservative voting for decades, although it was captured by Labour in 1945, and New Labour for two terms from 1997. Now it is a major target for the Liberal Democrats. They hope to capitalise on the fact it is heavily remain backing and its incumbent MP Anne Main is a hardline leaver, who narrowly survived a deselection attempt in 2009 after an expenses row. To win the seat in this election the Liberal Democrat candidate, Daisy Cooper will need to take votes from both the two main parties to overturn a 6000 strong majority. Share your views here. Southampton Itchen In Southampton Itchen, the Conservative Royston Smith is defending one of the smallest majorities in the UK, just 31 votes ahead of Labour. Will the contest be dominated by Brexit or more local issues? We are keen to hear from you about what your concerns and priorities are. Southampton Itchen is one of the constituencies where the student vote could make a big difference. If you are a student in Southampton, we’d like to understand the big issues which concern you and which policies matter to you. How do you feel about tuition fees, student debt and the high cost of living in student accommodation? We’d also like to hear from voters in the constituency who’re not students, what are the important national and local issues that will decide your vote? Share your views here. Stevenage The Guardian’s Gary Younge will be covering the election from Stevenage for two main reasons. First, he grew up there and second, it is a classical bellwether constituency. For almost half a century Stevenage has always voted for whichever party became the government. If you live in Stevenage, can you tell us what will decide your vote?

Wrexham The Tories are hoping to make dramatic gains in Wales – traditionally a Labour stronghold. One of the main battlegrounds is Wrexham. Labour has won here in north Wales since 1935 but at the 2017 election the majority for Ian Lucas was only 1,832. Lucas, a pro-remainer, has stepped down and the Tories are hopeful their candidate, Sarah Atherton, a former soldier, nurse, social worker and micro-brewery owner, can win. The constituency is for Brexit, with 59% voting leave. But the Brexit Party is standing, which could split the pro-leave vote.

The motion passed after a debate, and vote, over whether speaker Nancy Pelosi violated decorum in calling Trump’s racist comments racist. Republicans mostly defended Trump against charges of racism. Senate leader Mitch McConnell said, “The president’s not a racist” and House minority leader Kevin McCarthy accused Democrats of a cynical political ploy. Aide Kellyanne Conway demanded to know the ethnic identity of a reporter who questioned where it was that Trump wished the congresswomen to “go back” to. Watch the video here. The senate armed services committee held a confirmation hearing on defense secretary nominee Mark Esper. Elsewhere on the Hill, executives from big tech were called to hearings on privacy and censorship. Two lawsuits challenging Trump’s new asylum restrictions were filed today -- one by immigrant advocacy groups in DC federal court and another by the ACLU, in California. The House antitrust committee questioned representatives from Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon in a hearing focused on and anti-competitive behavior in online marketplaces. Trump campaign tapped the president’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump to spearhead a Women for Trump initiative. Reporting on the House resolution that just passed, Sabrina Siddiqui writes: The measure, which formally rebuked the president’s comments as “racist”, was approved on a mostly partisan-line vote of 240 to 187. The vote came days after Trump’s tweets about four newly elected Democratic lawmakers – Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan – sparked a widespread uproar. Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley and Tlaib were all born in the US, while Omar is a naturalized American citizen who arrived in the country at a young age as a Somali refugee. “Every single member of this institution, Democratic and Republican, should join us in condemning the president’s racist tweets,” the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said on the House floor. “To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people.” Here’s a video of the debate, as it happened: Senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris of California says she has also been told, “Go back to where you came from.” And several other lawmakers have had the same racist trope lobbed at them. HuffPo asked dozens of lawmakers, both Democratic and Republican, whether they’ve ever been told to “go back.” Nearly every minority lawmaker said yes. Every white lawmaker said no. “I’ve been told many times to ‘go back to China,’ even though I’m of Japanese descent, because people are prone to stereotypes,” Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) said. “Asian Americans, among other minority groups, often experience the feeling that they don’t belong in this country.” “Way, way back when, somebody yelled that. Not lately,” said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii). “However, the president seems to be resurrecting that.” Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) remembers hearing the taunt throughout his life, starting when he was a young boy. “At the age of six, my family and I were in a mall, and these two old ladies next to my family and my three sisters said, ‘Go back to Mexico.’ I think I heard it all the time in high school from every kid who hated me,” he said. “I heard it when I was in the Marine Corps. I heard it when I left the Marine Corps. I heard it in Arizona. I can’t even count the times I’ve heard it.” Lawmakers voted to officially condemn Trump’s racist attack on the four progressive congresswomen. The resolution states the House of Representatives “strongly condemns” Trump’s “racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.” Representatives voted largely along party lines — 235 Democrats were joined by four Republicans in support of the measure. The Associated Press reports that the Nuclear Regulatory Agency is looking to decrease inspections at nuclear power plants. Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff is recommending that the agency cut back on inspections at the country’s nuclear reactors, a cost-cutting move promoted by the nuclear power industry but denounced by opponents as a threat to public safety. The recommendations, made public Tuesday, include reducing the time and scope of annual inspections at the nation’s 90-plus nuclear power plants. Some other inspections would be cut from every two years to every three years... The nuclear power industry has prodded regulators to cut inspections, saying the nuclear facilities are operating well and that the inspections are a financial burden for power providers. Two lawsuits challenging Trump’s new asylum restrictions have been filed today. The latest was filed in DC federal court, by two immigration advocacy groups. The first, from earlier today, was filed by the ACLU. Both lawsuits are challenging new rules from the Trump administration that would end asylum protections for almost all migrants who arrive at the US-Mexico border. As The Guardian reported yesterday: According to the new rules, any asylum seekers who pass through another country before arriving at the southern border – including children traveling on their own – will not be eligible for asylum if they failed to apply first in their country of transit. They would only be eligible for US asylum if their application was turned down elsewhere. The change would affect the vast majority of migrants arriving through Mexico. Most of those currently come from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, but an increasing number are from Haiti, Cuba and countries further afield in Africa and Asia. As the House continues to debate a resolution condemning Trump’s racist comments, The Washington Post has published an op-ed from representative Ted Lieu, a Democrat from California, about times people have told him, and still tell him to “Go back to China.” I served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force and currently serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. Yet I still experience people telling me to “go back” to China or North Korea or Japan. Like many immigrants, I have learned to brush off this racist insult. I never thought the president of the United States would tell members of Congress to “go back” to another country President Trump has often crossed the line of what constitutes decent behavior. But this time feels different, because he is now attacking legal immigration and U.S. citizenship. His statements on Sunday and since then imply that immigrants are somehow less loyal to our country, less American, and that we should “go back” or “leave” if we disagree with him. Twenty years ago, I wrote an op-ed in The Post about what it was like to wear my Air Force uniform while people questioned my loyalty to the United States, all because of the color of my skin. I was in my Air Force blues when a woman asked if I was in the Chinese air force. The suspicion that immigrants are not to be trusted or are unpatriotic is not just wrong, it is un-American. And dangerous. The House antitrust committee has just completed its questioning of representatives from Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon in a hearing focused on competition — and anti-competitive behavior — in online marketplaces. The four companies spent much of their time claiming that they face fierce competition, to considerable skepticism from committee members. Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic congresswoman who represents Amazon’s hometown of Seattle, drew quick blood with sharp questioning of Facebook and Amazon. She pressed Facebook’s director of public policy Matt Perault on whether the company had devoted resources to identifying promising startups and targeting them for acquisition – a charge Perault denied despite a very public record of Facebook engaging in this behavior. Facebook’s use of a VPN app called Onavo to collect data on rival apps and inform acquisitions such has WhatsApp has been widely reported. The company has also aggressively copied features by startups that have rejected acquisition, including Snapchat and Houseparty. Jayapal also pressed Nate Sutton, Amazon’s associate general counsel for competition, on whether Amazon uses the data it controls on its platform to compete with third-party sellers when it makes its own private brand version of a product – another widely reported practice that Sutton nevertheless denied engaging in. Cicilline further pressed Sutton on the question, reminding the witness that he was under oath. “We use data to serve our customers,” Sutton said. “We don’t use individual seller data to directly compete with them.” Amazon also faced sharp questioning over the various fees that it levies against sellers, and reports that third-party sellers are pressured to pay Amazon for advertising and fulfillment services in order to compete. This article was amended on 17 July 2019 to correct the last name of Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. And they voted to allow Pelosi to speak, and allow discussion of the Democrats’ resolution to condemn Trump’s comments to continue. Democratic senator and presidential contender Elizabeth Warren who is not involved in the hubbub signaled support for Pelosi. And the “Nays” have it. The House votes 190 to 232 against the motion to strike Pelosi’s words from the record. They are also voting on whether to allow Pelosi to speak for the rest of the day. Matt Fuller of HuffPost explains: Meanwhile, Rep. Al Green, a Democrat of Texas says he’s planning to file articles of impeachment against President Trump tonight. As The Washington Post reports: Green’s move will force House Democrats to deal with the issue in the near term. Under House rules, Democratic leadership can decide to try to table the impeachment articles, effectively killing them for now and risk criticism from the party’s liberal base; refer them to the House Judiciary Committee for possible consideration; or allow the vote to proceed. If leaders do nothing, Green can force a vote on the impeachment articles in two legislative days. The move comes as more than 80 members of the House have called for launching an impeachment inquiry. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has resisted, however, encouraging her chairmen to keep investigating the president. The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to receive testimony from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III next Wednesday. Maanvi Singh, here, taking up the torch on the West Coast. Members of the House are currently voting on whether to strike from the record House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s remarks calling out Trump’s racist comments. With this vote, members of Congress could essentially change parliamentary precedent stating that lawmakers may not refer to the president making “a bigoted or racist statement.” Here’s a summary of where things stand: Republicans defended Donald Trump against charges of racism after Trump in a weekend tweet told members of congress who also are women of color to “go home” to their countries. “The president’s not a racist,” senate leader Mitch McConnell said. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy accused Democrats of a cynical political ploy. Trump defended himself, tweeting, “Those Tweets were NOT Racist. I don’t have a Racist bone in my body!” Trump resumed attacking the congresswomen, accusing them of failing to love their country for their exposé of detention center abuses. “They can leave. They can stay,” he said. Aide Kellyanne Conway demanded to know the ethnic identity of a reporter who questioned where it was that Trump wished the congresswomen to “go back” to. Watch video here. A planned House vote on a resolution condemning Trump’s tweets as racist was delayed momentarily by a parliamentary scrap on the House floor after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stood on the floor and called Trump’s remarks racist, in apparent violation of rules of decorum. Republicans demanded that Pelosi retract the statement which she refused to do. A House vote on the matter was under way. The senate armed services committee held a confirmation hearing on defense secretary nominee Mark Esper. Elsewhere on the Hill, executives from big tech were called to hearings on privacy and censorship. Drama on the floor: Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat and senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus, abandoned the chair as fighting continued over Pelosi’s comments on Trump’s racist tweets. “We don’t ever, ever want to pass up, it seems, an opportunity to escalate, and that’s what this is…we want to just fight,” Cleaver said. Dropping his gavel, he added, “I abandon the chair.” But the House speaker is showing no signs of backing down. Asked by an NBC News reporter whether she would revise her remarks, Pelosi replied, “No, not at all.” The Trump campaign tapped Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law, to spearhead a Women for Trump kickoff event at a casino outside Philadelphia this morning. Here’s Reuters: Lara Trump urged several hundred women to ask their neighbors whether they have more money in their pockets and are paying less taxes since Trump became president. “The reality is that for a vast majority of Americans the answer is yes,” she told supporters - mostly white women - at the event in the King of Prussia suburb. According to the Reuters/Ipsos 2018 Election Day poll, 56% of suburban women voters in Pennsylvania disapproved of Trump’s handling of the country, with 40% saying they approved. Read further. Senator Ted Cruz is firing questions at the Google “censorship” hearing before the judiciary committee. Cruz is questioning whether Google engages in inappropriate censorship, “choosing whether to amplify people’s voices... choosing what they see and what they listen to.” Karan Bhatia, veep for government affairs &amp; public policy at Google, is defending what he describes as the company’s standards for hiding or elevating content. You can watch here: House members are still going back and forth about whether Nancy Pelosi should be forced to withdraw her remarks on Trump’s racist tweets because they were “unparliamentary.” The drawn-out debate means that the actual vote on the resolution to condemn the president’s comments will likely be pushed until later this evening. Capitol Hill reporters versed in the minutiae of congressional decorum say the debate is centered on a rule barring “references to racial or other discrimination on the part of the President.” According to HuffPost’s Matt Fuller, if Pelosi does not withdraw her statement, the House may have to vote on the matter. After Trump backed down last week from a demand that a citizenship question be included on the 2020 Census, administration lawyers have been working with plaintiffs who sued the government to block the attempted move. The lawyers from both sides have informed a judge that they have reached an agreement that would lay the citizenship/2020 question to rest once and for all. The sides propose that the judge impose an order “permanently enjoining” attempts to add such a question to the 2020 census: A Republican congressman from Texas releases a statement saying he “strongly disagree[s]” with Trump’s racist tweets – without using the word “racist”. But Representative Ron Wright does say “when one becomes a citizen of this country, it no longer matters where they came from”: Republicans have requested that a statement by House speaker Nancy Pelosi on the House floor declaring that Trump is using disgraceful, disgusting and racist language be taken down, meaning deleted from the official record of the proceedings. Per the congressional research service: Representatives are prohibited from referring negatively to individual Members, identifiable groups of Members, the Speaker, the President, or the Vice President. This prohibition also has been applied to nominated candidates for President and Vice President, including those who are not Members of Congress or an incumbent President or Vice President. Similar restrictions apply to remarks about individual Senators. But Pelosi said she cleared her anticipated comments beforehand with the parliamentarian. It appears the refs are going to the tape on this one. Stay tuned. And here once again to lend some moral clarity to the situation, Anthony Scaramucci Here’s a bit of comic relief. A veteran congressman from New Jersey has taken an Onion spoof that he is angling for inclusion in the Ocasio-Cortez-Omar-Pressley-Tlaib “squad” and run with it: Update: congratulations, congressman. Hawaiian congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard has garnered little traction since she launched her presidential campaign. But the military veteran and staunch anti-interventionist is winning headlines today after campaign finance filings revealed a surprising donation: $5,600 from Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey. The donations were made the day after Gabbard’s appearance in the Democratic debates, where she turned in a performance that was surprisingly popular among sections of the “alt-right”, according to reports by BuzzFeed News and Mother Jones. Dorsey’s personal politics are somewhat oblique. He famously joined in protests in Ferguson, Missouri against the police killing of Mike Brown, appearing on stage with prominent protester DeRay McKesson wearing a Twitter-branded t-shirt reading “#StayWoke”. He also opposed a tax on wealthy San Francisco businesses that would help fund services for homeless people, and has drawn intense criticism for failing to crack down on white nationalists and other hate figures on Twitter. Gabbard is one of the handful of Democratic candidates who supports breaking up big tech companies, a policy position that could actually be helpful to Dorsey personally. One of his companies, Twitter, competes with Facebook on social networking, while the other, Square, is a payments processor that likely does not want to see Facebook muscle into that space. In late March, Dorsey donated $1000 to another long-shot Democratic candidate, Andrew Yang, according to FEC filings. The House Judiciary Committee’s hearing with executives from Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple has been delayed an hour due to a vote. But the line to get a seat for what is guaranteed to be a grilling from lawmakers on whether the tech giants’ market dominance stifles competition already stretches all the way down a Capitol Hill hallway, per a reporter there. Here’s some video of McConnell: Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has attempted to thread a needle in defending Trump against charges of racism, saying that legal immigration, as for example in his wife’s case, has “been reinvigorating America for hundreds of years”. Asked how he felt about Trump’s “go back to your country” line given that his wife, transportation secretary Elaine Chao, is a naturalized citizen who arrived in the United States as a child, McConnell responded: “Well the secretary of transportation came here at age 8, legally, not speaking a word of English, and has realized the American dream,” McConnell says. He calls legal immigration “a process of renewal that has gone on in this country for a very long time and we ought to renew it.” “Legal immigration has been a fulfilling of the American dream.... My wife is a good example of that,” he continues. “Look, I’m obviously a big fan of legal immigration, it’s been a big part of my family for a quarter of a century... it’s been reinvigorating America for hundreds of years.” But McConnell won’t condemn the president and depicts Trump’s racism as a two-sided war of words. “I think everybody ought to tone down their rhetoric,” he says. “The president’s not a racist. And I think the tone of all of this is not good for the country. But it’s coming from all ideological points of view... to single out any segment of this I think is a mistake.” For the record, only one side is telling people of color born in the United States to go back to their countries. But McConnell’s strategy here was notably different from that of the House leadership this morning, which simply dug in, vowed that Trump was not racist and basically suggested anyone who thought so was nuts. The House leadership looked as if it wanted to deepen the current argument. McConnell looked as if he was hoping to get past it. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell opens his news conference with a call for greater civility in [GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY] discourse. Saying political rhetoric has become “overheated”, McConnell called on leaders to “lower the temperature” and “raise the level of discourse.” Then they pivot to talk of tax cuts. The Republican leadership will formally recommend that members vote against a House resolution this evening condemning Trump’s racist tweets, Politico quotes a spokesperson for leadership as saying. That’s a signal to the rank-and-file that leadership is watching. The vote has become a loyalty test to party. The leadership did not need to draw such distinct battle lines. Or have the Democrats by bringing the resolution cornered the Republicans into making a racist Trump tweet into a party loyalty test? In any case it’s all hands on deck now. According to a report from the White House press pool, Trump has been asked where the four House Democratic congresswomen should go if they leave the United States. Trump says “they can stay” then attacks the members of Congress for their critique of the conditions inside migrant detention centers at the border, which critique sparked Trump’s racist tweets of Sunday. Trump accuses the members of Congress of not loving the USA. The members might reply that their whole point was that a great country like the United States can do better than caging children. But in Trump’s rubric criticism amounts to treason. He said: It’s up to them. Wherever they want – or they can stay. But they should love our country. They shouldn’t hate our country. I have clips right here. The most vile, horrible statements about our country. About Israel. About others. “It’s up to them. Do what they want. They can leave. They can stay. They should love our country, and they should work for the good of our country. Mitt Romney summons a masterfully mild framework for Trump’s racist attack on members of congress: it’s a failure of the duty to unite, you see. A federal judge has ordered Roger Stone, the former Trump adviser, to refrain from using social media after she found that he violated a previous gag order forbidding him from discussing his case online. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson told Stone on Tuesday that he could not use Instagram or other social media platforms while the case against him moves forward, the Associated Press reported. She said the punishment was necessary because he had proven unwilling to adhere to her orders and to refrain from publicly commenting on the case. Stone is charged with witness tampering and lying to congressional lawmakers in their investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. It can seem as if the Trump administration is in willful, determined pursuit of the destruction of the American ideal and legacy, as a melting pot nation that holds all individuals to be Americans first in the public square no matter their religions, ethnicities, races, identities or beliefs. First the president tells American citizens of color – members of congress, no less – to “go back” to their countries. Then Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, trying to deny that Trump’s tweets were racist, demands to know a reporter’s ethnic identity. Addressing reporters outside the White House, Conway insisted that Trump, by tweeting “Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came”, did not mean that the members of congress should visit countries once inhabited by their ancestors. But wait, said Andrew Feinberg, a White House reporter for Breakfast Media. So what “countries” was the president referring to, then? At which Conway made this jaw-dropping reply: “What’s your ethnicity?” Feinberg: Uh, why is that relevant? Conway: Because I’m asking you a question. My ancestors are from Ireland and Italy. Feinberg: My ethnicity is not relevant to the question. Conway: It is, because you’re asking about, he said ‘originally’. He said ‘originally from’. [Fact check: three of the four members of Congress in question are “originally from” the United States, unless where you were born... is not the same as where you are from... because you are... not white?] That’s a fairly powerful counterpoint to the op-ed this morning in the Washington Post by Conway’s husband, George Conway, titled “Trump is a racist president”: No matter how much I found him ultimately unfit, I still gave him the benefit of the doubt about being a racist. No matter how much I came to dislike him, I didn’t want to think that the president of the United States is a racial bigot. But Sunday left no doubt. Naivete, resentment and outright racism, roiled in a toxic mix, have given us a racist president. Mike Pence did not take questions about his boss’s racist tweets, or anything else, during an event where he unveiled the spacesuit worn by Neil Armstrong on the moon half a century ago. Speaking at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington on Tuesday, the vice president remained characteristically loyal. “Under President Trump’s leadership, it is now the policy of the United States of America to return to the moon within the next five years, and, from there, onto Mars,” he said. “I have a feeling that the man who wore the suit that we will unveil today would be glad to know that the first woman and the next man on the moon will also be an American. “Apollo 11 is the only event of the 20th century that stands a chance of being widely remembered in the 30th century. And that’s what makes a day like today so important. A thousand years from now, July 20, 1969, will likely be a date that will live on in the minds and imaginations of men and women here on Earth, across our solar system, and beyond.” On 16 July 1969, Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins blasted off from Pad 39-A at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to begin its historic quarter-million-mile journey to the moon, with Armstrong and Aldrin setting foot on the lunar surface four days later. In a speech watched by the late astronaut’s wife, son and grandson, Pence observed that the nation “had been deeply divided during the tumultuous 1960s” but for a moment “the man who wore this suit brought together our nation and the world”. The Armstrong spacesuit goes on public show for the first time in 13 years. Its conservation, display and digitisation were crowd funded. Lawyers for Roger Stone, the political... pirate?... and former Trump adviser, are in court this morning pleading against a government allegation that he has not complied with a gag order in discussing his case. Reuters has this: [Judge Amy Berman] Jackson in February ordered Stone to stop speaking publicly about the case after he posted what appeared to be a threatening photo of her next to the image of gun crosshairs on his Instagram account. In that hearing Stone tried to apologize, saying the posting was not intended as a threat. But a visibly angry Jackson said his apology “rings quite hollow” and warned him he would not have a second chance if he failed to abide by her order. As part of today’s hearing, Jackson is reading Stone’s instagram posts, reports Zoe Tillman of Buzzfeed: The hearing is currently in recess. Lawyers for accusers of Jeffrey Epstein, the financier facing two federal sex trafficking counts in New York, have urged a judge in the case not to grant Epstein’s request for release following a bail hearing on Thursday: A lawyer for one of Epstein’s accusers has alleged that Epstein committed abuse while in custody following the Florida plea deal, meanwhile. Read further: It’s rather a violent business. With each wrenching descent by Trump further into this nightmare of explicit bigotry emanating from the White House, the question always hangs for a moment of whether the Republican party will follow – whether they will take the step too, and go down there. There’s a pause – in this case, 48 hours. Then the party takes the step down. And then Trump makes sure everyone sees what just happened. Here he paraphrases McCarthy, accurately: The senate armed services committee is currently holding a confirmation hearing for Mark Esper, Donald Trump’s latest nominee to fill the secretary of defense post. Trump’s previous nominee to replace General Jim Mattis, General Patrick Shanahan, withdrew his nomination in June amid a delayed FBI background check and revelations about past family troubles. Esper is asked about his views on international allegiances. Does he agree more with Trump, who seems to hold traditional allies in low esteem, or Mattis, a defender of Nato and other post-World War II global political compacts? “I am fully committed to building alliances,” Esper says: Esper served briefly as acting defense secretary, then upon his formal nomination reverted to his previous role as army secretary. How did that outing by the House Republican leadership go? What did you make of the Republicans’ pained appeal just then for a return to civility? Was McCarthy convincing in defending the president against charges of racism? Here’s video of the moment when minority leader McCarthy is asked whether Trump’s tweets were racist: McCarthy announces last question. He’s asked whether he agrees with Trump’s reported assessment of former House speaker Paul Ryan as “stupid.” McCarthy says Ryan was a “great Speaker” and calls him a great friend. Then McCarthy suggests that the quote is made up. They are done. They walk out to somebody saying “a question? On socialism?” Those were the great themes of the conference: Socialism, impeachment, and a supposed clash of ideologies – as opposed to a clash of bigotries – that defines the current political showdown. The strategy was to attack the four members of Congress who warned the public in a news conference yesterday “do not take the bait” – in a fight Republicans seem eager to escalate. In any case, the Republican House leadership stands foursquare behind the president. Were the president’s tweets racist? A one-word answer: No. “Let’s not be false about what is happening here today,” McCarthy says. “This is all about politics and beliefs about ideologies that people have.” Then he gets a question about lifting an imminent debt ceiling (early September or sooner). “We should not leave before getting that,” he says. Next Q: Were the president’s “go back” to your country tweets racist? A flat “No” from McCarthy. Then he says such charges amount to a cynical political play by Democrats. “This is more from their base, this is about politics,” McCarthy says. He also frames the conflict thus: “This is about ideology. This is about socialism vs freedom.” He says he will vote ‘No’ on the House resolution condemning Trump’s tweets. “This party has been very clear,” he says. “We are the party of Lincoln.” First question from the media. Why can’t Congress pass comprehensive immigration reform? McCarthy... blames the Democrats. With Donald Trump in office, the rock in the stream blocking immigration reform is the Democratic House majority. “We should act,” McCarthy says. “The responsibility lies with us... we should make sure that we fix this problem.” Sounds promising. Representative Steve Scalise now attacks Reps Omar and Pressley – though he does use the honorific, just their last names. Scalise attacks the pair for having “personally attack[ed] president Trump instead of focusing on issues that help the economy.” He accuses them of saying “false and misleading things from this microphone. Omar continues to use terms like ‘people drinking out of toilets’ – it’s not happening in any of the detention facilities.” Those reports did not come from Omar exclusively of course, they are documented in multiple watchdog reports from Clint, Texas and elsewhere. “Pressley would not even refer to the president by the title,” Scalise complains. Republicans are lamenting an erosion of decorum, echoing Trump’s recent tweets complaining about the “racist” charge. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, is now speaking. The House Republicans have emerged. Representative Liz Cheney (daughter of Dick) of Wyoming speaks first. She makes a speech that basically asserts that “Go back to your country” is a policy critique. She does not use the word racist but repeats and repeats the word “socialist” and attacks Democrats for supporting abortion rights and for wanting, she says, to “force the American people to pay for free healthcare for illegal immigrants.” “Our opposition to our socialist colleagues has absolutely nothing to do with their gender, their religion or their race,” Cheney says. “Our opposition... has absolutely nothing to do with race, or gender or religion,” she repeats. “The issue here is the content of their policies”. “Go back to your country”: a policy critique. The president tweets that he does not have a racist bone in his body and calls a planned House vote today condemning them a “Democrat con game”. He says that the four women members of Congress who have confronted his racism “hate our Country” and argues that he has hit on a political winner. Is this sheet music for Republicans to sing from at their news conferences today? Will McCarthy et al. echo Trump’s charged denial that it is not racist to tell a person of color (who is American) to “go back” to their country? In a few minutes we’re due to hear from the House Republican leadership: Reps. Kevin McCarthy, Steve Scalise, Liz Cheney and Virginia Foxx. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have decided not to bring charges against a police officer involved in the death five years ago of Eric Garner, whose dying words “I can’t breathe” helped to galvanize a national movement against police violence. The justice department planned to tell Garner’s family on Tuesday morning that no charges would be brought against officer Daniel Pantaleo, the New York Times first reported. Pantaleo has been on desk duty since Garner’s death. He is awaiting the results of a police department review of the incident. Pantaleo threw Garner to a sidewalk in Staten Island, NY, using a banned chokehold, and the victim suffered a fatal asthma attack.

He’s not letting his hosts off easy, zinging Jeff Bezos and the sponsors. In their news conference Monday afternoon, the four congresswomen attacked by Trump – Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley – warned the public, “do not take the bait”. The line pointed to the perceived political risk for Democrats of giving in to an identity-politics war that Trump has eagerly joined. “The more media/Dems engage him, the better for him,” tweets Amy Walter, the national editor of the Cook Political Report, on Twitter. But is Trump really playing political chess here? The New York Times’ Alex Burns notes that the last political play Trump made on the eve of an election was to fearmonger about migrant “caravans” moving through Central America – and that did not work at all: For more along these lines, read Guardian Washington bureau chief David Smith (@smithinamerica): It was foul and repugnant. But was it a vote winner? Donald Trump’s bigoted tirade against four congresswoman of colour, telling them to “go back” to the countries they came from, prompted widespread revulsion – the comments “drip with racism”, said the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer – and yet will not necessarily damage his chances of reelection. On the contrary, the US president seems to regard divisive and nativist rhetoric as his best chance of clinging on to the White House next year. And, analysts say, he may be right. Read further: Hello and welcome to our live politics coverage. After two days of silence on Donald Trump’s “go back where you came from” tweets attacking four members of congress who are also women of color, the Republican leadership faces something of a moment of truth on Tuesday, with both the House and Senate leadership due to face reporters in their weekly news conferences. The House leadership speaks at 10am ET, the Senate at 2pm. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Monday that he would “be happy” to take questions about whether the party stands behind the president’s racist attack on the members of Congress, which Trump kept up on Twitter on Tuesday morning. This evening Republicans in the House will face another test, when the body is expected to vote on a resolution (text here) “condemning president Trump’s racist comments directed at members of Congress”. Extremely few Republicans have indicated support for the resolution. The congresswomen convened a joint news conference on Capitol Hill Monday afternoon in which they accused Trump of following an “agenda of white nationalists” and exhorted, “do not take the bait”. Two other major events were planned on the Hill Tuesday. At noon, the House is expected to vote to hold attorney general William Barr and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt of Congress for forestalling congressional investigations into the Trump administration effort to include a citizenship question on the 2020 US Census. At 2pm, representatives of the big tech companies – Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple – were scheduled to testify before a House judiciary subcommittee about “online platforms and market power.” We’ll be following that in real time right here. We’ll also be chasing the 2020 Democratic candidates.

Before we go, let’s recap the big stories from today: The Reserve Bank announced it will lift the cash rate from 1.35% to 1.85%. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the rate rise meant it was ‘another difficult day for Australian homeowners with a mortgage’. The Coalition party room agreed to a recommendation by shadow climate change minister, Ted O’Brien, to oppose the government’s climate bill. David Pocock urged a ‘new pragmatism’ needed to be found to combat climate change in his first speech to parliament. The employment minister, Tony Burke, said the government will establish a house select committee to examine the Workforce Australia employment services scheme. Aged care reforms became the first bill to pass the new parliament, but the minister, Anika Wells, said there is more work to do. The federal court ruled that WA premier Mark McGowan and mining billionaire Clive Palmer has defamed each other in their long-running legal stoush. At least 95 deaths from Covid-19 were reported across the nation as the TGA extended the shelf-life of anti-virals to fight coronavirus. Thank you so much for spending part of your day with us – we love it. Amy will be back in the morning so we will see you then! Mortgage-holders under pressure from rising interest rates “We paid $590,000 for the house, but the government has paid for 25% of that so we’ve ended up with a mortgage of $420,000,” Louise Hindes said. Their loan repayments have already gone up by more than $100 a fortnight. When they first moved in they paid $720, now they are paying $840. And now it is eggs ... I’ve got some pics for you from Mike Bowers from the Senate this afternoon: David Shoebridge speaks of ‘ecocide’ in first speech to Senate Greens senator David Shoebridge has outlined his main political priorities as legalising cannabis and taxing billionaires to support Medicare-funded dental treatment, as well as proposing “a new criminal offence of ecocide” with a 20-year jail term. In his first speech to the Senate, Shoebridge, a new senator for New South Wales, spoke effusively of the environment, climate change and Indigenous history, calling for stiff penalties over damage to the environment. “Ecocide is the mass, widespread damage and destruction of ecosystems and nature. It is, or at least should be, criminal where it is done by corporations or governments intentionally or recklessly,” he said. “So instead of a short-lived Twitter backlash and a revolving door taking you from politics into a six-figure consultancy, if you gladhand a fossil fuel project that screws our collective future you get 20 years in jail. That sounds more fair to me. That’s accountability I’d vote for. Why don’t we backdate it to today?” The former NSW state politician noted that the Labor government held 26 of the 76 seats in the Senate, and hinted at proposals to use that political calculus – and the Green’s position in the balance of power – to “provide far greater scrutiny, transparency and accountability of the executive”. Shoebridge mentioned the NSW parliament’s public accountability committee, which is investigating the appointment of former deputy premier John Barilaro to a New York trade commissioner post. The senator said it was an example of parliamentary structures working “to force accountability on an unwilling government”. “Whatever else it is, NSW politics sure is a masterclass in scandal, corruption and abuse of power, lessons that will certainly come in useful here,” Shoebridge said. He ended his speech with the words: “We have a planet to save, so let’s get started.” The Therapeutic Goods Administration has extended the shelf life of a key anti-viral medication – Paxlovid – that was rapidly approaching its expiry date. On Tuesday, the TGA published advice stating that it had extended the expiry date of various batches in Australia by six months, providing they met particular storage provisions. The first batch of the drug had an expiry date of August this year, with the drug approved in Australia initially with a 12-month expiry date. Manufacturer Pfizer has advised health professionals that the six-month extension can be applied retrospectively to Paxlovid products manufactured prior to the TGA approval. The government has been urging take-up of the anti-viral drugs amid the latest Covid surge, with more than 116,000 prescriptions so far administered. The health minister, Mark Butler, has been critical of the previous government for allowing the treatments to “gather dust” despite Australia ordering 1.3m courses of anti-viral drugs, comprising 1m Paxlovid and 300,000 Lagevrio. Pocock spoke about the need for solutions to the climate crisis to overcome the failure of imagination in policy. He said: It’s on us to make the changes, and it’s not too late. In the midst of this doom and gloom is an invitation to begin to turn things around. Thanks to ancient indigenous wisdom and the latest in science and technology, we have never known more about these life support systems, what we are doing to them, and what can and must be done to halt this catastrophic decline and begin to reverse it. We know what we are doing and what can be done. The first generation with this knowledge and the last to be able to do anything about it. Some of our failure has been a failure of imagination – a failure to imagine how great our future can be if we focus on the things that actually matter – the long-term health and wellbeing of our families, communities and land. This takes courage and leadership. It seems to me that a big part of politics is about dealing with problems in a way that turns them into opportunities. We have an opportunity to begin to write a new story, a better story, a story that is built on accepting responsibility for where we are and finding the courage to change where we are going. This is not about naive thinking or hoping for the best – it’s about a new kind of pragmatism where our actions match the scale of the challenge. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is here for the speech. We’ll have some Mike Bowers pics for you soon. The independent senator for the ACT, David Pocock, is giving his first speech, which includes a dire warning about climate change. Pocock said: There is no challenge greater than facing up to the climate and biodiversity crises we face. We live in unprecedented times. Generations before us faced their own unprecedented times – world wars, famines, pandemics, natural disasters. Many of our forebears put their lives on the line to build what they saw as a brighter future. Many lost their lives doing so. Others gave up their freedoms to build a more equitable society – activists who were at the time vilified, arrested and even killed, many of whom we now hold up as heroes for their lives of service and commitment to building a better future. Today the systems that sustain life on earth are at the brink of collapse. The climate as we know it is breaking down and the impacts are now being felt with distressing regularity. Extreme weather: drought, bushfires, hailstorms and floods are having a devastating effect on the people and places we love. We are also seeing the impacts on the state of the environment. The 6th mass extinction event is underway. The last one, 66 million years ago, was due to a massive asteroid. This time we’re causing it. Earlier, Pocock spoke about the diversity of Canberra: Despite what you may see on the news, Canberra is so much more than the sum of the decisions made in this building. Yes, we are a city of roundabouts and politicians. But we’re also much more than that. We’re a growing city with a strong community spirit, built on a passion for lifelong learning, good public policy, a connection to our environment, the arts, sport, defence, science and technology. We’re appropriately called the bush capital ... We have a vibrant and growing multicultural community. He also called for territories to regain the right to legislate, carefully tiptoeing to avoid the phrase “voluntary assisted dying”: Here in the ACT we have been denied rights held by the states. It is time for us to restore the right of the territories to make decisions for themselves. To ensure that our legislative assembly here in the ACT gets to make decisions about the future of Canberrans, not MPs from around the country whose own constituents already enjoy these same rights. Yesterday, legislation to restore our rights as a Territory was introduced into the House of Representatives. This is not the first time the parliament has tried to repeal the Andrews bill. But I hope it will be the last. I will work with everyone in this Senate chamber to support a vote giving us equality with the states. I would like to acknowledge the many brave, courageous people who have supported this campaign over many years. Other issues canvassed include the housing crisis, workforce shortages, increasing transparency and integrity in government, the protection of whistleblowers, and enshrining a First Nations Voice in the constitution. There was a controversy last week about whether Pocock would be allowed an Auslan sign language interpreter. The speech was given with an interpreter on four screens in the Senate and broadcast in parallel online, a solution allowing those watching to get the benefit but not allow a “stranger” in the Senate. What parts of Australia’s population have suffered the most from Covid? For most of the pandemic, Australia had one of the lowest death rates in the OECD. But Australia is now one of many countries caught in a series of rolling Covid waves. The data shows some parts of Australia’s population have had disproportionately high fatality rates: From AAP: Social issues committee calls for coordinated strategy to protect multicultural seniors from elder abuse Victoria needs a coordinated strategy to stop its multicultural seniors from falling victim to elder abuse, according to a new parliamentary report. The Legislative Assembly Legal and Social Issues Committee’s inquiry into support for older Victorians from migrant and refugee backgrounds delivered 76 recommendations on Tuesday. These include calls to support professional development and career pathways for bicultural and bilingual workers, and to increase funding for ethno-specific and multicultural organisations. The committee also recommended the state government trial or implement a care finder initiative to help culturally diverse older people access support in their local areas. The inquiry received 73 submissions and held five days of public hearings. Language barriers are a common hurdle to accessing appropriate community support. Ian Rintoul, from the Refugee Action Coalition, believes this stems from a cultural divide. “There is a lack of information about what services are actually available,” Rintoul said. “This is both a language issue but also one of accessibility, where the information actually reaches. Very often it just doesn’t reach the individuals and communities that need the information.” Sydney’s Aboriginal community calls for investigation into closure of National Center for Indigenous Excellence From AAP: Sydney Aboriginal community advocates have threatened to hold a sit-in at the National Centre for Indigenous Excellence to protest its looming closure. Staff and locals are calling for an investigation into how the centre in Redfern was run into a $2m annual loss, and for the federal organisation that runs it to request funding to keep it open. Locals were shocked on Monday to discover the centre would close in a week, despite becoming a cultural and community lifeline for local Aboriginal people since opening in 2006. Staff at its aquatic and fitness centre will be out of a job within days. Programs that support the local Aboriginal community, including employment services, have already been axed, while working parents will be forced to find alternative child care. The centre’s operator, the commonwealth’s Indigenous Land and Sea Corporation, has for years been at loggerheads with its leaseholder, the NSW Aboriginal Land Council, on how to keep the institution’s doors open beyond Monday. But the centre’s staff and the community groups that operate on its premises only learned of the talks on Monday, at the same time they were told the centre would close. I just want to bring your attention to this: my colleague Tory Shepherd has this important story on how only 2.6GL of the 450GL needed to save wetlands and species has actually been delivered, and very little of the $1.775bn in the fund has been spent. Hello everyone - this is Cait, I will be driving this blog for the rest of the day. As always, a big thank you to Amy for taking it through the morning. Let’s get into it! First up, I give you this humorous observation from JB: The Greens will be meeting again in a couple of hours to discuss its position on the government’s climate legislation. Murph will be all over that, and we will keep you updated with what we know, when we know it. In the meantime, Cait Kelly is going to guide the blog through the early evening. I will be back early tomorrow morning for the second last day of the first sitting – when Labor will pass climate through the house. Just a reminder that the bill won’t be going to debate in the Senate for at least another month, as it is in committee. At this point, it does not look like Liberal senator Andrew Bragg will cross the floor, but there is a long way to go on all of this. But first, we have the next couple of hours to get through. A very big thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Tory Shepherd for getting me through the day (as usual), as well as to the entire Guardian brains trust. And of course, to you. You are the highlight of my day, and I truly appreciate all of your comments and interest. See you tomorrow – and take care of you. Ejector seat ‘issues’ hit RAAF F-35A fighters Just weeks before pilots and their aircraft from 17 nations descend on the Northern Territory, “issues” have struck the Royal Australian Air Force’s new fighter jets. The RAAF will keep the F-35A Joint Strike Fighters in the air for now, after others in the United States and Israel were grounded due to a problem with the pilot ejector seats. There have been ongoing issues with the aircraft. A defence spokesperson said the RAAF was aware of the issues around the ejection seat, and that the F-35A Joint Program Office (JPO) was investigating. Air Force has undertaken an independent risk assessment based on information provided by the F-35A JPO and will continue flying the F-35A Air Force will continue to engage with the US Air Force and JPO and review its risk assessment if new information is received. Exercise Pitch Black 2022, which has been delayed because of the pandemic, will see military exercises involving Australia and other countries including the US, Canada, France, and Germany. The F-35As will be among several aircraft on display. Back to Stephen Jones, the assistant treasurer – he is asked on the ABC what would happen if inflation is still an issue in another year when the stage three tax cuts are due to come online and says: We will deal with 12 months in 12 months’ [time], but I tell you [it is one thing] to promise one thing and three months later to do the exact opposite. The prime minister is not in the game of doing that. Stuart Robert: territory rights bill ‘isn’t about voluntary assisted dying’ The shadow assistant treasurer, Stuart Robert, has spoken in favour of territory governments having the right to legislate - a strong hint he will support the territory rights (voluntary assisted dying) bill. Asked his position on the bill at a doorstop in Canberra, Robert said: You’ll see when I vote ... Patience is a virtue. Asked if Territorians deserve the same rights to legislate VAD, he said: I think the issue isn’t about voluntary assisted dying, it’s about whether an elected government should have a mandate to make decisions, based on what they took to the people in their respective state or territory - that is the wider issue at play here. Although he said his answer “implies nothing” about how he’ll vote on the bill, Robert said people “have an expectation that what they voted for will be carried out” and his view is that mandates “should be respected”. Stage three tax cuts to stay But the stage three tax cuts? They stay. Stephen Jones: Certainty and politics is everything and doing what you said you’re gonna do is everything in politics. We promised before the last election we would leave the legislative tax cuts alone. Therefore they will flow. We will ... look at all areas of policy to see what we can do to bring inflation back down. I know those tax cuts don’t come in until thereafter, so we have got a lot bigger problems if we haven’t started to turn the inflation rate around by the end of next year and the beginning of the year after. Labor: no extension to the fuel tax excise Stephen Jones is sticking to the “no” on the question of extending the fuel excise pause: The easiest thing for us to do is to say yes, we will extend them, that would be really easily and politically popular forever, and [then] the impact of that would start to hit and the people would be saying how come you didn’t tell us that you’ve added another $3bn to the trillion-dollars’ worth of government debt, and we are now paying interest on that and therefore can’t spend money on Medicare, schools, education, all these other things we care about? No responsible government can just keep writing $3bn cheques every time a problem [is] confronted and not tell people what the cost of that [is]. In Question Time today, we seem to see the Coalition having a bet each way, saying we shouldn’t be spending more money – and then you’ve got the leader of the opposition say we should be spending money. So I’m not sure whether the shadow treasurer and the shadow assistant treasurer or the leader of the opposition, a spokesperson for economic policy ... they can slug it out, because they are saying the complete opposite [out there] at the moment. Labor: Coalition’s contribution to energy is ‘policy uncertainty’ Assistant treasurer Stephen Jones enjoyed those comments, telling the ABC: We have got a crisis in the power system today, we cannot wait up to 20 years navel-gazing on a form of energy which, on what we know today, is more expensive, less stable, more dangerous than the existing forms of energy that are available. If you are a country that didn’t have any coal, gas, sun, didn’t have any geothermal [options], we would look at these nuclear options. We have an abundance of all the other traditional fossil fuels and [a] abundance of renewable energy as we are making the switch. The Coalition’s contribution to energy policy today is policy uncertainty, except for the paper they will put about on the most expensive existing form of energy. Not a very responsible position. Robert: Coalition’s nuclear energy interest is a ‘sensible review’ Stuart Robert was also asked about the Coalition’s sudden interest in nuclear energy: We are seeing small modular reactors delivering power simpler, cheaper and very safely. But is it affordable? Robert: This is the point of doing a sensible review of coming up with the Australian people as Peter Dutton did today saying that we will look at it to see if it is indeed ticking all the boxes. I think we are the only non-top 20 OECD country that doesn’t use nuclear power as part of its power [network]. Are we nearing peak “hip pocket pain”, as far as interest rates go? There’s some hope of that now the RBA has signalled that it won’t have to work as hard as it previously thought to contain inflation within its (arbitrary) 2-3% target rate. That doesn’t mean there won’t be more hikes to the cash rate that now sits (awkwardly) at 1.85%, and so perhaps the next move will be to a rounder 2.25%. As we noted (with some caveats) after the June quarter CPI numbers came in that some economists were already eyeing “peak inflation”. KPMG’s chief economist, Brendan Rynne, who was among those seeing the worst starting to be over, said he remained “optimistic” that the rate of quarterly growth in inflation at least may have peaked. We believe domestic inflation will peak at around the low 7 % by the end of this year, before falling back to the high 3%s by the middle of next year and then back within the 2-3% target band by the end of 2023. That’s slightly more optimistic than the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, who last week predicted CPI would peak at 7.75% – and governor Lowe, who tapped the same 7.75% peak number in today’s statement. (Lowe also said CPI would remain “a little above 4%” in 2023 and “around 3%” in 2024, stealing some of his thunder from Friday’s quarterly statement on monetary policy. Spare a thought for economic scribes and what they’ll need to fill their Saturday column inches with.) Anyway, if the inflation numbers “print” on the low side, the RBA needs to worry less about “inflationary expectations” running away, and hence the pullback in rate rise expectations today. As mentioned earlier, we saw a hint of that in the ANZ’s weekly survey: More of this to come, we hope. Stuart Robert: government can act now on cost of living increases Stuart Robert is also arguing the government needs to act now on cost of living relief. I think. He tells the ABC: They should and it [the October budget] doesn’t preclude acting in the meantime. There are two times when you can add reactions or decisions of government to the books, either budget or the midyear fiscal outlook which is generally in December. Therefore, the government can act now to assist Australians with cost of living increases and bring those to account. The budget in October does not preclude action now. Dutton statement on internal Coalition nuclear energy review Just before question time, Murph tweeted about about Peter Dutton’s “internal” nuclear review. Here it is in full: Today, I initiated a formal internal process to examine the potential for advanced and next-generation nuclear technologies to contribute to Australia’s energy security and reduce power prices. This review will be led by Ted O’Brien MP, shadow minister for climate change and energy, who will report to the Coalition policy committee, chaired by senator the Hon Marise Payne, and the Coalition party room. It is high time that Australia had an honest and informed debate on the benefits and costs of nuclear energy. A few points: 1. Australia has had a number of detailed reviews about nuclear dating back to the Switkowski review that Howard commissioned in the final term of his government. 2. Every review that I’ve seen about nuclear says the technology is not economic in the absence of a CO2 price. 3. Given the Liberals do not support carbon pricing, and can’t even bring themselves to support a more ambitious 2030 target despite the rout in their progressive heartland in May – what is the actual agenda here? Angus Taylor expects Labor to have all the answers for the economy nine weeks after winning government and two months before it hands down its budget. Taylor says Jim Chalmers is being a commentator, not a treasurer, because so far all he has offered is an economic statement. As Mike Bowers captured, some seem to be adapting to the new arrangements better than others. Helen Haines (the independent MP from Indi who is working from isolation after testing positive to Covid) says she will be moving amendments to Labor’s climate bill to include regional voices. From her statement: The amendments would require the Climate Change Authority to make sure that any measures to respond to climate change should boost economic, employment and social benefits, including for rural and regional Australia. Renewable energy and the new industries it will unlock could become the next gold rush or the next wool boom for regional Australia – but only if we plan it right. We want to see long-term, well-paid jobs being created in our local towns, new training opportunities in local Tafes, profits staying local instead of flowing overseas. My amendment will help secure these economic benefits that otherwise risk slipping through our fingers. The list of eligible qualifications for appointments to the Climate Change Authority would be expanded under Haines’ amendments to include regional development experience. “These are the people who will be advising on Australia’s targets and tracking our progress to achieving those,” Haines said. “We need regional voices at that table. And we need people who understand how to make renewable energy actually deliver for regional communities.” I regret to inform you that Hot Girl Summer has once again been cancelled and replaced with Wet Girl Summer: Speaker rulings on earlier complaints Milton Dick has been asked to rule whether Labor can use the word “rort” in its answers. Tony Burke points out that it was Peter Costello who started that. Dick is handing down his ruling on David Littleproud’s complaint that Labor is not reading out a full tweet on foot-and-mouth disease it has referred to earlier in the week. Dick says it is not his role to adjudicate what is true. But do not fret! There are two more to go! How lucky are we! Update on Ukrainian refugee visas Andrew Giles takes a dixer from Sally Sitou on what Australia is doing to help refugees from Ukraine. More than 8,600 visas have been provided so far, Giles says. He also says there were a few surprises in how the former government set up the visa process – there was a deadline to apply, which was not communicated to the Ukrainian community. Giles says he has extended the offer of the temporary humanitarian visas, as well as extending it to family members of Ukrainians who did not hold Ukrainian citizenship. Labor: over 6,500 more childcare staff needed to pursue universal childcare Back in the chamber and the LNP’s Angie Bell wants to know how many more early childcare staff will be needed to meet Labor’s universal childcare policy. Anne Aly says Labor knows there is more to be done, and that she met with members of the early childcare sector and that one of the main issues raised was the workforce; not just attracting staff, but retaining staff. But how many staff? Aly says the figures published earlier this week of about 6,500 vacancies were correct, but that Labor expects those numbers to increase. Bell chooses then to try and interject with a point of order on relevance, just as Aly was talking about the numbers. Milton Dick sits Bell down and Aly says there is a “rigorous” consultation process which is ongoing ahead of the skills summit to work out those numbers. “We have not underestimated the challenge ahead of us,” Aly says. Quite a bit to pick over in RBA governor Philip Lowe’s statement accompanying the fourth rate rise in as many meetings. It’s clear, though, that investors are interpreting the words to imply the pace and size of future rate increases may be less in the future than expected prior to today’s commentary. Stocks have pared their losses on the ASX, and the dollar has dropped against other currencies, including the US. However, the fact interest rates might not rise so fast has a sting in the tale. The RBA has cut its GDP growth forecast to 3.25% in 2022, compared to the 4.25% expansion pace it predicted in its most recent quarterly statement of monetary policy. (The RBA will update this statement on Friday.) Likewise, growth in 2023 and 2024 will be a modest 1.75%. That compares with the May forecast by the RBA of 2% in 2023, and 2% in the year to June 2024. Still, there’s quite a bit of good going in the economy. The labour market remains tighter than it has been for many years. The unemployment rate declined further in June to 3.5%, the lowest rate in almost 50 years. Job vacancies and job ads are both at very high levels and a further decline in unemployment is expected over the months ahead. Beyond that, some increase in unemployment is expected as economic growth slows. The bank’s central forecast is for the unemployment rate to be around 4% at the end of 2024. The shadow treasurer Angus Taylor has responded to the rate rise. Here is the statement in full. (Yes, he goes there): The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has today raised interest rates for the fourth consecutive month in a row. Australians with a $610,000 mortgage are now paying over $500 more per month on their repayments since May. The government still does not have a plan to deal with this. Nothing outlined in the treasurer’s economic statement last week will help Australians with these rising cost of living pressures. The treasurer continues to sound more like a commentator than a treasurer. Australians need a real plan, not just hollow words. All the government has done so far is walk away from promises, abandoning its commitment to cut power bills by $275 and real wage increases. Australians are already paying the price for Labor’s lack of a plan. If the treasurer fails to act, it will mean more pressure on inflation, more pressure on interest rates and higher cost of living for Australian families and small businesses. In the absence of a plan from the Albanese government to deal with rising inflation and interest rates, Australians will get a plan from the Reserve Bank. That plan will be to raise interest rates even further and Australians with a mortgage will pay the price. Australian Law Reform Commission recommends federal judicial commission to handle complaints against judges in federal courts The ALRC report into judicial impartiality and the law on bias was tabled in parliament today. It makes 14 recommendations, including establishing the commission, that the government should develop a more transparent process for appointing federal judicial officers on merit, and that the attorney general should report annually on the diversity of the federal judiciary. The report was sparked by the case known as Charisteas v Charisteas, which involved allegations of an improper relationship between a barrister and a judge presiding over a family law case. Last October, the high court found that the failure of the judge in the case to disclose the private communication he had with the barrister was “particularly troubling”. The former attorney general, Michaelia Cash, had already reportedly been seeking to implement an independent federal judicial commission while in government. Current attorney general Mark Dreyfus also said he supported such a commission while in opposition. Currently, complaints regarding the conduct of judges either have to be raised as part of the court process, such as by making an application for the judge to recuse themselves or by lodging an appeal, or to the court itself. These mechanisms were perceived as lacking transparency, the report found. According to the report, the commission could: Provide a transparent and independent mechanism to consider litigants’ and lawyers’ concerns about judicial behaviour or impairment, including those that might give rise to an apprehension of bias. This would provide an important institutional mechanism to protect both the public and the integrity of the courts. It would also provide a more transparent process than currently exists for addressing concerns that a judge’s conduct has fallen below the acceptable standard, even when the conduct does not amount to actual or apprehended bias under the law. The fact that a judicial commission would be independent from the courts would, to an extent, address perceived conflicts of interest in the self-disqualification procedure, under which the judge or court the subject of a bias allegation is required to consider and respond to the allegation. The ALRC said the reform would be significant, and should be accompanied by broad consultation. It did not propose any particular model of commission. Rishworth: No evidence the cashless debit card made a difference when it came to safety and harm Michael Sukkar to Anthony Albanese: Will you guarantee there will be no increase in the number of drunk and violent acts suffered against women and children when you cancel the [cashless debit] card as you promised? Amanda Rishworth (as the minister for social services) gets this one: ... I remind the House that the government was not able to demonstrate that the CDC (cashless debit card) program was meeting its intended objective. That is from the ANAO report. I continued reading the report and found some other interesting information in table 1.2. In 2020, the former government reduced, in the objectives of the Act, to actually reference violence and harm in the reduction of trial sites ... it removed that from the objectives. So in the new objectives there was no reference to trying to determine whether violence or harm was reducing. Sukkar has a point of order, but the speaker rules Rishworth is in order. She continues: In 2015, the former government was interested in whether the cashless debit card reduced harm in the trial areas, but by 2020 they were no longer interested. Why, why you might wonder. That is because they could not provide any evidence to suggest there was a reduction of harm and violence in community. We have heard a lot from those on the other side about the University of Adelaide report ... I want to go to the part of the report that talked about safety, crime and family violence. Where it said that 60% of CDC participants reported that they did not feel safer since the introduction of the CDC card and 28% – that’s more than one in four – reported their safety had reduced since the introduction of the CDC card. If we go to the evidence and ignore the ideological rhetoric from those over the back, we see that this program did not make a difference when it came to safety and harm. Indeed, what it did for participants was make discrimination normalised in communities [and] stigma normalised in communities, and of course it had practical problems that meant that people couldn’t buy a secondhand bfridge because they did not have enough cash. It meant families could not take their children to the football because they did not have enough cash. This has had real problems in communities and we are acting to fix it. Bowen: 43% climate target is modelled result of range of policies we have committed to The independent MP Allegra Spender to Chris Bowen (this is Spender’s first question): Many people in my community are concerned about climate change. Climate scientists are telling us we need [a] 2030 emission target reduction of at least 50% to prevent catastrophic climate change, and the Business Council of Australia has said Australian businesses can thrive under a 46 to 50% reduction by 2030. So, my question is: what are the business reasons for the government’s 2030 target of 43%? Bowen: I thank the honourable member for her question and her engagement and time so far in this parliament. I make a number of comments about the target. The prime minister has made clear repeatedly we went to the election with that target and sought a mandate and received a mandate for that target. It is important to the prime minister and this side of the House to maintain the commitments that we made during the election. Professor Mark Howden of the AMU Centre for Climate and Energy and Disaster Recovery and a vice-chair of the IPCC has said a 43% reductions target is entirely consistent with the obligations set out at the Glasgow conference last year and consistent with Australia’s obligations under the Glasgow conference. Another point I would make ... is that targets are very important. But even more important than targets are the policies underpinning it. When we released the 43% reduction target, it was the modelled result of the range of policies we committed to at the time. They are easier said than met. It is important to accompany targets with the policy. Whether it is safeguards reforms, Rewiring the Nation policies, reforming [the] electric vehicle tax cut and electric vehicle strategies which will give the Australians the [chance] to buy electric vehicles and enjoy the weekend at the same time, community batteries, solar banks policy ... the range of policies is important and we are getting on and implementing them all. The other thing important to get the investment in renewable energy is certainty and policy frameworks being legislated. I thank the member for Wentworth for her public announcement that she will be supporting our legislation in the House. It sends the message that not only does Australia now have a government that gets it, we have a parliament that gets it too. It will provide policy certainty and framework for investors around the world who see Australia as an opportunity ... because we want Australia to be a renewable energy powerhouse, we want Australia to take advantage of those economic opportunities because we see the world’s climate emergency, and there is one, as Australia’s jobs opportunity. Albanese: jobs and skills summit will address skills shortage impact on business Back to question time, Paul Fletcher has a question for Anthony Albanese: Will the government support the Coalition’s policy to help veterans and pensioners who may choose to work more hours to help fill vacancies in sectors like aged care, agriculture, hospitality and home care? Albanese: One of the things that the jobs and skills subsidy is going to address is bringing unions, employers, and civil society together to discuss how we address the acute skills shortages impacting on business. One way that we can do it ... I refer the shadow minister to my ageing vision statement given at the beginning of 2020 in Brisbane, where I referred to exactly the sort of idea of how we work through, constructively, ways to encourage older Australians to participate more in the workforce. That is something that I proposed way back in 2020. It is something that is going to be considered along with a whole range of other measures about how we can deal with the acute skills shortages which are there in our economy, which are holding people [and] businesses back. One of the things that occurred, because of ... the pandemic, was that Australia, we told all people on temporary visas holders to go. That is had a real impact now, because what [has] occurred now in critical areas, including the hospitality sector, is that you have around the country restaurants that cannot open seven days a week, cannot even open five days a week, because they simply cannot get the staff that were available. It is having an impact in agriculture, it is having an impact in construction and [the] infrastructure sector as well. Is also ... leading into inflation, because if you have a failure to be able to access the labour market that can increase your costs. This government is determined to have compared the plans. We are determined to consult with business and unions on these ideas, and I am pleased and I recommend ... our book of vision statement ... which I recommend to the shadow minister, there are lots of ideas there. We put a whole range of those ideas, we had fully costed policies during the election campaign. [We will be] feeding those ideas into the jobs and skills summit. I am not sure whether the opposition ... some have called for the jobs and skills summits and to go ahead, others have sought an invite. I’m not sure what their position is. We will be consulting with the business community and with civil society about how we address these great challenges. I am pleased that my ministerial colleague, minister O’Connor, he is working hard in the leadup to the summit, on a series of local events as well that will take those ideas. Greens: corporate super profit taxes are needed instead of interest rate rises The Greens treasury spokesperson, Nick McKim, has responded to the rate rise: The RBA is smashing workers, renters and recent homebuyers to try to bring down inflation that is being driven by supply shocks and corporate profiteering. We are hearing plenty from the government and the RBA about supply pressures. What we aren’t hearing from the government or the RBA is about the role of corporate profiteering. Profit’s share of national income was already at a record high and workers’ share of national income was already at a record low. Now big companies are using the cover of inflation to gouge prices and further drive up inflation. This is why raising interest rates is the wrong medicine. To tackle the cost of living crisis, we need government action to make big corporations pay their fair share of tax. We need corporate super profits taxes to help rein in corporate profiteering and to help fund cost of living relief, such as by putting dental and mental into Medicare, building 1 million new affordable homes, and providing free childcare. Here is how Mike Bowers has seen question time so far (a story in two parts) RBA governor: Board expects to take further steps to normalise conditions but is not on ‘pre-set path’ The 50-basis point increase in the RBA cash rate today was bang in line with market expectations. Much of the interest, though, will zero-in on what Philip Lowe, the RBA governor, had to say in the accompanying statement. In particular, what might come next. Here’s what he said: Today’s increase in interest rates is a further step in the normalisation of monetary conditions in Australia. The increase in interest rates over recent months has been required to bring inflation back to [the 2-3%] target and to create a more sustainable balance of demand and supply in the Australian economy The Board expects to take further steps in the process of normalising monetary conditions over the months ahead, but it is not on a pre-set path. The italics are an addition on the July statement. Jim Chalmers has responded to the rate rise during question time. It is another difficult day for Australian homeowners with a mortgage. The independent Reserve Bank has just announced its decision to increase interest rates by another 0.5%, bringing the cash rate to 1.85%. Australians knew that this was coming, but it won’t make it any easier for them to handle. This cycle of interest rate rises began before the election, in response to inflationary pressures that began accelerating at the beginning of this year. Average homeowners with $330,000 outstanding balance will have to find extra money on top of $220 in extra repayment since May. For Australians with a $500,000 mortgage [it’s] an extra $140 per month. In addition to the extra $335 they have had to find since early May. As I said, Mr Speaker, this decision does not come as a surprise. It is not a shock to anybody but it will still sting. Families will now have to make more hard decisions about how to balance the household budget in the face of other pressures like higher grocery prices and power prices and the costs of other essentials. Now, obviously, higher interest rates primarily affect mortgage holders, but there is a broader economic impact as well because of there is an impact on economic growth, which I talked about in a ministerial statement last week. There is also an impact on the budget. It means that the trillion dollars of debt the previous government left us gets even more expensive for us to service. (The answer goes on, but it is well-worn political territory.) Albanese: all workplaces should be safe Over in question time, Melissa McIntosh has asked Anthony Albanese about the CFMEU: Is a prime minister aware of CFMEU picketers verbally abusing and bobbing a female employee at an Adelaide building site? To the extent that she was unable to leave the site for fear of her personal safety? This CFMEU has given over $10m to the Labor Party since the last watchdog was abolished so why is this prime minister prioritising the interests of the CFMEU over the safety of women? Albanese: I make this very clear point. All workplaces should be safe workplaces. I am not aware of the specific example that the member raises. But it sounds on the face of it as being completely unacceptable. Completely unacceptable. Unacceptable behaviour in all workplaces, including Parliament House, to be acted upon by appropriate authority Those opposite know that in fact the ABCC does not have the power ... or the jurisdiction to act on crimes. That is not the role of the ABCC. Those opposite know that is the case but they continue to pretend that there is some connection between those two elements. There is not. All workplaces should be safe. That as principal number one. No they are not! And this workplace hasn’t always been safe either. All workplaces - (Interjections) ... But I would not have thought this was a controversial statement, Mr Speaker ... I was asked a serious question and giving a serious answer which is all workplaces should be safe. Whether they [are] white, blue-collar [jobs] or whether they be construction ... workers or an accountancy firm or a legal firm, all workplaces should be safe workplaces, and we should work towards that. That is why we will implement all 50 recommendations of the Jenkins report when it comes ... To making workplaces safe. I look forward to the opposition voting for that legislation when it comes before the parliament. So that is an increase of 0.50% (as expected), That is the highest rate since about 2016 from my very quick Google (rates were going down then) but Peter Hannam will update you. It means for a loan at $1m (very common in the capital cities and popular regions), the combined interest rate rises over the last four months means you are paying close to an extra $1,000 a month in loan repayments. In some financial news to interrupt Question Time (and prompt a few fresh questions), the Reserve Bank has just announced it will lift the cash rate from 1.35% before today’s board meeting to 1.85%. That makes it four months and four increases. More to come shortly, but the outcome matches overwhelming market expectations that the RBA would raise the rate by 50 basis points. In May, the central bank began its first cycle of rate rises in about 11 years, as you may recall during the official election campaign from a record low 0.1%. Now we’ve had four hikes in a row and an increase in the cash rate at a pace we haven’t seen since 1994 – or in the trailing end of the Hawke-Keating years. More to come shortly. OK, now we are just going to move away from question time for just a moment, while we get ready for the RBA decision to be made public. Labor: immunity to liability for aged care providers only for those who engage in restrictive practices as a ‘last resort’ Zoe Daniel to Anika Wells: Why does the government’s new aged care legislation grant legal immunity from liability for engaging in restrictive practices? Will the minister reconsider this and offer an indemnity, rather than immunity, to aged care providers, as proposed by the Australian Lawyers Alliance and other experts? There are many fine aged care facilities, including several within Goldstein, however per the royal commission, there are far too many instances of mistreatment of residents. Wells: I congratulate the member for Goldstein on her election victory and welcome her to this place. She’s very welcome indeed. And congratulate her on her first speech, which we heard earlier. I also acknowledge the way that you’ve asked this question that it’s in good faith, and I welcome the opportunity to assuage some of the concerns. I know that this issue has been ventilated last night in the Senate, and that some of the stakeholder groups within aged care are worried about it. So let’s use this opportunity to be clear. The immunity will only apply where restrictive practices are used as a last resort, only to the extent that they are necessary for the shortest time possible and in the least restrictive form. And crucially I think, here, to prevent harm to the care recipient. So it is a temporary measure. We take that onboard. And it is just to clarify a gap in the legislation between the commonwealth legislation and some of the state and territory legislative requirements. With respect of use of restrictive practices, you asked about revisiting it, specifically until we bring in the new Aged Care Act, which the royal commission has asked us to do by 1 July next year. This is a sunset clause that gives us the opportunity to consult fully with our advocacy groups to make sure the new Aged Care Act can be as good as it possibly can be. This reform will last for decades. We want to do it once and do it well. Stakeholder groups support this temporary measure – the Council for the Ageing have welcomed the wording we’ve used, and the Older Persons Advocacy Network support the specific amendment because, as without it, harm to older Australians and harm to aged care workers could occur. So that’s why we’ve done it for the next 12 months. And with my time remaining, Mr Speaker, may I update the member for Goldstein that, of the 20 residential aged care facilities in her electorate, four currently have outbreaks – but above the national average, you have 79.3% with their fourth dose, and more than 99% of aged care workers working in facilities in Goldstein have their fourth dose. So, congratulations and thanks for your advocacy on that. Coalition complains about dixers Paul Fletcher is arguing about Labor’s dixers and whether or not ministers can talk about the previous government’s record (or its interpretation of them, to be fair) in their answers. The minister was asked about what the Albanese Labor government is doing to address the power prices and instead we have heard this unstructured spray against the record of this side of the house. Milton Dick rules the question, and answer, is in order. Now, this is something Labor used to complain about when the Morrison government introduced “alternate approaches” in its dixers, which was just an excuse to slam Labor policies for three minutes. And as we are seeing, the danger of that practice is that it could then be used against you if you find yourself on the other side of the chamber. Terri Butler named chair of sustainability organisation Circular Australia The former Labor MP for Griffith, Terri Butler, has announced her new role – Butler has been named the chair of Circular Australia: The new peak organisation is working with partners and stakeholders across industry, government and research to unlock the $2tn economic opportunity to design out carbon and waste by keeping materials in the economy longer. As Australia works towards a net zero carbon target, the way we make, take, make and dispose of things is changing – designing things to last, to be repaired and recycled is the future. The circular economy is a huge opportunity to create new resilient jobs that are fit for the future, make more sustainable products and services in Australia – all while cutting carbon and waste. The federal court has given judgment in Clive Palmer’s defamation case against Mark McGowan and the WA premier’s cross claim. The summary is that McGowan came out on top, winning $20,000 damages from Palmer, while Palmer was awarded just $5,000. The dispute relates to an arbitration award to Palmer’s Mineralogy company that McGowan feared could cost the state up to $30bn, resulting in extraordinary legislation extinguishing the claim. A summary provided by Justice Michael Lee found that in early August 2020, McGowan made statements about Palmer containing imputations that Palmer: Is a threat to people of WA and is dangerous to them Is a threat to Australia Promotes a drug that all evidence establishes is dangerous Selfishly uses money he makes in WA to harm West Australians Is prepared to bankrupt the state Is so dangerous a person that legislation is required to prevent his damages claim Justice Lee found that Palmer defamed McGowan with statements containing the imputations including that he: Lied to people when he closed WA’s borders Lied about the justification for travel bans Corruptly sought to confer immunity on himself through the extraordinary legislation Justice Lee said all these imputations were defamatory. He rejected their defences of qualified privilege and Palmer’s defences of substantial and contextual truth. Justice Lee said that Palmer’s evidence about his fear for his personal safety was “so unbelievable, it had the effect of undermining” his credibility. McGowan was unresponsive at times, but otherwise candid. Justice Lee said that both were political figures of who the public would have entrenched opinions already, and had taken advantage of opportunities to respond in public. He said he had not been persuaded that Palmer suffered any “real or genuine hurt to feelings”. Because the harm to Palmer was minor, so should the damages be. The court will hear further submissions on costs, but the judge noted these are likely to be far, far more than the damages awarded. The hearing concluded with a homily that the litigation had not been worth it. Opposition continues pushing $275 power cut ‘mistake’ Sussan Ley to Anthony Albanese: My question is to the prime Minister. Prime minister, in April when you were caught not knowing the cash rate you said “I made a mistake, I am human. When I make a mistake, I will fess up to it and I will set about correcting that mistake. I won’t blame someone else. I will accept responsibility, that is what leaders do”. Prime minister, given you’ve dumped your promise to cut power bills by $275, will you fess up and correct your mistake? Albanese: I thank the deputy leader of the opposition for her question. I don’t seek to have a point of order on irony to rule it out, given the record of the deputy leader of the opposition, who made a bit of a mistake that led to her resignation from the frontbench of the Liberal party. But now she is back. Now she’s back. Paul Fletcher: Reflection on a member. That was quite inappropriate. The prime minister should answer the specific question, does he stand by his promise on $275 reduction or not? Albanese is asked to return to the question. Albanese: The fact is that those opposite knew the power prices were going up but they kept Australians in the dark. That is what they did. They knew about the price increase in March. They hid the increase in the default retail price for electricity which, for a small business in New South Wales increases by up to 19.7% ... just in New South Wales alone. What our policy is aimed at, and we stand by completely the modelling that we put out by Reputex which showed that when you invest in renewables ... renewables are cheaper, if you have cheaper energy input ... you get cheaper energy prices. What Reputex modelled was the impact of Labor’s plan, with Rewiring the Nation, our plan on other elements of the grid, including using the safeguards mechanism that was established by the Abbott government ... Ley tries to make a statement as a point of order, but she is sat down. Albanese: It is a simple principle here, and everyone understands, and no amount of bluster from those opposite will replace their failure over a decade of inaction. The truth is that if you have a plan for more renewables in the system because they are cheaper, you will have cheaper energy prices. That’s what Reputex modelled but those opposite couldn’t grasp that. That is why they produced 22 different policies – 22 shots at lowering prices and didn’t nail any of them. The worst of all the ministers was the member for Hume, who failed completely and then during the election campaign, went to the governor general to change the rules in order to hide the fact the prices would be going up on July 1. Dutton continues ‘$275 a year power price reduction’ attack strategy Peter Dutton to Anthony Albanese: Prime minister, your website currently states “A Labor government will cut power bills for families and businesses by $275 a year” is this still your policy? Albanese: I could just refer to my answer from yesterday, but ... (Interjections) ... but that wouldn’t be as much fun as going through what our policy is. Our policy is very clear. Our powering Australia plan is indeed up on the website and something that might be unfamiliar to those opposite is the concept of putting out an energy policy that you are going to actually implement. Those opposite had 22 energy policies and didn’t implement any of them. The other thing that might be confusing for those opposite is the concept of putting out a policy that’s fully costed and that has detailed economic analysis. In this case, by Reputex, Australia’s leading energy economist. What Australia’s leading energy economist said is that if you embrace the changes that we are advancing, including fixing transmission through our rewiring the nation plan, making sure that we bring the electricity grid into the 21st century. If you have a policy that upgrades ... Peter Dutton: Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is on relevance and I refer you to the many statements of former speaker Smith in relation to questions. The construction of questions, the question is very clear. On the prime minister’s web site it states “A Labor government will cut power bills for families and businesses by $275 a year... “ There is no point of order. Albanese: Those opposite are confused by the idea that you could put out a comprehensive policy plan to deal with energy in this country and that you would have proper modelling ... that was put out last December, wasn’t questioned in January, not in February, not in March, not in April, not in May. But, what was not known at that time ... (Interjections) ... What was not known was that those opposite had actually sat on and changed the rules to hide from the Australian people the increase in energy costs that occurred on 1 July. That occurred on 1 July. They went ... in a series of moves to deliberately stop the Australian people knowing before 21 May that they had baked in an increase. That is their responsibility. There is going to be the RBA rates decision in the middle of this. So we will bring you both – although it may mean I have to catch up on some questions. Anthony Albanese starts question time with an acknowledgement of the US strike which killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, who had taken over the helm of al-Qaida: Our thoughts today are with the loved ones of all of his victims. May they find some small solace in the knowledge that he cannot cause more grief through his acts of terror and let terrorists see that Afghanistan will never, ever be a safe haven for their hatred, their terrorism and their attacks on our humanity. Peter Dutton also speaks on indulgence: The pain of Australian families who lost loved ones on 9/11 or in service in Afghanistan will never dull, but his death may provide some solace in the knowledge that the planners and perpetrators of terrorism will always be relentlessly pursued and hunted. For them, neither place nor time will provide a sanctuary from the forces of justice. Al-Zawahrri’s death says we should always prepare for and confront threats from a position of strength, not weakness, terrorism, radical ideology, crime or authoritarianism. Webster: small business are bearing the brunt of gas prices Dr Anne Webster then gives this explanation: I might take you to a specific email that I just received from a small business down in Stawell a couple of months ago when gas prices started to hike. One of the brickworks down in Stawell had to close. [An] 80-year-old business who could not compete with the gas prices. The other bricks business across the road has just sent me his two invoices that have changed from $98,000 a month – a pretty hefty gas bill – to now, $500,000 for the month of June. These are the questions that need to be asked. You cannot take climate change as a blue sky prospect without actually addressing the real changes that are happening, for people who are bearing the brunt of decision that is are being made by this government. And we will continue to hold them to account and we’ll be very interested to see all the legislation that comes through from Labor. The gas prices are not about climate change policy – Australia’s east coast has plenty of gas – but the gas has been onsold to off-shore companies, which has caused an issue domestically. Coalition: who is going to pay for climate legislation? Q: Why is the opposition so against climate legislation? Dr Anne Webster: Our responsibility in opposition is to hold the Labor government to account. That’s our first and primary responsibility. And we’re dedicated to that. And you will see that the opposition, the Liberal and Nationals in government, will continue to hold this Anthony Albanese government to account for every decision they make, every piece of legislation that they put up. We’re not in a position right now where we are in a hurry to develop policy. There are obviously policies that we put to the people at the previous election which were successful. We had a technology roadmap. We still believe in that technology roadmap. The big question that as I said a minute ago is: who is going to pay for this? And how is it going to happen? And what kind of costs will every family turning on their lights pay? And will small businesses be able to continue to operate? They’re the questions that are burning on our mind for the people in our electorates. Nationals: ‘There is no benefit in legislating’ climate targets The Nationals MP Dr Anne Webster is the Coalition spokesperson on the Capital Hill panel on the ABC this afternoon, and she was asked about the Coalition’s opposition to the climate bill: Our position is that this is Labor’s bill. Labor have to explain how it’s going to happen. Who’s going to pay for it? And that’s their responsibility. The prime minister has said that he’s already been over and written his letter to the UN, putting us in the position where we must achieve 43% by 2030. This is their gig. Under our gig, we were working towards climate targets without putting it into legislation. From our perspective, there is no benefit in legislating, which is up-front and transparent. Former Liberal chief of staff to be referred to Victorian integrity agencies and police for investigation over possible breach of donation laws The Andrews government will refer a donation proposal made by Mitch Catlin, the opposition leader Matthew Guy’s chief of staff, to the state’s integrity agencies and state and federal police. Guy’s chief of staff has resigned following a report in The Age that he asked a Liberal party donor to make more than $100,000 in payments to his marketing business. The state government will also refer the matter to the Victorian Electoral Commission to investigate whether there was a breach of electoral donation laws, as the proposal was around 30 times the legal donation threshold. Danny Pearson, the Victorian government services minister: Victorians are entitled to answers about this secret deal and the Liberal party should be demanding their leader provides them. Guy on Tuesday confirmed Catlin had resigned following the report. Guy denied knowing about the proposal at the time and rebuffed claims it was an attempt to circumvent that state’s strict donation laws, which require donations above $1,050 to be disclosed and limited to $4,210 over four years. Here are the latest coronavirus case numbers from around Australia on Tuesday, as the country records at least 95 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 4 Cases: 754 In hospital: 158 (with 3 people in ICU) NSW Deaths: 47 Cases: 10,702 In hospital: 2,289 (with 76 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 0 Cases: 242 In hospital: 53 (with 1 person in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 22 Cases: 6,249 In hospital: 815 (with 28 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 3 Cases: 2,848 In hospital: 352 (with 9 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 1 Cases: 944 In hospital: 129 (with 9 people in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 13 Cases: 10,079 In hospital: 802 (with 44 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 5 (dating back to 23 July) Cases: 3,821 In hospital: 404 (with 14 people in ICU) What did Peter Dutton say to the party room to gee it up in the first time since it allowed cameras into the room? The government is enjoying a honeymoon and living high on the hog at the moment. Many Australian families and small businesses are doing it really tough. And it’s going to get tougher under this government. And I think that Australians are starting to realise that not all of the problems, of course, particularly of the international making, are the problem of this government. But we do know from the opening months of this government already that they don’t have a plan. And they don’t have a way forward for the Australian public. And it’s clear to all of us that Labor doesn’t know which levers to pull on the economy, and they are going to make a bad situation worse. And our job ... has always been to clean up Labor’s mess. Whether it’s in opposition or in government, because many of us come from small businesses. Many of us have worked hard to employ people, to build wealth. Many of us have a background in the economy ... that really places us in a position that the Labor party can’t bring to the table. So I want to acknowledge all of you in the room for your support, in the way in which you’ve approached debate. There is some contentious debates around, and we are not going to be a party that will shrink from those debates. We will stand up for our principles, for what we believe in. We’ll do it in a respectful way. And we will contribute to the national debate in a positive way. Greens senator Dr Mehreen Faruqi is speaking to the ABC about the Greens’ position on the government’s climate bill. ... We’re still having those discussions and we have a party room meeting planned for tonight where we will make that decision. We had always said that we would negotiate in good faith with the government. We know that 43%, obviously, is not enough to deal with the crisis that we are facing. And we have been able to get the Labor government to move and to rewrite parts of that bill. It is almost question time. Fuel excise should be on the list, but who knows given the opposition’s most recent strategies. Further to Luke’s post, here is the whole statement: Anika Wells was asked about the try and she waited until questions on aged care had been exhausted before she answered it. Josh Butler has been updating us on what has been happening on it: Sports minister Anika Wells has jokingly called for an NRL inquiry into the parliamentary State of Origin touch football game this morning, after prime minister Anthony Albanese was controversially awarded a try despite claims he was tagged before touching down. Wells, the captain of the Queensland side, claimed to have gotten a touch on Albanese just as he was diving for the line. The try was awarded, with emergency services minister Murray Watt accusing his boss of claiming a “dodgy” try. Photo evidence from news cameras lent weight to Wells’ claims. At her press conference this afternoon, Wells was cagey when asked whether she’d tagged Albanese. “We can all agree the referee awarded the Prime Minister a try, I think we can all agree that referee is going to be the next Governor General based on that decision,” she joked. National Rugby League CEO Andrew Abdo was on the field at the time, playing for the QLD side, and appeared to have a good view of the controversial try - as he lay sprawled on the ground behind the play. Guardian Australia asked if Wells had requested an official review from the NRL boss. “It did come up. I am reflecting on my remit to clean up sport,” she said, calling for “an inquiry through the NRL commission as a top priority.” We’ve approached the NRL for comment. Anika Wells on Anthony Albanese’s ‘dodgy’ touch footy try And on THAT try Anthony Albanese made in the politicians’ “friendly” game this morning, Anika Wells doesn’t repeat her claim. She tagged him, but doesn’t walk it back either. Keeping in mind my new position as a new minister, on the job for nine weeks, and when I say I will take this opportunity before I walk back into the office of the prime minister, I am the minister for sport and I love it – if it gets taken away from me based on this answer, so be it. We can all agree the referee awarded the prime minister a try. I think we can all agree that referee is going to be the next governor general based on that decision – and I think we can say ultimately, glory to Queensland. Number of nurses needed was determined through modelling, says Anika Wells Where does the 869 number come from? This is the number Anika Wells has been quoting in terms of 24/7 nurses. Wells: It’s the Department of Health and Aged Care’s modelling, everyone knows what modelling is – you will see different numbers out there as everybody would have done their own modelling at different times. But it’s pretty galling for the opposition to stand up every day and ask about this one figure when the reason we have these enormous workforce shortages with aged care is because they neglected [it] for nine years and they exacerbated it. One of the first things ... the Abbott government in December 2013 [did] was cut the aged care workforce compact. They suspended standing orders in the house to cut the aged care compact which would have given them a pay rise. One of the first things was cut the aged care package and set in line nine years of neglect and now with a straight face [they have] walked into the first three question times in the new parliament [asking] about this. I cannot believe they are doing that to be honest. ‘I will always be advocating for more’ aged care funding, says Anika Wells Can Anika Wells guarantee that the government will fund this new model of aged care? Wells says it is about transparency: This speaks to us doing more by way of transparency but what we have committed to do is release advice and table it in parliament and we will do that regularly so everyone can see the advice that we are giving. As to funding, that is a question for the treasurer but I will always be advocating for more in aged care. The Coalition party room has agreed to a recommendation by shadow climate change minister, Ted O’Brien, to oppose the government’s climate bill containing the 43% emissions reduction target. O’Brien argued that opposing the bill didn’t mean the Coalition was against targets per se, but the bill itself is not necessary because Labor has already increased our obligations under the Paris agreement. The Liberal leader, Peter Dutton, said the Coalition will develop a “detailed and specific policy” including targets before the next election, noting that Labor had only revealed its targets months before the 2022 poll. In particular, they will study nuclear energy to develop a “proper base of information”. He wants the public to see that the opposition is listening to the debate in a “respectful and thoughtful way”. A few MPs expressed concerns about opposing the bill and questioned the recommendation, but none went as far as to say they’d cross the floor. There was wide support for the position to oppose the bill. On other matters: Coalition MPs and senators will have a conscience vote on the territory rights (voluntary assisted dying) bill. The Coalition will oppose the bill to scrap the cashless debit card. The Coalition won’t seek to amend the paid family and domestic violence leave legislation, but will attempt to refer it to a Senate committee. It will attempt to refer the electric vehicles tax changes to a Senate committee. It will support the bill to improve the merit-based appointment of commissioners to the Australian Human Rights Commission. Anika Wells is welcoming the passage of her first aged care bill through the house – which is also the first bill to pass the new parliament. You can find out what that bill does here. But Wells says there is a lot more work to do – including bringing new staff into the system to ensure the care minutes can be met. I have got to get aged care through this winter and start the reform process so we don’t have winters like this again. The RBA will hand down its rates decision in the middle of question time – 2.30pm. Anthony Albanese given gift in recognition of aged care pay rise promise Michele O’Neil and Sally McManus were joined by aged care workers while visiting Anthony Albanese as the first bill passed through the parliament, which will improve conditions within aged care. Albanese was given a gift from Grace Gbala, an aged care worker, in recognition of his election promise of “absolutely” supporting a pay rise in line with inflation (then 5.1%) for those on the minimum wage. Katy Gallagher to introduce legislation on public servants’ super paid on rent-free housing Further to Sarah Martin’s report earlier from the Labor government party room on the Peace case about superannuation paid on rent-free housing for public servants - finance minister Katy Gallagher says retrospective legislation will be introduced tomorrow, to prevent “widespread, significant, unintended and inequitable” consequences. The case is about whether public servants (including many Foreign Affairs department staff posted overseas) should get the value of their rent-free housing included in their super payments. Labor MPs were told the potential claim on the government was worth between $3bn and $8bn for about 10,000 public servants between 1986 and 2022. In a statement, Gallagher said some commonwealth employees could receive “millions of dollars” of extra compensation, following a recent federal court judgment. Conversely, a small number of employees might “incur large, unexpected debts for unpaid member contributions”. “The bill protects against these potential unintended outcomes and ensures that the entitlements of commonwealth employees remain fair and reasonable and, importantly, that they continue to represent a responsible use of taxpayers’ money,” the finance minister said. “The bill is the most effective way of protecting against the unintended, and inequitable consequential impacts of a potential judgment that reverses long standing practice.” The government is hoping to get bipartisan support for the change. The Albanese government has flagged it may look to reform the $1.5bn-a-year Workforce Australia employment services scheme after announcing a parliamentary committee to probe its design. The employment minister, Tony Burke, told parliament on Tuesday the government would establish a house select committee to examine the scheme, which was created by the former Coalition government and replaced Jobactive this month. Burke said the government was “concerned we have ended up with a system that is driven more by the details of contracts with providers than the legislation the previous government brought to parliament”. He said: The government believes in a robust and flexible mutual obligation system that gets people job ready while they’re claiming jobseeker. There are however some aspects of the new program we believe require fresh parliamentary scrutiny and oversight. The previous Liberal and National government locked in Workforce Australia by signing more than $7 billion worth of contracts with providers just before the last election. Anecdotally, it appears the user experience of the system varies wildly from person to person and provider to provider. While in opposition, Labor backed the new model, which passed parliament in the dying days of the Morrison government. Burke argued on Tuesday the model did not necessarily reflect the legislation brought to parliament. While they spent nearly two years designing and building the software for the new system, they did not properly explain it to the Australian people, he said. He said the inquiry would examine the first 12 months of the scheme and will “recommend where we can make long-term reforms, as well as where we can make more immediate improvements”. It will have a particular focus on whether the scheme “respects individuals’ diverse needs, and supports job seekers into secure work, in particular, its support for long term unemployed and young people”. Guardian Australia has reported extensively on early issues with the program, including unreasonable mutual obligations placed on jobseekers by the outsourced providers. Last week, the Guardian also revealed the industry successfully lobbied to stop a proposed rule that would prevent job agencies from referring jobseekers to their own employability courses. On Monday, Guardian Australia revealed how the practice – which is used across the sprawling $3bn welfare-to-work system – allows job agencies to boost profits by referring jobseekers to irrelevant and sometimes absurd courses. Australia will ‘strengthen the integrity’ of nuclear non-proliferation treaty, senator says as Aukus deal under scrutiny Australia is “profoundly committed” to a world without nuclear weapons, and its plans to buy nuclear-powered submarines are no threat, government senator Tim Ayres has told a major United Nations meeting. The Aukus deal, which includes the submarines, is under scrutiny at the nuclear non-proliferation treaty conference in New York. Ayres, who is leading a 16-strong Australian delegation, said the treaty was under pressure and “must be preserved”. The treaty aims to not just stop global nuclear proliferation, but to move towards disarmament. Ayres pointed to a deteriorating global security situation, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its “nuclear brinkmanship”, as well as North Korea and Iran’s actions. The challenges to the NPT have never been greater,” he said. Some have claimed Australia’s planned submarine fleet will create a precedent for other non-nuclear nations to increase their stocks of weapons-grade uranium. Ayres said all three partners (Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom) were “committed to upholding our legal obligations and strengthening the integrity of the non-proliferation regime”. “We will not simply uphold, but we will strengthen the integrity of the regime,” he said. The conference runs for a month. Anika Wells has called a press conference in response to the passage of the first bill through the parliament and what that will mean for aged care. The senate is wasting no time – the first bill of the new government has passed the parliament (it just has to be reported back to the house, and then off for royal assent). The Coalition are also finished with their joint party room meeting. We will bring you what came from that very soon. There is a bit for the parliament to get through today, but a lot of the action will be happening in the hallways. We will bring you everything as it happens. The house and senate will both begin proceedings at midday. The government will introduce retrospective legislation to stop a claim from retired public servants for up to $8bn in superannuation entitlements. Finance minister, Katy Gallagher, briefed MPs on the proposed legislation in a meeting of caucus on Tuesday, which relates to the Peace case – a claim lodged in the federal court relating to the value of accommodation entitlements claimed during overseas postings. MPs were told the potential claim on the government was worth between $3bn and $8bn for about 10,000 public servants who were posted overseas between 1986 and 2022. One recipient would be entitled to a windfall claim of $11m up from $1m. The legislation will be introduced to parliament on Wednesday and the government is hoping to secure bipartisan support for the bill. Anthony Albanese also spoke to MPs about the first week of sittings, reflecting on the “extraordinary” speeches of new MPs and talking up the government’s focus on confidence and stability, and solutions rather than arguments. He also spoke about his attendance at the Garma festival, saying his speech would be “as important a speech as I will give in my life”. He also said that achieving a successful referendum was still a very big task and he wanted to “bring people in, not push them away” from the process. Pat Dodson and Malarndirri McCarthy also spoke on the importance of the Voice, with Dodson calling it the “most worthy thing our nation will do”. The foreign minister, Penny Wong, responded to a question about Nancy Pelosi’s impending visit to Taiwan. Wong emphasised Australia’s longstanding bipartisan position as support for one China, as well as peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and no unilateral change to the status quo. She said that in regards to the visit of the US delegation, the government’s policy was not to comment on actions or delegations from the US or other countries. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, was also asked about the government’s position on ending the fuel excise cut in September, with Chalmers reiterating the intention to go ahead with the end date for the measure that was put in place by the former government. There is a community rally to save the National Centre for Indigenous Excellence in Redfern. Sarah Collard has reported on just how much the centre means to the local Indigenous community: The Greens met this morning in Canberra to try and resolve their stance on Labor’s climate bill. There are divisions in the party room about whether or not to back the bill. The climate minister, Chris Bowen, has made it clear Labor’s 43% emissions reduction target for 2030 is a floor and not a ceiling, but the Greens remain concerned that 43% isn’t ambitious enough. They also want a moratorium on new oil and gas developments, which has morphed into a discussion about whether a climate trigger (or a process to consider one) might be the first step along that path. (A climate trigger would require the climate impacts of new projects to be assessed before the development is given approval.) In any case, they are not of one mind yet. They will meet again tonight to try and reach consensus. In the event that consensus is not reached, there will be a vote in the party room and the majority view is what ultimately determines the position. I think the Greens are going to attempt to determine a substantive position on the legislation tonight, but it’s not yet clear whether that will be possible. The party room has given the leader, Adam Bandt, additional points to be raised with Bowen over the course of today. Bandt is due to address the National Press Club tomorrow. A quick recap To recap the morning, there is a bit going on. The major issues are: The looming rate rise, which will be confirmed at 2.30pm after the RBA monthly meeting. The government’s climate bill and who is for and against it. The pending expiry of the fuel excise pause, which will add another 22c to the fuel price, but is unlikely to be extended by the government. And the Indigenous voice to parliament. The first sitting week is showing no signs of slowing down. Looks like it is going to be a long night. From my understanding, the government wants to deal with the climate bill in the house on Wednesday – but without the Greens’ support, it will languish in the senate. Labor has finished its meeting – we will bring you that update very soon as well. Mike Bowers was at the opening of the Coalition party room (the parties choose when to invite the media in). It was a (largely) maskless affair, as has become the Coalition’s habit. Listening face, engaged: In Victoria, 13 lives have been lost to Covid in the last day. There are 802 people in hospital and 44 in ICU. Victorian Liberal leader’s chief of staff resigns The chief of staff to Victoria’s opposition leader, Matthew Guy, has resigned following a reports he asked a Liberal party donor to make more than $100,000 in payments to his marketing business. Speaking to reporters outside parliament on Tuesday morning, Guy confirmed his chief of staff, Mitch Catlin, had offered his resignation after the Age revealed he drafted a contract that required a donor to pay $8,333 a month to his company, Catchy Media Marketing and Manager for services described as “supporting business interests”. Guy said he accepted his resignation but that contract was “never signed”. “I make it very, very clear that I value integrity in government and also in opposition,” he said. According to the Age, Guy had been forwarded the contact by Catlin for approval. NSW has recorded 47 deaths from Covid-19 in the last 24-hour period. There are 2,289 people in hospital being treated for the virus, with 76 of those in ICU. The Greens have finished meeting. We’ll bring you what came out of those discussions just before 11am. Coalition discusses climate The Coalition is holding its joint party room meeting, where it is discussing the government’s climate policy. Which seems a little backwards, given that Peter Dutton has already made a captain’s call to oppose it. Scott Morrison will also be attending for the first time since he lost the election and became a backbencher. No doubt he will just love all the cameras being pointed his way in a room he once commanded. Some interesting economic data out this morning from the ANZ and Roy Morgan, with their weekly gauge of consumer sentiment. For three weeks in a row confidence has perked up, although from low levels: That upturn might have something to do with the falling petrol prices (now in the $1.70-a-litre range for many places around the country) and the lack of devastating rains in farm regions for a few months. But it’s showing up too in a drop in inflation expectations that, while modest on a monthly basis, will be encouraging for the RBA board since governor Phil Lowe has talked about the concern of assumptions about rising prices becoming self-fulfilling prophecies (to paraphrase him). Of course, the board will be busy with their briefings right now and weighing up how much the cash rate should be lifted and probably won’t see this post unless they’re taking a morning break (but we live in hope). Anyway, it’s a reminder that a lot about the economy hinges on confidence and expectations, and often the massaging of them – including by our political leaders. The future, though, can be unpredictable, including when the next extreme weather will arrive and where. We know from the Bureau of Meteorology that conditions have been tilted towards a “three-peat La Niña”. (We flagged this as a possibility of three years in a row of La Niña back in March.) Indications continue to mount that we’re in for such an event ... so don’t store away the umbrellas if you’re in eastern Australia just yet: Did Albanese score a ‘dodgy’ try? Evidence from the parliamentary touch footy game this morning is building a case for Queensland being dudded by a bad refereeing call, after emergency services minister Murray Watt accused prime minister Anthony Albanese of scoring a “dodgy” try. Queensland captain (and sports minister) Anika Wells swore she got a touch on the PM before he dived in to plant the ball with a spectacular diving one-handed effort on the stroke of halftime in the annual state of origin match. Photos showed Wells claiming a tag but the on-field referee gave the try to Albanese, taking NSW to a 3-1 lead. National Rugby League CEO Andrew Abdo was on the sidelines of the match, having earlier briefly played for Queensland, to witness first-hand another refereeing controversy. Sadly the Parliament House playing fields do not have video replay or bunker facilities but photos from the game are filtering in to show Wells had a case. News Corp has published photos showing Wells appearing to get a touch on the PM’s side as he dived for the try. Albanese’s own social media team posted a pic from a slightly different angle, also showing Wells reaching out to claim a touch. Albanese joked in a sideline TV interview: I scored the try to put it 3-1 ahead and at that point I think the game should have been stopped at halftime. Apparently these other referees, this fellow called Andrew Abdo from the NRL, he is sort of trying to run the show. We’ve reached out to the NRL for comment on yet another refereeing controversy. Jacinda Ardern pledges millions to fund Samoan climate projects AAP has an update on New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern’s visit to Samoa: New Zealand has made a multimillion-dollar pledge to fund Samoan climate projects and to rebuild an Apia waterfront market. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced NZ$27m (A$24.3m) for the Pacific nation, with climate investments to be decided in tandem between the two governments: This funding will help build Samoa’s resilience to the impacts of climate change and its transition to a low emissions economy. Ardern is in Samoa on a two-day visit on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of both Samoan independence and the signing of a treaty of friendship between the two countries. The New Zealand delegation – including the opposition leader, other MPs, business and religious leaders – were the first arrivals after Samoa relaxed its border regime yesterday to allow international tourists to visit again. Back to Australian politics: Paul Karp has had a look at what an Indigenous voice to parliament will mean: Prime minister Anthony Albanese has released the proposed draft change to the constitution to recognise Indigenous Australians with a voice to parliament. But what will Australians be asked at a referendum, and what do we still need to know about a voice? You can read more on the US mission here: Joe Biden is still testing positive for Covid, so he is giving this statement from isolation. US president Joe Biden is giving a statement from the White House on the US strike that killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, who had taken over the helm of al-Qaida: People around the world no longer need to fear the vicious and determined killer. The United States continues to demonstrate our resolve and our capacity to defend the American people against those who seek to do us harm. We make it clear again tonight that, no matter how long it takes, no matter where you hide, if you are a threat to our people, the United States will find you and take you out. Tuesday mornings are always a little slower because the parties hold their meetings, meaning the proceedings don’t get under way until a little later. Given all the focus on interest rates and the RBA’s move on the cash rate, you might need a little refresher on what it all means. Here’s a little something we prepared earlier: ‘The RBA do have our support’ Anthony Albanese was also asked if he had faith in the RBA governor Phil Lowe after the football game this morning, in an interview with the Nine Network: He does, and the RBA do have our support. They are an independent authority. Look, we recognise that people are doing it really tough and people are worried about increases in their mortgage. That was foreshadowed well before the federal election that that would occur. The RBA are in charge of monetary policy, of course, and the independent Reserve Bank will make their decision this morning. But we are very conscious of the feelings that are out there that people are doing it tough and every half a per cent or quarter of a per cent in interest rates means higher payments for people and that means they are having to make choices about how they get by. On the fuel excise, Albanese echoed Jim Chalmers and said: We acknowledge that people are getting it tough, we get that completely, but we also know that we inherited a trillion dollars of debt from the former government and unless that has got under control, then people will do it tough down the track because it will have an impact on the economy. So we are very conscious about that. Jim Chalmers gave an economic statement last week to the parliament. We will be bring bringing down our product in October. Blues triumph in parliamentary state of origin touch footy Prime minister Anthony Albanese was accused of a “dodgy” try by his Queensland opponents as NSW won the annual parliamentary state of origin touch footy match this morning. There will be a few sore hamstrings in Parliament House this morning after politicians and staffers squared off on a chilly morning for the interstate bragging rights in the charity match. NSW captain Pat Conroy assembled a formidable squad including Albanese, Michael McCormack, Alex Hawke, “Big Dan” Repacholi and Channel Nine commentator/NRLW star Ruan Sims; Queensland captain, sports minister Anika Wells, led a team including Murray Watt, Nationals leader David Littleproud, Graham Perrett, NRL CEO Andrew Abdo, and, controversially, ACT senator David Pocock. The greatest scandal since [Greg Inglis] playing for Queensland,” Albanese joked in a Channel Nine interview from the sidelines. (To be fair, Pocock lived in Queensland first, after moving from South Africa as a child, before moving to the ACT. Barnaby Joyce, now representing the NSW seat of New England, also ran out for Queensland.) With 6 foot 8 Repacholi, Wallabies international Pocock, and a handful of Canberra Raiders stars on the field, the game was arguably the most fearsome sight seen on the Senate fields since Senator Glenn “Brick with Eyes” Lazarus terrorised the press v pollies games during the 44th parliament. Queensland scored the first try, and looked dangerous, with Perrett a livewire from the back of the ruck, Pocock giving good service from dummy half and Joyce trying to throw a few dummy passes. But NSW steamed back to score three in a row, with Albanese scoring the third on the stroke of halftime. Queensland players including Nationals MP Keith Pitt jeered from the sidelines, accusing Wells of letting Albanese slip through to plant the ball down. Wells swore she got a touch on the PM before he scored, with Watt – a close Albanese ally – accusing his boss of claiming a “dodgy try”. Watt joked about he handing in his resignation. Albanese shot back that he might name the Queensland senator to a junior committee role instead. As the former Nationals leadership team of McCormack and Littleproud good-naturedly wrestled on the sidelines, Queensland MP Garth Hamilton arguably committed a professional foul as he bodychecked a Pocock staffer who tried a chip-and-chase kick over the defensive line. Albanese told Channel Nine: Barnaby has very short stints on the field. Even though he represents the NSW seat, he has a Maroons jersey on as well. There should be an inquiry into some of these players and where they are playing for. The game ended 3-1 to the Blues, with Conroy lifting the trophy for yet another year. ‘My responsibility is to make the Reserve Bank’s job as easy as possible’ There are just two things Jim Chalmers is being asked about lately. Whether or not he will continue the fuel excise pause (it’s a no at this stage) … We’ve made it clear for some time now that it would be too expensive to continue that fuel excise relief indefinitely. Even to extend it by six months would cost something like $3bn … It would be too expensive to continue it forever. … and whether RBA governor Phil Lowe has his support: My focus isn’t on the Reserve Bank governor. I don’t think this is a time to take pot shots at Phil Lowe. My responsibility is to make the Reserve Bank’s job as easy as possible. That means not splashing cash around unnecessarily. It means dealing with the supply side issues in the economy where we can so that we make the job of the Reserve Bank easier, not harder. Now, I’ve got a Reserve Bank review for a reason. I want our central bank to be the best in the world to have the best set of institutional arrangements. That’s not about taking pot shots at anyone. It’s about making sure going forward that we’ve got the best monetary policy setting in the world. The Reserve Bank governor himself multiple times now has been quite upfront about the language that he’s used in the past to describe the future movement of interest rates. He has said publicly that the circumstances changed faster than the Reserve Bank anticipated. These are not decisions taken by the government. They are decisions taken by an independent Reserve Bank and they can explain and defend their own decisions. Queensland Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather congratulated after first speech The first speeches continued last night. Mike Bowers was in the chamber when the new member for Griffith, Max Chandler-Mather, gave his speech. Some special visitors from the Senate came to watch as well. Labor unlikely to extend the fuel excise cut Asked about the fuel excise in that same interview, Jim Chalmers said: I’ve been really upfront with people, Charles, for some time now – before the election, during the election and after the election – and pointed out that extending that would cost some billions of dollars and the budget can’t afford that. We’ve inherited a budget which is absolutely heaving with a trillion dollars in Liberal party debt. And when interest rates are rising, it actually costs more and more to service that debt. The fastest-growing area of government spending in the budget is actually servicing the debt that we’ve inherited because, as interest rates rise, it becomes more expensive to pay that back. So every dollar borrowed, whether it’s by our predecessors or by the new government costs more to pay back and we need to be conscious about that. We need to be responsible about that and upfront about that. And that’s what we’re being. So it does not look promising. Today ‘a difficult day for Australians with a mortgage’, Jim Chalmers says Now that rates are going up the governor of the RBA, Philip Lowe, is coming under pressure, with a lot of media focusing on the governor as though he is solely responsible for the decision. Jim Chalmers was asked if he still had faith in the governor in an interview with the Nine network this morning: This isn’t about any one individual. This is about a difficult day for Australians with a mortgage, another difficult day I think everybody is bracing for the interest rate rise that the governor and the Reserve Bank board has flagged. These decisions are taken independently by the Reserve Bank, by its board and by its governor. People are expecting this outcome today. But it won’t make it any easier. My job is not to take pot shots at the governor, my job is to do what we can in the government to alleviate some of these inflationary pressures that we’re seeing in the economy. And that’s what our focus is. East coast gas shortages in the spotlight Gas shortages – or the risk of them – in the east coast remains in the news this morning, with many media reports picking over the ACCC’s “scathing”/ “damning”/ “terrible, horrible, no good, very bad” gas industry report released yesterday. The resources minister, Madeleine King, has taken the first step in reining in the big three LNG exporters by “triggering the trigger”, as she told RN Breakfast this morning. She’s signalled she may make use of the Australian domestic gas security mechanism to ensure those big (mostly foreign-owned) gas producers don’t ship all of the expected 167 petajoules of gas that is not yet contracted. The ACCC says about a third of that is needed to keep the home fires burning. We looked a bit of how we got into this mess in this piece today: The most telling chart comes via the Australia Institute, which marks the original sign when the industry and governments (both Labor and Liberal) designed a market without reserving supply for domestic use (unlike WA): Anyway, King for now is hoping that by asking the gas producers to play nicely and not ship all of that gas offshore will be enough. Dark comments about the loss of “social licence” seems to be as far as the government is prepared to go for now ... rather than, say, imposing a windfall tax that might actually rake back some of the surplus profit gas producers are earning for not doing anything at all (thank Russia’s Vladimir Putin for pushing up global prices). It will be interesting to see if any of the new MPs (Labor or others) start calling for such a tax, particularly if jobs start to be lost in firms unable to pay the energy bills. Another interest point is the lack of interest from King or others to go after NSW or Victoria for not producing more gas. That’s despite prodding by journalists and some fairly hysterical language in some papers. In fact, as we noted yesterday, the ACCC left out all references to the states being to blame for the problem, compared with previous gas reviews. As Tennant Reed, AiGroup’s energy guru, notes, NSW’s Narrabri gas project is years from starting and the onus now very much sits with Santos, its developer. For Victoria, the onshore conventional gas (ie, not fracked coal seams) bans have also gone. At its most productive, though, Victoria’s extra output would only be in the order of 15PJ a year, Reed says. That’s a modest addition at the most in an annual production nudging 2000PJ, so perhaps the blame game should look elsewhere. Sarah Hanson-Young says Lidia Thorpe has every right to express herself Sarah Hanson-Young was also asked about senator Lidia Thorpe calling the Queen a coloniser during her swearing-in in the Senate yesterday: She said Thorpe had every right to express herself: Look, I think this is an issue for not just First Nations people. This is an issue for lots of Australians, myself included. I want us to be a republic. I’m a strong believer and supporter of a republic. There is a big push and concern that unless you have strong voices advocating for change, that these things just get put in the too-hard basket. I’m proud of our team. I’m proud of the diversity of our team. And of course, First Nations people, whether they are across the rest of the country or here in this parliament have a diversity of their own voices as well. Lidia is forthright, she’s strong. But she is determined to give First Nations people a voice in this parliament ... Lidia took the action she felt comfortable with, that she, you know, made a stand. I support her. She’s been re-elected. Victorians have backed her. She has every right to sit in the chamber as any of the rest of us. She wasn’t here last week because she was ill. I’m glad to have her back. I’m glad to see her standing strong. Sarah Hanson-Young was also asked how the discussions between the Greens and the government over the climate change bill were going. The government cannot pass the bill through the parliament without the Greens’ support. Hanson-Young: We are in good conversations with the government. Those discussions are continuing. The Greens will be discussing this issue again at our party room meeting today to discuss and go over what changes the government has committed to. It’s a welcome move that the government has made some changes that the Greens have pushed for, that is important. But what is even more important than that, is this 43% is not enough to reduce the pollution at the rates and in the timeframe needed. We all know that. The science says that. We need real action on the table. So regardless of whether this 43% target bill passes the parliament, what comes next is what is most important. Because we need to cut pollution, and we need to be doing it faster, and harder and deeper. We need to get out of any suggestion that we need new fossil fuel projects here in Australia. Australia has a big role to play internationally. We have this government saying they want to bring the UN climate conference to Australia, well, they’re going to have to do much more than 43% otherwise, we continue to be a laughing stock on the world stage. Sadly, and most importantly, we will be left behind when the transition is on everywhere else. Australian businesses will lose out and our climate will continue to get worse. Gas companies ‘taking us all for a ride’, Sarah Hanson-Young says The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young had a bit to say about Australia’s gas situation on the ABC this morning – particularly given that this isn’t about supply, it’s about the amount which has been quarantined for domestic supply: It’s quite obvious that the system, as it is, is broken. These big gas companies have been ripping off customers, consumers, households and small businesses for far too long. They’re making windfall profits. They’re not paying enough tax. And they’re taking Australians for a ride. There is no shortage of gas here in Australia. We’ve got plenty of it. It’s just that these big corporations are wanting to make more profits, don’t pay any tax. Most of it goes overseas and Australians are left high and dry. We need to change the system. One of the things we’ve got to really do is fast track the transition ... of our energy grid making sure we have it powered by renewables and storage. That would make cheaper, more reliable power and push down prices very, very quickly. Department of Parliamentary Services defends air quality in Parliament House amid Covid surge The Department of Parliamentary Services wasn’t happy with my comment yesterday about the airflow in the building (in relation to people not wearing masks despite the advice and Covid infections) and has sent through this statement: DPS regularly engages independent experts to monitor air quality in Parliament House. This monitoring reinforces the effectiveness of the Parliament House ventilation system, with all air quality measures, including in the Press Gallery, well within required thresholds. Moderates in Coalition may be open to Labor’s climate policy Labor’s climate policy is yet to go through the Coalition party room but Peter Dutton made a decision the party would not support it. That has left some moderates unsettled – Bridget Archer and Andrew Bragg have not ruled out crossing the floor. Warren Entsch has told Murph and Sarah Martin he has an “open mind” on the legislation. From their report: The veteran Liberal MP Warren Entsch says he is open-minded about Labor’s bill to enshrine a 43% emissions reduction target if he can be convinced the Albanese government has a concrete plan to achieve the cut without driving up power prices. Ahead of the first substantive Coalition party room meeting of the 47th parliament on Tuesday, Entsch told Guardian Australia he was seeking advice on the bill and might lend support if there was evidence to suggest the number wasn’t a “brain fart”. Unless you’re living under a rock you’ll have probably heard that the Reserve Bank board will very likely raise its main interest rate later today at 2.30pm AEST. We previewed the meeting here, noting among other things that energy prices might be ebbing (deflating some of the need for an extension of the 22.1c/litre petrol excise cut beyond its 28 September expiry). We haven’t had a rate rise of larger than 50 basis points (or half a percentage point) since 1994 when there were a couple of 1 percentage point rate hikes. They came within a five-month period when there were three RBA rate rises totalling 2.75 percentage points – that’s the last time the central bank was this active. Back then, though, the following move didn’t come until July 1996 when the RBA began the first of six rate cuts that stretched out over about 2.5 years. Nobody, though, is expecting Tuesday’s move – the fourth rate rise in four months – to be the last increase. Investors have a market they can bet on what the RBA will do, and as of yesterday evening they were wagering on a 65 basis point rise today to 2% as a 67% chance. And expect more rate rises to come – just how many and how large will play out for the rest of the year and into the next one. Happy Tuesday! The political parties will hold their party room meetings and work out positions on issues and legislation, but today is all about the Reserve Bank of Australia and the slated rate rise. With inflation having risen since the last quarter, all economists seem to agree there is another rise coming from the RBA, which is hoping that sharp rises now will head off problems down the track. But that just means people are being hit twice – in their daily spend and their mortgages. It seems incredible that after all these years there doesn’t seem to be any other ideas of how to handle rising inflation other than to raise interest rates, but here we are. There are a lot of eyes on the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, and the board as to how high the rate rise will be this month, given the already sharp increases. We know that the RBA believes it needs to take the cash rate to 3% before the end of the year, so mortgage holders are being told to brace for more pain. Meanwhile, the government is under pressure to extend the fuel excise pause the previous government had in place. It’s due to expire in September (the date the Morrison government set) but, with petrol prices still high despite the 22c cut, the Albanese government is being asked to keep the pause going. Treasurer Jim Chalmers says that will cost the budget too much given all the other pressures it is under, but given household budgetary pressures, it may be a fight Labor isn’t willing to have this early in the term. And of course there is still climate and the issue of gas supply. We’ll cover all of that and more as the day unfolds. You have Mike Bowers with you, with Katharine Murphy leading the way. Sarah Martin, Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Tory Shepherd will help guide you through exactly what is happening while I – Amy Remeikis – drink too much coffee and try to keep up. I’m on cup No 3 already, if anyone was wondering.

Wind power remains ruled out in England, but offshore wind farms are supported. The energy efficiency of all fuel-poor homes would be upgraded to meet energy performance certificate (EPC) band C criteria by 2030. There is no environment section in the manifesto and the UK’s air pollution crisis gets a single sentence: “We will take action against poor air quality in urban areas.” A free vote on repealing the ban on fox hunting with dogs is promised. Labour Four million homes would be insulated to cut emissions, improve health and lower bills. Fracking would be banned but new nuclear power stations and renewable energy, including tidal lagoons, are supported. On air pollution, a new Clean Air Act is promised, but without any detail. The controversial badger cull, intended to curb TB in cattle, would end and bees and other pollinators would be protected by a ban on neonicotinoid pesticides. Labour would “set guiding targets for plastic bottle deposit schemes”, aimed at cutting the 7bn single-use bottles sold in the UK each year. Liberal Democrats Five new green laws are promised on transport and pollution, nature, buildings, waste and making the UK zero-carbon. Air pollution would be cut by new ultra low emission zones in 10 more towns and cities outside of London, a diesel scrappage scheme and a ban on the sale of diesels by 2025. Fracking is “opposed” but government support for solar and wind power would be restored. Four million homes would be required to meet EPC band C criteria by 2022 and all homes in England by 2035. New homes would have to be zero carbon. The Lib Dem tree-planting target is far higher than other parties, at 6.5m a year for a decade. Like the 5p charge on single-use plastic bags, there would be a 5p charge on disposable coffee cups. Greens Nine million homes would receive energy efficiency upgrades, bringing two million people out of fuel poverty. Fracking would be banned and the planned Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset cancelled, while public funds would be divested from the fossil fuel industry. A new government-owned investment body would finance the transition to a zero-carbon economy. The Greens would “end the monopoly of the big six [energy companies] by building democratic, locally owned alternatives”, which would get priority access to the national grid. Plastic waste would be tackled with the introduction of a bottle deposit scheme and free public water dispensers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2021/jun/21/australia-politics-live-national-party-barnaby-joyce-michael-mccormack-david-littleproud-national-cabinet-scott-morrison-covid-vaccine-health-sydney-masks","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-21T10:19:24Z","webTitle":"Barnaby Joyce returns as Nationals leader; Senate hearing on Covid-19 begins – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/jun/21/australia-politics-live-national-party-barnaby-joyce-michael-mccormack-david-littleproud-national-cabinet-scott-morrison-covid-vaccine-health-sydney-masks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2021/jun/21/australia-politics-live-national-party-barnaby-joyce-michael-mccormack-david-littleproud-national-cabinet-scott-morrison-covid-vaccine-health-sydney-masks","fields":{"headline":"Barnaby Joyce returns as Nationals leader; Senate hearing on Covid-19 begins – as it happened","bodyText":"The Senate Covid committee has wrapped up its hearing, so we will now wrap up the live blog after quite a day in politics. Here’s the main points: Barnaby Joyce will be sworn in as deputy prime minister again tomorrow morning after this morning winning a party room vote against outgoing leader Michael McCormack. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, spent the day video conferencing into parliament from quarantine in the Lodge, and has come under fire for a side trip to trace his family history while he was in the UK for the G7 meeting. New Zealand, Tasmania and the NT have all begun lifting restrictions on people travelling from Melbourne. Restrictions remain for travel to Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. Sydney’s five-day mask mandate is likely to be extended beyond Wednesday after NSW recorded two new cases of Covid-19. Queensland’s chief health officer, Jeanette Young, was named the state’s next governor. A brief of evidence has gone to the ACT Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to Brittany Higgins’s allegations The government says Australia is still on track to have enough vaccine supply to cover the population by the end of this year, but there will be a constraint on Pfizer supply until August at least. Amy Remeikis will be back with you tomorrow morning for Tuesday’s sitting day. Until then, stay safe. Prof Brendan Murphy, says CSL will continue to produce “their contracted amount” of AstraZeneca. We have 53m supplied, with 3.8m jabs so far. He says there would be “no more” than 12-15 million doses needed in Australia, and while it is a matter for government, Australia could end up donating 35m doses to other countries: “We are continuing to make donations of AstraZeneca to countries that have dire needs and wanted we’ve made significant donations to Pacific Island nations in Papua New Guinea, and we will continue to do that, as was always our intention. We’ve always had many more vaccines then we need in Australia. The states and territories have approximately 800,000 Pfizer doses on hand at the moment, which health department secretary, Prof Brendan Murphy, says is an “appropriate amount” for a dynamic program, and while states would like more supply, they know they are working in a constrained environment. He said there should be no need for states to cancel appointments, if they have not booked beyond their projected supply. Skerritt says Moderna has yet to apply to the TGA to have its mRNA vaccine approved in Australia, but it is expected a “comprehensive” application for the vaccine will be submitted in the first or second week of July. The delay was because Moderna was not established or incorporated in Australia until very recently. He said he expected the application to be “relatively straightforward”, but the TGA will give it full attention. Skerritt said it may even include seeking approval for the use of the vaccine on young adolescents. Skerritt also adds that although the Delta variant is very transmissible, data out of the UK suggests vaccines work against it, but two doses are better than one. The TGA’s John Skerritt also tells the committee there is limited data on clinical efficacy of what he calls “mix and matching” various vaccines. And on that basis it’s difficult to determine the protection from disease from having different shots. People who have had the first shot with AstraZeneca will not have access to the Pfizer vaccine as the second dose at this stage, Prof Brendan Murphy says, because it is not recommended to mix the vaccines in Australia at this stage: “There is very limited data on mixing and matching it may be later on that that changes but at the moment we’re saying people who’ve had AstraZeneca should get the second dose [of] AstraZeneca.” As of 6pm tonight, NT has revoked the quarantine requirement on people from Melbourne. So that just leaves Queensland, South Australia and WA with quarantine restrictions on Victoria. Labor committee chair Katy Gallagher asks what the health department is doing about vaccine hesitancy, pointing out people are stopping her in the street to tell her about their concerns and that there’s a feeling the AstraZeneca is somehow a second-best vaccine. Health department secretary Prof Brendan Murphy says the department is monitoring the doses and there hasn’t been a drop off yet, and less than 2% of people have not turned up for their second doses: “We haven’t seen a discernible drop off in people - 67,000 people turned up to the GPs and state clinics on Friday for AstraZeneca, and the weekend turn up was pretty similar and a number of those are second doses. “So it’s too early to tell whether this further advice will lead to a hesitancy in relation to those taking doses, but our message is very, very clear that to the 3.8 million Australians who have had first dose AstraZeneca, as Atagi and the TGA has advised, the risk is minuscule of getting an adverse event occurring with the second dose, and we are strongly encouraging people to get their second dose.” If you’re between 18 and 39 years of age and wondering when you’ll be able to get your Covid-19 shot, health department secretary Prof Brendan Murphy says he can’t say just yet: “We will be tracking the supply, demand, and the uptake in state clinics and in GP clinics as we roll out Pfizer and when we are seeing a capacity to broaden the age range we will do that.” General John Frewen says they’re reviewing the phases as part of the Covid vaccine taskforce, and that review will be completed in the next few weeks. There are 2.3m doses of Pfizer on hand, with 3.4m being delivered until the end of July. That means there will be 5.7m on hand. That will be a combination of first and second doses. With the additional 2.1m Australians now eligible to receive Pfizer, the head of the rollout, General John Frewen says there will be an “initial adjustment” in bookings, but he does not think it will be a major disruption: “There may have to be some prioritisation at the local state levels, about what other cohorts might be allowed in overtime. But we think the suppliers at the moment with the likely take up rates that we won’t see major disruption over the next couple of months.” The committee hears Pfizer cannot bring forward any expected shipments of the vaccine. Lambie asks how much Australia saved by opting for AstraZeneca over Pfizer. Murphy says price was not a factor: “We have spent, I think it’s $7bn on vaccine purchases and distribution. Price has not been affected in any of these decisions, the government has paid the price that the companies have offered.” The committee wants more information on the vaccine deals, and the health department said it would be taken on notice to see if a public interest immunity claim would be argued. Independent senator Jacqui Lambie asks why Australia can’t have some of the surplus of vaccine supply the US is promising to other countries. Health department secretary, Brendan Murphy, says Australia isn’t seeking donations, but just to get the supply we already have on order: “We’re not looking for donations of vaccines. Obviously we’re a high income country that can purchase their own vaccines, and I can tell you that we are working almost every day with Pfizer and Moderna. “We have more than enough vaccines coming, it’s simply a matter of the time frame, getting them out in their global supply chain.” He said the government is working with Pfizer to get the supply as soon as possible but it is a global issue – every country is trying to get their hands on the vaccine. The head of the Therapeutic Goods Administration, John Skerritt, tells the committee that Australia is identifying the rare AstraZeneca blood clot cases more than the UK did, but the cases are less severe: “The difference is that we are picking up cases early, and while some of our cases, about 30%, are in the more serious category, about 70% seem not to be. Australia is picking up a large number of cases so our percentage of cases, compared with the number of doses given, is actually higher than in the UK, but the average seriousness seems to be significantly less and the fatalities are very much less so.” He stresses it is a rare but important condition. He also points out clotting cases are much more regularly reported by media in Australia than in the UK, where they can go days without reports because of the “bigger spectre of Covid itself”. Atagi co-chair, Dr Christopher Blyth, tells the committee the chance of dying from blood clots associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine is one in 2 million. He says the benefits are “vastly” in favour of older people over 60, and especially over 70s, having the AstraZeneca vaccine compared to the risk of getting Covid. He says the group is constantly reviewing the Covid situation in Australia, as well as the supply of vaccines available and the recommendations on who should get access to the AstraZeneca vaccine: “We will continue to evaluate both the risk of TTS (rare blood clots) and other complications from the vaccine ... and also understand supply constraints. All of those factors were considered last week and will need to be continued going forward.” The health department secretary, Prof Brendan Murphy, says Pfizer came to the government with the offer of 10m vaccine doses, which was considered reasonable considering the uncertainty around mRNA vaccines at that time and the lack of local manufacturing capability: “We advised government that to produce whole population coverage with both those two vaccines, it was an important initial investment because it can be made locally, both the University of Queensland and the AstraZeneca were recommended to government as the important backbone of locally manufactured vaccines because they were the two most proven technologies.” The University of Queensland vaccine has been abandoned, and the AstraZeneca is now only advised for those aged over 60. There have been reports that Pfizer met with the health department in July 2020, and offered to cover the entire population with enough vaccines and the government rejected that offer. The health department’s first assistant secretary, Lisa Schofield, has confirmed the department met with Pfizer on 10 July 2020, after Pfizer wrote to the government, but there was nothing like that on offer at the time. Schofield said it was a pretty broad overview in the meeting, about the clinical trials and the manufacturing capability: “I think it was a pretty preliminary sort of view of where they’re up to and what they were thinking.” Schofield said the government said it was interested in talking about potentially purchasing a vaccine, but there were no numbers on the table. Labor senator Katy Gallagher: “So, any, any speculation that the government, the department rejected an offer from Pfizer is not true?” Schofield: That’s correct. The committee hearing begins with an opening statement from General John Frewen, the head of “Operation Covid Shield”, about how to go about the vaccine rollout. He said since he was appointed there were three initial areas of focus: Improving coordination and optimising the plan, such as by removing duplication and barriers Building public confidence through clear and simple messaging and moving from an informative message to a motivating one And delivering a safe and efficient rollout He would not provide to the committee the lowest and highest numbers of vaccines expected to be delivered to the states and territories by the end of this year. It was provided to the leaders in national cabinet today, and he said it could not be released as such. But he said it was a formality, and would be provided soon. The Senate Covid committee is just about to start, hearing from the health department, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. It will run for about two hours, and I expect it’ll all be about vaccines. I will bring you the latest from that hearing. The re-Joycing will be complete at 8am tomorrow, sparing Michael McCormack another question time in the hot seat as the outgoing leader. This afternoon, the Home to Bilo campaign sent out this video of the Murugappan family daughters, Kopika and Tharnicaa, out shopping in Perth. When they were on Christmas Island they were not allowed to go to the shops like this, and all trips outside of home were supervised by Border Force officials, so this is likely their first big shopping trip in over three years, after they were removed from Biloela by Border Force in March 2018. I just double checked, and it seems the states still requiring people from Melbourne to quarantine are Queensland, South Australia, Northern Territory, and Western Australia. Tasmania will ease its restrictions on Melbourne from midnight tonight. So people in Melbourne will be able to go to New Zealand before about half of the states and territories in Australia. Victorians will be able to go to New Zealand again without quarantining from 11.59pm tomorrow night. Officials say there have been no new cases of the Delta variant in Victoria in the past week. Thank you, Amy. I just received a freedom of information refusal from the federal health department over documents related to the operation of the COVIDSafe contact tracing app. The health minister, Greg Hunt, is required to produce reports on how well the app is going every six months since the legislation governing the app passed. If you hadn’t realised, it has been over a year since the app was launched. I asked for the report under FOI, but the department claims it can’t release the 28 documents it located related to the report because it would “reveal preliminary opinions and recommendations” made and would “prejudice the ability of the department to provide all information and options”. The department claims the report will be tabled in the winter sitting of parliament, which ends on Thursday. So the clock is ticking for them to show us how well the COVIDSafe app is actually working. And on that note, I am going to hand you over to Josh Taylor to take you through the rest of Monday, 21 June – also known as the day of Australia’s re-Joycing. It will all get very serious tomorrow when Barnaby Joyce is sworn in as deputy prime minister, so make sure you get an early night tonight, because you’ll all need to be fighting fit. Thank you to everyone who has joined me today as we waded through the day. It was... a lot. For those wondering, the Coalition seems a little split on what it all means – there are those who think that seats in central Queensland and the Hunter Valley just got easier to keep, and those who think some Victorian electorates just got a bit more wobbly. As usual though, no one knows until they actually know. A very big thank you to Mike Bowers who kept me updated on all the things happening in the corridors today – he is, as always, an invaluable pair of eyes, ears (and of course cameras) for this project. And to the whole Guardian crew who managed to keep me at my desk and not in a puddle on the floor. I will be back early tomorrow morning for the third time Joyce is sworn in as deputy prime minister (there was also the section 44 pause, for those keeping count). As always, please – take care of you. What does Ken O’Dowd think about net zero emissions by 2050? (O’Dowd has done a lot of things in his life, but science and research is not one of them). For anyone to sign up to net zero by 2050 are weasel words. I could say you could go -1 degree but what does it mean? It means I’m just plucking figures out of the air. We are trying to get emissions to net zero as quick as we can. How do we do it? I don’t know but I tell you what, being a nuclear power energy source would be a start in the right direction. If you want to take all the planes out of the skies, that would be another start, but how we going to get around? Outgoing LNP MP Ken O’Dowd, who sits in the Nationals party room, confirmed on the ABC that Barnaby Joyce has spent the past three years ‘white anting’ Michael McCormack: That’s the nature of politics. He has [in answer to a question on white anting], and everyone’s got an ego, and he wasn’t there for the good of his soul, I can tell you that. You can always count on O’Dowd to say the quiet things out loud. A little earlier today, when all the Barnaby Joyce stuff was happening, the head of the vaccine roll out, General John Frewen confirmed that there will be no vaccination campign from the government until there are vaccine supplies. We are 18 months into the pandemic now I mentioned the other day, we are close to moving into a rallying phase of the campaign, to inspire as many Australians to start taking up the vaccinations. We’re just working at the moment manage the commencement of that in line with the supplies available because we want to make sure we don’t start the campaign until we are comfortable to meet the demand. Anne Webster is speaking to the ABC now – ahead of the leadership spill, she said it would be a problem for some women if Barnaby Joyce became leader once again. She now says: I think what I said was I’d had a few people contact me about that issue. Democracy is what it is. We have a new leader in the party room and I respect that process. I will be working hard to make sure women in my electorate and the men in my electorate, and the children in my electorate for that matter are all represented to the best of my ability, and I’ve taken no back step in confronting Michael McCormack over this period of time and I look forward to working with Mr Joyce as well So it is still an issue for women? I imagine we are going to find out. History is what it is and is Mr Joyce said today, he has learned from his past, and all mature adults to learn from their past, hopefully. And look forward to a new day. That’s what we need to do. How does Barnaby Joyce show he’s changed? I think it’s a great question. First and foremost, women need to feel they have been heard and what they raise, the issues are taken seriously. I do take heart from the fact that Mr Joyce worked really well with Fiona Nash as his deputy leader, and I’ve spoken with Fiona Nash this afternoon, and she is positive about the future and that is the road that we need to move forward on. Liberal MP Jason Falinski took Joel Fitzgibbon’s line when it came to the National party leadership: It is not the best look to be honest. But they are a democratic party who made a decision. We are in the middle of a pandemic and the government has been going very well. We have been delivering for all parts of Australia and we need to be working for the people of Australia. And not be focused on ourselves. The Covid committee is holding a meeting tonight – that will be from 6pm. We should get some more second vaccination numbers then, too. Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi has a few things to say about the government supporting the latest culture war (critical race theory): “The government has a damning track record of indulging far-right politics and One Nation stunt motions in the Senate. “Fear-mongering about critical race theory is nothing more than a culture war beat-up by Fox News and their local outpost of cranks, Sky News. “It turns out the pandemic didn’t kill the so-called culture wars that are being manufactured again by the far-right in the parliament. The government is in competition with One Nation in an effort to appeal to the Sky News crowd. “Critical race theory is basically a study of systemic racism. But it has become a bogeyman for the far-right—first in the US, now here—in their fear-mongering about anti-racism and racial justice. “The government cannot viably claim to be taking far-right hatred seriously when they fall in line behind crap like this.” Supporters of the Murugappan family have said Barnaby Joyce’s re-elevation to the deputy prime ministership should give greater support to allowing the family to return to the regional Queensland town of Biloela Last week, when he was still a backbencher, Joyce told Sunrise he believed the family should be allowed to return to Biloela, after immigration minister Alex Hawke placed them in community detention in Perth: “Tharnicaa and Kopika were born in Australia. Maybe if their names were Jane and Sally we’d think twice about sending them back to another country which they’re not from. “Why not send them to Southern Sudan, why not send them to Rwanda, to Belarus? They’re also countries they were never born in.” Biloela local and friend Angela Fredericks, who last week travelled to Perth to be reunited with the family said she hoped his position would mean the government will finally send her friends home to Biloela: “We’re running out of time. Priya and her family have been only given temporary protection here in Perth due to Tharni’s health issues, but just last week minister Hawke was still threatening to send them to danger in Sri Lanka. Having Mr Joyce back as deputy prime minister might bring the new hope this family desperately needs.” Angela Fredericks of the Home to Bilo group is hoping this leadership change means the prime minister and his immigration minister will finally send her friends home to Biloela: “We’re running out of time. Priya and her family have been only given temporary protection here in Perth due to Tharni’s health issues, but just last week minister Hawke was still threatening to send them to danger in Sri Lanka. Having Mr Joyce back as deputy prime minister might bring the new hope this family desperately needs.” Joyce was asked earlier today whether his differing view on the Biloela family to McCormack’s was a view shared among his colleagues, but Joyce did not answer the question specifically. This is good news – from the Arcare Maidstone aged care home in Melbourne’s west: Arcare is pleased to advise that the Western Public Health Unit (WHPU) has declared Arcare Maidstone’s Covid-19 outbreak over. Our strong infection control procedures and introduction of learnings from last year have seen us effectively manage this outbreak. The official national cabinet statement is out. Here it is: The National Cabinet met today to discuss Australia’s Covid-19 response to the Australian COVID-19 Vaccine Strategy. National Cabinet continues to work together to address issues and find solutions for the health and economic consequences of Covid-19. There have been 30,356 confirmed cases in Australia and, sadly, 910 people have died. More than 19.7 million tests have been undertaken in Australia. Globally there have been over 178.4 million cases and sadly over 3.8 million deaths, with 305,611 new cases and 6,700 deaths reported in the last 24 hours. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to surge in many countries around the world. Australia’s Covid-19 vaccine roll out continues to expand. To date 6,590,741 doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in Australia, including 34,712 in the previous 24 hours. In the previous 7 days, more than 723,442 vaccines have been administered in Australia. To date 26.7 per cent of the Australian adult population have now had a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, including over 65.2 per cent of over 70 year olds. National Cabinet agreed on the imperative to work together to administer Covid-19 vaccinations to Australians as quickly as possible. Lieutenant General John Frewen, Coordinator General of Operation COVID Shield, Professor Brendan Murphy, Chair of the Science and Industry Technical Advisory Group and Secretary of the Health Department, and Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly provided a detailed briefing on the vaccination program. Vaccine Roll Out National Cabinet noted the updated advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) about the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine and the changes to the Covid-19 vaccination program. The updated advice of ATAGI recommends the Pfizer vaccine is the preferred vaccine for adults under the age of 60, and that people aged 50-59 can now book appointments for the Pfizer vaccine. All states and territories agreed to prioritise Pfizer appointments for people aged 40-59 and Phase 1a and 1b eligible people under the age of 40 years of age. The Coordinator General of Operation Covid Shield, Lieutenant General Frewen, provided each state and territory government with planning projections of Pfizer and AstraZeneca doses for their jurisdiction over the remainder of 2021, to inform state and territory vaccination plans. The Coordinator General confirmed that Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine allocations are provided on a proportional population basis. The Coordinator General confirmed that the Commonwealth delivers all first dose allocations to states and territories with matching second dose allocations delivered three weeks after first doses are administered. This ensures that states and territories have control over allocation of first and second doses administration based on the supply schedules. National Cabinet noted that the Commonwealth is fast tracking plans to expand the number of access points for Pfizer. By the end of July, all 136 Commonwealth Vaccination Clinics, 40 ACCHS and 1,300 GPs will be administering Pfizer. Many more primary care providers will be offered the chance to administer mRNA vaccines as the supply of Pfizer significantly increases and the first supplies of Moderna arrive in September/October. National Cabinet noted the forward Covid-19 vaccines communications strategy. The Coordinator General confirmed that based on our expected supply picture, Australia remains on-track to offer every eligible person in Australia a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by the end of 2021. Back to Kay Hull – what does she think of women including Anne Webster and Michelle Landry saying some women will feel uncomfortable with the decision to return Barnaby Joyce to the leadership? Hull: Well, some women will may be disappointed but I just heard comments from women in his electorate while I was sitting here waiting to speak with you, and those women seem to be quite positive about it. The only women that will be voting or not voting for Barnaby Joyce will be the women of New England. The rest of the women who will be voting for or against a Nationals member or senator will be voting on the way in which their member is representing. But leadership of the party matters (which is what every Nationals MP shouted after the 2016 Turnbull election anyway). Hull: I disagree with you ... That might be in the city, you may not know who your member is in the city, but country people know who their member is because the local member makes sure the country people know who their member is, they are out there on the road every day. Oh good. The government is in support. Australia, say hello to your new culture war. The federal president of the National party, Kay Hull, is speaking to Patricia Karvelas on ABC TV and is asked whether or not Barnaby Joyce has changed. “I think he is Barnaby Joyce,” she says. Which means what? He can be polarising, very polarising. You can be a lover of Barnaby Joyce or a serious detractor. He has always been polarising. He’s never been any different in that respect. I think we will see Barnaby going forward, and it’s up to Barnaby to determine how he is going to manage that process into the future. Mia Davies continues: There will be questions asked and I think the party will need to answer that. At a state level, the party that I represent and as leader of the opposition, I would say that our party has done and continues to work hard to make our organisation at state level a safe place for women to put their hand up and participate – be involved. Myself and others within the party have gone to great lengths to try and address some of the concerns we see across political parties, not just at a state level but at a federal level. I will continue to do that. It will be a decision for voters come the federal election as to whether or not it has been the right decision. The WA Nationals leader Mia Davies says she is disappointed the federal National party has changed leaders. The Western Australia National Party did not have a vote in the partyroom so our position at the time, and you would recall – there was significant questions around behaviour, matters in the media being raised – it was he was unable to go to the despatch box as the deputy minister and answer a question. There was no possibility of him doing that job and doing it effectively. That was our view when we made it known at the time. Here’s how Mike Bowers, our photographer, saw QT: The Greens are still pushing for this. Labor loses the suspension of standing orders and Michael McCormack wraps up question time. His last words are “que sera, sera”, which is something he has been quoting all day. The chamber gives him a standing ovation. The DPP has released this statement: I confirm I have today received a partial brief of evidence, and a request to provide advice for consideration of prosecution. “There’s nothing to re-Joyce about if you care about regional jobs in Australia, there’s nothing to re-Joyce about,” Chris Bowen says, before he too is gagged. Anthony Albanese, again trying to suspend standing orders to speak about the house, notes the Abbott-Truss, Turnbull-Truss, Turnbull-Joyce, Turnbull-McCormack, Morrison-McCormack, Morrison-Joyce government promised stable government. The incoming deputy prime minister has said investing in renewables is insane and lemming-like. The incoming deputy prime minister backs nuclear power plants in the middle of towns. The government has had no fewer than 22 energy policies in eight years, the government is more divided than ever on achieving net zero by 2050, and therefore condemns the government for fighting itself instead of fighting for the jobs of the future, for sustainable climate, and a strong economy for all Australians. Albanese gets out: You will see that video ... of the incoming deputy primeminister out on the farm with the cows, looking up at the sky, talking about how the world is flat.. But then gets gagged. That would be the video Joyce released at Christmas about how he just wanted the government out of his life. We haven’t seen a lot of the prime minister this question time (and tomorrow will most likely be the Barnaby Joyce show) but you can see him on his screen in the chamber and he is spending a bit of time on his phone. Can’t imagine what he would have to talk about today. Anthony Albanese has to reword a question which originally asked about the Coalition agreement and ends up with: Should Australians have oversight in a transparent manner over why it is this government refuses to adopt net zero emissions by 2050, unlike the National Farmers’ Federation, the Business Council of Australia, every state and government, every major business in this country, as well as all of our major trading partners, including all of the G7? The current deputy prime minister: Our policies on climate are working and working for the benefit of all Australians. We beat our targets by 459 million tons. Our emissions are down more than 20% from 2005 to December last year (that sound you hear is our environment editor Adam Morton screaming into the abyss), compared to the OECD average from 2005 to 2018. We should be proud of doing what we are doing and having achieved what we have achieved as far as climate action, responsible action, is concerned. We will not, as Liberals and Nationals, put in place policies that will jeopardise their jobs and livelihoods of Australians who depend on it, and indeed we have put in place a manufacturing policy, which is investing, which is funding, which is backing and supporting those people who want an industry base, who need a job and the manufacturing sector. Those manufacturing sectors have a high energy need, have a high requirement. We will back every step of the way the policies that back and support those jobs but also keep household energy electricity prices low. The alternative is what Labor offers. Labor pulled at the nose by the Greens, pulled at the nose by Melbourne. It is putting in a carbon tax which will affect the price of houses, the price of homes and households across the nation. Mark Butler gets up on a point of order, to which McCormack says “why are you interrupting me, I don’t have long” but there was nothing in the question about alternatives, so McCormack is told to stick to the question. Refer to the previous answer if you have a burning need to know what he said. And then maybe think about why you have a burning need to know what Michael McCormack said. The Nationals in WA don’t have a coalition with the Liberal party there, and there are no federal WA Nationals in the parliament. But still, this should be interesting Greg Hunt just referenced his “good friend the deputy prime minister”, which prompted calls of “which one?”. Michael McCormack pointed to himself. Anthony Albanese to Michael McCormack: Doesn’t it mean the creation of the Morrison-Joyce government means there is no hope that this government will ever do the right thing by regional Australia and join the National Farmers’ Federation, the Business Council of Australia, major businesses and every state and territory government and commit to net zero emissions by 2050? McCormack: We will always do the right things by jobs in regional Australia, we always will and I know that there are a couple of members on the Labor side, the member for Paterson and Hunter, who are in favour of the resource sector, very much in favour of of ensuring their jobs in mind going forward and we will continue... We will always make sure that our policies, climate and any other policy, will be in the best interest of jobs in this nation and regional Australia is leading the way when it comes to taking responsible action on climate. Absolutely it is and the fact that we have got so many solar farms, wind farms, whether you like them or not, they are in regional Australia and, indeed, our agriculture, our agricultural industry, farming sector remains committed to making sure that it will play a leading role in lowering emissions into the future and many farmers are committed to that very task right now. They are doing all the sorts of things that you would expect them to do. I can remember, when my late father Lance, we would burn our stubble and these days they are ploughing it back into the soil to provide that vital nutrients, nitrogen back into the soil. We are changing our farming practices and so much for the better. We are improving our farming practices and we are also utilising technology. I am proud that I sit on the side of government, sit on the side of this house that has invested considerably in GPS technology, such that my father would have had to rely going all over the paddock when I was driving the tractor, just probably to get out of a job, but these days they steer themselves and well done to the government for providing that vital assistance with funding GPS technology and other technologies. Leading the way to making sure we continue to lower our emissions. We will do it through technology, not taxes. Taxes, that is the Labor way, that is the Greens away. We will do it through technology and I am proud to say that we have been beating all international obligations we said we would do and there are other countries clamouring at the moment to say a lot of things about climate but we are beating them as well. We are beating the lower emissions they are putting in place as well. Those solar panels are mostly in place because of state government policies, which encouraged their use and rollout, not because of federal government policy Labor loses the suspension of standing orders and we go back to questions. It’s a dixer on the government’s bid to further weaken Australia’s environmental protections, so go have a cup of tea. While this suspension of standing orders draws to its inevitable conclusion, Ben Doherty has a Ben Roberts-Smith update: Ben Roberts-Smith does not have Covid-19 – his test has returned negative. But his defamation trial over war crimes allegations cannot yet continue because he has only just been told by NSW health authorities he is free to leave self-isolation. Roberts-Smith will be back in the witness box from 3:30pm. The court heard from his barrister, Arthur Moses, SC, that following the negative test result Roberts-Smith had been “online for two hours” seeking instruction from the NSW Department of Health. Department officials gave him permission to leave isolation at 2:20pm. Roberts-Smith visited a Covid hotspot in the Sydney CBD some time on Thursday. The Victoria Cross recipient, who has been in the witness box for six days, is in the middle of being cross-examined over his actions in Afghanistan. Roberts-Smith, one of the most decorated soldiers in Australian military history, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of reports published in 2018. He alleges the reports are defamatory because they portray him as someone who “broke the moral and legal rules of military engagement” and committed war crimes, including six allegations of murder. The 42-year-old has consistently denied the allegations, saying they are “false”, “baseless” and “completely without any foundation in truth”. The newspapers are defending their reporting as true. Anthony Albanese gets gagged after only getting out the sentence “this circus has to end”. Circuses (without animals) can be at least entertaining though. And besides, previously, it was the muppet show. It’s hard to keep up with the analogies. Anthony Albanese is moving to suspend standing orders to debate a motion saying the coalition promised stable government and hasn’t delivered it. Plus some quarantine and vaccine stuff. It will not be successful because of the numbers in the House. But Albanese lists off all the different names the Coalition has had led it over the last eight years (six different pairings), which means the Labor party just got its TV grab up. Stuart Robert is answering a dixer which gives us all an opportunity to switch our brains off for a few minutes. Anthony Albanese gets told to stop saying “current deputy prime minister” by Tony Smith. There is no current, otherwise it flows both ways and I don’t want that coming into debate. The leader of the opposition will rephrase this question. Albanese: My question is to the deputy prime minister, instead of fighting each other, why hasn’t the government fought for a safe national quarantine system? Peter Dutton says that is not a question for Michael McCormack On a point of order, that is not a question that goes to responsibilities of the deputy prime minister and should be directed either to the prime minister or the minister for health. Albanese says that’s not true: The deputy prime minister in his capacity as regional development minister has commented, including in his last question, continuously on quarantine, on the vaccine, on the issue of the pandemic. He is the deputy prime minister. You just declared correctly that it was the case, and he should have the capacity to answer the question. Smith rules the question in order. McCormack tries to answer it (sort of): Two million deaths worldwide from the coronavirus this year ... that is absolutely tragic. We mourn for those and the families who lost their lives, and we will go on remembering them, we will go on mourning them ... But we should be very proud of what we’ve been able to do, what we’ve been able to do as a nation to keep coronavirus, the case rates very low, the death very, very low and we have in place a quarantine system using hotels and motels. And that was established through the national cabinet process of which last time I looked there were more Labor premiers sitting around that meeting then there were indeed Liberal and indeed, we’ve taken that advice, we’ve taken the advice of the Australian health protection principle committee, the advice of Professor Paul Kelly, the chief medical officer, the advice of the previous CMO, Professor Brendan Murphy. This has kept us safe. We have said to the ministers that if they can come forward with the proposals, we will certainly look at it through the national cabinet process, through the prime minister as you would expect, as Australians would expect, and of course there is criteria around it. Criteria includes a proximity to a tertiary hospital, proximity to an airport with regular international flights, making sure that the communities surrounding those facilities are indeed in favour of a quarantine facility being built in their locality. We have taken on board that advice, we have done the right thing all the way through. We have a good submission from Victoria, which is being considered in the proper way as Australians would expect. If other states come forward with proposals, we will certainly look at those as well. We have assisted with the expansion of the Howard Springs facility in the NT. An additional $500 million. We will make sure that facility is fit for purpose to take returning Australians home, but the critical thing is keeping Australians safe. I think, I know Australians would be very pleased, very pleased about how we have adopted this approach, taken the best possible medical advice and kept this nation safe. Josh Frydenberg is yelling about the economy, having once again forgotten how microphones work. It seems impossible for that knowledge to stay in his memory. No one needs this today. And judging from the expressions on the backbench, I’m not the only one who thinks this. Some new federal vaccine data has come in. As at midnight 20/06/2021: · Total vaccines: 6,590,741 · Daily increase in vaccines: +34,712 · Last 7 days: 723,442 doses (including the Queen’s Birthday long weekend in most states) · Last 8 days: 755,995 doses (including the Queen’s Birthday long weekend in most states) · Last 9 days: 816,817 doses (including the Queen’s Birthday long weekend in most states) · Last 10 days: 949,733 doses (including the Queen’s Birthday long weekend in most states) · Aged Care: All 2,566 RACF’s have received a first dose. 2,510 of 2,566 (97.8%) of Commonwealth RACF’s have received a second dose. New Zealand is approving the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has announced. The move follows Canada, the USA, Europe, and Japan, all of whom have approved Pfizer for the 12-15 age cohort. Ardern said while children were less likely to suffer serious illness from Covid-19, there were cases of children getting sick, and they could also transmit the virus. “Put simply - when our children are vaccinated, their teachers, friends, siblings, parents and grandparents are more protected from the virus too. So it’s in all of our interests for this group to get the vaccine,” Ardern said. The country’s medical regulator, Medsafe, had completed its assessment and provided “provisional consent,” meaning Pfizer must meet conditions including supplying more data from clinical trials as they progress. “Medsafe’s approval has been a very carefully considered and robust process, with safety the key priority,” Ardern said. She said there were about 265,000 children in the age bracket, and New Zealand’s existing order contained enough doses to cover the group. Medsafe approval is the first and most significant step toward vaccination for children, but the move will still need final sign-off from the Ministry of Health. A decision from the ministry is expected later this month, and 12-15 year olds would not be vaccinated before then. New Zealand is still in the early stages of its vaccine rollout, with around 7.7 percent of the adult population vaccinated. The rollout has so far focused on targeting specific vulnerable groups, including border workers and their families, high-risk frontline workers, older people, and those with pre-existing conditions. The vaccine rollout for the general adult population is due to start in July, and will be staggered by age group, reaching under-35s in October. Anthony Albanese to Michael McCormack: “To the current deputy prime minister I ask, why hasn’t the government told the deputy prime minister instead of rolling out the vaccine?” McCormack: We are rolling out the vaccine and I am very pleased we are rolling out the vaccine. There is more, but there is only so much any of us can take. Even on days like today. In this dixer, the current deputy prime minister is repeating a story about a flight attendant who thanked him for saving his job recently. Anthony Albanese now seems to be torturing Michael McCormack by asking him why he has been replaced. Over the last eight years, why has Australia enjoyed the Abbott-Truss government, then the Turnbull-Truss government, then the Turnbull-Joyce government, then the Morrison-McCormack and now the Morrison-Joyce government. If the Morrison-McCormack government was going so well, why have you been replaced? McCormack points to the Gillard-Rudd changes. Tip-top to the end. The current deputy prime minister (for one of the last times): It is called democracy, opposition leader. The Nationals took a decision today to have a party room vote, as is the conventions of any political party, indeed. The opposition leader mentions the leadership changes in the Liberal-Nationals government. I think Australians can well remember what went on in the Rudd-Gillard years. They were dysfunctional. They were chaotic. (They were eight years ago). They were not good for this nation ... we have worked very hard as a government to repay the debt left to ours as a legacy (debt had doubled under the Coalition before the pandemic) by the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years, and indeed just prior to the pandemic hitting, we were so close to getting back in the black. Indeed, we would have got back in the black but for a global pandemic, if it hasn’t escaped the attention of the opposition leader and those behind him. We are in the middle of a global pandemic and addressing that very excruciating issue for and on behalf of Australians. Since 2013, we have been a very, very good government. There are more people in employment now than they were when we got back into government in 2013. The unemployment rate at 5.1% as determined just last week is lower than it was prior to the pandemic. That is something that we should be proud of. We haven’t lost our triple-A credit rating. We have more Australians in work and more women in work participating in the workforce, and that is a good thing. I am sure the women of the Labor party agreed that it is a good thing. We will go on being a good government, we will go on under the prime minister, under the member for New England, we will go on being a good government, serving Australians as you would expect. It has been a tough day for me but I still have a job. There are a lot of Australians out there doing it a lot tougher, many Australians today who are in hospital wards recovering from Covid. My thoughts are with them. It is not about me, this is not about me, it is about Australians. We will go on serving those Australians, we will go on a serving those Australians who have got mice ravaging their farms, serving small business owners who are concerned about whether they will have a future. Rest assured, under the Liberals and Nationals, the economic future will be far brighter than it would ever be under an Albanese-led government. It will be far better than it was under those six sorry, chaotic, divided years under Rudd, Gillard and Rudd. Scott Morrison is looking up, but not at the camera – it seems like he has an autocue for this quesiton time. His eyes are looking just to the right of the camera as he says this dixer. He’s swapping between looking down at the papers on his desk and reading, and then looking just off camera. It’s very strange. This wasn’t just a moment in time – this is what they looked like for most of the press conference. Scott Morrison thanks Michael McCormack for being such a “tremendous bloke”. Then it is on to the dixers. Scott Morrison is on the screen. He’s in between two flags with a background of parliament house. Anthony Albanese asks the screen: Who is the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia? Michael McCormack takes a very big drink of water. Morrison: The member for Riverina is the deputy prime minister of Australia. As you are aware, the Nationals party room held an election today. The new leader is the member for New England. I congratulate him on his election by his party today, and look forward to working with him closely, as I do with the current deputy prime minister. I want it placed on record, my deep appreciation to the current deputy prime minister. We have enjoyed a close and a strong bond leading together as part of a strong correlation. I particularly want to commend the member for Riverina, the deputy prime minister for his great integrity, dignity, his work ethic which shows most in the chamber. To his wife, we extend thanks to the wonderful relationship we have shared together, and Jenny does as well. Anthony Albanese says he can’t hear him. The Speaker says he can hear him fine. Albanese says he can’t hear him at all. Morrison continues paying tribute to McCormack. Barnaby Joyce will be sworn in tomorrow and Morrison “looks forward to the relationship I will renew”. Michael McCormack is in the prime minister’s chair. Anthony Albanese reaches across the table and shakes his hand. Graham Perrett uses the last 45 seconds before QT to pay tribute to McCormack. He then makes a run for question time. Barnaby Joyce says he will take the energy policy his party decides on to the prime minister. He says it is not “Barnaby’s policy”. So what is the problem he is fixing, that Michael McCormack couldn’t do? I want to make sure that we have a process that we can go to places such as central Queensland. That we have the capacity to, on behalf of the Coalition, give us the very best chance of winning the next election. I’m not detracting for one second or one iota, the qualities that Michael has and has shown the parliament. I’m not saying also that I have the same suite of issues. I have a different suite of issues. I have a different suite of attributes and I hopefully will be able to apply them in such a way as to give us the best chance. And that was not a decision, as I keep saying, that I made. It’s a decision that my colleagues made. Samantha Maiden asks Barnaby Joyce about concerns some of the women in his party have raised about how some women might feel about his return, and why he resigned in the first place. Joyce: Let’s start with the most difficult one first. I believe that you have to clear the air, that even though I absolutely clearly said that if there was ever an issue of that sort, it should be taken to the police, I completely deny it and said that they were spurious and defamatory. Nonetheless, for the sake of my party, I did not want to be litigating that one at the dispatch box. With other issues, I can and I won’t start telling other people how they should start thinking of other people. I will try, always, to be the better person. I acknowledge my faults. I resigned, I’ve spent three years on the backbench. I don’t walk away from making sure that I can be a better person to do a better job. And I’m reminded by that by the people that I love dearly - my four daughters and my two sons and Vicky. Barnaby Joyce says if he was expecting something to happen today, he would have brought his hat. What has Barnaby Joyce learned in his three years away from the leadership? Well, I acknowledge my faults. And I resigned as I should [have] and I did. I’ve spent three years on the backbench and, you know, I hope I come back a better person. I don’t walk away from the fact that you have to have time to consider, not only the effect on yourself but, more importantly, the effect on others. I’ve done that. I don’t want to dwell on the personal, except to say – hopefully one learns from their mistakes and makes a better person of themselves. Barnaby Joyce has had a conversation with Scott Morrison and says he will be re-negotiating the Coalition agreement. Barnaby Joyce is very “humbled”: I’d like to say to my colleagues how humbled I am and that the task going ahead first and foremost is to make ourselves a team that is formidable for the next election. No one person makes a decision, it’s a democratic decision, and nothing is a certainty and you don’t have the minds of other people. And I’m sure that’s a question that you’re going to be asking about the circumstances that gave rise to this. But that is really secondary. The most important thing is this is about, first and foremost, the people of Australia, the people of regional Australia and to be brought about by that wonderful team, the Nationals. Before I hand over, I would like to sincerely thank Michael McCormack and I believe that Michael has conducted himself right to the press conference he just had with dignity and that is something that is a very admirable trait. While we wait for Barnaby Joyce, David Littleproud and soon-to-be-returned-to-the-ministry Bridget McKenzie to make their appearance, here was Michael McCormack’s take on what he thought about women in his party saying some women would be concerned with Joyce’s return to the leadership: Q: One of the people that was prepared to put her name on the record to her concerns was Michelle Landry, who said she was concerned that some female voters might have a problem with Barnaby Joyce because of the issues that have arisen in the past. How serious is this issue? Are there women in regional Australia that are worried about Barnaby Joyce? What is your view? McCormack: You would have to ask women in regional Australia that. Q: But I am asking you that? McCormack: I am a man in regional Australia. You would have to ask a woman in regional Australia. Q: You don’t think that men are worried about those allegations? McCormack: Again, Barnaby has been elected democratically according to party traditions and all of the rest – well, it is not part of traditions because we don’t normally do this – but by convention he has been elected. He’s got more numbers than me this morning. Good luck to him. I respect that. Q: AnneWebster says the same thing? McCormack: You will have to ask that question to Michelle and Anne. Q: What is the feedback you have been given from regional women ... It is a serious issue, isn’t it? You are a leader and not that long ago you said you were going to continue ... McCormack: A leader for not much longer but all good. Q: Sure. But if the women in your party are saying that is a problem? McCormack: I only have read what you have written. They haven’t said that to me. That is a matter for them and you can take that up with them. Gladys Berejiklian has said Sydney’s mask mandate will likely go beyond Wednesday, as New South Wales recorded a further two new local cases of Covid-19. The two new cases were recorded after 8pm on Sunday, meaning they will be recorded in Tuesday’s numbers. Two separate cases were also reported on Monday, but they had already been announced on Sunday. Berejiklian, the NSW premier, said on Monday it was likely people in Sydney and surrounding areas would need to continue wearing masks after Wednesday. “Whilst this isn’t a bad outcome, our level of concern is still there,” she said. The rules mandate masks indoors in the local government areas of Randwick, Bayside, Canada Bay, Inner West, City of Sydney, Waverley and Woollahra. Face masks are also compulsory on public transport in the Wollongong and Shellharbour local government areas, as well as in greater Sydney. “Given the situation we are in and given we don’t want to see further restrictions imposed more broadly across our city and our state, in all likelihood, the existing settings we have in place will continue beyond the five days,” Berejiklian said. Asked if she expected the restrictions to increase, NSW’s chief health officer, Kerry Chant said at the moment authorities were “just watching every new case that comes in” and monitoring for unlinked cases and new exposure venues. “This is a critical part in the response,” she said. “It is critical that we all do our part in moderating our behaviours taking that extra care, and that applies to individuals but also businesses,” Chant added. Scott Morrison’s office has released this statement: The Liberal-National Coalition has been a successful and enduring partnership for seven decades. It will continue to be a strong partnership, one based on shared values and a shared passion for building an even stronger Australia. We have achieved so much together, especially for rural and regional Australia, and together we will achieve even more. I welcome Barnaby Joyce to the role of leader of the Nationals and soon to be deputy prime minister and I look forward to working closely together to ensure Australia continues its recovery from Covid-19 and the recession it caused. Our focus remains on two outcomes – protecting lives and protecting livelihoods – as we continue to bolster our vaccine rollout and build on the economic recovery that has led to the creation of almost 1m jobs since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Barnaby and I have a shared passion for ensuring our regions and rural communities thrive. I thank Michael McCormack for his dedicated service as deputy prime minister. Michael will continue to be an invaluable member of the National party, and a passionate advocate for regional and rural communities. I wish him and his wife Catherine and their children well. Pauline Hanson is very exercised about critical race theory, which is not an issue here, unless you watch Sky News, which is also very exercised about it because Fox in America is upset about it. Seems we can all go and look up our convict ancestors and have a lot of sympathy for what they went through, but we’re not allowed to examine how Indigenous people who already lived here felt about their arrival in their country, and what ongoing systemic issues that created, which we are still witnessing today. The NSW government has confirmed the state’s public servants will get a 2.5% pay increase. Last year public sector wages in NSW were capped at 1.5% until 2014, angering unions, but the treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, has told a press conference on Monday the state was now in a position to go further. That meant wages for 400,000 workers would increase by 2.5% for the next four years, at a cost of $2.7bn. He said that was because the economy had “rebounded back”. Perrottet says: I think this is a very strong indication of the strength of the NSW economy. Michael McCormack says he has to go to question time. It’s in 30 minutes. McCormack says he will still be in the prime minister’s chair, as Barnaby Joyce hasn’t been sworn in. “It’ll be surreal, a little bit surreal,” he says. And then we get some classic McCormack talking in circles – this is paraphrased because the transcription gave up, but it was along these lines: “There are a lot of Australians out there who are having a tough day, they don’t have, they don’t have a job. There are a lot of Australians out there not working, lucky the unemployment [is going down], but there are a lot of Australians having a tougher day than I. They have Covid, for instance, and that’s why we’re encouraging people to get a vaccination. There are a lot of Australians who don’t have jobs, I still have a job I’m very thankful for that.” Bridget McKenzie will be at the press conference with Barnaby Joyce and David Littleproud. Michael McCormack is asked about Michelle Landry’s comments about women in regional Australia being uncomfortable with Barnaby Joyce’s return to the leadership. He doesn’t answer. Because he’s “a man in regional Australia”. (McCormack’s inability to speak up on important issues is one of the reasons he is no longer leader of the National party.) “Well, Michelle has said that to you so I’ve only read what you’ve written,” he says, saying it will be a matter for the women to answer. Michael McCormack thanks AFR journalist Phil Coorey for his story that “started all the hares running”. He’s being funny. Michael McCormack says he has been pre-selected to run in his seat, but he will be taking his time to consider whether he will stand at the next election and he’ll tell his community first. Michael McCormack is asked if he has a message for his National party colleagues: For the sake of good governance, good governance for the people of Australia, if you are going to say something, have the guts and the gumption to put your name to it. Don’t go backgrounding against colleagues – it’s not good for the government. It’s not good for democracy. If you’re going to say something put your name to it. You know I have always done that. Michael McCormack says he will continue to serve in the government, but will also take some time to consider his future. And just after a leadership spill that was prompted by his own party, for reasons known to his own party, he speaks about the “bubble”: It has been the government, which has made sure that we’ve had that practical responsibility, getting the job done, and people out and about in Australia at the moment – they’re not so much interested in the machinations that go on here in the bubble, they want the bread-and-butter issues addressed and that’s what we’re doing. Michael McCormack is speaking after he was dumped as the Nationals leader. He says the party will go on, no matter who is leader. His wife, Catherine, is also at this press conference. I’ve worked well with Scott Morrison, to ensure that we’ve had good and stable government in such challenging times, times that no one could have imagined. It’s been bushfires, there’s been cyclones, storms, floods, and of course, Covid-19, and all through it, we have been a good and responsible government. I’ve been there to serve alongside Scott Morrison. In that time and I regard him as a friend, as a true leader of our nation, and I will go on supporting the coalition government, the Liberals and Nationals, to continue to serve this nation. We’ve been a good government since 2013. We have delivered for Australians. I’m so humbled. I’m just a boy from my era, when I was born in 1964, in Marrar, probably a village of just a few more than 100 people, that’s all. To think that a country with a village of more than 100 people can have somebody from that village serve them as the deputy prime minister shows what a great country this is. It’s such a great country. It is such a humbling privilege, and I’m really pleased that I believe the leadership of the National party in the deputy prime ministership with the love my life, Catherine, and the respect of our three children. It is all but assured Darren Chester is moving back to the backbench: Barnaby Joyce will be holding his press conference at 1.45pm – which is just before question time and therefore means will be time limited. 1.45pm is the favoured time for when you have to say something, but don’t want to spend too long answering questions. Michael McCormack will hold his press conference in about five minutes. There are a lot of Liberal MPs who are not exactly thrilled with the news Barnaby Joyce is back. But it is the former Liberals going on the record: Anthony Albanese was asked a few questions on what he thought Barnaby Joyce’s return to the deputy prime minister role would mean: Q: Barnaby is a prominent supporter of new coal-fired power plants in Australia. Would Labor be willing to work with the government to fund a new coal-fired power plant? Albanese: No. Q: On that subject, do you see on the flip side of the whole climate change argument, do you see Joyce’s ascendancy as posing problems for you, Labor, in the Hunter? Albanese: No. Q: No? Albanese: No. Anthony Albanese is holding a quick press conference, where he has some thought on this morning’s events: This government had just two jobs this year. They had to roll out the vaccine, and they had to fix national quarantine. Now instead of rolling out the vaccine to the Australian people, they just concentrated on rolling each other. The rolling of Michael McCormack, a decent human being, by Barnaby Joyce, represents the sixth combination of prime minister and deputy prime minister under the eight long years of this government. It’s a vote of no confidence in their own government. And the fact is if you want to end this circus, it’s time to end this government. I’ve seen governments be self-indulgent before and get punished. This is a government that is being self-indulgent at a time of the pandemic. The last time there was a spill was in the middle of the bushfire crisis. This time it’s in the middle of a pandemic. Here is Barnaby Joyce casually playing catch with a piece of coal in question time back in 2017 (it had been brought in by Scott Morrison). It’s nice they get to play together again. Here was how Michael McCormack spent what turned out to be his last week in the job: Michael McCormack was deputy prime minister for 1,215 days – and in that time was unable to convince his party he could win them an election, which is why Barnaby Joyce was able to wait in the wings. Joyce’s leadership ambitions were never neutralised because McCormack didn’t make a single mark in more than three years. Homespun homilies and attacks on coffee and the inner city is not leadership. Other than “we’re getting on with the job”, does anyone know what McCormack stood for? That’s the reason Joyce is back. Anthony Albanese has responded: A couple of readers have contacted me saying they received a phone poll about a month ago asking whether they would vote for the Coalition if Barnaby Joyce were re-elected Nationals leader. They’re in Coalition electorates, they tell me. Just an interesting side note. Sarah Martin says Michael McCormack left the room saying it had been a privilege to serve and this is what democracy looks like. Then there will be a cabinet reshuffle – Darren Chester, for instance, will be moved back to the backbench, given that there is no love lost between Barnaby Joyce and Chester, and Bridget McKenzie will probably be moved back to the ministry. McKenzie stepped down over a “conflict of interest” during the sports rorts affair. But she has been very keen to return to the ministry. Keith Pitt will probably stay, given that he played a role in kicking this whole thing off. Matt Canavan will most likely get a choice about whether he wants to return. And there will most likely be some sort of discussion with Scott Morrison about the Coalition agreement – the secret agreement between the two parties that binds them but of which we’re not allowed to know the details. The governor general will have to swear Barnaby Joyce in as deputy to make it all official, but that has happened virtually lately, so there shouldn’t be too much of a hold-up. Nationals whip Damian Drum confirms Barnaby Joyce as the new leader (which is how people used to find out, because mobile phones): There was a spill motion put forward. The spill motion was carried. We had an election. And Barnaby Joyce has been elected leader of the National party at a federal level and will therefore be going through the various situations that he has to go through. He has to go through a process now to be sworn in, to have all the conversations, to talk to the prime minister, and effectively get on with the job of representing our people. Barnaby Joyce just got a $222,000 (or so) pay rise with that vote. *I was previously using old tribunal remuneration figures for this – but as a wise blog watcher pointed out, the DPM pay is 105% on top of the base backbencher pay of $211,500 as at the last determination. Meanwhile, will Barnaby Joyce continue to push for the Murugappan family to go home to Biloela now that he is returning to the $433,575 deputy PM job? That means there is another limited edition mug from the Coalition store: It has been 1,215 days since Barnaby Joyce was last in the deputy prime minister role. He stepped down after a sexual harassment allegation was made against him. A six-month investigation by the National party into the allegation was unable to reach a conclusion. You’ll find the results of that investigation here: This is some excellent game face from earlier this morning. He had more votes than toes. What a world. It’s confirmed. Barnaby Joyce has been returned as Nationals leader. Which will make him the deputy prime minister. Again. Barnaby Joyce could be in the prime minister’s chair for question time. This whole nation may actually just be a reality TV experiment. Que sera, sera indeed. The AFR is reporting Barnaby Joyce has won the leadership ballot as well. Sky News is reporting that Barnaby Joyce has won the ballot. They’ve gone back into the party room. Honestly. This cannot be difficult. Is there one person in the leadership pool who has more votes than you have fingers? Then that person is the leader. Solved. Sarah Martin says Matt Canavan said he would “leave it to others to announce” what happened in the party room. There has been a Senate division called – which means the Nationals party room meeting is being interrupted for the senators to go vote. You can’t imagine the Nationals latest leadership crisis will take too long. There are only 21 people in the party room. They only have to count to 11. That’s it. The official NSW Covid press conference will be at 1pm but here is the NSW Health alert (the new cases will be in tomorrow’s numbers): NSW recorded two locally acquired cases of Covid-19 in the 24 hours to 8pm last night, both of which were announced yesterday morning. NSW Health has also been notified of two new locally acquired cases overnight. These cases will be included in tomorrow’s numbers. Five new overseas-acquired cases were recorded in the same period, bringing the total number of cases in NSW since the beginning of the pandemic to 5,460. There were 25,252 tests reported to 8pm last night, compared with the previous day’s total of 24,468. NSW Health urges the community to come forward for testing in greater numbers as high testing numbers are vital in detecting cases of Covid-19 in order to prevent further transmission. Anyone with even the mildest of cold-like symptoms is urged to get tested without delay and isolate until a negative result is received. People in Sydney’s eastern suburbs and the Wollongong area are asked to be especially vigilant for the onset of symptoms. In the week ending Sunday 20 June, NSW Health administered 90,485 vaccines. This is the highest number of vaccines administered by NSW Health in a week and includes 36,515 vaccines administered at the Sydney Olympic Park vaccination centre. The total number of vaccines administered in NSW is now 1,897,131, with 676,080 doses administered by NSW Health to 8pm last night and 1,221,051 administered by the GP network and other providers to 11.59pm on Saturday 19 June. So Barnaby Joyce supporter Matthew Canavan has called the spill motion for the leadership of the National party. Now we wait. It’s not like there is anything else going on, like, I don’t know – a pandemic, a vaccination rollout that is behind schedule and has seen another setback, communities still recovering from bushfires, storms and loss of revenue, and about a trillion other things Australians care about because it impacts on their actual lives. But the National party is upset there could be a change of energy policy (in that there might actually be one) and its MPs are worried about their electoral chances, so you know, priorities. It’s never the challenger: And in case you didn’t believe me: Does Michael McCormack have the support of his colleagues? I hope so. We will find out soon, won’t we? Who knows what the future holds? Que sera. The future is not ours to see. I’m quoting Doris Day there. I have to go. This is the man who is now the deputy leader of the country. Sigh. Mike Bowers popped his cameras into the chamber this morning. This looks like one of the moments when Barnaby Joyce realises he probably won’t be getting to 11 and once again has created a bunch of smoke with no flame. It’s like the nation is stuck in the lamest deputy prime minister reveal party possible. Just two more examples of merit: These people can’t decide on a leader but can make decisions for the country. Makes total sense. Ben Roberts-Smith, in the middle of his defamation hearing over allegations of war crimes, has been placed into self-isolation after he visited a Covid hotspot. The Victoria Cross recipient, who has been in the witness box for six days and is being cross-examined about his actions in Afghanistan, visited a Covid hotspot in the Sydney CBD on Thursday evening. He was alerted to this by an email from the NSW Department of Health on Sunday. He was tested for Covid-19 on Sunday evening and is awaiting those results. His trial has been adjourned until he is cleared to return to court, likely sometime today. Roberts-Smith, one of the most decorated soldiers in Australian military history, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of reports published in 2018. He alleges the reports are defamatory because they portray him as someone who “broke the moral and legal rules of military engagement” and committed war crimes, including six allegations of murder. The 42-year-old has consistently denied the allegations, saying they are “false”, “baseless” and “completely without any foundation in truth”. The newspapers are defending their reporting as true. So a grinning Michael McCormack, an unhappy Barnaby Joyce and an ambivalent David Littleproud walk into the Nationals party room. Leadership. That’s it. That’s the joke. Sarah Martin tells me that on his way in to the Nationals party room, Michael McCormack was asked how he was feeling and answered with: Positive, as I’m always feeling. Uh huh. Barnaby Joyce apparently didn’t look quite so positive and walked in alone. He answered: “Good.” David Littleproud responded with: “Who knows?” If there is one thing we can be grateful for today, it’s that it is the winter solstice – and therefore the shortest day of the year. For context of what George Christensen, a member of the government, just supported, here is the bill: LNP MP George Christensen seconds Craig Kelly’s private member’s bill to the House. He does not give a speech – but he puts his name to the bill. A little earlier this morning, Barnaby Joyce laid out his case for leadership, while also saying there would be no spill: He told the Seven Network: I think that Michael McCormack is a good bloke and he’s working as hard as he can. The issue is, in the next election, and this is for the National party, for the Coalition in general – it’s going to be won in three places. The Hunter Valley, where [Labor MP] Joel [Fitzgibbon] is, in central Queensland, and in and around Darwin. That’s it. And we’ve got to make sure and Michael has to make sure that we are clearly identifiable in our policy structure in such a way that we can win it, not just for the Nationals but for the Coalition. Craig Kelly is once again using his position in the House of Representatives to question the Covid vaccine. I am not going to put his speech in here for obvious reasons but it is part of a private member’s bill for a “no domestic Covid vaccine passports bill”. There is no push for a vaccine passport at the moment. Labor has its lines for the day: Can someone let the current deputy prime minister know that he as a person will survive even if he loses his position. Can Victoria expect to see a further easing of restrictions? It is looking good, but James Merlino says that is a question for later: That is being assessed right now. I do have confidence and an expectation that later in the week we’ll be announcing a whole range of easing of restrictions for regional Victorians and Melburnians. But I don’t want to foreshadow those today. As Prof Sutton always says, everything is on the table in terms of assessment, and it will be public health advice in terms of what can be eased further in a Covid-safe way. And here is what Anthony Albanese had to say in a quick doorstop before parliament: The Coalition had two jobs this year: the effective rollout of the vaccine and national quarantine. And they’ve botched both. They’re too busy either patting themselves on the back or engaged in disruption and undermining each other to focus on the job at hand. And today we have two events. The prime minister convening a phone hook-up with state premiers, seemingly to blame them for the failure when it comes to the supply of the vaccine. And then the National party engaged in more internal chaos, as we’ve seen before. The last time there was a spill in the National party it was during the bushfire crisis. This time it’s during the pandemic. We have a plague of mice around regional Australia and we have a plague of disloyalty in this parliament when it comes to the National party. What does Victoria want to see out of the national cabinet meeting? James Merlino: This is the one job that the commonwealth government has: procure and supply vaccines. That’s what we want to see. We want to see a plan to deliver just that. At the moment – and I welcome Gen Frewen’s appointment – at the moment we’ve got a plan, but that plan includes fewer doses for Victorians for weeks in July and August. Now, they can spin it any way they like, the commonwealth government, but that is the reality for Victorians. I’m told Michael McCormack cracked some jokes while at the Australian local government conference this morning, introducing his speech with: As deputy prime minister ... well, for now. There’s some gallows humour for you. He’s stealing my material, but I’ll allow it. The acting Victorian premier, James Merlino, is about to enter one of his last national cabinet meetings (Daniel Andrews is back at the end of the month) and he using it to really step up pressure, and criticism, of the vaccine rollout by the federal government: In terms of where we are right now, we are well behind where we need to be. You know, our total in terms of our population, and how many are fully vaccinated, it’s around 3%. You look at other jurisdictions around the world, they’re at 45%, 50%, 60% fully vaccinated, and a much higher number with their first doses. So, when you compare how Australia is going with the rest of the world, we are falling so far behind it’s not funny. Now, what we’ve seen out of this very high-level plan are fewer doses for Victorians for weeks in July and August before a mad rush at the end of the year. Now, I welcome Gen Frewen’s appointment, and God knows we need someone to sort out the mess in Canberra, so I welcome his appointment. But what we need to see out of national cabinet today, and for the rest of the year, is a sense of urgency, an acknowledgement that this is a race and that we need more supply, not fewer doses, coming to Victoria in July and August, but more supply so that we can meet the demand that is out there. People want to get vaccinated. We need people to get vaccinated. The higher the proportion of your population that is vaccinated, the better options there are for public health advice in terms of how we get through this pandemic. Michael McCormack has spent the morning at the Australian Local Government Association’s national conference (which is why you haven’t seen him – it’s not that he has blended in with the wall again). He’s on his way back for the Nationals party room meeting. The government is happy to announce that when you are eventually allowed out of the country again, any pub trips will be considered “soft diplomacy”. Siplomacy, if you will. The Nationals are holding their party room meeting at 10.30am, for those wondering. Queensland CHO (and future governor) Dr Jeanette Young has also confirmed that Queensland’s latest positive Covid case (which was announced yesterday) was most likely picked up in hotel quarantine. The woman had been released from hotel quarantine and was in the community for four hours – but she doesn’t have the more contagious Delta variant, according to genomic testing, so authorities are not as worried. Queensland’s new governor has been named – Annastacia Palaszczuk has told a press conference that the chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, will step into the role when Paul de Jersey steps down in November. And Queensland has recorded no new cases of Covid today. There is another deer on the loose. Of course there is. Nothing else is going on today. Victorian Nationals MP Darren Chester, who is Michael McCormack’s greatest strength (his numbers man, and the one reasonable heads tend to listen to – reasonable heads within the Nationals being an entirely different “reasonable” to what you might be used to) was playing down any chance of a challenge while speaking to the ABC a little earlier: I’ve heard the speculation. I don’t think there’s even going to be a spill motion today, and nor should there be. I think Michael McCormack is doing a very good job for our country, for regional Australia, in difficult circumstances. And, you know, as I travel around my electorate – I was back in Gippsland yesterday – the recovery from the floods and storms are under way, that’s what people are talking to me about. We had the Australian defence force on the ground yesterday. And we’ve got some big issues we’re trying to deal with in my community and right across regional Australia. Quite frankly, I actually think regional Australians more generally are tired of this bulldust. They want us absolutely focused on them, on the issues that matter to them, and so I think Michael will continue in his role throughout the day and lead us to the next election. For those who are asking, Barnaby Joyce saying there is “no prospect” of a leadership spill today, doesn’t mean there absolutely won’t be a spill. It just means that Joyce won’t be the one to call it. That’s not unusual – leadership challengers are rarely called on by the challenger these days. But it doesn’t mean it absolutely won’t happen. Joyce doesn’t seem to have the magic number of 11 just yet (let’s remember that there are only 21 people in this party room – 21 people who have spent the time since Joyce stepped down in 2018 wringing their hands over who should lead them) so the next few hours are going to be very interesting. And don’t rule out David Littleproud doing a Scott Morrison and coming up through the middle (you may remember the original challenge to Malcolm Turnbull was Peter Dutton). There are two things going on with the Nats right now. One is climate – the Nationals are terrified Morrison might actually listen to the international community and do something on climate, like commit Australia to a net zero 2050 emissions target (a reminder that net zero is not zero emissions), which is very scary to a party which is still telling people it wants to build a new coal-fired power station. They don’t think McCormack pushes back enough (I mean, that is a timeless statement – it’s been almost three years and Barnaby Joyce is STILL an option because McCormack is so beige). The other thing is the Nats have an eye to the election. When Joyce was leader in 2016, the Nats held all their seats (and picked up one, from memory) despite Turnbull’s unpopularity, because Joyce was a powerful Nats brand. In 2019 McCormack might have been weak but Morrison was strong enough for the Nats to hold. Morrison’s personal popularity has been on the downhill slide for a little bit now, and the Nats are worried that without a strong leader themselves, and a weakened Liberals leader, they are left vulnerable. So they’re looking to hold their seats. Always the best way to make decisions that decide who should be Australia’s deputy prime minister. (Plus, depending on who it is, the decision could also lead to a loss of seats in other areas. So what is the big picture play, here?) Victoria will hold its press conference at 9.30am this morning. There’s also the emergency national cabinet meeting today to discuss the vaccine rollout in light of the changed advice. Let’s just go through some of this morning shall we? 2GB host Ben Fordham: Just on your trip, it is being reported this morning that your office spent weeks planning a G7 side trip to explore your convict family roots while you were arguing that Britain was too risky for Australian travellers. I’m guessing there’ll be some people saying that this is double standards. Scott Morrison: Oh Ben, I think that’s, I wouldn’t describe it like that at all. I mean, we had to land north of London as opposed to landing down there in Cornwall because of the fog. And we stopped off along the way. We had some lunch and stopped off in another location on the way and after the G7 on the way to the airport, we stopped at another place, which just happens to be where my fifth great-grandfather was from. So I think it was pretty innocent. I think that’s massively overstating it. On the prime minister’s dismissal that he just stopped off somewhere in Cornwall that “happens to be” where his (fifth) great-grandfather was from (where a local florist also happened to be ready with a bouquet of flowers) which then Simon Birmingham described as “soft diplomacy” (because apparently it might be news to a country which colonised Australia that its leaders might have links to said country), could we all just give the Australian public a little more credit? It’s not the fact that it happened, it’s that there seems to have been an attempt to keep it off the media schedule – and then just wave it off when questions are asked. Q: While you were away, Four Corners put together this investigation trying to link you to a bloke called Tim Stewart who’s involved in the QAnon conspiracy theory. What did you make of all of that? Morrison: Well, I thought it was, I think it was pretty ordinary. I mean, we’ve all got friends and we’ve all got acquaintances and people we know who have views that we don’t share. But you know what they expect us to do just to sort of cancel people just because they have views different to ourselves? I don’t support the views of QAnon. I barely even knew what it was until more recently over the last year or so. So, you know, look, if people are going to have a crack at you because of what people you know think, I think that’s really starting to, you know, bit of a longbow. Fordham: Out of interest, are you still close to him or have you given a little bit of fresh air there? Morrison: No, look, I haven’t seen Tim for some time, much closer to his wife, who you know, Jenny and I are longtime friends of her, I just think it’s sort of a bit ordinary to drag other people into, I mean, I’m the prime minister, hold me accountable for my views. For people who have known me or have been friends with me over the period of time, they’re entitled to their privacy regardless if people don’t agree with their views. And I certainly don’t agree with Tim’s views on those things at all. I mean, he’s a Sharkies supporter – I agree with him on that – but not on QAnon. It’s the same when it comes to the prime minister’s defence of his friendship with Tim Stewart. No one holds Morrison responsible for the views of his personal friends. (My dad has voted One Nation since 1996, for Dolly’s sake.) What people want is some answers to questions – were there conversations about adding the word “ritual” to the apology to child abuse survivors? If so, why and, given these concerns were first raised in 2019, why has there been no response? It’s the dismissal of questions, the pats on the head and the ol’ “don’t you worry about that” fallback – instead of actual answers – which is the issue. Photographer Mike Bowers was up early capturing some bracing scenes on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin as Canberrans stripped off for the fifth annual winter solstice nude charity swim. The person is a close contact and has been in isolation for their infectious period though, so no need to worry. Labor will move a motion in the Senate today in support of a referendum for a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament – which is what the Uluru Statement from the Heart called for. From Patrick Dodson and Malarndirri McCarthy’s statement: The proposals in the Uluru Statement are modest and compelling. They are the result of an extensive, democratic process involving months of dialogues with First Nations people around the country. Yet four years after the Uluru Statement was first presented to the Australian people, very little progress has been made towards realising its generous vision. In 2017, the Greens expressed their strong support for the Uluru Statement and urged all sides of politics to start the process outlined. In 2019, Minister Wyatt promised a referendum on constitutional recognition in this term of government. We are asking the Coalition and the Greens to stand by these promises and join Labor in supporting the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full. The Uluru Statement represents a unique opportunity to realise a fairer and more decent Australia. Here’s how the local Cornwall media described the trip: Mr Morrison took time out from the Bodmin Jail to travel to St Keverne in memory of his ancestor. He spent some time in the village’s parish church and and laid flowers in the churchyard, with the bouquet provided by local florist Emma Hosking. The prime minister wrote in the church’s visitor book: “Thank you for your very kind welcome to St Keverne. It has been wonderful to to return ‘home’ in memory of William Roberts.” ... After talking to member of the public he popped into the Three Tuns pub, enjoyed a pint of Korev and sandwich while the Australian high commissioner tucked in to one of the pub’s Sunday roasts. He also dropped in for a quick tour of the newly refurbished £8.5 million Bodmin Jail museum which includes an immersive and educational journey through Cornwall’s dark past. Here was Scott Morrison’s full quote on his visit to trace his family roots, while he was in the UK for the G7 (and telling us it’s still too dangerous to travel): I mean, we had to land north of London, as opposed to landing down there in Cornwall because of the fog, and we stopped off along the way we had some lunch and, and, we stopped off in another location on the way. And on after the G7 on the way to the airport we stopped in another place, which just happens to be where my fifth great-grandfather was from, so I think was pretty innocent. I think that’s massively overstating it. This is a new one. Simon Birmingham is asked about Bevan Shield’s story in the Sydney Morning Herald that the prime minister made a long-planned side trip to trace his family’s convict ancestry while in the UK, despite telling Australia it’s still too dangerous to travel (and while thousands of Australians are still stranded overseas, unable to come home because of quarantine caps). He says Scott Morrison was engaging in “soft diplomacy”. (Morrison, for the record, told 2GB he stopped off on the way to the airport after the G7 at a place that “just happens to be” where his (fifth) great-grandfather was from. What are the chances?!) Birmingham: All leaders when they’re overseas engage in soft diplomacy – that’s the nature of building relations with other countries and other communities and the substance of the prime minister’s trip saw a trade agreement signed with the UK, it saw the Nato summit make strong statements in relation to China. It saw agreements for cooperation for hydrogen signed with leaders of Germany and Singapore and saw an agreement with the leader of Japan there. The ABC hosts very rightly point out that it was a personal visit, and Birmingham says: Well, that type of engagement is precisely what a soft diplomacy type exercise is. Tracing your family roots is soft diplomacy? Showing the connection between leaders and other countries and between nations is, indeed, very much [soft diplomacy]. Does he believe it was justifiable? My understanding is that these things happened on his way to and from the region in which the meetings were held. And as you can see from what I just went through, there was plenty of agenda and substance. The purpose of the trip was very clear. It was the first time that President Biden had travelled overseas for meetings and the fact that Australia was able to be at the table, have meetings with President Biden and prime minister Johnson to discuss the many particular challenges that we face and to highlight issues in our region and it was a crucial opportunity that the prime minister was right to seize and pursue. Barnaby Joyce was on the Seven Network this morning. He said: There is no prospect of a spill at this point in time. I would just let that issue arise. (That doesn’t mean that someone won’t still call on a spill this morning though. Llew O’Brien called it on the last time, not Joyce.) Simon Birmingham is hoping it means the Nationals have calmed down: Well, I welcome that. I expect that that would be the truth, if that’s what he’s saying. I expect that everybody ought to be focused on the jobs and security and safety of Australians. And we have a record number of Australians in employment at present. They’re the jobs that matter and they’re the jobs we’ve got to keep creating and growing. But it’s not a great look is it? I don’t know where the speculation has come from. I see Barnaby Joyce is ruling it out. That’s welcome because the priority is about Australians outside of this building. That’s the prime minister’s focus is. It’s where my focus is and I know it is where Michael McCormack’s focus is too. (The phone calls are coming from within the house, Birmingham. Or, for non-horror fans, the speculation is coming from the Nationals party who have never been happy with McCormack’s leadership and are in two camps; “We’ve only really got Joyce” and “Anyone but Joyce”.) Simon Birmingham was over on the ABC talking about the coronavirus vaccine rollout – the states have raised concerns about the supplies of Pfizer. We know that the bulk of what Australia has on order isn’t arriving until the end of the year. And the head of the rollout, General Frewen, admitted on Friday that the rate of vaccinations would slow while waiting for some more supplies. Birmingham says the government is “working to ensure that we have as much available supply as possible”. (We don’t make mRNA vaccines in the country though, and the whole world wants mRNA vaccines, so there isn’t a huge amount which can be done in the short term.) Birmingham: There’s around 2.3m doses of the Pfizer vaccine being distributed through this part of June. There’s around 3.4m doses expected to be available for distribution through July. We’ve had across the country around 6.5 million Australians who have had their first dose or a dose of vaccines, sorry, 6.5m doses administered. And more than 65% of those aged over 70 have received their first dose, and many of them are becoming eligible for the second dose. So, of course, we would wish that some of the disruptions to the vaccine program that we’ve seen such as the changing health advice had not occurred, but that health advice has changed. We’ve had to pivot and we’re working with the states and territories as best we can to make sure that the supplies that are there get out and get distributed effectively. Scott Morrison said he is “absolutely” happy with Michael McCormack’s leadership and he has a “wonderful” partnership with him, providing “a great stable leadership for Australia”. Scott Morrison has kicked off his return to the country with a chat to Sydney radio station 2GB, where he dismissed practically every question put to him (not that they were difficult) and then spoke about how he saw the host on Ninja Warrior overnight. So let’s go through what he said. On the Sydney Morning Herald story which reported that his office “spent weeks planning a G7 side trip to explore his convict family roots while the prime minister publicly argued Britain was too risky for Australian travellers (he made a trip to St Keverne, which the SMH’s Europe correspondent reports was on his schedule for at least two weeks but never disclosed to the media) Morrison says: After the G7 on the way to the airport we stopped in another place, which just happens to be where my fifth great-grandfather was from so I think it was pretty innocent. “Which just happens to be.” On his friendship with Tim Stewart, who is married to Jenny Morrison’s best friend, who is heavily involved with QAnon and has posted on social media about his ability to speak with the prime minister (as well as housesitting Kirribilli) and claimed credit for the inclusion of the word “ritual” in Morrison’s apology to child sexual abuse survivors (a word which also serves as a code to QAnon believers), Morrison says the Four Corners report was a bit “ordinary”. I mean, we’re all got friends and we’ve all got acquaintances and people we know who have views that we don’t share, but you know what will they expect us to do to sort of cancel people just because I have views different to ourselves. I don’t support views of QAnon and I barely even knew what it was until more recently over the last year or so, if people are going to have a crack at you because of what of people you know think, I think that is drawing a bit of a long bow. Morrison said he hadn’t seen Stewart for “some time”. I’m much closer to his wife – Jenny and I are longtime friends of her. I just think it’s sort of a bit ordinary to drag other people into the – I mean, I’m the prime minister, hold me account[able] for my views. People who have known me or been friends with me over the period of time they’re entitled to their privacy regardless. If people don’t agree with their views, and I certainly don’t agree with Tim’s views on those things at all. I mean, he’s a Sharky supporter – I agree with him on that – but not on QAnon. [laughs] Welcome to another sitting week, which opens with the Nationals throwing a tantrum over their leadership. Again. The last time the Nationals did this it was February 2020 when the parliament was holding a special day to recognise the deadly, devastating, summer bushfires. This time they’ve chosen a pandemic, in the middle of a confused vaccination rollout. It’s almost like ... the Nationals are only focused on themselves? Barnaby Joyce has told the Seven Network there is “no prospect” of a spill today. That’s after a weekend of Joyce’s backers telling people the former deputy prime minister and Nationals leader was within a vote of the leadership. Michael McCormack, the current deputy prime minister, says he is just getting on with the job. The job being protecting his job, at the moment. And while Joyce and McCormack fight it out, David Littleproud, the deputy leader, is on the sidelines, ready to step in as a consensus candidate. A reminder there are only 21 people in the Nationals party room. And no overwhelming agreement about who should lead them. Good times. We’ll bring you that, as well as the actual news which is important to you, including what the national cabinet decides is the best plan for the vaccine rollout in light of the new AstraZeneca advice, which recommends it only be given to people who are over 60. The state and territory leaders will be meeting (virtually) today with Scott Morrison, who is back in Australia and in quarantine. He’ll also be appearing at question time virtually. We’ll bring you that as well. You have Mike Bowers with you this morning, as well as Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp, Sarah Martin and Daniel Hurst in Canberra. You have Amy Remeikis on the blog. It’s going to be a long day.

The shells of gutted homes stand in barren rice paddies that lay in the path of waves that killed more than 18,000 people across three prefectures in north-east Japan – including 1,600 in Fukushima – on the afternoon of 11 March 2011. The Fukushima brand may forever be associated with nuclear catastrophe, but some residents, angered by persistent rumours about the dangers of even making brief visits to the area, are turning to tourism to show the world that, for some, life in Fukushima goes on. “The people around here aren’t happy with the idea they live in a ‘dark” place,” says Shuzo Sasaki, a prefectural government official who also works as a guide for Real Fukushima, one of several organisations offering tours to small groups of visitors. “The idea that because this is Fukushima it must be dangerous is completely wrong,” adds Sasaki, who has guided students from the Georgia Institute of Technology and will host a group of Danish high school pupils next year. The challenge facing residents desperate to change the Fukushima narrative was highlighted this summer with the release of “Dark Tourist”, a Netflix series hosted by the New Zealand journalist David Farrier. In one episode, Farrier and several foreign tourists were shown glued to their Geiger counters as they were driven around the area in a minibus, with some becoming visibly distressed when radiation readings spiked. When they reluctantly ate lunch at a restaurant, Farrier speculated that his meal might be contaminated, even though the official threshold for radioactive substances in food from Fukushima is much lower than those in the European Union and the US. In some decontaminated parts of Fukushima, radiation levels have fallen to the government target of 0.23 microsieverts an hour, or 1 millisievert a year assuming that an individual spends eight hours outdoors and 16 hours indoors each day. By comparison, the global average exposure of humans to ionizing radiation is between 2.4 and 3 millisieverts a year. Karin Taira, a Real Fukushima guide who runs the Lantern House, a guesthouse in the Odaka district, claims the Netflix documentary overstated the risk posed by radiation and painted an unrelentingly negative picture of the area. “It gave the impression that this place is hopeless,” she says. “But there is hope here.” But there are also reminders of the devastation unleashed by the tsunami and the nuclear meltdown. On a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean, a memorial lists the names of 182 people who were swept away to their deaths in the town of Namie. Inland, just beyond the tsunami’s destructive reach, is evidence of a different kind of tragedy. At Kumamachi primary school, just two kilometres from the wrecked nuclear plant, classrooms appear frozen in time, with books, bags and other possessions abandoned when the order to evacuate was given. Outside, wild grass and weeds are reclaiming streets where wild boar and raccoons roam, untroubled by humans. Only a small number of the 150,000 people evacuated after the triple meltdown have returned to areas deemed safe by the government. Some parents are concerned about their children’s long-term exposure to radiation, amid evidence that in some areas levels are higher than the government claims. Others have built new lives elsewhere and see no compelling reason to return to areas whose economies were ruined by the disaster. But a semblance of civic life is returning to some towns and villages, which before the tsunami were known for their farm produce and seafood. This summer, a beach 40km north of Fukushima Daichi reopened after seven years. Farmers are replanting rice and other crops, and fishermen have returned to the sea. Solar plants have been built in abandoned fields, although they are dwarfed by the estimated 16m bags containing radioactive topsoil removed from the region during a huge decontamination effort. Fukushima City will host baseball and football matches during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and J Village, commandeered in the aftermath of the meltdown to host thousands of workers and their equipment, has been restored to its original role as a football coaching centre. ‘We want tourists to come and see for themselves’ In the town of Okuma, local official Shuyo Shiga and his colleagues are preparing for the opening next April of a new town office, apartments and shops following the partial lifting of the evacuation order. There are also loose plans to refurbish traditional Japanese houses and advertise them though Airbnb. In 2016, 52,764 people visited the area, according to prefectural government figures, more than 92% the number seen the year before the disaster. “Visitors who come for the first time are amazed that there are people actually living here,” Shiga says. Takahiro Kanno has seen his hotel, located by the coast in the city of Minamisoma, transform from lodgings for power plant and decontamination workers into a destination for tourists and parties of schoolchildren. “It’s still difficult to encourage people to come, but those who do are amazed to see that people living so close to the nuclear power plant are leading normal lives again.” Nora Redmond, an Australian who was touring the area with her husband Billy and their daughter Ciara, said they had “done their homework” on the risks posed by radiation and had no concerns for their health during the several hours they spent in areas close to Fukushima Daiichi. “We heard that the region was suffering from depopulation so we thought it would be a good idea to spend some time and money up here,” Redmond says. “I didn’t realise the scale of the devastation, that people’s whole history has gone. We must have seen 20 houses being pulled down as we were driving around. You could see the beautiful wooden interiors … and they were being reduced to rubble. That was what struck me most.” Fukushima residents balk at the suggestion that they are victims – a label that ignores the pockets of economic activity sprouting up in communities where radiation levels have been brought down to government-set targets. In Europe, average natural background exposure ranges from below 2 millisieverts a year in Britain to more than 7 millisieverts in Finland, according to the pro-nuclear lobby group the World Nuclear Association. “It will take years for this and other neighbourhoods to look like they did before the disaster,” Kanno concedes. “In the meantime, we want tourists to come and see for themselves and to learn what life is really like here. But this is just a start.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/mar/31/when-new-technology-goes-wrong-humans-carry-the-can","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-03-31T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"When new technology goes badly wrong, humans carry the can | John Naughton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/31/when-new-technology-goes-wrong-humans-carry-the-can","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/31/when-new-technology-goes-wrong-humans-carry-the-can","fields":{"headline":"When new technology goes badly wrong, humans carry the can","bodyText":"Since the 1960s, one of the key developments in making cars safer has been the idea of a “crumple zone”, a part of the vehicle (usually the front) that is designed to absorb the energy from a collision by controlled deformation, ie crumpling. By doing this, the zone protects the most important part of the car – the cell containing the driver and passengers. (If you doubt the effectiveness of crumple zones, by the way, a video made some years ago by the Fifth Gear TV programme makes interesting viewing.) As the world moves to vehicles that drive themselves, our roads are likely to become safer because most road accidents are caused by driver error. That, at any rate, is the standard spiel of evangelists for autonomous vehicles. There will, they say, be many fewer collisions and therefore less carnage on our roads. Crumple zones will become less necessary, though autonomous vehicles will continue to need them. For some time to come, however, the new crumple zones won’t look anything like the ones built into today’s Volkswagens, Toyotas and Fords. In fact, they will be indistinguishable from you and me because they will be humans. This is the argument advanced in Moral Crumple Zones: Cautionary Tales in Human-Robot Interaction, a fascinating academic paper by Madeleine Clare Elish, an anthropologist who works at the Data &amp; Society institute in New York. She had been reading media coverage of self-driving cars over the last few years and noting that the prevailing narrative was, and remains, consistent in one respect: on the (rare) occasions when a self-driving car has been involved in an accident it is invariably the fault in some way of human drivers rather than of the machine itself. A classic example is the case of an accident in March last year when an Uber self-driving car struck and killed a pedestrian who was wheeling her bike across a highway in Arizona. At the steering wheel of the supposedly autonomous vehicle was a safety driver whose job was to monitor the car’s systems and take over in the event of an emergency. The safety driver may now face criminal charges of vehicular manslaughter. This tragic accident brought to the fore the question that has been on everyone’s mind – or at least on the minds of tech company lawyers – for the last few years: if a driverless car kills someone, who or what is to blame? This particular case is relatively recent but it’s just the latest example of an older question, namely: what is the responsibility of a human who is obliged to work in a complex, interactive system designed by others? To illustrate this, Dr Elish looks at two celebrated earlier cases: the partial meltdown of the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania in March 1979; and the case of Air France Flight 447 in 2009, in which an Airbus jet with 228 people on board crashed into the Atlantic, killing everyone on board. Both cases involved human operators and pilots struggling to mitigate disasters caused by the malfunctioning of complex and inscrutable technical systems. But in both cases the prevailing tone of media (and some “expert”) commentary was that human error – rather than design failures – provided the main explanation for what happened. “The explicit point,” writes Elish, “is that the autopilot and associated automation are smart enough to outsmart and save the human every time, the same narrative we saw in nuclear power plant design. The idea that the automation and its software could ever fail was never a possibility.” This mindset prompts Dr Elish to coin the term “moral crumple zone” to describe the role assigned to humans who find themselves in the positions that the Three Mile Island operators, the Air France pilots – and the safety driver in the Uber car – occupied. It describes how responsibility for an action may be wrongly attributed to a human being who had limited control over the behaviour of an automated or autonomous system. “While the crumple zone in a car is meant to protect the human driver,” she writes, “the moral crumple zone protects the integrity of the technological system, at the expense of the nearest human operator. What is unique about the concept of a moral crumple zone is that it highlights how structural features of a system and the media’s portrayal of accidents may inadvertently take advantage of human operators (and their tendency to become “liability sponges”) to fill the gaps in accountability that may arise in the context of new and complex systems.” This all aligns nicely with one of the most pernicious aspects of our time: the subliminal tendency to assign more credibility to supposedly “smart” machines than to humans. In the meantime, I can see corporate lawyers at the big tech companies salivating at the idea of a ready supply of liability sponges and wondering why they hadn’t thought of it before. What I’m reading Breaking Vlad Russia is planning an experiment: to cut itself off from the global internet. It might be more difficult than Putin realises, reports the MIT Technology Review. Beyond the pale Stanford University has a new institute to look into the challenges of AI and show its commitment to addressing concerns over tech’s lack of diversity. Guess what, Quartz reports: of 121 faculty members associated with the venture, 100 appeared to be white and the majority were male! News unworthy The Columbia Journalism Review surveys how mainstream media covered the Christchurch killings.

This live blog is now closed, you can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war in our new live blog. Here are some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine today. US President Joe Biden is set to announce plans on Thursday to send additional military aid to help Ukraine fight back against the Russian invasion, according to a US official. The official, who was not authorised to comment publicly and spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, said Biden will deliver a Thursday morning address at the White House detailing his plans to build on the roughly $2.6bn in military assistance the administration has already approved for Ukraine. The new package is expected to be similar in size to the $800m package Biden announced last week. It includes much needed heavy artillery and ammunition for Ukrainian forces in the escalating battle for the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. “I don’t know about you, but I’ve been to Ukraine a number of times before the war ... and I knew they were tough and proud but I tell you what: They’re tougher and more proud than I thought,” Biden told military commanders. “I’m amazed at what they’re doing with your help.” Chinese President Xi Jinping has reiterated China’s opposition to unilateral sanctions and “long-arm jurisdiction,” and said that “de-coupling” and pressure tactics such as cutting off of supply chains will not work. China has repeatedly criticised western sanctions, including those against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, but has also been careful not to provide assistance to Moscow that could lead to sanctions being imposed on Beijing. During a video speech to the annual Boao Forum for Asia gathering on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, Xi also said that efforts are needed to stabilise global supply chains, but also said China’s economy is resilient and that its long-term trend had not changed. Today’s Guardian Today in Focus podcast asks: Can Russia succeed as a new chapter of war begins in Ukraine? Ukraine’s army held off Putin’s forces and stopped a Russian takeover of Kyiv in the first phase of the war. But, as Luke Harding reports, Russia’s approach in this next stage looks very different Now, Putin’s focus is largely on winning territory in the east of the country. In terms of military might, Russia appears to hold the advantage. But in the messy, grinding weeks ahead, will its forces be able to sustain the resources and willpower necessary to grasp victory? A senior Kyiv official accused the International Committee of the Red Cross of working “in concert” with Russia in Ukraine, a charge the organisation has denied. Ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova decried ICRC’s announcement last month that it was planning to open a branch in Russia’s southern Rostov region to help Ukrainian refugees, who, Kyiv says, have been forcibly deported to Russia. “The International Red Cross is not fulfilling its mandate, I am certain of that,” Denisova said on Ukrainian television Wednesday after meeting with the head of the ICRC’s Ukrainian branch, AFP reports. Citing data from the United Nations, Denisova said that some 550,000 Ukrainians, including 121,000 children, have been taken to Russia during the course of the war, but Kyiv has no information on who these people are and where they are being kept. “Where are they? In filtration camps? In temporary facilities?” Denisova asked. The official said she had asked both her Russian counterpart Tatyana Moskalkova and the ICRC for help in getting information on these refugees so that Ukraine could facilitate their return home, but had received “zero answer from her or from the Red Cross”. Asked by the TV anchor whether Denisova suspected that the Red Cross was working “in concert” with Russia, Denisova replied: “Yes, I suspect they are.” The ICRC strongly rejected Kyiv’s accusations. “The ICRC does not ever help organise or carry out forced evacuations. We would not support any operation that would go against people’s will and international law,” the organisation said in a statement to AFP. It added: “Building and maintaining a dialogue with parties to a conflict is essential to get access to all people affected and obtain necessary security guarantees for our teams to deliver life-saving aid.” The Red Cross said it has been exploring the possibility to open an office in southern Russia. “Our sole objective is to alleviate the suffering of the people affected by the armed conflict. And the suffering right now is simply immense.” Here is an inside look at a settlement for displaced people in Lviv, Ukraine. Houses were provided by the Polish government. “Here we can be just by ourselves, we have real beds, and it’s warm,” Viktoria, a 39-year-old kindergarten administrator, told AFP. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki made a visit to the new settlement on Tuesday, saying it could welcome up to 350 people. “There will be more of these villages. In Lviv alone, they will accommodate 5,000 people,” he said, adding that plans were afoot to build similar settlements in ravaged towns retaken from the Russians outside the capital Kyiv. Russia controls 80% of territory in Luhansk, the head of the Luhansk regional military administration has said. Serhiy Gaidai said in an update posted to his official Facebook account: Yes, 80% of our territories are now controlled by [Russians]. Kremínna under [Russian control], Rubížne and Popasna. The fights are going on.” Gaidai added that morgues and hospitals in the temporarily occupied territories are crowded. “Luhansk land is full of corpses of enemies,” he said. Germany will phase out Russian oil imports “by the end of the year” foreign minister Annalena Baerbock has said. Speaking at a news conference in Riga with Baltic foreign ministers, Baerbock reiterated that coal imports would be phased out by the end of the summer. Gas imports would be phased out over a longer timeframe, she added. I therefore say here clearly and unequivocally yes, Germany is also completely phasing out Russian energy imports. We will halve oil by the summer and will be at 0 by the end of the year, and then gas will follow, in a joint European roadmap, because our joint exit, the complete exit of the European Union, is our common strength.” G7 finance ministers said they have provided and pledged together additional support to Ukraine exceeding $24bn for 2022 and beyond, adding that they were prepared to do more as needed. In a statement seen by Reuters, the ministers said they regretted Russia’s participation in international forums, including G20, International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings this week. “International organisations and multilateral fora should no longer conduct their activities with Russia in a business-as-usual manner,” the ministers said. Ukraine is ready to offer unconditional talks on Mariupol and has proposed to hold a “special round” of negotiations with Russia in the besieged city, officials said. “Without any conditions. We’re ready to hold a ‘special round of negotiations’ right in Mariupol,” Ukraine negotiator and presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted. Another key Ukrainian negotiator, David Arakhamia, said he and Podolyak “are ready to arrive in Mariupol to hold talks” and “a proposal was put forward to hold direct negotiations, on site, on the evacuation of our military garrison.” Meanwhile, Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy said the situation in Mariupol is deteriorating with roughly 1,000 civilians remaining trapped in the city’s Azocstal steel plant, hiding there with the remaining fighters, who are heavily outnumbered. Zelenskiy said 120,000 people were being kept in Mariupol and that “crimes that are happening there are far more scary and large scale than in Borodyanka”, referencing a devastated Ukrainian town. A Ukrainian marine commander fighting in Mariupol has said his forces are “maybe facing our last days, if not hours”, as another Russian ultimatum to the remaining Ukrainian troops in the city to surrender or die expired with no mass capitulation. “The enemy is outnumbering us 10 to one,” Serhiy Volyna, a commander from the 36th separate marine brigade, said in a video message. Intelligence indicates Russia is poised to launch powerful cyberattacks against rivals supporting Ukraine, members of the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence sharing network - the US, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - have warned. “Evolving intelligence indicates that the Russian government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks,” the group said in a statement. Putin ally Ramzan Kadyrov said Russian forces would be in complete control of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol “before lunchtime, or after lunch” on Thursday. The head of Russia’s republic of Chechnya made the claim in an audio message posted online early on Thursday as seen by Reuters. Ukraine is working to convince western allies to shift Russia’s shipments of natural gas from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Ukraine’s pipeline, increasing Kyiv’s leverage in its conflict with Russia, energy officials told Reuters. Italy has signed a deal with Angola to ramp up gas supplies in a bid to break away from Russian gas. In an interview with the Corriere della Sera, Prime minister Mario Draghi said: “We do not want to depend on Russian gas any longer, because economic dependence must not become political subjection.” The US defence department retracted its claim that Ukraine had been supplied with more aircraft, instead saying only parts had been delivered to enable Kyiv to put more jets into the fight against Russia. A senior US defence official added 14 US howitzers were now being delivered to the region, along with ammunition for them. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the US is “working around the clock to provide security assistance to Ukraine” as five flights with military assistance arrived in the region over the last few days, with more than half a dozen flights from the US scheduled to arrive shortly with more equipment. The US also imposed sanctions on dozens of people and entities, including a Russian commercial bank and a virtual currency mining company with the aim “to target Moscow’s evasion of existing sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine”. Germany has defended itself against criticism that its delay in authorising the delivery of heavy weapons to Ukraine. Foreign minister Annalena Baerbock agreed to a swap system whereby Germany would help refill the gaps in the arsenal of Nato and G7 states after saying Germany has has run out of military hardware it can dispatch swiftly without undermining its own security commitments. Russia said it had test-launched its Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, a new addition to its nuclear arsenal. “This truly unique weapon will strengthen the combat potential of our armed forces, reliably ensure Russia’s security from external threats and provide food for thought for those who, in the heat of frenzied aggressive rhetoric, try to threaten our country,” Putin said. Zelenskiy spoke of his “cautious optimism” that Ukraine’s partners now better understand the needs of his country, seemingly in reference to supplying weapons and intensifying sanctions on Russia. Ukraine can develop “maximum speed” in joining the EU, Zelenskiy said in a national address Wednesday evening after meeting with the president of the European council, Charles Michel. “This is the historic moment when we can develop maximum speed in joining the European Union,” he said. UK prime minister Boris Johnson likened Russian president Vladimir Putin to a crocodile, saying he is not optimistic that the Russian leader can be negotiated with. “How can you negotiate with a crocodile when it has your leg in its jaws, that is the difficulty that Ukrainians face. It is very hard to see how the Ukrainians can negotiate with Putin now given his manifest lack of good faith,” he told journalists. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has separately asked Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to receive him to discuss steps to bring about peace. Finance ministers from the UK, US, Canada and France walked out of Wednesday’s G20 meeting as Russian representatives spoke, exposing deepening divisions over Russia’s continued presence in the body. A small but growing number of top Kremlin insiders are reportedly questioning President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine, according to Bloomberg. Some senior Kremlin insiders believe Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a “catastrophic mistake that will set the country back for years”, the channel cited multiple sources as saying. More than 5 million people have fled Ukraine since Russian troops invaded the country on 24 February, according to figures by the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR). Women and children account for 90% of those who have fled. A further 7.1 million people are displaced inside Ukraine. Imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has also spoken out against far-right French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen’s alleged ties to Russia in a long Twitter thread late on Wednesday. “This bank is a well-known money-laundering agency created at the instigation of Putin,” Navalny tweeted, without citing evidence other than his own investigations into corruption in Russia. “This is selling political influence to Putin.” French President Emmanuel Macron has accused his far-right rival Marine Le Pen of being in thrall to Russian President Vladimir Putin over a years-old Russian bank loan to her party during a fiery debate ahead of Sunday’s election. Macron’s strongest lines of attack were on a well-publicised loan to her party for its 2017 campaign contracted through a Russian bank. “You depend on the Russian power, you depend on Mr. Putin,” Macron told his opponent. “A lot of your choices can be explained by this dependence,” he said in an attack on Le Pen’s policy positions. “You cannot defend the interests of France because your interests are linked to Russian powers,” Macron said. “In 2015 you took out a loan with a Russian bank and you still have not paid it back.” Le Pen dismissed the charge of being compromised politically by the Russian bank loan. “He knows I am a free woman, I am a patriot. I have always defended France and the French. Always and in all circumstances,” she said. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has separately asked Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to receive him to discuss steps to bring about peace. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said separate letters were handed to the permanent missions of Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday afternoon asking Putin to receive Guterres in Moscow and Zelenskiy to receive him in Kyiv, according to a Reuters report. “The Secretary-General said, at this time of great peril and consequence, he would like to discuss urgent steps to bring about peace in Ukraine and the future of multilateralism based on the Charter of the United Nations and international law,” Dujarric said in a statement. A senior US defence official said 14 US howitzers that Washington said last week would be provided to Ukraine were now being delivered to the region, along with ammunition for them. Around 50 Ukrainians are being trained outside of Ukraine to operate them, the official said. “They will get trained on how to use the howitzers and then they’ll be able to go back in to Ukraine and train their colleagues,” the official said. The US defence department has retracted its claim that Ukraine had been supplied with more aircraft, instead saying only parts had been delivered to enable Kyiv to put more jets into the fight against Russia. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby retracted his statement from Tuesday that Ukraine had received fighter jets from an unnamed ally. While fixed-wing aircraft have been offered by an unidentified country to bolster Kyiv’s defences, “they have not received whole aircraft from another nation,” Kirby told reporters. “I was mistaken. They have not received whole aircraft from another nation,” Kirby said of his Tuesday claim. “That said, Ukrainians have received through United States coordination and provision enough spare parts and additional equipment such that they have been able to put in operation more fixed-wing aircraft in their fleet than they had even two to three weeks ago,” he said. Separately, a senior US defence official said the parts supply has enabled Ukraine to add 20 previously inoperable jets to its active fighter fleet. Five allied countries including the United States have warned that “evolving intelligence” indicates Russia is poised to launch powerful cyberattacks against rivals supporting Ukraine. The members of the “Five Eyes” intelligence sharing network - the US, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - said Moscow could also involve existing cybercrime groups in launching attacks on governments, institutions and businesses, in a statement released on Wednesday. “Evolving intelligence indicates that the Russian government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks,” they said in an official cyber threat alert. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could expose organisations both within and beyond the region to increased malicious cyber activity. This activity may occur as a response to the unprecedented economic costs imposed on Russia as well as materiel support provided by the United States and US allies and partners. In addition, it said, “some cybercrime groups have recently publicly pledged support for the Russian government. “ “Some groups have also threatened to conduct cyber operations against countries and organisations providing materiel support to Ukraine,” it said. Wednesday’s alert said Russian state-sponsored cyber actors have the ability to compromise IT networks, to steal large amounts of data from them while remaining hidden, to deploy destructive malware and to lock down networks with “distributed denial of service” attacks. The alert identified more than a dozen hacking groups, both parts of Russian intelligence and military bodies and privately operated, which present threats. It warned that infrastructure could be particularly targeted in countries Moscow might want to take action against. US, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cybersecurity authorities urge critical infrastructure network defenders to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats - including destructive malware, ransomware, DDoS attacks, and cyber espionage - by hardening their cyber defences and performing due diligence in identifying indicators of malicious activity,” the alert said. US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly malicious cyber activity is “part of the Russian playbook”. We also know that the Russian government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks against US critical infrastructure.” “Russia has significant cyber capabilities and a demonstrated history of using them irresponsibly, and state-sponsored malicious cyber activity is a real risk to organisations around the world,” Sami Khoury, Head, Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, added. Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Russia’s republic of Chechnya, said Russian forces would be in complete control of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol on Thursday. “Before lunchtime, or after lunch, Azovstal will be completely under the control of the forces of the Russian Federation,” he said in an audio message posted online early on Thursday as seen by Reuters. Chechen forces have been fighting in Ukraine as part of Russia’s military operation. Mariupol would be the biggest city to be seized by Russia since invading Ukraine eight weeks ago. Ukraine is working to convince western allies to shift Russia’s shipments of natural gas from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Ukraine’s pipeline, increasing Kyiv’s leverage in its conflict with Russia, energy officials told Reuters. Doing so, they said, would force Russia to move more of its Europe-bound gas through Ukraine. That would make Moscow pay more transit fees that could help Ukraine’s wartime defence and deter Russia from damaging Ukraine’s gas pipelines in the meantime, they told lawmakers and Biden administration officials in Washington last week. Representatives from Ukraine’s gas pipeline operator and gas firm Naftogaz spent a week in Washington meeting administration officials and congressional lawmakers to urge them to convince Germany and other European allies to adopt the plan. Russia “depends on us transporting gas from Russia to Europe. This is something to leverage in our discussions with them and Europe can help,” said Olga Bielkova, director of international affairs for the Gas Transit System Operator of Ukraine, in an interview in Washington. Italy has signed a deal with the southern African country of Angola to ramp up gas supplies as it scrambles to break away from Russian gas. A declaration of intent was signed to develop “new” natural gas ventures and to increase exports to Italy, a statement from the Italian foreign minister announced on Wednesday, Agence France-Presse reports. Today we have reached another important agreement with Angola to increase gas supplies. Italy’s commitment to differentiate energy supply sources is confirmed.” Prime minister Mario Draghi wants to add Angola and Congo-Brazzaville to a portfolio of suppliers to substitute Russia, which provides about 45% of Italian gas. In an interview with the Corriere della Sera daily published on Sunday, Draghi said: We do not want to depend on Russian gas any longer, because economic dependence must not become political subjection. Diversification is possible and can be implemented in a relatively short amount of time - quicker than we imagined just a month ago.” Cingolani described the deal as “an important agreement that gives impetus to the partnership between Italy and Angola in the fields of renewables, biofuels, LNG (liquefied natural gas) and training in technology and environment”. Italy is one of Europe’s biggest guzzlers of gas, which currently represents 42% of its energy consumption, and it imports 95% of the gas it uses. Ukraine is ready to resolve the issue of unblocking Mariupol and evacuating civilians through diplomacy and has proposed to hold a “special round” of negotiations with Russia in the besieged city, officials said. Ukraine negotiator and presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak responded late on Wednesday: Yes. Without any conditions. We’re ready to hold a ‘special round of negotiations’ right in Mariupol. One on one. Two on two. To save our guys, Azov, military, civilians, children, the living &amp; the wounded. Everyone. Because they are ours. Because they are in my heart. Forever,” he tweeted. Another key Ukrainian negotiator, David Arakhamia, said on Telegram that he and Podolyak “are ready to arrive in Mariupol to hold talks”. Today, in a conversation with the city defenders, a proposal was put forward to hold direct negotiations, on site, on the evacuation of our military garrison. For our part, we are ready to arrive for such negotiations at any time as soon as we receive confirmation from the Russian side.” As yet another desperate attempt to evacuate civilians from Mariupol failed Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that “the situation in Mariupol is deteriorating” with thousands of troops and civilians stuck in the city. Zelenskiy said his country is ready to resolve the issues in Mariupol but Russia has “not yet shown readiness to take such a step” during a meeting with media representatives after talks with President of the European Council Charles Michel in Kyiv. “The situation in Mariupol is deteriorating. Unfortunately, so far we cannot achieve a positive result there. Our warriors have hundreds of wounded. Protecting ordinary civilians with their backs, they lose their lives. Because, as far as I know, there are about a thousand civilians behind our guys in Mariupol, including children and women,” Zelenskiy said. Turkey has accused some of its Nato allies of wanting the war in Ukraine to last longer in order to weaken Russia. “There are countries within Nato who want the war to continue,” Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN Turk in an interview on Wednesday. “They want Russia to become weaker,” Cavusoglu said, as talks between Ukrainians and Russians appear to have stalled after the last face-to-face meeting in Istanbul last month. They had been due to continue online. Cavusoglu did not name any country directly. Internet coverage in Ukraine has received a boost after Elon Musk’s SpaceX Starlink internet terminals restored connection across the country. Minister of digital transformation, Mikhail Fedorov, said there are now 10,000 terminals in Ukraine after heavy fighting has destroyed infrastructure and crippled internet access. Fedorov requested the technology from Musk at the start of the war. Zelenskiy also spoke of his “cautious optimism” that Ukraine’s partners now better understand the needs of his country, seemingly in reference to supplying weapons and intensifying sanctions on Russia. I am very pleased to say, with cautious optimism, that our partners started to understand our needs better. Understand what exactly we need. And when exactly we need all this. Not in weeks, not in a month, but immediately. Right now, as Russia is trying to intensify its attacks. Ukraine can develop “maximum speed” in joining the EU, the county’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has told his citizens in a national address this evening. Speaking after meeting with the president of the European council, Charles Michel, Zelenskiy said the pair discussed Ukraine’s movement towards European integration. This is the historic moment when we can develop maximum speed in joining the European Union. We have already proved that the Ukrainian state and public institutions are effective enough to withstand even the test of war. We are already doing as much to protect freedom on the European continent as other nations have never done. And I see from all our friends in the European Union a willingness to help our movement as much as possible. Railways have been flooded by the millions of Ukrainians who have fled the country since the start of the Russian invasion and conductors and other workers have risked their lives to aid the escape, NBC News reports. More than 100 railway workers have been injured and 95 have lost their lives, according to the head of Ukraine’s national rail system, Alexander Kamyshin. Roughly 25% of Ukraine’s 14,000 miles of tracks have been damaged by bombs. Russian attacks on the railroads have also resulted in the deaths of civilians, including children. But that hasn’t stopped workers from showing up to ensure the trains keep running. UK prime minister Boris Johnson likened Russian president Vladimir Putin to a crocodile, saying he is not optimistic that the Russian leader can be negotiated with. “How can you negotiate with a crocodile when it has your leg in its jaws, that is the difficulty that Ukrainians face,” Johnson told journalists on a plane heading to India. “It is very hard to see how the Ukrainians can negotiate with Putin now given his manifest lack of good faith.” Johnson continued that he thinks it’s possible Moscow could “even launch another assault on Kyiv”. “I really don’t see how the Ukrainians can easily sit down and come to some kind of accommodation,” he added. “How can you negotiate with a crocodile when it’s got your leg in its jaws?” Instead, Johnson said Nato would “keep going with the strategy” of supplying Ukraine with weapons to defend itself. Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian negotiator and adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, tweeted that they are ready to hold negotiations in the besieged city of Mariupol “without any conditions”. “One on one. Two on two,” he said. “To save our guys, Azov, military, civilians, children, the living &amp; the wounded. Everyone. Because they are ours. Because they are in my heart. Forever.” Russia has not responded to the offer, the Associated Press reports. Earlier, Zelenskiy said roughly 1,000 civilians remain trapped in the city’s Azocstal steel plant, hiding there with the remaining fighters, who are heavily outnumbered. The Ukrainian president added that 120,000 people were being kept in Mariupol and that “crimes that are happening there are far more scary and large scale than in Borodyanka”, referencing a devastated Ukrainian town. A Ukrainian marine commander fighting in Mariupol has said his forces are “maybe facing our last days, if not hours”, as another Russian ultimatum to the remaining Ukrainian troops in the besieged port city to surrender or die expired with no mass capitulation. Russia said it had test-launched its Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, a new addition to its nuclear arsenal. Germany’s foreign minister has insisted there is “no taboo” in Berlin over sending armoured vehicles to Ukraine, as her government defends itself against criticism over its delay in authorising the delivery of heavy weapons. The US imposed new sanctions on dozens of people and entities, including a Russian commercial bank and a virtual currency mining company. Donetsk’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said fewer buses than planned were able to reach civilians in Mariupol. Finance ministers from the UK, US, Canada and France walked out of Wednesday’s G20 meeting as Russian representatives spoke, the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki has said the US is “working around the clock to provide security assistance to Ukraine”. A 91-year-old Holocaust survivor has died in a basement in Mariupol, AP reports: The Auschwitz Memorial announced the death of Vanda Semyonovna Obiedkova. The Jewish organization Chabad.org reported that her daughter shared the news after arriving with the rest of her family at a safe location, saying she died April 4, pleading for water in a freezing basement. She was 10 years old when the Nazis occupied Mariupol and killed thousands of Jews in a single day, including her mother. She survived in a basement then, and died in a basement in the same city 81 years later. The US secretary of state has also expressed concerns about the humanitarian corridor that Ukraine is working to establish for evacuations out of Mariupol, the AP reports. Antony Blinken, currently in Panama City, said today: Of course, we want to see people who are in harm’s way, if they are able to, to leave it safely and securely ... What gives pause is the fact there have been agreements on humanitarian corridors established before that have fallen apart very, very quickly, if not immediately, principally because the security has been violated by Russian forces. And so people leaving, believing that they could do so safely and securely, were fired on. Blinken said the US was sharing its assessments, but that the Ukrainian government and its citizens had to weigh the risks. He noted the “death and destruction and atrocities” that the world saw after the Russians retreated from Bucha. He added: We can only anticipate that when this tide also recedes from Mariupol we’re going to see far worse, if that’s possible to imagine. Tatyana Burak, who spent 45 days in Mariupol before escaping to Lviv with her husband, said her home was bombed and destroyed and shared her story with CNN: It was a horrible dream which thousands of people were dreaming at the same time and it had no end. So, we spent a lot of time in the hospital because we were wounded right at the beginning of this Russian onslaught and we were taken by our military doctors to the hospital and so we felt every single bomb, every single shell which was going to our city. We understood there is nothing to be expected, that our city was doomed because these people came, as they said, to ‘liberate us’. They didn’t know what they were going to liberate us from, but they said that we were suffering and they came to liberate us. They liberated us from our homes, from our jobs, from the possessions of all our lives, from our family history. They liberated many thousands of people from their lives. They just — I don’t know. They seem to be just crazy and insane.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki has said the US is “working around the clock to provide security assistance to Ukraine”. At her briefing to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, Psaki said five flights with military assistance arrived in the region over the last few days, with more than half a dozen flights from the US scheduled to arrive shortly with even more equipment. Psaki said: We made a strategic decision given we’ve seen Russia reposition their troops and their military to the eastern part of Ukraine to fight a different kind of war on the ground, which will be more shooting back and forth through long range. We have been working with Ukrainians and the Ukrainian military to determine exactly the kind of security assistance they need for this stage of the war. That has included an increase in artillery and ammunition. Psaki said that president Joe Biden is processing images coming out of Ukraine “with horror, with sadness, with fear for the people of Ukraine, for the families, the children, the innocent civilians at risk”. Obviously this conflict is consuming a great deal of his time. He is consuming [the images] as many people are, as I am, as you are, as Americans out there watching all of your networks are: it’s emotional. Watching these images is really raw for people, including the president, because you’re watching people suffering at the hands of a dictator who is brutally targeting civilians. Russia’s nuclear forces will start taking delivery of the new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile later this year once testing is complete, the country’s news agency Tass said on Wednesday, according to Reuters. Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Roscosmos space agency, said deliveries of the missile, each of which can carry up to 10 warheads, would start “in the autumn of this year”, Tass reported. Earlier in the day Russia said it had conducted a first test launch of the missile. “This truly unique weapon will strengthen the combat potential of our armed forces, reliably ensure Russia’s security from external threats and provide food for thought for those who, in the heat of frenzied aggressive rhetoric, try to threaten our country,” the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said. The Pentagon said on Wednesday Russia had properly notified it ahead of its test launch, adding it saw the test as routine and not a threat to the United States. Read more: The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on dozens of people and entities, including a Russian commercial bank and a virtual currency mining company, Reuters is reporting. The aim of this new round of penalties, the agency says, is “to target Moscow’s evasion of existing sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine”. The US treasury department said in a statement it had put sanctions on Russian commercial bank Transkapitalbank, whose representatives it said serve several banks in Asia, including in China, and the Middle East, and have suggested options to evade international sanctions. Washington also targeted a global network of more than 40 people and entities led by the US-designated Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev, including organisations “whose primary mission is to facilitate sanctions evasion for Russian entities”. The US also imposed sanctions on companies operating in Russia’s virtual currency mining industry, reportedly the third largest in the world. It targeted the holding company of Bitcoin miner BitRiver and 10 of its Russia-based subsidiaries. Brian Nelson, the US treasury’s under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said his country was committed to ensuring that no asset became “a mechanism” for Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to offset the impact of sanctions: The treasury can and will target those who evade, attempt to evade, or aid the evasion of US sanctions against Russia, as they are helping support Putin’s brutal war of choice. The United States will work to ensure that the sanctions we have imposed, in close coordination with our international partners, degrade the Kremlin’s ability to project power and fund its invasion. The Kyiv symphony orchestra will perform its first concert since the Russian invasion on Thursday in Warsaw, Poland, at the start of a European tour musicians hope “will heal troubled souls and help boost Ukrainian culture.” Some of the orchestra’s musicians fled the country to the sound of Russian bombs, others remained in Ukraine but had to leave their homes and have been playing only to their families or in bomb shelters, AFP reports. Men in the orchestra were granted special dispensation from Ukrainian authorities to leave the country because under emergency war regulations men “of fighting age” are not normally allowed to leave. The arrangement will last until the end of the tour on 1 May. “Our concerts are truly a cultural mission,” Oleksii Pshenychnikov, a 22-year-old second violin in the orchestra, told AFP during a break in the rehearsals. “In Ukraine, we say there is a ‘cultural front’, meaning it is not escaping from the war, it is another aspect of the war.” Nine concerts are scheduled for the Voice of Ukraine tour, including in Dresden, Berlin and Hamburg. Poland’s ambassador to the US, Marek Magierowski, has been sharing his thoughts on the abortive plan to transfer the country’s MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. Addressing the Economic Club of Washington this morning, he said: I have the impression that in America, there was a perception of these Soviet-made fighter jets today looking like those B52s, the Stratofortresses, which are mothballed somewhere in the middle of the desert in Nevada, covered by dust but usable. No, our MiGs ... were upgraded a few years ago ... and they account for a third of our fleet of combat aircraft. This leads me to a very obvious conclusion: we can’t rid ourselves of a third of our capability without proper compensation or backfill. Magierowski said that was why Poland came up with the idea in early March of handing the planes to the US at the Ramstein airbase in Germany and letting Nato decide what to do with them, “and then if all Nato countries choose unanimously to transfer these airplanes to Ukraine, we would be fine by that”. But, he said: The American government decided that it was not the brightest idea. The ambassador, however, said the idea was “still on the table” and was “still a valid proposal,” although Poland was also “trying to understand the American position when they say that it would be too escalatory from the point of view of Russia.” Read more: Finance ministers from the UK, US, Canada and France walked out of Wednesday’s G20 meeting as Russian representatives spoke, the chancellor Rishi Sunak said, exposing deepening divisions over Russia’s continued presence in the body. Reuters is reporting that Ukraine officials in attendance also walked out of the meeting in Washington DC of the world’s 20 largest economies. In a tweet, Sunak said the walkout was a coordinated protest: Earlier my representatives, along with US &amp; Canadian counterparts, left today’s G20 meeting in Washington as Russian delegates spoke. We are united in our condemnation of Russia’s war against Ukraine and will push for stronger international coordination to punish Russia. The US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, told attendees she strongly disapproved of a senior Russian official’s presence at the meeting, two sources told Reuters. The Russian deputy finance minister, Timur Maksimov, attended the meeting in person, and the country’s finance minister, Anton Siluanov, and central bank governor joined virtually, a source said. Siluanov “urged G20 not to politicise the group’s work”, Reuters reported, because it would “undermine confidence in global monetary and finance systems”. Yellen was joined in the walkout by the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, and the Canadian finance minister, Chrystia Freeland, among others. Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, meanwhile, urged Maksimov to convey to Moscow a clear message: end the war in Ukraine. Yellen plans to boycott two G20 sessions on the international financial architecture and sustainable finance, one of the sources said, although US treasury officials said she would join a discussion of the Ukraine war’s impact on the global economy. It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: Some civilians trapped in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol have been able to leave but officials said there were far fewer than hoped. Mariupol city authorities had earlier said they were hoping to evacuate around 6,000 people under a preliminary agreement with Russia – the first in weeks – on establishing a safe corridor. Local media reported that the meeting points had been hit by artillery. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he remained ready to swap Russian prisoners of war in exchange for safe passage for civilians and Ukrainian troops in Mariupol. Speaking after a visit from the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, Zelenskiy said there were an estimated 1,000 civilians sheltering in Mariupol’s Azovstal steel plant. An ultimatum by Russia to Ukrainian fighters holding out in Mariupol to surrender passed its deadline. In a statement issued early this morning, the Russian defence ministry said it would “once again” offer Ukraine the option “to stop fighting and lay down their weapons” from 2pm Moscow time (1100 GMT) on Wednesday. A Ukrainian commander from the 36th separate marine brigade in Mariupol made an urgent plea in a video shared on his Facebook page, saying that his forces were probably facing their “last days, if not hours”. Serhiy Volyna said his troops were outnumbered 10 to one and appealed to world leaders to help 500 wounded soldiers and hundreds of civilians trapped in the city. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, said Russia had successfully conducted a test launch of the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile. He said the missile, dubbed Satan 2 by western analysts, has no analogues elsewhere and would provide food for thought for those who try to threaten Russia. A small but growing number of top Kremlin insiders are reportedly questioning President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine, according to Bloomberg. Some senior Kremlin insiders believe Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a “catastrophic mistake that will set the country back for years”, the channel cited multiple sources as saying. More than 5 million people have fled Ukraine since Russian troops invaded the country on 24 February, according to figures by the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR). Women and children account for 90% of those who have fled. A further 7.1 million people are displaced inside Ukraine. The head of Ukraine’s Orthodox church, Metropolitan Epifaniy, has asked people to forgo night Easter services in areas of the country affected by fighting amid fears Russian bombardments will continue during the Orthodox Easter period. In a televised address, he said he had little faith that a pause in shelling by Russian troops, proposed by Ukraine for the duration of the Orthodox Christian Easter festivities, would hold. Western nations prepared to stage coordinated diplomatic snubs in protest against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Washington. The US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, plans to avoid G20 sessions attended by Russian officials on Wednesday. The UK finance minister, Rishi Sunak, also will not attend certain G20 sessions, a British government source said. The head of Ukraine’s Orthodox church, Metropolitan Epifaniy, has asked people to forgo night Easter services in areas of the country affected by fighting, amid fears Russian bombardments will continue during the Orthodox Easter period, Reuters reports. In a televised address, Metropolitan Epifaniy of Kyiv said he had little faith that a pause in shelling by Russian troops, proposed by Ukraine for the duration of the Orthodox Christian Easter festivities, would hold. He said: It is hard to believe this will really happen, because the enemy is trying to completely destroy us. Epifaniy said the Easter service could be held in the morning or afternoon and that priests should try to avoid crowds in churches. People could also watch broadcasts of Easter services on television or the internet, he said. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, has also called for a four-day Orthodox Easter humanitarian pause in fighting in Ukraine to allow for the safe passage of civilians to leave areas of conflict and the delivery of humanitarian aid to hard-hit areas. Wimbledon has set itself on a potential collision course with the rest of the tennis world after banning Russian and Belarusian players from this summer’s championships due to the scale and severity of the invasion of Ukraine. The decision was taken after nearly two months of deliberations and legal advice, with the All England Club also concerned about the image it would present if the world No 2, Daniil Medvedev, lifted its famous silver gilt cup on Centre Court. In an unusually strong statement, Wimbledon expressed “sadness” that individual players would suffer, but stressed it wanted to play its part “to limit Russia’s global influence through the strongest means possible”. “In the circumstances of such unjustified and unprecedented military aggression, it would be unacceptable for the Russian regime to derive any benefits from the involvement of Russian or Belarusian players with the Championships,” it added. The Lawn Tennis Association, which runs all the other major summer grass court tournaments in Britain, including the prestigious Queen’s Club event, has also announced a ban. Those set to miss out include the men’s world No 8, Andrey Rublev, who wrote “No war please” on a TV camera lens after a match in Dubai, and the two-times women’s grand slam champion Victoria Azarenka. The US was properly notified by Russia ahead of its test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile, the Pentagon said. The Pentagon said it saw the test of the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile as routine and not a threat to the US. The Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, said: Such testing is routine, and it was not a surprise. Donetsk’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said fewer buses than planned were able to reach civilians in the besieged city of Mariupol today, Reuters reports. As a result, not many people were evacuated from Mariupol as city authorities had hoped, he said. Ukrainian MP, Inna Sovsun, shared a video reportedly showing a convoy of stationary buses hours after the humanitarian corridor from the port city was meant to be open. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, blamed Russia’s “lack of control over their own military on the ground”, AP’s Philip Crowther said. Mariupol’s mayor earlier said he hoped 90 buses would be able to enter the city and take out about 6,000 women, children and elderly people. Kyrylenko said: People of course gathered at the agreed meeting points, but few of them got onto the buses. Local media reported that the meeting points had been hit by artillery, according to NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he remains ready to swap Russian prisoners of war in exchange for safe passage for civilians and Ukrainian troops in Mariupol. Speaking after a visit from the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, Zelenskiy said there were an estimated 1,000 civilians sheltering in Mariupol’s Azovstal steel plant. The situation in the besieged Ukrainian city is worsening, he said, with hundreds of wounded without access to medical care. The Ukrainian leader went on to say that he had not seen or heard about a document that the Kremlin said it had sent to Ukraine in connection with peace talks. Earlier Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was waiting for a response after it had handed a document to the Ukrainian side. Germany’s foreign minister has insisted there is “no taboo” in Berlin over sending armoured vehicles to Ukraine, as her government defends itself against criticism that its delay in authorising the delivery of heavy weapons is undermining the west’s unified stance. Berlin has not ruled out shipping tanks to Ukraine, “even if it may sound like that in the German debate”, said Annalena Baerbock at a joint press conference in Riga with the Latvian foreign minister, Edgars Rinkēvičs. However, as the German army has run out of military hardware it can dispatch swiftly without undermining its own security commitments, the Green politician said her government had agreed instead a swap system whereby it would help refill the gaps in the arsenal of Nato and G7 states that are in a position to help Ukraine more quickly. “We support partners that can deliver weapons quickly and guarantee replacements,” said Baerbock at the start of her three-day tour of the Baltic states. At a press conference on Tuesday evening, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, confirmed that his government was planning to support Kyiv with cash rather than by sending tanks or armoured vehicles from its own stocks. “We have asked the German arms industry to tell us which material it can deliver in the short term,” Scholz said. “Ukraine has now made a selection from this list and we will provide it with the required money for the purchase.” The list of materials included anti-tank weapons, anti-airplane systems and munition “that could be used in artillery battle”, he said. The Ukrainian government has complained that Scholz’s list does not include the kind of heavy weapons that would allow its forces to mount a counter-offensive against Russian troops in the Donbas region, such as the Panzerhaubitze 2000 artillery system. Ukraine’s ambassador in Berlin, Andrij Melnyk, said on Tuesday night that Scholz’s lack of direct material support had been received in Kyiv “with great disappointment and bitterness”. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, said Russia has successfully conducted a test launch of the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, AFP reports. The Sarmat, dubbed Satan 2 by western analysts, is among Russia’s next-generation missiles that Putin has called “invincible”. It is designed to replace the Soviet-era Voevoda ICBM, known by the Nato designation SS-18 Satan. Designed to elude anti-missile defence systems with a short initial boost phase, giving enemy surveillance systems a tiny window to track, the superheavy intercontinental ballistic missile can carry multiple warheads. Addressing the Russian army in televised remarks, Putin said: I congratulate you on the successful launch of the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile. This truly unique weapon will strengthen the combat potential of our armed forces, reliably ensure the security of Russia from external threats and make those who, in the heat of aggressive rhetoric, try to threaten our country, think twice. According to the Russian defence ministry, the test “successfully” took place at the Plesetsk cosmodrome in northern Russia. The ministry said: Sarmat is the most powerful missile with the longest range of destruction of targets in the world, which will significantly increase the combat power of our country’s strategic nuclear forces. Vladimir Putin has ordered a review of Russia’s position within the World Trade Organization (WTO) to counter “illegal” sanctions imposed by western states, AFP reports. Speaking at a televised government meeting, the Russian president said western governments broke WTO rules by imposing politically-motivated import restrictions on Russian products such as steel and other metals. Putin said: These measures (sanctions) run counter to WTO principles, to which European colleagues have constantly reiterated their adherence. He told his government to update Russia’s strategy in the WTO: I instruct the government to conduct a comprehensive review of the legitimacy of the actions taken by our western trading partners, and to prepare an updated strategy for our actions within the World Trade Organization. He said the review must be completed by 1 June but did not provide any details about what it might entail. Russia’s defence ministry said it has test-launched its new Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, Reuters reports. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was shown on TV being briefed by the military that the missile had been launched from Plesetsk in the country’s north-west and hit targets in the Kamchatka peninsula in the far east. The Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile has “the highest tactical and technical characteristics”, Putin is quoted as saying. He said the missile has no analogues elsewhere and would provide food for thought for those who try to threaten Russia. It is 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: An ultimatum by Russia to Ukrainian fighters holding out in the besieged port city of Mariupol to surrender has passed its deadline. In a statement issued early this morning, the Russian defence ministry said it would “once again” offer Ukraine the option “to stop fighting and lay down their weapons” from 2pm Moscow time (1100 GMT) on Wednesday.

Serhiy Volyna said his troops were outnumbered 10 to one and appealed to world leaders to help 500 wounded soldiers and hundreds of civilians trapped in the city. A small convoy of buses carrying dozens of civilians in Mariupol have reportedly departed from a planned evacuation point to Ukraine-controlled territory. Mariupol city authorities had earlier said they were hoping to evacuate around 6,000 people under a preliminary agreement with Russia – the first in weeks – on establishing a safe corridor. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, announced that a humanitarian corridor has been agreed to evacuate women, children and the elderly from Mariupol. Ukraine is aiming to evacuate 6,000 civilians in 90 buses on a route to Zaporizhzhia via Berdyansk. A small but growing number of top Kremlin insiders are reportedly questioning President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine, according to Bloomberg. Some senior Kremlin insiders believe Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a “catastrophic mistake that will set the country back for years”, the channel cited multiple sources as saying. More than five million people have fled Ukraine since Russian troops invaded the country on 24 February, according to figures by the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR). Women and children account for 90% of those who have fled. A further 7.1 million people are displaced inside Ukraine. Half a million Ukrainian citizens have been deported to Russia since the start of the war, according to Mykyta Poturayev, the head of the Ukrainian parliament’s humanitarian committee. Addressing the European parliament, Poturayev called on the Red Cross to establish contact with those missing. Reuters could not independently verify the figure given by Poturayev. Finland’s parliament has opened the debate on whether to seek Nato membership. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, has said her country would decide “quite fast, within weeks” whether to apply for membership after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to a surge in political and public support for joining the military alliance. Western nations prepared to stage coordinated diplomatic snubs in protest against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Washington. The US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, plans to avoid G20 sessions attended by Russian officials on Wednesday. The UK finance minister, Rishi Sunak, also will not attend certain G20 sessions, a British government source said. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you still to bring you all the latest news from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. A small convoy of buses carrying dozens of civilians in the besieged city of Mariupol has departed from a planned evacuation point, Reuters has cited two witnesses as saying. The buses were headed to Ukraine-controlled territory, according to reports. Mariupol city authorities had earlier said they were hoping to evacuate around 6,000 people under a preliminary agreement with Russia – the first in weeks – on establishing a safe corridor. The city’s mayor said evacuation corridors would be open between Mariupol and Zaporizhzhia from 2pm local time (11am GMT). Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said Berlin has chosen not to reveal details about the weapons it has sent to Ukraine. Speaking at a news conference in Riga today, Baerbock said: We have delivered anti-tank missiles, Stingers and other things that we have never spoken about publicly so these deliveries could happen quickly. She was asked whether Berlin would be sending its Panzerhaubitze 2000 artillery system – which some experts say Ukraine needs to mount a counterattack against Russian forces in the Donbas region, Reuters reports. In response, Baerbock said Germany would train Ukrainian soldiers on using and maintaining advanced weapons systems which it has received from other allied countries. If partners deliver artillery that we can no longer deliver, we will help with training and maintenance. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has just posted video of himself with President of the European Council, Charles Michel, who is visiting Kyiv today. He accompanied the tweet by saying that “sanctions against Russia, defence and financial support of our state, and answers to the questionnaire on compliance with EU criteria were discussed. Thank you for a meaningful meeting and solidarity with the people of Ukraine”. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has been giving a lunchtime briefing. Picking through the simultaneous translation, the key points she was making include: Allegations that Russian-speaking civilians in the Donbas are being taken hostage by “those who’ve been trained in Nato countries. Now those people are torturing those who are suspected of sympathising with Russia. By Nato personnel, I mean everyone who has been trained in Nato countries or under the leadership of Nato military.” Russia is collecting evidence of what it says are crimes committed by Ukrainian forces. Zakharova said “all materials will be carefully studied, attached to criminal cases, and presented to the court. Not a single Ukrainian nationalist involved in crimes against the civil population and Russian military personnel will escape fair retribution.” Since the beginning of what she termed the “special military operation”, 15,500 tonnes of humanitarian cargo have been delivered to territories in Ukraine by Russia. She claimed Ukrainian negotiators were trying to delay the negotiation process by “refusing to take a constructive approach on priority issues.” She went into great lengths explaining that the assistance for Ukraine announced by New Zealand included $5m for weapons and $2m for commercial mapping services, and therefore none of the money was actually going to Ukraine. She alleged “this money is coming to the pockets of the collective west”, and that “so-called assistance always comes back to the same accounts in the same banks where it came from”. A court in Moscow has rejected an appeal by the liberal radio station Ekho Moskvy against Russia’s move to take it off air over its coverage of the war in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Ekho Moskvy, one of Russia’s leading current affairs channels, stopped broadcasting last month after the prosecutor general’s office demanded that access to the station be restricted. Authorities also ordered that the station’s website be blocked for spreading what it called “deliberately false information” about Russia’s military operation. The station, which has rejected the charges, later shut down under pressure from the authorities. Ekho Moskvy’s editor-in-chief, Alexander Venediktov, wrote on Telegram: The court has rejected Ekho’s request to have the radio station and website restored. We will appeal. Mykyta Poturayev, the head of the Ukrainian parliament’s humanitarian committee, told members of the European parliament by video link: Half a million of Ukrainian citizens were deported from Ukraine to the Russian Federation without agreement from their side. He said there was “no opportunity” to make contact with these people and called on the Red Cross to establish contact with those missing. Reuters could not independently verify the figure given by Poturayev, who did not give details or supporting evidence. Poturayev said he was concerned about the fate of those Ukrainians he says were sent to Russia, telling European lawmakers: We know about so-called filtration camps for Ukrainian citizens. That’s one of the possible directions of Red Cross activity, at least to find these deported people and to understand what is going (on) with them on the territory of the Russian Federation. Alexandra Boivin, a Red Cross official, said her organisation was talking to the Russian authorities about possibilities to help these people, adding: The question about whether we can confirm that people were forcibly displaced at this moment is one that I cannot answer … but it’s certainly an issue of concern. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has been speaking about Aiden Aslin, the British fighter captured by Russian forces in Mariupol. Asked by Aslin’s MP, Robert Jenrick, whether footage showing him being interviewed under duress “for propaganda purposes” would constitute a “flagrant” breach of the Geneva conventions, Johnson replied: I think everybody will want to urge the Russian state to treat his constituent humanly and compassionately because in my view, although we do not encourage people, in fact, we actively dissuade people from going to that theatre of conflict, I understand that he had been serving in the Ukrainian forces for some time and his situation was very different from that (of) a mercenary. I hope that he is treated with care and compassion. I thoroughly echo the sentiments of my right honourable friend has expressed about those who broadcast propaganda messages. Footage aired on Russian state TV on Monday showed Aslin and another captured British fighter, Shaun Pinner, calling on the PM to help free them in exchange for Ukraine releasing the pro-Kremlin politician Viktor Medvedchuk. Aslin’s family said he had been a legitimate combatant with the Ukrainian armed forces and was speaking under duress during an interview. Finland’s parliament has opened the debate on whether to seek Nato membership after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to a surge in political and public support for joining the military alliance, AFP reports. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said her country would decide “quite fast, within weeks” whether to apply for membership. Lawmakers in Finland’s Eduskunta last week received a government-commissioned “white paper” that assessed the implications of Nato membership. The report did not make recommendations but stressed that without Nato membership, Finland enjoys no security guarantees despite currently being a partner to the alliance. The “deterrent effect” on Finland’s defence would be “considerably greater” as a Nato member, the report said. Finnish media report around half of Finland’s 200 MPs support Nato membership, while about 12 oppose it. Sweden is also discussing whether to submit a membership bid. A Ukrainian commander from the 36th separate marine brigade in the besieged city of Mariupol has made an urgent plea in a video shared on his Facebook page, saying that his forces were probably facing their “last days, if not hours”. Serhiy Volyna said his troops were outnumbered 10 to one and appealed to world leaders to help 500 wounded soldiers and hundreds of civilians trapped in the city. President of the European Council, Charles Michel, said “history will not forget the war crimes” committed in Ukraine during a visit to Borodianka, near Kyiv, today. Earlier today, Michel shared a picture of his arrival at a train station in Kyiv, writing: In the heart of a free and democratic Europe. A small but growing number of top Kremlin insiders are reportedly questioning President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine, Bloomberg reports. Senior Kremlin insiders in high-level posts in government and business believe Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a “catastrophic mistake that will set the country back for years”, ten sources told Bloomberg. These people see “no chance” Putin will change course and no prospect of any challenge to his position inside Russia, the sources said. The Russian president has become increasingly reliant on a narrowing circle of hardline advisers, they said, while Putin has reportedly dismissed warnings of the crippling economic and political cost of the war in Ukraine. Some Kremlin insiders increasingly fear that Putin could resort to using nuclear weapons if faced with failure, the sources said. An ultimatum by Russia to Ukrainian fighters holding out in the besieged port city of Mariupol to surrender has passed its deadline. In a statement issued early this morning, the Russian defence ministry said its forces opened a humanitarian corridor from the Azovstal plant “for the withdrawal of Ukrainian servicemen and militants of nationalist formations” to “voluntarily lay down their arms” as well as to evacuate civilians. “As of 22:00 (Moscow time) on April 19, 2022, no one used the specified corridor,” the ministry added. Russia said it would “once again” offer Ukraine the option “to stop fighting and lay down their weapons” from 2pm Moscow time (1100 GMT) on Wednesday. The Azovstal steel plant, the last main Ukrainian stronghold in Mariupol, has been hit with bunker-buster bombs, Kyiv said. Ukrainian officials say hundreds of civilians are sheltering beneath the factory. The head of Ukraine’s negotiating team, Mykhailo Podolyak, a key adviser to President Zelenskiy, accused world leaders yesterday of having “blood on their hands” while “the world watches the murder of children online and remains silent”. Figures by the United Nations’ refugee agency (UNHCR) show the number of people who have fled abroad since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February is now 5,010,971. Kelly T Clements, deputy UNHCR chief, addressed the UN security council yesterday: Eight weeks into the conflict, we are at 5 million and counting, with 5 million unique stories of loss and trauma. More than 218,000 third-country nationals, largely students and migrant workers, have also fled to neighbouring countries, according to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM). Women and children account for 90% of those who have fled. A further 7.1 million people are displaced inside Ukraine, according to the latest assessment by IOM. This means that more than a quarter of Ukraine’s prewar population of 44 million has either fled the country or been internally displaced in under two months. Clement urged members not to “lose sight of what these figures mean”: Women, children, and the aged, have left their homes, their lives, their sons, their fathers and husbands. Each one of the millions of displaced are forced to make impossible, heartbreaking decisions and have left everything, almost everything, they hold dear. Also addressing the UN security council yesterday, the IOM chief, António Vitorino, warned that more than half of Ukraine’s children displaced. Many are vulnerable to trafficking, “violence, exploitation, and abuse” by criminal networks taking advantage of the crisis, Vitorino warned. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you today to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. “Russia’s idea is to eliminate Ukraine – and to eliminate Ukrainian culture. If it has no culture, Ukraine does not exist.” That was the sentiment that compelled Pavlo Makov, the official Ukrainian artist at the 59th Venice Biennale, to head to Italy to install his exhibition. Makov and his team, including the curator Maria Lanko, were determined, said Pavlov, “to show that we are here, and we exist. I am not quoting Churchill directly, but he talked about the things that we are fighting for – and we are fighting for our culture, our way of seeing the world.” Makov’s work is called Fountain of Exhaustion – a pyramid of 78 bronze funnels set in tiers, through which water flows. The original idea came in 1995, when, owing to serious floods, the city of Kharkiv lost its water supply for several weeks. When the invasion began on 24 February, Lanko took to her car, with the bronze funnels in her boot. Six days later – the highways having been shelled and the back roads jammed – she made it to the border. In Milan, she found a fabricator who could recreate the parts of the artwork that she hadn’t been able to take with her. Makov described how he and his family had initially been reluctant to leave Kharkiv, despite a terrifying period in February when “life was like a pendulum swinging first this way then that – will the war start? Yes, or no.” After a week sleeping in a bomb shelter beneath Kharkiv University’s arts centre, he, his wife, some close friends and his mother (and their cats) took to the road. Having got his mother safely installed in Vienna, he set off for Venice. “I felt I’m not so much an artist, or an individual, so much as a citizen of Ukraine. I felt that Ukraine has to be represented,” he said. Read more of Charlotte’s article: ‘We are fighting for our culture’: Ukrainian artists head to Venice Biennale Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has announced that a humanitarian corridor has been agreed to evacuate women, children and the elderly from the besieged southern port city of Mariupol. Ukraine is aiming to evacuate 6,000 civilians in 90 buses on a route to Zaporizhzhia via Berdyansk. Russia has given the besieged port city a fresh ultimatum to surrender by 2pm today. A commander for the Ukrainian marines fighting in the last stronghold of Mariupol said his forces were “maybe facing our last days, if not hours” and appealed for extraction in video message published to his Facebook account early on Wednesday morning. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has issued a stark message to western leaders, claiming if Ukraine had access to all the weapons it needs, the war would have “already ended” during his latest national address The Russian ministry of defence says its forces hit 1,053 Ukrainian military facilities overnight, destroying 106 firing positions. Russian forces have seized Kreminna in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region and Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from the city, the regional governor said. Kreminna, a city of more than 18,000 people about 350 miles (560km) south-east of Kyiv, appears to be the first city captured in a Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. Norway will donate 100 mistral air defence missiles to Ukraine, its defence ministry said in a statement. Finland’s parliament will start debating whether to seek Nato membership today. Western nations are preparing to stage coordinated walkouts and other diplomatic snubs in protest against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Washington. The US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, plans to avoid G20 sessions attended by Russian officials. The UK finance minister, Rishi Sunak, also will not attend certain sessions. European Council president Charles Michel has travelled to Kyiv this morning. He arrived by train and was welcomed by Ukrainian deputy prime minister for European affairs and Euro-Atlantic integration Olga Stefanishyna. Michel is expected to meet Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy later today. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you for the next few hours. A Ukrainian man has been able to follow the redeployment of the Russian soldiers who looted his hometown – by tracking his Airpods as they move around Ukraine. Vitaliy Semenets shared a screenshot of his stolen headphones on Instagram, showing that they had settled in Russia, on the other side of the country’s border with Ukraine, about 90 miles east of Kharkiv, where Russian forces are thought to be regrouping in preparation for a renewed assault on eastern Ukraine. “Thanks to technology, I know where my headphones from my home in Gostomel went,” he said. The tracking, possible thanks to Apple’s Find My service, is another example of consumer technology companies accidentally providing actionable military intelligence in the course of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In the early days of the war, columns of Russian armour showed up on Google Maps as traffic jams, allowing open source investigators to follow the progress of the invasion. Ukrinform is carrying some quotes from Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, a spokesman for Ukraine’s ministry of defence, given in an interview with RBC-Ukraine. He said that Russia was massing troops in a bid to overpower Ukrainian forces by sheer weight of numbers. He is quoted as saying: According to all the rules of offensive operations, the attacking side must have at least three times as many troops. But given the current fighting, the current level of weapons, equipment, aviation capabilities, this advantage should be at least 4-5 times greater. This is what Russia is trying to do now. Western nations are preparing to stage coordinated walkouts and other diplomatic snubs in protest against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Washington. The US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, plans to avoid G20 sessions attended by Russian officials on the sidelines of International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings on Wednesday. The UK finance minister, Rishi Sunak, also will not attend certain G20 sessions, a British government source said. However, Yellen will attend an opening session on the Ukraine war regardless of Russian participation, a US treasury official said. Reuters reports Moscow confirmed yesterday that Russia’s finance minister, Anton Siluanov, would lead its delegation at the talks despite repeated protestations by western diplomats that they could not go ahead as usual during a war in which thousands of civilians have died in bombardments by Russian troops. “During and after the meeting we will be certain to send a strong message and we will not be alone in doing so,” a German government source said, accusing Russia of starting a conflict that has also sent world food and energy prices spiraling.

Michel is expected to meet Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy later today. Overnight the New York Times has been carrying the story that the Wimbledon tennis tournament in London is planning to ban Russian and Belarusian players from competing. Christopher Clarey writes: Wimbledon officials were set to announce they would bar Russian and Belarusian players from playing in this year’s tournament because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Belarus’ support of the war. The ban, which would make Wimbledon the first tennis event to restrict individual Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing, was confirmed by a highly placed international tennis official on Tuesday who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak on behalf of the All England Club, which organises and hosts the tournament. The decision would exclude a number of highly ranked players. Four Russian men are ranked in the top 30 on the ATP Tour, including No 2 Daniil Medvedev, who is the reigning US Open men’s singles champion. Read more here: New York Times – Wimbledon plans to bar Russian and Belarusian players The US interim ambassador to the UK, Philip T Reeker, has been appearing on Sky News in the UK. He spoke about how the actions of Russia in Ukraine had demonstrated the strength of the Nato alliance. He told viewers: Vladimir Putin thought that he would find a divided west, divided alliances, that he would be able to drive wedges. He was sorely mistaken. On the support, both military and humanitarian, being offered to Ukraine, he said: I think there’s been a constant dialogue and consultation with the Ukrainian leadership on what they need. And I think what we’ve seen is this also remarkable effort by the Ukrainians. He described Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy as “an inspiration not only to his own people, which is most important, but to so many of us”. He clarified again US president Joe Biden’s decision that US troops would not engage directly in Ukraine, saying: He’s been very clear about we’re not going to war with Russia. We want to support Ukraine. We want to, of course, protect our allies who are under Nato, who do fall under article 5, the sacred bond that has made Nato so successful for these 70-plus years in terms of defending an area of peace. Nato, a defensive alliance, threatening no one. Not threatening Vladimir Putin. Not threatening Russia. And here you have in fact, Putin attacking Russian speaking cities like Kharkiv. And so we will continue to support the Ukrainian people who again have shown this remarkable resilience, and I think that’s been a surprise to Putin. In his calculus, obviously, a lot of miscalculation on his part. He also wanted to stress the steps he said Biden had taken to try to work with Putin, saying: The president was very ready to work with Putin. He made that clear he wanted a more predictable, more stable relationship from the first day of the presidency. Last year, when he came into office, Biden extended the New Start treaty, not for a year or a month, but for five years. He created a strategic stability dialogue, so Putin could raise the issues that seem to concern him. Reuters reports the Russian ministry of defence says its forces hit 1,053 Ukrainian military facilities overnight, destroying 106 firing positions. The claims have not been independently verified. Mariupol’s deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, appeared on BBC Breakfast in the UK earlier, and this was what he had to say: It’s very hard to talk to people who are in full blockade for more than 50 days. We cannot even imagine what their life looks like. So you understand, in the city there is about 130,000 citizens, they’re still in Mariupol, and they are living in continuous war conditions, shelling, airstrikes. Yesterday, Russia started to use very hard bombs. I don’t know what it it, but the sound from them goes for 50 to 60km around Mariupol. And it makes a lot of damage. The city is in full blockade. Lack of food, water, medicine, help, lack of everything. Lack of life, I would say. That’s why it’s hard. And we people of course, want to be relocated to Ukrainian-controlled territory. There were reports yesterday that Russia had begun to use so-called “bunker-busting” bombs to try to shift Ukrainian fighters out of the Azovstal metallurgical plant, which remains under Ukrainian control. Ukraine is aiming to evacuate 6,000 civilians in 90 buses from Mariupol today, according to the mayor of the city. Reuters reports Vadym Boychenko said 100,000 civilians remain in the besieged city and that tens of thousands have been killed. Lorcan Lovett writes for us this morning about the women who are returning home to Ukraine, despite there being seemingly no let-up in the dangers of war: Fifty-year-old Ann moved through a crowd of women and children at Przemyśl train station in Poland on a Wednesday afternoon to board her train. “I do not care what will happen to me,” she says. “If something happens to my family, why do I need to live?” As the war continues, and allegations of Russian war crimes reach the international community, it is hard to understand why anyone would risk returning to Ukraine. But since Russia’s invasion on 24 February, of the more than 2.5 million people who have entered Poland, about 502,000 are estimated to have returned. Over the course of a week, the Guardian spoke to women at two different train stations, on either side of the Ukraine-Poland border, to find out why they were going home. They gave a range of reasons but many, like Ann, were motivated by a desperate desire to be with loved ones again. They were grateful for the support of their European hosts, but love for their family and home was pulling them back. Read more of Lorcan Lovett’s report here: ‘All I can do is pray’: the Ukrainian women going home despite the danger Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has announced on Telegram that a humanitarian corridor has been agreed to evacuate women, children and the elderly from the besieged southern port city of Mariupol. She posted: Given the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Mariupol, it is in this direction that we will focus our efforts today. We managed to agree in advance on a humanitarian corridor for women, children and the elderly. Civilians are instructed to gather at 2pm (11am GMT) and the column will then proceed to Zaporizhzhia via Berdyansk. Vereshchuk added: Due to the very difficult security situation, changes may occur during the corridor. So, please follow the relevant official announcements. We will do our best to make everything work properly. Earlier though, deputy mayor of Mariupol Sergei Orlov spoke to Sky News in the UK, and demonstrated how low trust is between the two sides. He told viewers: Do not believe in any words from Russia. It would be good if they allowed civilians to leave the Azovstal, but they didn’t allow this for 50 days, why should they allow this now? Some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine can be seen in the photo gallery below. One resident walks along a street past burnt out buses in Mariupol. Another cycles with his child through the debris. Another family carts their belongings in a shopping trolley along a destroyed city street. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has issued a stark message to western leaders, claiming if Ukraine had access to all the weapons it needs, the war would have “already ended” during his latest national address late on Tuesday evening. If we had access to all the weapons we need, which our partners have and which are comparable to the weapons used by the Russian Federation, we would have already ended this war. We would have already restored peace and liberated our territory from the occupiers. Because the superiority of the Ukrainian military in tactics and wisdom is quite obvious … It is unfair that Ukraine is still forced to ask for what its partners have been storing somewhere for years. If they have the weapons that Ukraine needs here, needs now, if they have the ammunition that we need here and now, it is their moral duty first of all to help protect freedom. Help save the lives of thousands of Ukrainians. If we had received what we are getting now in the first week of the war, the benefit for Ukraine and for freedom in Europe would be greater, I am sure. And if we get what some partners plan to hand over to Ukraine in the coming weeks right now, it will save the lives of thousands of people. I hope that the partners will hear this thesis and understand that every day matters. Any delay in helping Ukraine gives the occupiers an opportunity to kill more Ukrainians.” A commander for the Ukrainian marines fighting in the last stronghold of Mariupol said his forces were “maybe facing our last days, if not hours” and appealed for extraction in video message published to his Facebook account early on Wednesday morning. “The enemy is outnumbering us 10 to one,” Serhiy Volyna from the 36th Separate Marine Brigade said as he sheltered at the besieged Azovstal factory, a vast plant with underground tunnels where Ukrainian defenders are pinned down by Russian fighters. We are probably facing our last days, if not hours. The enemy is outnumbering us 10 to one. “We appeal and plead to all world leaders to help us,” Volyna said in the video. “We ask them to use the procedure of extraction and take us to the territory of a third-party state.” Russian forces are believed to have gradually pushed their way into the city while Ukrainian defenders bunker down at the Azovstal plant. Volyna said the Russians had the “advantage in the air, in artillery, in their forces on land, in equipment, and in tanks”. “We are only defending one object – the Azovstal plant – where in addition to military personnel, there are also civilians who have fallen victim to this war,” he added. Russia’s military presence on Ukraine’s eastern border continues to build, while fighting in the Donbas is intensifying, according to the latest British intelligence report. Russian air activity in northern Ukraine is likely to remain low since its withdrawal from north of Kyiv. However, there is still a risk of precision strikes against priority targets throughout Ukraine. Russian attacks on cities across Ukraine show their intent to try and disrupt the movement of Ukrainian reinforcements and weaponry to the east of the country.” An earlier report claimed Russia had increased its offensive in the Donbas but its progression has been hampered by environmental, logistical and technical challenges. The report, published 8pm GMT on Tuesday, read: Russian shelling and strikes on the Donbas line of control continue to increase, with the Ukrainians repelling numerous attempted advances by Russian forces. Russia’s ability to progress continues to be impacted by the environmental, logistical and technical challenges that have beset them so far, combined with the resilience of the highly motivated Ukrainian armed forces. Russia’s inability to stamp out resistance in Mariupol and their indiscriminate attacks, which have harmed the resident civilian populace, are indicative of their continued failure to achieve their aims as quickly as they would like.” Norway will donate 100 mistral air defence missiles to Ukraine, its defence ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. The mistral air protection system is “an effective weapon that has been used in the maritime defence, and that will be of great benefit to Ukraine” defence minister Bjørn Arild Gram said in a statement. The mistral system has been used on deminers and corvettes. It is a type of air defence that the armed forces has planned to replace. It will therefore not have a major impact on the national operational capability to donate the missiles. The missile will be phased out by the Norwegian armed forces, but it is still a modern and effective weapon that will be of great benefit to Ukraine.” The weapons have already been sent out of Norway, the ministry added. Russia has given the besieged port city of Mariupol a fresh ultimatum to surrender by 2pm today. In a statement issued early on Wednesday morning, the Russian defence ministry said its forces opened a humanitarian corridor from the Azovstal plant “for the withdrawal of Ukrainian servicemen and militants of nationalist formations” to “voluntarily lay down their arms” as well as to evacuate civilians. “As of 22:00 (Moscow time) on April 19, 2022, no one used the specified corridor,” the ministry added. Russia said it would “once again” offer Ukraine the option “to stop fighting and lay down their weapons” from 2pm ( Moscow time) on Wednesday, 20 April. Finland’s parliament will start debating whether to seek Nato membership today, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked a surge in political and public support for joining the bloc. Finland’s prime minister said that her country would now decide quickly on whether to apply for membership despite Russia warning of a nuclear build-up in the Baltic should Finland and neighbouring Sweden join the military alliance. “I think it will happen quite fast. Within weeks, not within months,” prime minister Sanna Marin said last week. Sweden is also discussing whether to submit a membership bid following Russia’s invasion. The 200 MPs in Finland’s Eduskunta last week received a government-commissioned “white paper” that assessed the implications of Nato membership alongside other security options, such as increased bilateral defence agreements. The report did not make recommendations but stressed that without Nato membership Finland enjoys no security guarantees, despite currently being a partner to the alliance. It said the “deterrent effect” on Finland’s defence would be “considerably greater” inside the bloc, while noting that membership also carried obligations for Finland to assist other Nato states. After two decades of public support for Nato membership remaining steady at 20-30%, the war caused a surge in those in favour to over 60%, according to opinion polls as cited by Agence France-Presse. Russian forces remain intent on capturing the city of Mariupol while continuing to storm the Azovstal plant, Ukraine’s military has said in its latest operational report as of 6am this morning. “The main effort of the opponent focuses on the capture of the city of Mariupol, continues storming actions in the area of the plant Azovstal,” the report read. Ten Russian attacks were reportedly thwarted over the past 24 hours by Ukrainian defenders in the territory of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, officials said. Additionally, Ukraine claimed to have destroyed 12 Russian tanks, 28 units of armoured vehicles and two units of automobile equipment, one artillery system and nine air targets including one plane, one helicopter, six different types of UAFs and a missile wing. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments until my colleague, Martin Belam, takes the reins a little later in the day. It is just past 7am in Ukraine. Here’s what we know so far: Russia has given Mariupol a fresh ultimatum to surrender for 2pm today. In a statement issued early on Wednesday morning, the Russian defence ministry said its forces opened a humanitarian corridor from the Azovstal plant “for the withdrawal of Ukrainian servicemen” to “voluntarily lay down their arms” as well as to evacuate civilians. A commander for the Ukrainian marines fighting in Mariupol said his forces were “maybe facing our last days, if not hours” and appealed for extraction in video message published to his Facebook account early on Wednesday morning. We are probably facing our last days, if not hours. The enemy is outnumbering us 10 to one,” Serhiy Volyna from the 36th Separate Marine Brigade said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the intensity of fire by Russian troops towards Kharkiv, the Donbas and in Dnipro has “increased significantly”, one day after the Kremlin launched its long-anticipated offensive in eastern Ukraine. Russian officials said a total of 1,260 military targets were hit by rockets and artillery along the 300-mile frontline in the Donbas and Kharkiv regions. Zelenskiy said the situation in the besieged city of Mariupol is “as severe as possible”. “The Russian army is blocking any efforts to organise humanitarian corridors and save our people,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly address. “The fate of at least tens of thousands of Mariupol residents who were previously relocated to Russian-controlled territory is unknown.” Russian forces have seized Kreminna in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region and Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from the city, the regional governor said. Kreminna, a city of more than 18,000 people about 350 miles (560km) south-east of Kyiv, appears to be the first city captured in a Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine. Russia has increased its offensive in the Donbas but its progress has been hampered by “environmental, logistical and technical challenges”, the UK said. “Russian shelling and strikes on the Donbas line of control continue to increase, with the Ukrainians repelling numerous attempted advances by Russian forces”, the UK Ministry of Defence said late on Tuesday. Russia has deployed up to 20,000 mercenaries from Syria, Libya and elsewhere in Ukraine’s Donbas region, according to a European official. The official said mercenaries are being sent into battle with no heavy equipment or armoured vehicles. Dozens of young Ethiopian men gathered at the Russian embassy in the capital, Addis Ababa, on Monday following rumours of soldiers being recruited to fight in the war in Ukraine, multiple reports suggest. Photos circulating on social media purport to show the lone line of hopeful recruits. In his nightly address, Zelenskiy claimed if Ukraine had access to all the weapons it needs, “and which are comparable to the weapons used by the Russian Federation, we would have already ended this war. It is unfair that Ukraine is still forced to ask for what its partners have been storing somewhere for years.” US president, Joe Biden, will announce another military aid package for Ukraine roughly the same size as the $800m one the US president announced last week, which would bring to more than $3bn the total US aid to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion. Biden told reporters he is unsure if he will go to Kyiv. The UK plans to equip Kyiv with anti-ship missiles and armoured missile launchers - including by mounting British Brimstone rockets to vehicles. Germany has also said it will work with private military equipment makers to help Ukraine meet its weapons requirements after exhausting the weapons it can provide itself. “We intend to pay for these deliveries,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told a news conference in Berlin on Tuesday. Russia is expelling 31 Dutch, Belgian and Austrian diplomats as Moscow faces increased international isolation. It comes after the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria announced the expulsion of some Russian diplomats. Canada said it will impose targeted sanctions on 14 individuals, including Russian President Vladimir Putin’s two adult daughters, according to a statement from the foreign ministry. China has criticised western actions in Ukraine, saying the provision of offensive weapons “will only prolong and escalate the conflict” and some sanctions are “tantamount to weaponising economic interdependence” in remarks made at the latest UN security council briefing. Western nations are preparing to stage coordinated walk-outs and other diplomatic snubs to protest at Wednesday’s meeting of G20 finance ministers in Washington, their officials said. Direct communications between the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Chernobyl nuclear power plant has been restored, according to a statement issued late Tuesday from IAEA’s director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi. Russian businessman, Oleg Tinkov, spoke out against the “crazy” war in Ukraine and described supporters of Moscow’s military actions as “morons”. In an Instagram post, Tinkov, who has been sanctioned by the UK government, said “90% of Russians are against” the war.

If tidal energy cannot be allowed without the possibility and costs of storage being certain, how is it that nuclear has been allowed when the costs and feasibility of storing the used fuel for countless lifetimes is equally unknown and likely to be much higher? He describes tidal energy as intermittent, when it is regular and very suitable as a base power source. In contrast, he describes nuclear power as consistent when this is far from the truth. Quite apart from their hopeless record on delivery dates, rising costs and concern that they will work, they’re also offline from time to time. The station at Sizewell is offline for maintenance for five to six weeks every 18 months. By November last year there had been 16 planned outages. But there had also been unplanned outages when dangerous faults have been identified. The most likely, it seems the only, motivation for using nuclear power is its link to Trident. Electricity customers will be subsiding its cost. Prof Andy Stirling and Dr Phil Johnstone from the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex University write that the £19.6bn Hinkley Point project will “maintain a largescale national base of nuclear-specific skills” without which there is concern “that the costs of UK nuclear submarine capabilities could be insupportable”. Alicia Hull Norwich • It may suit the boss of Iberdrola to tell governments they should abandon “moonshot” green technologies such as the Swansea tidal project, but he should know better (Report, 2 July). Unlike wind and solar, tidal power is entirely predictable and, to a degree, can be stored within barrages and lagoons, providing greater flexibility. Furthermore, tidal barrages can be used to improve transportation links across an estuary and help to manage flood risk which could be invaluable to the Severn estuary. Of course, there is an environmental impact but unless we get a move on, the world’s estuaries are going to feel the full impact of rising sea levels and warming waters. Tidal power is complementary to wind and solar which is why the British government should be looking to make the UK a world leader in the technology. Liam O’Keeffe Abinger Hammer, Surrey • You should talk to people in the solar industry about the future for domestic solar power rather than just relying on “predictions” (Abandon wave power schemes, says energy boss, 2 July). As a non-executive director of AES Solar Ltd in Forres, Scotland, I can tell you that our order books are healthy, despite the government’s solarcoaster tariffs. We are seeing real, steady growth because, for instance, where better to spend a small part of a pension pot than to put in a solar water heater, PV electrics and a battery system, thus decoupling the household budget from soaring energy prices from the grid.Smart householders don’t just switch energy providers, they go solar, not least those looking for a financially safer old age. That is the sort of compelling reason why solar has a brilliant future in the UK, not a dark one.

The nuclear regulator said its investigation had led it to prosecute Cumbria-based Sellafield Ltd, which handles the waste from the UK’s nuclear power stations as well as spent fuel from Japan and the US. It is the first time in five years that the Office for Nuclear Regulation has prosecuted the company. Last time, Sellafield was fined £700,000 for sending bags of radioactive waste to a landfill dump instead of a specialist facility. Now, if the prosecution is successful, the firm is understood to be facing the prospect of a substantial fine, likely to be much larger because an individual was affected. The fine would be proportionate to the scale of the business, which has a £2bn-a-year turnover. The case relates to an accident in February 2017, when a site employee was wounded while handling equipment, leaving him open to internal radiation exposure. He was decontaminated afterwards, but an investigation found the individual may have been exposed to radiation up to three times the annual limit. The regulator is taking the firm to court over offences under the Health and Safety at Work act. Both Sellafield and the ONR said they were unable to comment further for legal reasons. The prosecution is due to begin at Workington magistrates court in Cumbria on 20 July. Sellafield has been state-run since 2016, after MPs raised concerns over how much it was costing taxpayers under private ownership. The facility is in the process of a major transformation from a reprocessor of nuclear waste, where it turns spent fuel from power stations into uranium that can be used again, to solely focusing on storage. The site’s Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (Thorp) ceases operations in November this year, and will then be dismantled. Sellafield’s Magnox reprocessing plant, which handles waste from Britain’s early nuclear power stations, is scheduled to close in 2020."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/jan/24/take-the-airbus-chief-no-deal-brexit-warning-seriously","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-01-24T15:27:50Z","webTitle":"Take the Airbus chief's no-deal Brexit warning seriously | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/jan/24/take-the-airbus-chief-no-deal-brexit-warning-seriously","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/jan/24/take-the-airbus-chief-no-deal-brexit-warning-seriously","fields":{"headline":"Take the Airbus chief's no-deal Brexit warning seriously","bodyText":"There is one complaint about Tom Enders’ latest warning about Brexit. The chief executive of Airbus would do himself a favour if he sounded vaguely grateful for the huge subsidies his company has received from the UK government, and thus British taxpayers, over the decades. The corporate sense of entitlement is one reason why we’re in the current mess. But let’s save that one for another day. When Enders warns that a no-deal Brexit could force “potentially very harmful decisions” for Airbus’s operations in the UK, it’s time we listened to him and ignored what he called “the Brexiteers’ madness”. This is about the politics and economics of aircraft production and three points are important. First, Enders – or, since he’s on his way out, his successor – is in a position to pull investment from the UK. If that happened the jolt to the entire UK aerospace industry could be enormous. As Airbus regularly points out, there are 110,000 jobs in its UK supply chain, on top of the 14,000 people it employs directly, and this is an industry that runs on multinational lines. Second, it is naive to think Airbus is engaged in elaborate scaremongering in its analysis of Brexit. The company’s “risk impact assessment” last June was not, as some Brexiters tried to pretend, an argument about tariffs that would not apply. The worries were about the movement of employees between the UK and the EU, supply logjams and the harmonisation of aircraft regulations on parts and components. If those factors create costs and disruption they will inevitably enter calculations on where to invest. Third – and perhaps most importantly – one can be very confident that other countries would try to exploit a no-deal outcome to bag more Airbus work for themselves. “Make no mistake there are plenty of countries out there who would love to build the wings for Airbus aircraft,” Enders said – a lofty statement but one that is also plainly true. It’s an open secret that the German and Spanish governments, even before the 2016 referendum, were lobbying to get the wing-manufacturing work currently done at Broughton in north Wales. China might also want to pitch. That’s the aerospace industry – it is political. So, when Enders says Airbus is not dependent on the UK for its future, take him seriously. It would be expensive and time-consuming for Airbus to dump its sole supplier of wings and establish another facility from scratch, as he acknowledged. And one suspects, even after a no-deal Brexit, Airbus would first want to see what extra incentives were on offer from the UK. But the threat to redirect investment – with strong encouragement from EU capitals – is credible. Gratitude, you can be sure, will not form part of the thinking in the Airbus boardroom. Same old story with nuclear energy For official purposes, Hitachi last week merely “suspended” work on the £16bn nuclear power station it had hoped to build at Wylfa on Anglesey. What would it take to restart the project? “Nationalisation is the only path,” says Hiroaki Nakanishi, the chairman of the Japanese firm, who presumably knows the idea is a non-starter. Even simple majority control – a shade over 50% – would destroy the old boasts in Westminster that a resurgence in new nuclear could be funded with private capital. As it was, the government was pushing the limits of acceptability when it offered to take a one-third stake in Wylfa and arrange the debt financing. Under such a deal, an awful lot of construction risk would have been sitting with the state. Hitachi’s problem was its inability to attract partners to take a slice of the equity. But that is a familiar story with nuclear energy. The technology is seen as too uncompetitive and too uncertain for equity investment. The business secretary, Greg Clark, instead of searching hopefully for a different financing model, should take a hint from the market. A new energy policy is required. New Look cannot bet on a saviour New Look fears its junior bondholders would like the overborrowed clothing chain to put itself up for sale. You can see why the juniors might push for that. Unlike the senior lenders, they will be virtually wiped out under the debt-for-equity scheme unveiled by the retailer last week. They might as well try to see if there’s a saviour out there. To put mildly, it looks a long shot. New Look has £1.35bn of borrowings and 500 stores, which looks too many in the current retailing climate. Even Mike Ashley, one suspects, will not be making an appearance on this occasion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/feb/28/how-donald-trump-kim-jong-un-misread-each-other-hanoi-summit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-28T14:01:58Z","webTitle":"The art of the no deal: how Trump and Kim misread each other | Julian Borger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/28/how-donald-trump-kim-jong-un-misread-each-other-hanoi-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/feb/28/how-donald-trump-kim-jong-un-misread-each-other-hanoi-summit","fields":{"headline":"The art of no deal: how Trump and Kim misread each other","bodyText":"As with many disastrous second dates, the collapse of Donald Trump’s summit with Kim Jong-un was made inevitable by the misreading of each other’s intentions at their first encounter. Since their initial meeting in Singapore last June, the US president had become fixated on what he saw as a close personal bond with the North Korean dictator half his age. He told his supporters: “We fell in love ... He wrote me beautiful letters.” Those hand-delivered missives appear to have flattered Trump without offering concrete proposals of what Kim was going to do as part of a bargain. A joint statement issued in Singapore stated North Korea’s commitment to the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, which Trump appears to have understood as a pledge of complete unilateral nuclear disarmament. In North Korea, however, the phrase is a routine regime slogan that refers to a gradual defusing of tensions on the peninsula and phased multilateral disarmament, during which North Korea would be treated as a nuclear power. For his part, Kim appears to have come away from Singapore interpreting Trump’s gushing behaviour as sign of a desperation to strike a deal, which would potentially leave most of his arsenal in place while normalising relations with the US and lifting sanctions. These wildly different perceptions collided painfully in Hanoi, where the two leaders discovered each other not to be the ideal partner they had previously imagined. “It was obvious from the beginning that they would get stuck on the questions of how much denuclearisation there should be and how much sanctions relief,” said Joseph Yun, former US special representative for North Korea policy now at the US Institute of Peace thinktank. “Both Kim and Trump are now in a very difficult position. I think Trump now has to realise that complete denuclearisation, however charming Kim may be, is not on the cards.” Yun said that Trump’s room for manoeuvre was constrained by the timing of the summit, coinciding with a furious denunciation by his former lawyer in congressional hearings. The president’s embattled position in Washington meant he had to deliver something spectacular in Hanoi or nothing at all. “Probably a smaller deal was possible,” Yun said. “But in my view Trump had to have a big deal, with Cohen going on in Washington. If he brought home a small deal he knew he would be heavily criticised.” Many experts who have been severely critical of Trump’s diplomacy said they thought he had done the right thing by refusing to accept the deal apparently presented in Hanoi by Kim: sanctions relief in return for undertakings to shut down North Korea’s oldest and biggest nuclear weapons complex at Yongbyon. The two sides dispute the extent of sanctions relief: the US has said Kim wanted complete relief, North Korea has said it was asking for partial relief. “You can all argue whether this should have been done at a summit at all,” said Joel Wit, a former state department official with long experience of negotiating with North Korea and now a senior fellow at the Stimson Center thinktank. “I wouldn’t have done that deal either. I think it was the right thing to do not to sign.” Vipin Narang, an expert on nuclear proliferation from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it was “better that Kim Jong-un didn’t commit to shutting down Yongbyon if he was going to slow-roll it, because committing to it in writing and then leaving himself vulnerable to being accused of violating it sets us on a collision course”. For the time being, Trump has shown no sign of a backlash against Kim in the face of Thursday’s bitter disappointment. He made clear he still believed in the North Korean despot’s good faith, even in the matter of the brutal and fatal torture of the US student Otto Warmbier in a North Korean prison. Some had feared that when it became clear Kim had no intention of giving up his nuclear arsenal Trump would resort to the threats and insults which helped bring the two countries to the brink of war in the summer and autumn of 2017. For all the claims of his ghost-written book The Art of the Deal, Trump revealed himself to be a profoundly flawed negotiator who failed to understand his counterpart, and convinced himself only he could clinch an agreement, nuclear experts said. Stephen Biegun, the US special representative for North Korea, who had taken part in preparatory talks with North Korean officials, was sidelined at the summit, his place at the table taken by the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who has minimal foreign policy experience. Biegun’s marginalisation was “incredibly striking”, said Alexandra Bell, a former state department arms control official. “The president has repeatedly signalled through word and deed that he doesn’t really trust Biegun to lead this process,” said Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. She recalled Trump’s lack of concern about extensive vacancies at the state department when he said: “I’m the only one who matters.” “That may be the case to the president, but it means no one can work ably on his behalf,” she added. “Based on his remarks at the press conference, he seemed to intimate that he thought we could secure a grand bargain and declare victory. That’s not how any of this works.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/oct/16/safer-small-nuclear-reactors-power-plant-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-16T13:30:35Z","webTitle":"This new technology could save the troubled nuclear power industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/16/safer-small-nuclear-reactors-power-plant-technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/oct/16/safer-small-nuclear-reactors-power-plant-technology","fields":{"headline":"This new technology could save the troubled nuclear power industry","bodyText":"The future of the nuclear industry may happen somewhere on scenic but relatively isolated land that’s about 100 miles southwest of Yellowstone National Park. Amid the 890-square-mile Idaho National Laboratory campus, a plan is in motion to build a type of nuclear reactor unlike any that’s currently in use to produce electricity. The plan belongs to Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems, a consortium of 45 municipal agencies looking to replace their aging coal-fired plants. It won approval from the US Department of Energy earlier this year to scope out a site at the lab to analyze the environmental and safety impacts of what’s called the small nuclear reactor. If all goes well, the consortium plans to build a power plant there with 12 reactors totalling 600 megawatts in capacity. The analysis is crucial for determining whether there’s a strong business case for building small nuclear reactors. The emerging technology is meant to create cheaper and safer nuclear power plants. Nuclear power plants emit no emissions, but existing designs have become too costly to be a popular solution for climate change. The new technology has gotten significant funding from investors such as Bill Gates. The Utah group isn’t alone in investing in the new technology. In May, the Tennessee Valley Authority, which supplies power to nine million people in seven southeastern states, became the first utility to apply for a permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build a small nuclear reactor. The name of the technology gives a good clue to its distinguishing characteristics. Unlike other nuclear reactors that usually produce about 1,000 megawatts of carbon-free electricity, the small modular reactors, like the ones Utah is planning, are designed to be a fraction of the size at 50 to 300 megawatts. Rather than using electrically operated pumps and motors to circulate coolant and keep the core of the nuclear reactor at a low temperature, as happens in traditional plants, small reactors use no pumps and motors and instead rely on passive means such as gravity and conduction to cool the reactors. The compact size and other new improvements, including the ability to assemble all the components in a factory rather than on a project site, in theory make the small modular reactors much cheaper to build than traditional nuclear power plants that cost about $10bn and take a decade to secure permits and build. At a time when many existing nuclear power plants are struggling financially from competition from low natural gas prices and subsidized wind and solar projects, the nuclear industry sees hope in this next-generation technology. “From an investment standpoint, this makes it easier to do because you don’t have to put all the money up front; you can stagger when you build them,” said Gene Grecheck, a former president and the current co-chair of a policy advisory committee at the American Nuclear Society, which represents engineers and scientists. Grecheck said scientists are studying other ways to improve nuclear technology. “There is also a lot of research going on for advanced reactor concepts to take used fuel and reprocess it to reduce [the spent fuel] even more dramatically,” he said. Startup companies working on using spent uranium fuel include the Bill Gates-backed TerraPoweras well as Transatomic and Terrestrial Energy. Another start up, Oklo, seeks to create 2-megawatt reactors that fit inside shipping containers to provide electricity for remote off-grid locations. Many small nuclear reactor companies have yet to line up customers. One exception is Oregon-based NuScale Power, whose technology has been tapped for the project by the Utah consortium in Idaho. NuScale plans to apply for certification from the US Nuclear Regulatory Agency later this year, a step that all nuclear engineering firms must take before their designs can be used to build power plants. The company expects the agency to approve the design by 2020 if the permit process goes smoothly, said Mike McGough, NuScale’s chief commercial officer. McGough said NuScale has currently spent “a little over” $30m on testing ahead of its NRC submission, and if the design is approved, the company expects construction costs to be less than $3bn for the first 12 modules. Comparatively, the Southern Company’s 2,200-megawatt Vogtle Power Plant, being built in Georgia, is expected to cost $8bn just for its roughly 46% share in the project. Even if the small reactor remains within estimated costs, it will be pricey, at least initially, next to subsidized wind and solar. The US Energy Information Administration estimates the cost of constructing and operating power plants averages $50.90 per megawatt hour for wind and $58.20 per megawatt hour for solar. NuScale estimates the same type of cost for the first batch of small modules will be about $101 per megawatt hour. Like solar and wind, McGough said he expected the prices would decrease over time as more utilities build small nuclear reactors. The Utah consortium is pegging the cost at $85 per megawatt hour, a lower estimate because city governments can borrow money at cheaper rates, Webb said. The Utah consortium, like power companies across the country, is under increasing pressure from state and federal regulations such as the Clean Power Plan to cut its emissions. Nuclear fits that need, but the size of traditional plants is too big, said LaVarr Webb, spokesman for the Utah consortium. NuScale’s design is much more appealing. “That way we buy based on what our needs were, which makes a lot of sense,” he said. Plus, Webb said, the small reactor design eases the challenge of using nuclear power to complement the group’s intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. Current nuclear plants are designed to produce electricity without interruption; adjusting the levels of energy output quickly in response to any sudden increase or drop of renewable energy generation is difficult to do. Small reactors can operate independently, allowing a plant to vary its output more dynamically, McGough said. The Utah consortium will hire Washington state-based Energy Northwest to operate and maintain its 12 reactors in Idaho if they are built. The Utah group expects the project to come online by 2024. The initial high prices mean these tiny nuclear reactors will likely be built in the near future in states that allow utility monopolies, such as California, Utah and Washington. Utilities in those states need to win state approval for charging customers higher rates to pay for the new power plants, but they don’t have to worry about competition. Mike Pasqualetti, senior sustainability scientist at Arizona State University’s School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning, isn’t convinced the world needs this technology. These new plants may be cheaper to build in theory than conventional nuclear projects, but it delays the transition to a more sustainable future in which 100% of the US’ electricity needs come from renewable sources and energy storage, he said. “Small scale nuclear has advantages to it, but there’s still waste. Are they safer? Probably. Are they cheaper to build? Probably. Do we have any experience doing it? Not really,” Pasqualetti said. While active research is in place to reduce the complexity of building and operating nuclear power plants, there’s a long way to go in making this source of energy an important solution for fighting climate change, said Dan Bakal, head of the electricity power research organization Ceres, a nonprofit sustainability advocacy group. “If we get to a breakthrough there, that could lead to [new plant construction]. Right now I wouldn’t be betting a lot on that,” Bakal said."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"politics/2017/jul/11/uk-should-stay-euratom-nuclear-body-labour-brexit-keir-starmer","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-10T23:01:39Z","webTitle":"UK should stay in Euratom nuclear body, says Labour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/11/uk-should-stay-euratom-nuclear-body-labour-brexit-keir-starmer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/jul/11/uk-should-stay-euratom-nuclear-body-labour-brexit-keir-starmer","fields":{"headline":"UK should stay in Euratom nuclear body, says Labour","bodyText":"Labour’s Keir Starmer has urged the government to keep Britain in the Euratom treaty that governs the movement of nuclear materials – and drop its red line on the future role of the European court of justice or risk defeat in the House of Commons. The shadow Brexit secretary vowed to work with MPs across the political spectrum, including a growing number of Conservative rebels, to protect the UK’s place in the European atomic energy community. “It’s increasingly clear that the government acted recklessly by giving up on membership of Euratom. As with so many aspects of the prime minister’s Brexit strategy, she has let ideological obsessions – in this case preventing any future role for the European court of justice – take priority over safeguarding jobs and the economy,” said Starmer, who said there were 78,000 UK jobs in the nuclear industry. With at least nine Tory MPs signalling a willingness to line up with Labour and the Lib Dems, it could be difficult for May to win a vote on the issue later this year, even with the support of the Democratic Unionists. Ed Vaizey, a former Tory minister, joined forces with Labour MP Rachel Reeves over the weekend to warn that the treaty was vital to protect the nuclear power industry in the UK. Euratom is the body that coordinates Europe’s civil nuclear energy industry. It was born in parallel with the birth of the European economic community in 1957, and is part of a separate treaty to that which created the European Union. As a result the UK had to serve notice to quit it separately. It has emerged that ministers are considering trying to secure “associate membership” of the grouping, similar to that held by Switzerland, in the face of the possible rebellion. Another option on the table is paying money to an international agency to set up an independent arrangement. However, all countries that currently have full access to Euratom do have to accept that the ECJ has a role in dealing with relevant disputes, something that Theresa May has said she will not accept. Questions were also raised about the impact that a Euratom exit could have on cancer patients, amid warnings that thousands could face delays to treatment if there are difficulties moving radioactive material around. Dr Nicola Strickland, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, told the Evening Standard she feared the risk of “Brexatom” could threaten the supply of radioactive isotopes, used in scans and treatment. The newspaper, edited by the former chancellor George Osborne, carried a story on its front page with the headline: “Cancer patients in Brexit scare.” Labour’s shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has demanded that his counterpart in government, Jeremy Hunt, urgently update parliament about the possible impact for patients. The Labour frontbencher has sent a letter asking the Department of Health to publish any analysis it has carried out on the issue, and questioning what consultations were carried out before a decision was reached on exiting Euratom. “The NHS is already under huge pressure and struggling to cope in the face of underfunding by this government. Demand for cancer services is rising and key cancer targets have been missed in recent months. Clearly this additional threat to stable supply chains has the potential to make a difficult situation much worse,” Ashworth wrote. He also called on ministers to release the legal advice that said it was necessary to leave Euratom as part of Brexit. The pressure has been mounting since May included leaving Euratom in her article 50 letter to the European council president, Donald Tusk. Critics believe May has created the problem by insisting that the UK cannot remain under the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. However, a senior Whitehall source told the Guardian that the government had included that line because of a belief that the UK had no choice. They said that “both the UK government and the European commission thought it was a legal necessity” to leave Euratom as part of Brexit. However, the source said significant work was under way to ensure that Britain had the “same outcomes” as currently enjoyed within the grouping, and admitted that country membership was being considered. “We will not be marking our own homework when it comes to nuclear safety,” he added. A source from the European commission confirmed that, legally speaking, the UK would have to leave Euratom as part of Brexit. All the members of Euratom are inside the EU, although Switzerland is an equal partner through associate membership. Reeves, who is running to become chair of the business select committee in parliament, said: “MPs from across the political spectrum are clearly very worried about the prospect of leaving Euratom and ideology getting ahead of sensible politics. “It is time for the government to rethink this. Nobody voted to leave the EU to come out of Euratom, and no one would think the government was going soft on Brexit if they rowed back on this.” Dame Sue Ion, honorary president of the National Skills Academy for Nuclear and former chair of the Nuclear Innovation and Research Advisory Board, said: “Associate membership is better than nothing, but it all depends on exactly what that means. It’s normally associated with access to Euratom research, not the wider cover provided by the treaty for everything else [such as transport of nuclear materials].” She added: “The best option is clearly to stay in, which is entirely possible.” A government spokesman responded on the question of a risk to cancer patients: “This simply isn’t true. The availability of medical radio-isotopes will not be impacted by the UK’s exit from Euratom,” he said. “The UK supports Euratom and will want to see continuity of co-operation and standards. We remain absolutely committed to the highest standards of nuclear safety, safeguards and support for the industry.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/jul/10/what-is-euratom-and-why-does-it-matter","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-10T12:45:32Z","webTitle":"What is Euratom and why does it matter? | Dan Roberts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/10/what-is-euratom-and-why-does-it-matter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/jul/10/what-is-euratom-and-why-does-it-matter","fields":{"headline":"What is Euratom and why does it matter?","bodyText":"Of all the many European collaborations threatened by Brexit, the UK’s participation in the European atomic energy community, Euratom, might seem an odd subject for Tory rebels to pick for their first fight. But the government’s policy on leaving this nuclear safety and research watchdog provides an unusually clear-cut example of the economic pain of taking back control – and one for which there is unusually limited political justification. “Initially created to coordinate the member states’ research programmes for the peaceful use of nuclear energy,” explains the official legal summary, “the Euratom treaty today helps to pool knowledge, infrastructure and funding of nuclear energy. It ensures the security of atomic energy supply within the framework of a centralised monitoring system.” What’s special about Euratom compared with other EU regulatory agencies? Unlike the dozens of other, equally sensitive, regulatory arrangements for industries such as aviation or pharmaceuticals, Euratom has been singled out for special treatment because it is not technically part of the EU. Instead, the treaty that established this body to coordinate Europe’s civil nuclear energy industry was born in parallel with the birth of the European economic community in 1957. Britain’s participation in this largely untouched relic of atomic camaraderie therefore required a separate legal relationship with the European court of justice to enforce it. Since Theresa May has committed the country to severing all ties with the ECJ, it also required a separate clause announcing our intention to leave in the article 50 legislation that triggered the start of the two-year Brexit process in March. What is at risk if the UK does quit as proposed? For the nuclear industry, rapid departure from Euratom without a clear replacement spells disaster. Scientists have warned that British power stations may not be able to source nuclear fuel if it cannot be legally transported across borders. The shipment of medical isotopes used in scans and cancer treatment is also said to be jeopardised. European workers on shared research projects, such as experimental fusion reactors, face an equally uncertain future without Euratom’s separate guarantees of freedom of movement. Some critics have claimed that abrupt exit means that by 2025 “you could be doing your writing by candlelight on a typewriter” as the future of Britain’s nuclear industry hangs in the balance. Calmer voices argue that arranging new rules to ensure safety and govern shipments should not be that hard; just that it is likely to take much longer than the 20 months remaining. But the cost of any short-term chaos is hard to justify given that nobody ever complained about the minor compromises imposed by Euratom on British sovereignty in the first place. Instead, it provides an embarrassing example of the unintended consequences of the prime minister’s hard red line on dealing with the ECJ – something even a former special adviser to the Brexit secretary has described as dangerously “absolutist”. Is this the first of many regulatory rows? More such awkward disentangling is almost certain to follow as Britain decides whether to leave other European regulatory agencies. But, these questions are currently shrouded in political fudge with the government officially undecided on what happens. So, for now at least, Euratom provides a taste of these many battles to come. The defection of just seven Tory MPs could be enough to give Theresa May’s fragile minority government a potentially fatal dose of radiation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2021/may/19/uk-inflation-rises-april-energy-fuel-clothing-bitcoin-ftse-stock-markets-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-19T20:58:11Z","webTitle":"Bitcoin plunges, then rebounds, as inflation worries hit markets – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/may/19/uk-inflation-rises-april-energy-fuel-clothing-bitcoin-ftse-stock-markets-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2021/may/19/uk-inflation-rises-april-energy-fuel-clothing-bitcoin-ftse-stock-markets-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Bitcoin plunges, then rebounds, as inflation worries hit markets – as it happened","bodyText":"Finally....after probably the most chaotic days trading since the crash of March 2020, bitcoin is holding up better than rival cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is currently trading around $38,300, a fall of over 11% today after worries about China’s crypto currency triggered today’s slump. But still, that’s a rebound from bitcoin’s lowest point (when it briefly hit $30,000), after Elon Musk tweeted about Tesla’s diamond hands (implying that it wasn’t selling its bitcoin), and Ark’s Cathie Wood said she still backed it. Ether, the coin used on the ethereum blockchain network, is nursing steeper losses - down almost 25% today at $2,587, despite today’s news of a plan to cut its carbon emissions. Ripple’s XRP is also down over a quarter, while joke coin Doge’s hopes of going “to the moon” have taken a knock -- it’s down 25% today at $0.35. Nicholas Cawley from DailyFX says it was a day of ‘relentless selling pressure’ across the cryptocurrency market. The sell-off has been triggered by news that China is looking to ban the use of cryptocurrencies. The speed of the sell-off suggests that leveraged accounts are being hit badly and the indiscriminate slump across the space also points to a lack of buying intent. It maybe that this sell-off is an opportunity to enter or re-enter the market but the current level of volatility in the market should warn people against trying to ‘buy the dip’. Investors should not buy in a falling market and should wait until price action stabilizes before considering hitting the buy button.” Bloombeg argues that Bitcoin’s relative recovery tonight shows its resilience: That’s all for tonight. Here’s our news story about today’s action: After a wild day, the New York stock market has closed off its earlier lows, as traders shook off the turmoil in the crypto asset world. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has ended 164 points lower at 33,896.04, down 0.5%. Oil company Chevron was the top Dow faller, down 2.8%, tracking the 3% drop in crude prices today. It was followed by sportwear group Nike (-1.9%), investment bank Goldman Sachs (-1.65%) and chemicals producer Dow Inc (-1.4)%. But the DJIA’s tech stocks did better, with Salesforce.com rising 3.2% and Intel nearly 1% higher. The S&amp;P 500, which covers a broader range of stocks, fell 0.3% while the Nasdaq finished flat. As well as bitcoin’s partial recovery from its 30% slump, investors have also been digesting the Federal Reserve’s latest minutes. Capital Economics’ Paul Ashworth reckons the Fed sounds dovish, despite some members suggesting it might soon be time to talk about how to taper its stimulus. The minutes of the late-April FOMC meeting reveal that, even though some officials were beginning to worry the upward pressure on inflation could last longer, they were still committed to maintaining the asset purchases. “The economy remained far from the [FOMC’s] maximum-employment and price-stability goals” and, as a result, “it would likely be some time until the economy had made [the] substantial further progress” needed to begin tapering those purchases. Tesla’s share price has dropped today too, down around 3% in afternoon trading at $560. That’s rather worse than the wider market - the Nasdaq is staging a late recovery, only down 0.2%. Tesla bought $1.5bn of bitcoin earlier this year, later selling around 10% of its bitcoin stake for a $101m profit. On top of the crypto volatility, Tesla’s share price could also be affected by the news this week that Michael Burry (of The Big Short fame), has taken a position against Tesla. Burry owns puts* against 800,100 Tesla shares, an SEC filing showed. [* puts give investors the option of selling shares at a predetermined price, within a certain timeframe, so would be ‘in the money’ if a stock fell below that point] The minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last meeting, held at the end of April, are out. They show that some policymakers might be open to talking about how to slow its bond-purchase stimulus programme, at future meetings, if the economy keeps recovering. The minutes of the FOMC meeting say: A number of participants suggested that if the economy continued to make rapid progress toward the Committee’s goals, it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchases. So just a hint that the Fed could reconsidering its easy policies if the economy keeps rapidly improving. It’s currently buying $120bn of assets per month, expanding its balance sheet to stimulate the recovery and bring unemployment down. However, the minutes also show that the Fed believes the US economy is far from reaching its inflation and maximum employment targets: Participants observed that economic activity had picked up sharply this year, with robust gains in consumer spending, housing-sector activity, business equipment investment, and manufacturing production. They noted that the acceleration in economic activity reflected positive developments associated with the rapid pace of vaccinations as well as continued support from fiscal and monetary policies. Nevertheless, participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals. The meeting took place before April’s Non-Farm payroll report showed much fewer jobs were created last month than expected, and before US inflation jumped to a 12-year high of 4.2%. The minute are online here. Bloomberg’s John Authers has some timely thoughts on today’s drama: Reuters’ John Foley has a good column on bitcoin tonight - arguing that the bull case for the crypto asset has been undermined this week: The bull case for bitcoin is pretty simple. It’s a form of payment that can be used anywhere in the world; its supply is limited, so it should preserve its value when inflation picks up; and it can’t be manipulated, especially by central bankers or governments. After a recent plunge, the crypto-asset is currently scoring zero out of three. So although Cathie Wood is still bullish, and bitcoin could achieve a critical mass where “Musk-style interventions” can’t impact it, crypto-assets are a long way from achieving the status of a real currency, Foley adds: While there is no central bank to meddle with its value, Musk, China or posters on Reddit can too easily step into the vacuum, without a central bank’s accountability. As for inflation, investors are more worried about that than they have been in years, yet bitcoin is going in precisely the wrong direction. In sum, the best way to think about bitcoin is as an option on something that might one day be a currency. And a pretty expensive one at that. Technology investor Cathie Wood has not lost faith in bitcoin, despite watching it plunge 30% earlier today before a rebound. The head of Ark Investment Management told Bloomberg TV that Ark still expects the cryptocurrency to reach a price of $500,000. Wood said that environmental concerns have risen, leading to people such as Elon Musk pulling away, but she argues that bitcoin mining could increasingly use green power sources such as solar - which could help the adoption of solar to accelerate. Wood also said that the indicators which Ark tracks have been suggesting bitcoin had entered a ‘capitulation’ phase today -- ie, a buy signal. “I think we’re in a capitulation phase. That’s a really great time to buy no matter what the asset is.” You can watch some of the interview here. ARK holds several cryptocurrency-related investments, including funds in Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust and crypto exchange Coinbase, whose shares fell again today. Aviva Investors is shutting its £347m UK Property fund, which has 3,400 investors, more than a year after suspending dealing, saying there is not enough liquidity to reopen it. It it also closing two feeder funds. The funds will be wound up on 19 July and the cash returned to investors “in a fair and orderly manner” – after the properties owned by the funds have been sold. As these sales complete, cash will be returned to investors in a series of payments, starting in late July. Aviva Investors expects this process to take 12 to 24 months, although it may take longer, depending on market conditions. The initial payment will be at least 40% of the total net asset value of the UK Property Fund, on the date of the closure – at the moment, this would amount to £139m. The UK Property Fund’s top holdings are the Ealing Cross office complex valued at £60m to £80m, along with Lombardy Shopping Park in Hayes, the Corn Exchange in Manchester city centre and the Guildhall shopping centre in Exeter, which are all worth £20m to £40m each. The asset manager explained: “As investors will be aware, dealing in the funds was suspended in March 2020 due to material uncertainty over the valuation of property within the portfolio, brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. During this period of economic uncertainty, it has become increasingly challenging to generate positive returns whilst also providing the necessary liquidity to re-open the funds.” Investors had a reminder of the prospect of rising interest rates earlier today, when Iceland became the first in western Europe to tighten monetary policy since the pandemic. Iceland’s central bank raised its key interest rate to 1%, from 0.75%, due to “widespread“ inflation pressures. It cited the depreciation of the krona, and steep rises in wages and house prices. Bloomberg explains that Iceland is trying to head off a spike in inflation: Iceland’s sudden shift in its policy path is standing out in a region where central banks from Frankfurt to London are still deploying degrees of ultra-loose easing to give recoveries time to take hold. Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, says Iceland’s move - and the jump in UK inflation this morning - may have prompted some investors to look at their portfolios. “It’s all been a pretty toxic mix. Inflation fears and a touch of FOMO might have pushed some investors to consider dipping their toe into crypto assets, but today’s falls have been a sharp reminder of their volatility. The decision by Iceland to hike interest rates has also served as a timely reminder that just because UK rates have remained at record lows for over a year they certainly won’t stay there long-term and today’s inflation figures will have prompted some investors to take a long look at their portfolios. Speaking of volatile.... Bitcoin has now jumped back to $40,000, taking its daily losses to below 10% in a day of remarkable swings: Prices have picked up since Elon Musk’s ‘diamond hands’ tweet. The threat of a clampdown in China means bitcoin will remain volatile, predicts Sheila Warren, Deputy Head of the World Economic Forum’s C4IR [Centre For the Fourth Industrial Revolution]. We fully expect bitcoin’s price to remain volatile, as it tends to be hyper-responsive to even the hint of regulation. That being said, China’s move doesn’t necessarily presage similar crackdowns in other jurisdictions, and this move is likely to affect Chinese business innovation, which has already been slow because of the concern about regulatory action, more than consumer activity. Matt Weller of Forex.com points out that bitcoin has been through several slumps in the past: Any time markets are volatile, it helps to take a step back and review the historical data. While Bitcoin’s current plunge certainly feels terrifying for bulls in the moment, experienced “hodlers” know that Bitcoin routinely sees steep selloffs during bull markets. As the chart below shows, Bitcoin saw seven separate -30% pullbacks before finally peaking in its 2015-2017 bull market: As such, Weller is skeptical that the confluence of bearish news and horrendous price action will mark the end of the Bitcoin bull market and a new crypto “winter”. Here’s a chart showing how bitcoin slumped dramatically a few hours ago, before a partial recovery..... ...and here’s one showing how prices surged to record highs in April, before falling back in the last few weeks. After its earlier crash, Bitcoin has risen back to around $37,000. That still leaves it down 12% today, and around 40% below April’s peak above $64,000. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reached for the emoji button, and tweeted that his carmaker has ‘diamond hands’ . That’s a phrase popular among Reddit traders, meaning to hold onto a position even if prices plunge. Musk said on Monday that Tesla had not sold any of its remaining bitcoin which it acquired earlier this year. Back in London, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has closed 84 points lower, or 1.2%, at 6950 points - its lowest close in over a week. Angst about inflation, and the possibility of central banks tightening policy, hit the mining sector. Anglo American (-4.7%), BHP Group (-4.6%), Antofagasta (-3.4%), Rio Tinto (-3.4%) and Glencore (-3.3%) led the fallers, on fears that any hike in interest rates would hit demand for commodities such as iron ore, copper, coal, nickel, zinc, platinum.... A research note from JP Morgan, suggesting that institutional investors have been cutting their exposure to bitcoin, may also have added fuel to today’s selloff. Reuters explains: Investors may also be exiting bitcoin for gold, analysts at JPMorgan said, citing positioning data compiled on basis of open interest in CME bitcoin futures contracts. This shows “the steepest and more sustained liquidation” in bitcoin futures since last October, they told clients, adding that it pointed to “continued retrenchment by institutional investors”. Advocates of bitcoin have argued that it provides a hedge against inflation and money printing, as there can only be 21 million in circulation (over 18 million have been mined so far). Gold, that more traditional protection against inflation, rose over 1% today to $1,889 per ounce, its highest since early January. Lumber prices have also fallen sharply today, the 8th daily drop in a row. You might not think lumber and bitcoin have anything in common. But... they were both boosted by the liquidity sloshing around the system, and are now being hit by broader market anxiety about the risk of central banks tightening policy to tackle inflation. Fear of missing out has lured many people into crypto recently, with the price of bitcoin, ether et al soaring in recent months. But as Rick Eling, investment director at Quilter, points out, FOMO is not the basis of an investment strategy. Bitcoin is a volatile asset, and as we have seen so often in financial markets boom is almost always followed by bust. Eling adds that the logic for investing in bitcoin is flawed: If we say that Bitcoin is a currency, then it must get to a point of broadly stable value in order to function as a currency. Successful currencies do not have wildly fluctuating values such as this. But if we also say that Bitcoin will “make us money” then it can’t also have a stable value. We reach a circularity. “In other words, the premise on which people claim Bitcoin has long term value (that it will become an accepted currency) argues against its future growth potential. Those who have made money from cryptocurrencies have much more luck than they do skill.” Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, is just “months” away from shifting its underlying infrastructure to a new model that would slash its carbon emissions a hundredfold, the project has announced. Since Ethereum also provides the infrastructure for a host of other cryptocurrency-related projects, including many non-fungible token platforms, the change could radically improve the energy efficiency of the sector. At its heart, the plan involves shifting the way Ethereum’s underlying blockchain works. Currently, Ethereum uses a “proof-of-work” system, like the model used by Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies. The security of the system as a whole is guaranteed by a requirement that members burn electricity doing complex but pointless mathematics, in order to ensure that no single user can dominate the system. When the switch is complete, Ethereum will instead use a model called “proof-of-stake”. Under that approach, rather than handing out internal responsibilities based on how much electricity is burned, the system instead allocates power based on how much Ethereum existing users already hold – requiring them to “stake” a portion of their currency every time they make a decision. Here’s the full story: Shares in Coinbase, the crypto exchange, tumbled over 10% at the start of trading. They fell as low at $208 per share, a new record low, further from the $381 at which it listed just last month. Edward Moya of OANDA points out that today’s plunging crypto prices will scare off some potential customers (as well as hurting those who have taken the plunge in recent weeks). Coinbase will go down as one of the worst direct listings ever. Coinbase is getting crushed as the crypto markets collapse. The global crypto market is down over 25% today alone and this crash will not bode well for attracting new customers. Coinbase wants new crypto traders, but many will be afraid that this Bitcoin crash could end up just like the one in 2017. Coinbase’s trading debut coincides with the top for Bitcoin and many traders can’t make a convincing argument that it will be able to recover all those losses since then. Some Coinbase customers are also struggling to use its service, CNBC flags: We’re seeing some issues on Coinbase and Coinbase Pro and we’re aware some features may not be functioning completely normal,” the company said in a statement to CNBC. “We’re currently investigating these issues and will provide updates as soon as possible.” Stocks have opened lower on Wall Street, with inflation worries hitting shares, and the slump in crypto assets also causing jitters. Here’s the early prices: Dow Jones industrial average: down 424 points or 1.25% at 33,635 points S&amp;P 500: down 60 points or 1.5% at 4,067 points Nasdaq: down 229 points or 1.7% at 13,074 points Beyond the meltdown in crypto, other assets are also falling today as inflation worries rise. In London, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is now 1.4%, or 99 points at 6935. Mining companies are leading the fallers, with Anglo American (-4.8%) and copper producer Antofagasta (-4%) hit by worries that central banks will be forced to raise interest rates to tackle rising prices. Oil is also weaker, with Brent crude down 2.5% at $67 per barrel. Sophie Griffiths, market analyst at OANDA, says:. Rising Covid cases in India, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam have prompted fresh lockdown restrictions, raising concerns over softer fuel demand. The global picture for demand is probably the most divided it has been since the start of the pandemic, with an improving demand picture in the West versus a deteriorating outlook in Asia. The mixed picture is contributing to the volatility we have seen across recent sessions. Rising inflation fears are adding pressure to oil as market participants sell out of risker assets. The crypto bubble that “added billions to nonsense digital tokens overnight” is bursting, says Bloomberg: Bitcoin plunged more than 20% to less than $35,000, wiping out more than half a trillion dollars in value from the coin’s peak market value. It has erased all the gains it clocked up following Tesla Inc.’s February 8 announcement that it would use corporate cash to buy the asset and accept it as a form of payment for its vehicles. Ethereum, the second-biggest coin, sank more than 40%, while joke token Dogecoin lost 45%. Bitcoin’s slump is accelerating, plunging through $32,000 in further wild swings - a fall of around 25% today. That means its lost half its value since hitting record highs in April. Nouriel Roubini, the American economist who has repeatedly warned that bitcoin is a bubble, tweets: CNBC points out that China’s hard line on digital currencies is not new: In 2017, authorities shut down local cryptocurrency exchanges and banned so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs), a way for companies in the space to raise money through issuing new digital tokens. Traders in China once accounted for a huge share of the bitcoin market but after the crackdown, their influence was reduced significantly. Chinese cryptocurrency operations have moved abroad. “The crypto markets are currently processing a cascade of news that fuel the bear case for price development,” said Ulrik Lykke, executive director at crypto hedge fund ARK36. More than $250 billion evaporated from the bitcoin market alone last week, Lykke said. Though that number seems “astronomical,” such moves aren’t uncommon in the volatile crypto market, he added. Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG, tweets that liquidity-fuelled assets, such as bitcoin, are being hit by fears of higher inflation. A permanent rise in inflation could force central banks to tighten monetary policy, meaning higher interest rates and an end to bond-buying stimulus programmes which have pumped liquidity into the markets. Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist at crypto traders LMAX Digital, also argues that the “shakeup” in crypto markets is driven by inflation worries: The market has been looking to the news around Tesla and regulatory headwinds out of China as reasons behind the turnaround, though we have been warning for some time that a correction was due given the pace of the bull run this year. On Tuesday, China was out reiterating its 2017 stance that local financial and payment institutions should not engage in or provide services to crypto related businesses. But much like the Tesla story, we think assigning the pullback to the China news would be a gross exaggeration of the reality that this is indeed a market that has run too far and fast and a market that is still very much correlated to broader risk sentiment. If anything, we would assign investor worry around rising inflation risk and the impact this is having on stocks as a more legitimate reason to reconcile weakness in crypto. Crypto is considered to be an emerging market, and as such, a risk correlated market vulnerable to downturns in global sentiment. The sentiment across the crypto market has certainly taken a downturn: Today’s bitcoin losses come days after Tesla’s Elon Musk rattled the crypto sector by suspending payments in Bitcoin, citing its high energy use. Laith Khalaf, financial analyst at AJ Bell, argues that “the tide has turned” on bitcoin, given rising regulatory risks and environmental concerns (research shows that bitcoin consumes more energy than whole countries). “The price of Bitcoin has tumbled by a third over the last month, which highlights the extreme risk inherent in cryptocurrency. Risk cuts both ways however, and Bitcoin is still trading above where it started the year, so many investors will remain in profit, albeit trimmed back by the recent fall. Some rough and tumble is to be expected when holding something as volatile as cryptocurrency, but in recent weeks there have been significant developments which undermine Bitcoin’s long term prospects. “The tide has turned on Bitcoin because environmental concerns and regulatory risks have materialised, which have raised doubt over the long term adoption of cryptocurrency by businesses and consumers. Tesla’s decision to suspend accepting Bitcoin on environmental grounds will give other companies the jitters about facilitating crypto payments, lest they spark an ESG backlash from shareholders. Those companies which already accept Bitcoin will likely be having second thoughts. “Consumers and investors may also start to shun cryptocurrency, when they discover it’s an environmental deadweight, particularly younger Bitcoin fans who are also likely to be sensitive to climate issues. Bitcoin mining uses up a phenomenal amount of energy, and unlike traditional metal mining, doesn’t actually produce anything which is useful in the economy. Even celebrity endorsements may dry up as public figures become wary of being associated with an environmentally unfriendly product. China’s warning overnight has also highlighted the regulatory threat to cryptocurrencies, Khalaf adds: “Meanwhile the Chinese central bank has issued a warning that cryptocurrencies shouldn’t be accepted as payment for products or services. This is a manifestation of the regulatory risk surrounding cryptocurrencies. Central banks aren’t simply going to roll over and let systemic risks build up on the back of Bitcoin trading, particularly when cryptocurrencies are looking to usurp their position as arbiters of monetary value. Bitcoin has slumped to its lowest level since early February, after Chinese regulators intensified their efforts to crack down on the use of cryptocurrencies by financial institutions, and warned investors against speculative crypto trading. A sudden selloff sent the world’s largest cryptocurrency lurching to as low as $36,111, before it then recovered to around $38,500 -- still down around 11% so far this session, according to Reuters data. Coindesk data shows that bitcoin is currently down 15% over the last 24 hours. Other cryptocurrencies are also plunging, with ether down almost 25%. The slump was triggered by Chinese regulators intensifying their efforts to crack down on the use of cryptocurrencies by financial institutions. In a joint statement, banking and internet industry associations said that financial and payment institutions should not accept cryptocurrencies as payment or offer services and products related to them. Reuters has more details: China has banned financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions, and warned investors against speculative crypto trading. It was China’s latest attempt to clamp down on what was a burgeoning digital trading market. Under the ban, such institutions, including banks and online payments channels, must not offer clients any service involving cryptocurrency, such as registration, trading, clearing and settlement, three industry bodies said in a joint statement on Tuesday. “Recently, crypto currency prices have skyrocketed and plummeted, and speculative trading of cryptocurrency has rebounded, seriously infringing on the safety of people’s property and disrupting the normal economic and financial order,” they said in the statement. Bitcoin has now fallen around 40% since hitting record highs around $64,000 last month. The British weather has not been terribly kind to the pub trade recently, since pub beer gardens were reopened in the middle of April. But still, customers have been braving the wet weather to flock back to their local for a pint, according to the pub groups Mitchells &amp; Butlers and Marston’s, who reported strong demand since reopening in mid-April. The pub and restaurant group Mitchells &amp; Butlers, which is now serving customers at almost all of its 1,600 venues, said it was confident its profits would rebound once coronavirus restrictions are fully eased. Phil Urban, Mitchells &amp; Butlers’ chief executive, said this morning: “We had plenty of examples of hardy souls refusing to leave their pint just because of a bit of rain.” The All Bar One owner, which also runs pub chains including O’Neill’s and restaurant brands such as Harvester, said it had seen strong levels of bookings and demand. However, with pubs restricted to outdoor-only tables until indoor drinking resumed on Monday, sales in the five weeks from 12 April remained 37% lower than normal trading before the pandemic. “It finally feels as though we are on the way back,” said Urban. “Judging by our bookings, we are in for a busy time. We believe people will value eating and drinking out far more than before, having been starved of it for so long.” Future, the owner of magazines from Marie Claire to Metal Hammer and sites such as Techradar and GoCompare, has reported record revenues and profits in its first half as the company continues to cash in on the pandemic-fuelled reading and online shopping boom. Future reported a 21% increase in group revenues to £272m and more than doubled pre-tax profits to £57m in the six months to the end of March, well ahead of analyst forecasts, prompting the company to say that its full year results will now be “materially ahead” of expectations. Future’s share price has surged 8% today, to its highest levels in over 20 years - since the aftermath of the first dotcom boom two decades ago. This gives the London-listed group a market value of more than £3bn. The company, which generates revenue from magazine sales, digital advertising and e-commerce by sending online readers to partner retailers, said that Covid lockdown restrictions provided a £5m eCommerce revenue boost as shoppers stocked up online. Future grew online users by 31% to 311m year-on-year and says it now reaches more than a third of adults online in the US and UK. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: “There’s no getting away from the fact that these are a stonking set of results from Future, and suggest at least for now, the business is futureproof” Back in the City, UK infrastructure investor John Laing are leading the FTSE 250 risers after agreeing to be taken over by private equity giant KKR in a £2bn deal. My colleague Joanna Partridge explains: Private equity firm KKR has agreed to buy UK infrastructure investor John Laing, whose recent projects include Liverpool’s Alder Hey Children’s Hospital, in a deal valued at around £2bn. John Laing has invested in over 150 projects and businesses since it was founded, across a range of sectors including transport and energy. The firm, which was floated in February 2015, currently owns assets including schools, hospitals and infrastructure predominantly in the United States and Australia, as well as in Europe. John Laing said its board intended to unanimously recommend KKR’s offer to its shareholders to take the firm private, adding that it represented a fair and reasonable value for the company. The takeover values the London-listed firm at 403p per share, a 27% premium to its value on 5 May, just before it confirmed it was in talks with KKR. Shares in John Laing have jumped 11% to 401p today. John Laing was founded in 1848 as a building company in Carlisle, and has worked on major UK projects such as the M1 motorway, the Severn Bridge, and the Sizewell B nuclear power station, before focusing on infrastructure work. It was previously taken over by Henderson in 2006, before returning to the stock market in 2015. Here’s our news story on the jump in UK’s house prices: House prices across the UK grew at the fastest pace in March since just before the financial crisis hit in 2007, according to official figures. With buyers rushing to take advantage of the government’s stamp duty holiday, extended to the end of June, the average UK house price climbed 10.2% in the year to March, up from 9.2% in February. This is the highest annual growth rate the UK has seen since August 2007, said the Office for National Statistics. Jamie Durham, economist at PwC, predicts that house prices will keep rising in the coming months, having jumped 10.2% to record levels in March. He cites demand for larger houses, low borrowing costs, and the stash of savings accrued by some households in the lockdown. “A shift in preferences towards larger properties, an accumulation of more than £140 billion of savings over the last year, low interest rates, and the stamp duty holiday continue to drive house price growth. We expect that these forces will continue to support price growth over the coming months, even as the stamp duty holiday winds down. “The spread of the new variant in the UK, and possibility of measures to contain it, is unlikely to have a material impact on the housing market, given price growth remained strong during the most recent lockdown. “However, there is some risk to the outlook if inflation takes hold in the UK as banks may increase interest rates. This would affect mortgage affordability criteria, lending, and could ultimately weigh on house price growth, though the impact of this will depend on how high inflation rises.” Anna Clare Harper, CEO of asset manager SPI Capital, points to the generational inequality created by housing boom: ‘The effects are also clear: with wages rising significantly more slowly than houseprices, affordability constraints are increasingly. This is creating, and will continue to drive huge inequalities between older and younger generations, and growing demand from both younger and older renters who are ‘priced out’. She also predicts prices will continue to increase - partly because construction materials are much more expensive (prices of timber, copper and steel have surged amid shortages) ‘It is also getting more expensive to build. With construction costs rising due to raw material costs, and regulations around building standards getting tighter, it is easy to see how house price rises will continue over the coming years, in particular for new homes. The UK housing market of the future will no longer be dominated by the high value of land but by the challenges and costs of building new homes that meet the needs of a net carbon zero economy, in a context of rapidly rising costs to deliver. Jonathan Hopper, CEO of Garrington Property Finders, says a ‘perfect storm’ of factors drove prices since the first wave of Covid-19 hit the economy. “It’s official – a year of on-off lockdowns has completely unshackled the property market from the wider economy. “The UK economy shrank by 6.1% between the first quarter of 2020 and the same time this year. Yet those same 12 months saw the average home rocket in value by 10.2%. “The boom isn’t just one for the history books. It’s also the product of a perfect storm of factors. Years of demand that had been repressed by Brexit uncertainty were unleashed just as the difficulties of lockdown living forced thousands of people to fundamentally reassess what they want from their home. “The Stamp Duty holiday fanned the flames, spurring thousands of would-be buyers into action. “Spring is traditionally a busy time for the property industry, but this year has been off the chart. Yorkshire and The Humber saw the highest growth in house prices over the last year within England, with average prices increasing by 14.0%. But London lagged far behind, with average prices up 3.7% over the year to March 2021. That highlights how people have been looking to move out of the capital to more rural areas, where properties are less expensive. The average UK house price hit a new peak of £256,000 in March 2021, which is £24,000 higher than in March 2020. House price inflation in the UK has risen to its highest level since the summer of 2007, just before the collapse of Northern Rock. The average UK house price increased by 10.2% over the year to March 2021, hitting a new record, up from 9.2% in February 2021, the Office for National Statistics reports. This is the highest annual growth rate the UK has seen since August 2007, just before the credit crunch struck. The report shows that prices rose strongly in England, Wales and Scotland, but lagged behind in London: Average house prices increased over the year in England to £275,000 (10.2%), in Wales to £185,000 (11.0%), in Scotland to £167,000 (10.6%) and in Northern Ireland to £149,000 (6.0%). London continues to be the region with the lowest annual growth (3.7%) for the fourth consecutive month. Prices for detached houses rose by 11.7%, faster than the average, amid the surge in demand for larger houses - perhaps further from the office - following the move to home working. The government’s stamp duty holiday (which was extended in March’s budget) also fuelled the rise in prices. The ONS says: The latter half of 2020 saw the UK’s average house price growth accelerating. This trend has continued into the beginning of 2021, reaching an annual growth rate of 10.2% in March 2021. The pandemic may have caused house buyers to reassess their housing preferences. In our UK HPI data, we have seen the average price of detached properties increase by 11.7% in the year to March 2021, in comparison with flats and maisonettes increasing by 5.0% over the same period. Changes in the tax paid on housing transactions may have allowed sellers to request higher prices as the buyers’ overall costs are reduced. Inflation across the eurozone also accelerated last month, due to rising energy bills.... but core inflation has dipped. Consumer prices across the single currency region jumped by 1.6% over the 12 months to April, up from 1.3% in March, and nearer to the European Central Bank’s target of close to, but below, 2%. Prices rose 0.6% during the month (as they also did in the UK). Prices of energy, such as oil and gas, jumped by 10.4% over the year, as the recent increase in crude prices hit consumers’ pockets. Food prices were 0.6% higher than a year ago, with services costs rose 0.9%. But core inflation (stripping out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco) dipped to an annual rate of 0.7%, down from 0.9% in March, and less than expected. That’s may be helping European stock markets to recover some ground -- the FTSE 100’s now down around 0.8%, or 58 points. Europe’s stock markets are all in the red this morning, with inflation worries on the rise. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says: “Global markets have woken up on the wrong side of the bed, with share prices flashing red across most of Asia and Europe,” “Despite the initial shock when Covid struck in early 2020, stocks had a tremendous run last year as investors priced in the potential for strong earnings recovery. While we’re now seeing a lot of companies beat expectations, it isn’t enough to sustain momentum in the market. “Inflation concerns continue to trouble investors, with the UK among the countries reporting a growing cost of living. A key focal point for the market is whether economies are running too hot and what central banks might do to cool them down. Stocks in London have fallen sharply into the red this morning, following losses on Wall Street last night. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip share is down exactly 100 points, or 1.4%, at 6934 this morning, with almost every stock lower. Mining companies are being hit by concerns that inflationary pressures could force central banks to rein in some of their stimulus packages, as a rise in interest rates would hit demand for commodities. Anglo American, which produces iron ore, coal, nickel, copper and platinum, are down 4%, followed by copper producer Antofagasta (-3.8%). Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust, which owns stake in major tech companies, are down 3.4%, with the futures market suggesting America’s Nasdaq index will open lower. Engineering companies are also in the fallers, with Renishaw down 3% and Melrose off 2.5%. Hospitality companies are under pressure too, with Intercontinental Hotels down 3%, amid concerns that plans to ease lockdown restrictions could be upset by the latest Covid-19 variant. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says: Investors continue show signs of indecision as inflationary pressures, reopening uncertainty and toppy valuations just give them cause for a breather. UK manufacturers put up their prices in April, as rising commodity prices drove up their costs..... which could signal that inflation pressures are building. Factory gate prices (the cost of goods when leaving the factory) rose 3.9% in the 12 months to April 2021, up from 2.3% in March. Prices rose 0.4% during the month, which may filter through to consumers in the shops. Manufacturers were also hit by a surge in input prices, which jumped by 9.9% compared to April 2020. It was mainly due to rising prices for metals and minerals, and crude oil (which plunged to 18 year lows early in the pandemic but have since recovered). This indicates that inflationary pressures are building in supply chains; a global scramble to get hold of raw materials drove iron ore and copper prices to record levels earlier this month. Ellie Henderson of Investec says supply chain disruption is push up factory gate costs: Of course this is a sharp increase, but it is important to note that these numbers have been distorted by the pandemic-related low base of April last year. Even so this represents a persistent theme witnessed since the start of the year of supply chain disruptions placing upward pressure on producer prices. At the House of Lords economic affairs committee meeting yesterday, Bank of England Governor Bailey acknowledged this development, but was keen to reiterate that ‘we are not yet seeing strong evidence of the pass through into consumer prices’. Economist Julian Jessop also sees more inflation pressures building: Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, predicts that April’s burst of inflation will be temporary. She points outs out that most of April’s increase was due to energy price effects - the 13.6% jump in motor fuels, and the 9.2% increase in the gas and electricity price cap. There were pockets of inflation in those sectors that are reopening, with clothing inflation bouncing back from -3.5% to +0.5%, as retailers continued to reverse the aggressive discounting during lockdowns, and furniture inflation rising from 4.5% to 5.8%. And depending on the strength of pent-up demand for hospitality, there will probably be further surges in these categories over the coming months. But in April, these movements were partially offset by some of the pandemic-induced surges in inflation continuing to fade. Data processing equipment fell further from 5.9% in March to 0.2%. Meanwhile, second-hand car inflation dropped from 1.2% to 0.2%. So while inflation “looks set” to rise above the Bank of England’s 2% target later this year, Capital Economics doubt it will stay there long, as energy-related effects go into reverse next year, “reopening” inflation eases and the stronger pound pushes down on inflation. Food prices also rose last month - partly driven by increased prices for chocolate, and choc ices as people emerged from lockdown. The inflation report shows that confectionary prices, breads and cereals, and oils and fats all pushed food inflation up during April. The ONS explains that: Food prices rose by 0.9% between March and April 2021 but were little changed between the same two months in 2020. Prices for a variety of bread and cereal items rose this year but fell a year ago, resulting in an upward contribution of 0.04 percentage points. There was a similar upward contribution from across a range of sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery items, with standout movements coming from large bars of chocolate and chocolate covered ice-cream bars. Prices for these items rose between March and April 2021 but were being discounted between the same two months in 2020. Demand for icecream has also created a shortage of Cadbury 99 Flakes, due to an unexpected surge in demand for Mr Whippy-style 99 icecream cones. Laith Khalaf, financial analyst at AJ Bell, says: “Inflation has doubled, with price rises occurring in key areas where it’s hard for consumers to control spending, namely transport, clothing, and household energy. Those with a sweet tooth will also be perturbed to learn the price of chocolate bars and ice creams is on the up, particularly in a year when travel restrictions mean getting moderately beach fit is no longer a top priority. Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, says April’s jump in inflation is mainly due to prices rising this year, while they were falling a year ago in the first lockdown. Plus, the rise in crude oil has pushed motor fuels to the highest since January 2020, he adds. Core inflation, which strips out volatile components such as energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, rose by 1.3% in April, up from 1.1%. Geoff Tily, senior economist at the TUC, says this shows inflation isn’t a danger - the real risk is that policymakers fail to provide enough economic support to drive the recovery. Clothing and footwear prices rose by 2.4% in April, the month when retailers reopened their doors as restrictions on non-essential shops were eased. That follows a 1.6% rise in March, after prices fell in February during the lockdown. Hannah Audino, economist at PwC, says: “After 12 months of subdued inflation, the Consumer Price Index rose by 1.5% in the year to April, doubling from 0.7% in March. The annual rise in inflation largely reflects an increase in prices from their low levels a year ago at the start of the pandemic. “April’s increase in consumer prices was driven by higher household energy bills, due to Ofgem’s increase in the price cap, and the price of motor fuels. After months of discounting, the price of clothing and footwear also rose reflecting the easing of restrictions. Motor fuel prices jumped by 13.6% in April compared to a year ago -- which is the largest annual increase since March 2017. The ONS explains: Between March and April 2021, petrol prices rose by 1.8 pence per litre, to stand at 125.5 pence per litre, and diesel prices rose by 1.4 pence per litre, to stand at 129.5 pence per litre. In comparison, between March and April 2020, petrol and diesel prices stood at 109.0 and 116.0 pence per litre, respectively, having fallen by 10.4 and 7.8 pence per litre. Last April’s fall in petrol prices was the largest monthly fall since the current ultra-low sulphur or unleaded petrol series began in 1990. Gas bills rose by 9.4% in April, the ONS says, while electricity bills jumped by 9.1%. That’s due to energy regulator Ofgem lifting the price cap on standard tariffs back to pre-pandemic levels, following a rise in wholesale energy costs. As we wrote in February, this dismayed consumer groups who warned that many households already face mounting financial difficulties from the pandemic. This chart shows how the jump in regulated electricity and gas bills, clothing and footwear prices, and rising petrol prices, all pushed UK inflation up: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Inflation across the UK has risen to its highest level in over a year, more than doubling last month as higher petrol prices and gas and electricity bills pushed up the cost of living. The Consumer Prices index rose by 1.5% in the 12 months to April 2021, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show. That’s the highest reading since March 2020, and more than double the 0.7% recorded in March 2021. During April alone, prices rose by 0.6%. The jump in inflation was driven by rising household utility bills, with the cap on energy bills being lifted. Motor fuel prices also had an upward impact on the inflation rate, as the jump in crude prices fed through to the pumps. The ONS added that clothing had pushed up the inflation rate in April, saying: Price movements for household utilities, clothing, and motor fuels are the main reasons for the higher monthly rate this year than a year ago. Inflation worries have been weighing on the financial markets for weeks, as it could force central bankers to slow their bond-buying stimulus programmes or consider raising interest rates. The Bank of England’s target is for inflation to be around 2% in the medium term. Economists and investors expect inflation will keep rising in the next few months, as the economy emerges from lockdown. Jon Hudson, fund manager of Premier Miton UK Growth Fund, says: “Inflation is likely to continue rising throughout the year as lockdowns ease, the economy recovers and various commodity shortages feed through to rising prices. The recent strength of Sterling will act as a buffer for inflation as it reduces the cost of imports. European stock markets are set to fall at the open, after a late selloff on Wall Street last night. Kyle Rodda of IG says: The S&amp;P500 ended the session’s trade down by 0.85 per cent, in what was a fairly broad-based session of losses for the US stock market. Value sectors led the losses, with energy, financials and industrials at the bottom of the intraday market map. However, there was no clear rotation into value, and only a slight preference for defensiveness, with growth and the tech-sector also down, and only a small bid coming through for health-care and real estate stocks. Energy’s weakness came-in sympathy with a fresh drop in oil prices overnight. Crude fell after news hit the headlines that progress was being made between the US and Iran on a new nuclear deal. The sell-off was retraced after the Russians later came-out to throw cold water on the story. But the move illustrated a slight wariness in the market about any factor that could boost global oil supplies at this time – although there is debate about what impact, if any, Iran’s return to global energy markets would have on prices. Cryptocurrencies are sliding too, with bitcoin dropping below $40,000 to its lowest since February.

EDF Energy, the French company building the nuclear power station, likes to reel off dizzying numbers: 8,000 people have already worked there and at the peak there will be 50 tower cranes on site. The final pour of concrete for the base of the first of two reactors was the largest in the UK, beating the Shard in London – and the cake baked to celebrate that moment included more than 2,000 eggs and 2kg of jam. Ten miles inland, most residents in the nearest town, Bridgwater, are not bothered about this game of construction site Top Trumps. They would just like their town back. Many argue that the place is blighted by the noise of lorries carrying materials and equipment and coaches transporting workers. They say the influx of employees needing somewhere to stay – there are more than 2,000 workers in digs – has led to rising rents. The food bank is witnessing an increase in numbers of users that it puts down to soaring property prices. Some people say they are frightened to go into town at night because they worry there will be fights, and complain there has been an increase in the number of sex workers. “They told us Hinkley would be for the locals but they have brought in labour from all over and there has been no trickle-down effect,” said Matthew Brock, a building maintenance worker. Brock chatted as he worked on a house being converted into bedrooms for Hinkley workers. Though the project is giving him work, he remains sceptical. “I have’t heard anything positive about it.” In the 19th century, Bridgwater was a major centre for the manufacture of clay tiles and bricks and more recently it was the home of British Cellophane. Production of the wrapping notoriously gave the town an eggy smell, but also jobs, until the factory closed down in 2005. For more than half a century the area has been a base for nuclear energy. Work on Hinkley A power station began in 1957 and most locals have grown up with the idea of nuclear. But the construction of Hinkley Point C has brought misery for many residents. Spend a few minutes next to one of the traffic-choked roads in the town centre and it is easy to understand their frustration. A jetty is due to open in the autumn and a wharf is being improved that will allow more deliveries by sea, but until then EDF has permission for an average of 750 lorry movements a day – 375 in and 375 out. In the week ending 19 July, there were 550 a day. In addition to the lorries, there are 400 bus journeys a day through Bridgwater. EDF says it is a good thing that 94% of the workforce use the bus to get to work but locals are frustrated when they see buses that are empty or carrying just one or two workers, which is a common sight. Some local politicians and many residents pleaded for a bypass for construction traffic and workers. It would have cost about £100m, a fraction of the £20bn cost of the project, but EDF has adapted existing junctions. The leader of the Labour group on Sedgemoor district council, Brian Smedley, said: “EDF told us: ‘No, it’s too expensive. We can deal with the extra traffic by tweaking some of the junctions.” Local people say some journeys are taking double the time or more, and drivers are finding ever more ingenious rat runs. Father and daughter Malcolm and Sue Calladine say they almost lost their business, Bedrock Furniture, because of roadworks to accommodate Hinkley traffic. “I had to let all my employees go and we just went down to my dad and I,” said Sue. “There’s no compensation for us. Their attitude was ‘Bugger everyone else.’ They knew it would impact heavily. They should have put a bypass in.” There are 4,300 workers on site at the moment. Half of them live within the town or at a commutable distance. That leaves 2,150 needing somewhere to stay. Two large campuses provide workers’ accommodation, one near the gates of the site on the coast (the Hinkley campus), the other in the town centre on the old Cellophane site (the Sedgemoor campus). They have a total of 1,500 beds, making the combined facility the second biggest hotel in the UK. The accommodation, which caters for men and women, is relatively cheap (£20-£25 a night) and spotlessly clean. There are canteens, bars, laundries, gyms and sports pitches. Some locals have dubbed the Sedgemoor campus Cell Block H because the pods squat behind wire fences, or “50 shades of grey” – reflecting their sombre colour (not what goes on in them – they are single occupancy only). But the campuses are by no means full. “You can find cheaper accommodation elsewhere,” said one scaffolder, who is staying in a converted nursing home. “And you have more freedom to come and go without being monitored.” It also suits owners of houses and other buildings in the town who are making good money out of Hinkley. What were family homes have been converted into homes of multiple occupancy (HMOs). HMOs are easy to spot – many have code keypads on the front door and a handwritten notice in the window advertising cheap rooms to rent. The lure of profit from the Hinkley workforce has led to buildings all over the town being converted into flats and HMOs, including a former tax office and the historic Mansion House Inn on the High Street. Mark Bevington, 33, who works at the bed shop, said he would like to move with his family to a larger house but cannot afford to. “I feel Hinkley is nothing but negative,” he said. House prices are rising sharply. According to the online property site Zoopla, the average price for property in Bridgwater stood at £236,055 in July 2019, a rise of almost 3% in just three months. Property prices have risen 25% in five years. Phil Jarman, who runs the food bank, is a fan of Hinkley Point but said he was seeing an increase in the number of clients. “Landlords are putting rents up and the situation is either pay the rent or the food. Hinkley Point is wonderful. We lost British Cellophane so Hinkley C was fantastic news. But the downside is this increase in rents because of the influx of people into the town. It’s driving people into the food bank.” EDF says there is no evidence that it is driving up rents and points out that its lorries make up only a small fraction of the total traffic. Still, Bridgwater people reel off Hinkley complaints – from struggling to get a doctor’s appointment to the notion that the project may lead to an increase in marriage breakdowns if local people run off with incomers. One of the most common complaints is that the town has become a no-go area at night because of fights and antisocial behaviour. The statistics do not bear this out. Construction began in the second half of 2016. In May 2016 in Bridgwater town centre, there were 32 antisocial behaviour crimes. In April 2017, that rose to 110 then dropped back to 38 in April 2018. It was at 58 in April 2019. Public order offences were steady over the same period and drugs offences up slightly. Kady Finka, a mother of four who works at the Sedgemoor campus, laughs at the notion the place has become dangerous. “That’s nonsense,” she said. People often ask her if she is frightened of the male guests. “But they are mainly family men just here to work. It’s prestigious to work on a nuclear site. They don’t want to mess that up.” Finka and some of her neighbours from the Sydenham estate are doing well out of Hinkley Point. She is one of 85 people from the estate, which is opposite the Sedgemoor campus and one of the most deprived in Somerset, who work for Host, the company that runs the campuses. They make up a quarter of the Host workforce over the two campuses. “When Hinkley Point C came along people said we would be inundated and there would be nothing for the local people. I believe the impact has been positive.” She says a 22-year-old who lives opposite her has managed to get on the property ladder because of Hinkley wages; a friend got a job there driving a van, then a truck and has now been trained to pilot a crane. EDF points out that people are learning skills from fixing steel to welding, from hospitality to hi-tech engineering. Alcohol and drug testing at Hinkley Point is stringent. “We just don’t take the risk,” said one worker. “It isn’t worth it. We’re on good money. Go in pissed or on drugs and you’re out. Simple as that.” EDF funds a four-strong “Hinkley Point police beat team” – a sergeant, two constables and a community support officer. EDF has also provided money for a street pastors’ scheme. “The workforce is not causing a spike in any activity we should worry about,” said Andrew Goodchild, Hinkley Point’s lead planner. There are signs of prosperity in Bridgwater. The new Mercure hotel is a glitzy addition, featuring a Marco Pierre White steakhouse bar and grill. Some businesses have boomed, including barber shops. EDF says it has made £100m available for transport schemes, to fund the police officers and to help tourism. EDF cash has also been used to boost sports and leisure facilities and community spaces. But many fear the town will suffer the same fate as US gold rush towns – a few good years followed by abandonment. The worry is that the local people being squeezed out will not return."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/mar/05/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-nato-gives-green-light-to-bombing-with-lack-of-no-fly-zone-says-zelenskiy","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-06T05:07:17Z","webTitle":"The International Monetary Fund announced it could approve $1.4b emergency funding – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/05/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-nato-gives-green-light-to-bombing-with-lack-of-no-fly-zone-says-zelenskiy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/mar/05/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-nato-gives-green-light-to-bombing-with-lack-of-no-fly-zone-says-zelenskiy","fields":{"headline":"The International Monetary Fund announced it could approve $1.4b emergency funding – as it happened","bodyText":"Thank you for following our Ukraine liveblog. We have launched a new blog here where you can stay abreast of all the latest developments. Russia’s war on its neighbour continues for its tenth day and well into its second week. It is 7am in Ukraine and here is where the situation currently stands: US president Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to discuss ongoing efforts to impose sanctions on Russia and speed up US military, humanitarian and economic assistance. The White House said during the call the pair also discussed talks between Russia and Ukraine, but offered no additional details. Britain’s prime minister Boris Johnson issued a six-point plan in reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and is urging other leaders to endorse it in efforts to ensure Russia fails in its apparent attempt to take over its democratic neighbour. Zelenskiy also said he spoke to SpaceX and Tesla boss Elon Musk, announcing the country will receive more of its Starlink satellite internet terminals this coming week. US-based credit card giants Visa and Mastercard announced they will suspend their Russian business operations. The Ukrainian military said Russian forces continue to focus on Kyiv while moving ahead with assaults on Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and the creation of a land corridor with Crimea, in its latest operational report. The report said aircraft from airports in Belarusian territory were involved in air strikes on military and civilian infrastructure in Kyiv and Zhytomyr. US-based think tank and policy research organisation, the Institute for the Study of War, released a report saying Russian forces in Ukraine may have entered a possibly brief operational pause as they prepare to resume operations against Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mykolayiv, and possibly Odesa in the next 24-48 hours. The relief effort to distribute humanitarian aid to Ukraine has stepped up as volunteers across the country work tirelessly to gather basic necessities to give to refugees and prepare food supplies for the army to be sent to the frontline. The humanitarian situation in the southern Ukrainian port of Mariupol is “catastrophic” and it is vital that civilians be evacuated, a senior official from the NGO Doctors Without Borders warned. The International Monetary Fund announced it could approve $1.4 billion emergency funding as early as next week as the body warns of war’s “severe impact” on the global economy. Western sanctions on Russia are a stumbling block to revived Iran nuclear deal, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba met with US secretary of state Antony Blinken, saying Ukraine “will win this war” but needs more help from Nato. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dymtro Kuleba, appealed for more military assistance while Reuters reports Zelenskiy made a “desperate plea” for eastern Europe to provide Russian-made aircraft to Ukraine. In a call with US senators, he is also understood to have called for a no-fly zone, lethal aid, a ban on Russian oil and a suspension of Visa and Mastercard in Russia. The US is reportedly in discussions with Poland on the possibility of Poland providing more fighter jets to Ukraine with the US potentially agreeing to backfill Poland’s fleet of fighter planes if Warsaw decides to transfer its used MiG-29s to Ukraine, four US officials told POLITICO. Russia and Ukraine plan another round of talks on Monday, even though previous talks that produced an agreement to a limited ceasefire in order to protect corridors for civilian have not been honoured by Russia. The United Nations recorded 351 civilians killed and 707 injured in Ukraine, according to the UN high commissioner for human rights. Tens of thousands joined rallies around the world in support of Ukraine over the weekend, gathering in cities across Europe, the US and South America to demand an end to Russia’s invasion. For any tips and feedback please contact me through Twitter or at samantha.lock@theguardian.com A Royal Australian Air Force C-17A Globemaster delivered critical military equipment and medical supplies to Ukraine, recently released images from the Australian defence force reveal. The delivery follows Australian prime minister Scott Morrison’s announcement that the country will provide defensive military assistance. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy recently spoke to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, inviting him to visit after the war. Zelenskiy shared a video of the call on social media shortly after Ukraine announced it would receive more Starlink satellite internet terminals for destroyed cities from the company next week. “So if you have time - after the war - you’re very welcome. I invite you,” Zelenskiy says. “Sounds good. I look forward to visiting,” Musk replies. Watch video of the call below. Tens of thousands of people demonstrated in cities including Santiago, Vancouver Paris and New York in support of Ukraine on Saturday, demanding an end to Russia’s invasion. About 41,600 people demonstrated in 119 protests in towns and cities across France, according to interior ministry estimates. In Paris itself, 16,000 gathered at Place de la Bastille. One rally in Zurich saw 40,000 people take part, Switzerland’s ATS news agency reported. Hundreds also turned out in London, including Ukrainians whose families were forced to flee Russian bombs. In the centre of Rome, unions and organisations rallied in a large “procession of peace”, demonstrating against Putin but also Nato. More than a thousand people also demonstrated in the Croatian capital Zagreb with banners saying: Stop the War, Save Europe and Glory to Ukraine. Across the Atlantic Ocean, several thousand people gathered in New York’s Times Square. They carried sunflowers, Ukraine’s national flower, and signs calling to, Stop Russian terrorism. Hundreds also gathered outside the White House in Washington to demand a Nato no-fly zone and military assistance for Ukraine. In Santiago, Chile, an anti-war protest broke out in front of the Russian embassy, while members of the Ukrainian community demonstrated in front of the Russian embassy in Colombia in the capital Bogotá. The relief effort to distribute humanitarian aid to Ukraine has stepped up in recent days. Volunteers across the country have worked tirelessly to gather basic necessities to give to refugees and prepare food supplies for the army to be sent to the frontline. Thousands of Ukrainian refugees continue to flee their homeland seeking safety in neighbouring countries. More than 1.3 million Ukrainians have crossed borders since the Russian invasion started on the 24 February in what the United Nations is now calling Europe’s fastest-moving refugee crisis since the end of the second world war. Figures released today by the United Nation’s Refugee Agency (UNHCR) show that to date 1.37 million people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring European countries after the military offensive ordered by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. “This is the fastest-moving refugee crisis we have seen in Europe since the end of the second world war,” UNHCR head Filippo Grandi said. Russian forces in Ukraine may have entered a possibly brief operational pause as they prepare to resume operations against Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mykolayiv, and possibly Odesa in the next 24-48 hours, according to a US-based think tank and policy research organisation. A recently published report by the Institute for the Study of War, claims: Russian troops did not launch major ground offensive operations against Kyiv, Kharkiv, or Mykolayiv in the last 24 hours Ukrainian forces near Kharkiv, on the other hand, conducted a counter-offensive that reportedly penetrated to the Ukrainian-Russian border.” The institute adds that Russian troops continued to encircle, bomb, and shell Mariupol while Russian forces east of Kharkiv and in northern Luhansk Oblast appear to be trying to link up. “Russian troops around Kherson city are likely preparing to resume offensive operations against Mykolayiv and ultimately Odesa and Russian naval infantry in Crimea continue to prepare for amphibious operations, which would most likely occur near Odesa,” the assessment adds. Ukrainians have taken their resistance online through increasingly creative means in an effort to inform Russians of the destruction inflicted upon their country. In light of Russia blocking multiple social media channels and independent media, one way that Ukrainians are trying to reach the Russian people is through writing unique Google reviews of popular Russian cafes and restaurants. “Ivan, 27, now spends his time writing Google reviews for Russian cafes and restaurants. But they are no ordinary reviews,” Anastasiia Lapatina, a Ukrainian journalist and reporter for the Kyiv Independent, writes for the New York Times. “Russian troops have been bombing Kyiv and its peaceful residents for 4 days,” one review reads. “Go out in the streets — stop the deaths of children.” “By flooding places where Russians are congregating online, Ivan and the hundreds of others writing similar messages hope to spread the truth of the Kremlin’s atrocities,” Lapatina says. The US is in discussions with Poland on the possibility of Poland providing more fighter jets to Ukraine with the US potentially agreeing to backfill Poland’s fleet of fighter planes if Warsaw decides to transfer its used MiG-29s to Ukraine, four US officials told POLITICO. As part of the conversations with Poland, the US is determining what “capabilities we could provide to backfill Poland if it decided to transfer planes to Ukraine,” a White House spokesperson said, decline to give any detail surrounding what backfill options are under consideration. Last week, Poland weighed the possibility of sending its warplanes to Ukraine, with Warsaw asking the White House if the Biden administration could guarantee it would provide them with US-made fighter jets to fill the gap. The White House said it would look into the matter. The Biden administration didn’t oppose the Polish government giving Kyiv the MiGs, which could potentially escalate tensions between Nato and Moscow. Poland, for now, has held on to its fighter jets. “We are working with the Poles on this issue and consulting with the rest of our Nato allies,” a White House spokesperson told POLITICO. “We are also working on the capabilities we could provide to backfill Poland if it decided to transfer planes to Ukraine.” The move comes amid a frantic push to find weapons to equip Ukrainian forces as they continue to fight off the massive Russian invasion. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has hailed advances made by Kyiv’s forces against Russia, asserting that “Ukraine is bleeding, but it has not fallen and stands with both feet on the ground.” Kuleba reiterated his demand for Moscow to withdraw its forces from Ukrainian territory. Watch the video of his address below. From New York to Paris and Santiago, Chile, thousands gathered in cities across the world this weekend to protest against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, calling upon their governments to take more action. Hundreds of people gathered outside the White House in Washington to demand a Nato no-fly zone and military assistance for Ukraine while demonstrators took part in a protest at Place de la Bastille in Paris on Saturday. In Santiago, Chile, an anti-war protest broke out in front of the Russian embassy while a crowd of thousands showed their support for Ukraine in front of the Vancouver Art Gallery. The Ukrainian military has just released its daily operational report, noting Russian forces continue to focus on Kyiv while moving ahead with assaults on Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and the creation of a land corridor with Crimea. According to the report, published by Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces at 2am local time, aircraft from airports in Belarusian territory were involved in air strikes on military and civilian infrastructure in Kyiv and Zhytomyr. Citing internal intelligence information, the military added that Russian forces intend to seize the Kaniv hydroelectric power plant on the Dnieper River in Kaniv, Ukraine while the regrouping of Russian troops continues. Russian troops continue to “block the city of Mariupol, carry out artillery shelling of civil infrastructure” and Mykolaiv suffered “significant losses” the report reads. Another four Russian helicopters, five planes and one UAV were shot down, the Ukrainian military added. US President Joe Biden has again spoken with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Saturday in call that lasted for about 30 minutes, the White House has said. According to a White House readout of the call, Biden “highlighted the ongoing actions undertaken by the United States, its Allies and partners, and private industry to raise the costs on Russia for its aggression in Ukraine.” A statement reads: In particular, he welcomed the decision this evening by Visa and Mastercard to suspend service in Russia. President Biden noted his administration is surging security, humanitarian, and economic assistance to Ukraine and is working closely with Congress to secure additional funding.” Zelenskiy confirmed the call, writing over Twitter early this morning: As part of the constant dialogue, I had another conversation with @POTUS. The agenda included the issues of security, financial support for Ukraine and the continuation of sanctions against Russia.” In case you missed this brilliant piece from the Guardian’s diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour, we explain how the phone has become the Ukrainian president’s most effective weapon. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he has spoken to SpaceX and Tesla boss Elon Musk, announcing the country will receive more of its Starlink satellite internet terminals this coming week. In a post to Twitter early this morning, Zelenskiy confirmed he spoke with Musk, saying: “I’m grateful to him for supporting Ukraine with words and deeds. Next week we will receive another batch of Starlink systems for destroyed cities. Discussed possible space projects. But I’ll talk about this after the war.” Starlink provides high-speed internet from space with satellites flying in low Earth orbit. Musk said on Thursday that the service was the only non-Russian communications system still working in some parts of Ukraine. Hello I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold. It is 2am in Ukraine as Russia’s war continues for its second week. Here is where the crisis currently stands: Britain’s Boris Johnson has issued a six-point plan in reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and is urging other leaders to endorse it in efforts to ensure Russia fails in its apparent attempt to take over its democratic neighbour. US-based credit card giants Visa and Mastercard have both just announced they will sanction Russia by suspending their Russian business operations. The humanitarian situation in the southern Ukrainian port of Mariupol is “catastrophic” and it is vital that civilians be evacuated, a senior official from the NGO Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières MSF) has warned. Western sanctions on Russia are a stumbling block to revived Iran nuclear deal, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba met with US secretary of state Antony Blinken, saying Ukraine ‘will win this war’ but needs more help from Nato. Kuleba earlier demanded a new round of sanctions on Russia, reports Reuters. The International Monetary Fund has announced it could approve $1.4 billion emergency funding as early as next week as the body warns of war’s ‘severe impact’ on the global economy. The United Nations recorded 351 civilians killed and 707 injured in Ukraine, according to the UN high commissioner for human rights. Russia and Ukraine plan another round of talks on Monday, even though previous talks that produced an agreement to a limited ceasefire in order to protect corridors for civilian have not been honoured by Russia. The US government has warned American citizens living or travelling in Russia to “depart immediately”, in new guidelines, published today, by the US state department. Volodymyr Zelenskiy reportedly made a “desperate plea” for eastern Europe to provide Russian-made aircraft to Ukraine. In a call with US senators, he is also understood to have called for a no-fly zone, lethal aid, a ban on Russian oil and a suspension of Visa and Mastercard in Russia. For any tips and feedback please contact me through Twitter or at samantha.lock@theguardian.com The White House has just put out a statement condemning Russian government stifling of media freedom in reporting “Putin’s unconscionable war” and the Kremlin’s new law promising jail for those spreading information it deems false about the invasion of Ukraine. It was issued by US National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne about Russian president Vladimir “Putin’s war of choice in Ukraine”. It says in part: “The Russian government’s efforts to propagate lies and obscure the truth have been rejected by the international community: governments, the private sector, and civil society have taken independent action in an unprecedented manner to reject efforts to sell Putin’s war as justified. “With our partners, we will continue to condemn Russia’s shuttering [ie closing down] of independent media and technology platforms that refuse to allow Putin to run his disinformation campaigns unchecked. “To hide the truth from its own citizens, Russia’s censorship agency has shuttered independent Russian media outlets, blocked social media, and restricted access in Russia to international news outlets. We condemn the move by the Russian Federation Council to approve a law threatening prison sentences of up to 15 years for journalists and ordinary citizens that would spread so-called “false” information about Putin’s unconscionable war in Ukraine. “We urge continued action across all sectors of society to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms online and offline. This includes disinformation that seeks to divide the global community and conceal the Kremlin’s responsibility for this crisis. The United States firmly believes that the best way to accomplish this goal is to hold accountable the propaganda media and disinformation proxies that disseminate Putin’s lies. Through their principled actions, like-minded governments, private companies, and non-governmental organizations are demonstrating leadership in this moment.” The Guardian’s award-winning Today in Focus news podcast had a tremendous episode on Thursday called “What Russians are being told about the war in Ukraine”, which is worth a listen in case you missed it, you can reach it here. US-based credit card giants Visa and Mastercard have both just announced they will sanction Russia by suspending their Russian business operations. Visa Inc, based in California, issued a statement that said: “Visa will work with its clients and partners within Russia to cease all Visa transactions over the coming days. Once complete, all transactions initiated with Visa cards issued in Russia will no longer work outside the country and any Visa cards issued by financial institutions outside of Russia will no longer work within the Russian Federation.” “We are compelled to act following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed,” said Al Kelly, chairman and chief executive officer of Visa Inc. “We regret the impact this will have on our valued colleagues, and on the clients, partners, merchants and cardholders we serve in Russia. This war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values.” Moments prior, Mastercard Inc, based in New York, issued a statement. It began: “For more than a week, the world has watched the shocking and devastating events resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Our colleagues, our customers and our partners have been affected in ways that most of us could not imagine.” The company went on to say: “We have decided to suspend our network services in Russia. This decision flows from our recent action to block multiple financial institutions from the Mastercard payment network, as required by regulators globally. With this action, cards issued by Russian banks will no longer be supported by the Mastercard network. And, any Mastercard issued outside of the country will not work at Russian merchants or ATMs [cash point machines].” It added: “We don’t take this decision lightly. Mastercard has operated in Russia for more than 25 years.” CNN’s chief White House corr, Kaitlan Collins and others noted that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had urged the companies to take this action when he talked by video to American members of Congress earlier today. It’s a significant move. It looks as though the situation will be different for those using Visa or Mastercard cards within Russia that were issued by Russian banks, though facts and the implications coming out of Russia may take a bit longer to become clear. The Reuters news agency noted that the Tass Russian news agency had reported that Sberbank Rossii PAO, Russia’s largest lender, said sanctions announced by Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc would not affect users of the cards it issues in Russia when used inside Russia. Britain’s Boris Johnson has issued a six-point plan in reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and is urging other leaders to endorse it in efforts to ensure Russia fails in its apparent attempt to take over its democratic neighbour. The British prime minister’s proposal does not involve western allies engaging in military action with Russia. It was released by Downing Street today. Johnson is meeting with leaders from Canada and a variety of European countries in London in a series of talks beginning on Monday and he reiterated a point made in the House of Commons last month that Russia must “be seen to fail” in its mission of aggression towards Ukraine. His new six-point response includes the objective of inflicting maximum economic pain on Moscow. “It is not enough to express our support for the rules-based international order - we must defend it against a sustained attempt to rewrite the rules by military force,” Johnson said in a statement. The plan includes an international humanitarian coalition to help Ukraine’s civilians, support for the country’s self-defence capabilities and greater economic pressure being brought to bear on Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. Johnson will seek to rally the international community to make a “renewed and concerted effort” to end Moscow’s devastating war, and launch a six-point plan of action that he will detail tomorrow (Sunday), the Agence France-Presse reported. “In the days since Russia invaded Ukraine we have seen an unprecedented wave of international condemnation from across the globe,” Downing Street said. “Nations across the globe have imposed the largest ever package of sanctions against a major economy.” “Putin must fail and must be seen to fail in this act of aggression,” Johnson is to say. Reuters adds: Johnson also called for diplomatic paths for de-escalation with the full involvement of Ukraine’s government, stronger security in the European-Atlantic area, and an end to the “creeping normalisation” of Russian activities in Ukraine. After meeting the prime ministers of Canada and the Netherlands on Monday, Johnson is due to host leaders from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia - countries experiencing an influx of refugees caused by the invasion - on Tuesday. Britain is planning to move more quickly to sanction Russian businessmen through new legal measures which will be sent to parliament on Monday. Canada told its citizens on today to leave Russia “while commercial means are still available,” saying security conditions were unpredictable and could deteriorate without notice. “Flight availability is becoming extremely limited ... The ability of our embassy to provide consular services in Russia may become severely limited,” Canada’s foreign ministry said in a travel advisory. Canada has imposed sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau will be heading to eastern Europe next week. The humanitarian situation in the southern Ukrainian port of Mariupol is “catastrophic” and it is vital that civilians be evacuated, a senior official from the NGO Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières MSF) has warned. The city has been under siege by Russian forces and is near the border with its larger aggressor, in the south-eastern part of Ukraine. A supposed ceasefire agreement there to allow civilians to be evacuated safely never really came to fruition. “It is imperative that this humanitarian corridor, which could have been created today but which has not really been put in place following non-respect of the ceasefire, is put in place very quickly to allow the civilian population, women and children, to get out of this city... the situation is catastrophic and getting worse day by day,” MSF’s emergency coordinator in Ukraine, Laurent Ligozat, told Agence France-Presse (AFP). The agency further reports: The strategic city and Azoz sea port is considered a key one for Russia to capture. “Today there is no more water; people have huge problems accessing drinking water and this is becoming a crucial issue,” said Ligozat. “There is no more electricity, there is no heating. Food is running out, shops are empty. “For several days quite simply, there has been nothing coming in or going out of the city.” Russia’s defence ministry earlier declared the ceasefire, to open a humanitarian corridor to allow the city’s 450,000-strong population to begin to leave by bus and private cars. However, Ukrainian officials then called a delay in the evacuation, saying the Russian side had continued to shell the city and its environs. Russia later announced “offensive actions” had resumed, each side blaming the other for the failure of the ceasefire. John Bolton, former US national security adviser under Donald Trump and, previously, anti-United Nations US ambassador to...the United Nations, speculates in an interview that Vladimir Putin was waiting before invading Ukraine for Trump to win a second term in the White House and pull the US out of NATO. That didn’t happen so now he’s invaded anyway - though he waited more than a year (did he think, like fanatical Trumpists, that Trump was going to overturn the election result and return to the White House...?). So it seems outlandish. But worth noting in passing... Dramatic images have emerged of people trying to flee the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, crossing over the Irpin River, where Russian bombardment has damaged the infrastructure. More of the pictures taken by Emilio Morenatti of the Associated Press are worth noting here. Extraordinary. Here he is with this image. More Struggling through mud in the cold with the bare minimum of possessions. Agonising scenes have unfolded once again at a hospital in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, as medics fought in vain to save an 18-month-old boy, a young victim of Russian attacks on the city, and not the first child victim in this city. Authorities in the city have said an evacuation of civilians has been postponed because Russian forces encircling the place were not respecting an agreed ceasefire. In a statement, the city council asked residents to return to shelters in the city and await further information on evacuation. As the AP reports, yesterday a young man dashed into a hospital in Mariupol with a desperately wounded toddler in his arms, the child’s mother on his heels. Doctors are forced to use smartphone torches to examine patients’ wounds. They raced to save the boy, but were not able to. Distraught staff sank to the floor and tried to recover themselves somewhat before the next emergency arrived. Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett met Russian president Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin earlier today to discuss the war in Ukraine and later spoke by phone with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Bennett’s spokesperson said. Bennett is coordinating his efforts in the crisis with the United States, France and Germany, an Israeli official said. After his meeting with Putin, Bennett headed to Berlin for talks with German chancellor Olaf Scholz, his spokesperson said and Reuters reported. French president Emmanuel Macron had spoken to Bennett before he flew to Moscow to brief him on his own conversations with Putin, the Elysée Palace said. Israel, at the behest of Zelenskiy, has offered to mediate in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, though officials have previously played down expectations of any breakthrough. In their three-hour meeting in the Kremlin, the Israeli official said, Bennett also raised with Putin the issue of the large Jewish community caught up in the war in Ukraine. Israel will send medical teams to Ukraine next week to set up a field hospital that will provide treatment for refugees, its Health Ministry said. While Israel, a close ally of the United States, has condemned the Russian invasion, voiced solidarity with Kyiv and sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine, it has said it will maintain contact with Moscow in the hope of helping to ease the crisis. Israel, home to a substantial population of immigrants from the former Soviet Union, is also mindful of Moscow’s military support for president Bashar al-Assad in next-door Syria, where Israel regularly attacks Iranian and Hezbollah military targets. Communication with Moscow prevents Russian and Israeli forces from accidentally trading fire. Bennett and Putin also discussed the ongoing talks between world powers, including Russia and Iran, about reviving a 2015 nuclear deal. Russia said on Saturday that western sanctions imposed on it over its invasion of Ukraine had become a stumbling block for the Iran nuclear deal. Israel opposes any revival of the deal. Bennett, a religious Jew, flew to Moscow in violation of Sabbath law because Judaism permits this when the aim is to preserve human life, his spokesperson said. He was accompanied by his Ukrainian-born housing minister, Zeev Elkin. Elkin had in the past accompanied former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an interpreter in his talks with Putin. Talks between Tehran and global powers to revive the tattered 2015 nuclear deal - to avoid Iran becoming a nuclear military power - have run into difficulty with a new demand from Russia for written American guarantees that sanctions on Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine would not harm Russian cooperation with Iran. There had been progress at talks in the Austrian capital of Vienna but Russia’s demand is “not constructive”, a senior Iranian official said today. The Reuters news agency reports: The announcement by Russia, which could torpedo months of indirect talks between Tehran and Washington in Vienna, came shortly after Tehran said it had agreed a roadmap with the United Nations nuclear watchdog to resolve outstanding issues that could help secure the nuclear pact. “Russians had put this demand on the table (at the Vienna talks) since two days ago. There is an understanding that by changing its position in Vienna talks Russia wants to secure its interests in other places. This move is not constructive for Vienna nuclear talks,” said the Iranian official in Tehran, speaking to Reuters. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Saturday that the Western sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine had become a stumbling block for the Iran nuclear deal, warning Russian national interests would have to be taken into account. Lavrov said Russia wanted a written guarantee from the United States that Russia’s trade, investment and military-technical cooperation with Iran would not be hindered in any way by the sanctions. When asked whether Russia’s demand would harm 11 months of talks between Tehran and world powers, including Russia, Iran Project Director at the International Crisis Group, Ali Vaez, said: “Not yet. But it’s impossible to segregate the two crises for much longer.” Two diplomats, one of them not directly involved in the talks, said China also has demanded written guarantees that its companies doing business in Iran wouldn’t be affected by US sanctions. Such demands may complicate efforts to seal a nuclear deal at a time when an agreement looked likely. All parties involved in the Vienna talks had said on Friday they were close to reaching an agreement. The 2015 agreement between Tehran and major powers eased sanctions on Tehran in return for limiting Iran’s enrichment of uranium, making it harder for Tehran to develop material for nuclear weapons. The accord fell apart after President Donald Trump withdrew the United States in 2018. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, urged US lawmakers to help provide aircraft to defend the country against the Russian invasion, during a video meeting with members of Congress earlier today. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic senator from New York and US Senate majority leader, said Zelenskiy “made a desperate plea” for the military aid, which would include planes, drones and anti-aircraft missiles. The Ukrainian president praised sanctions placed upon Russia during the meeting but pressed US lawmakers to go further by banning oil imports from Moscow. “These planes are very much needed,” Schumer said in a statement following the gathering of more than 280 senators and House of Representative members. “And I will do all I can to help the administration to facilitate their transfer.” On Friday, Zelenskiy criticised Nato for not imposing a no-fly zone above Ukraine. “All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you,” he warned in a speech. Nato has said sending jets to shoot down Russian planes would risk a severe escalation in the conflict. Zelenskiy made a ‘desperate plea’ for military aid to more than 280 senators and representatives as Congress works on a $10bn package. On Friday, Zelenskiy criticized Nato for not imposing a no-fly zone above Ukraine. “All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you,” he warned in a speech. Nato has said sending jets to shoot down Russian planes would risk a severe escalation in the conflict. Russian-made fighter jets familiar to Ukrainian pilots may be sent to the beleaguered country, however, possibly via US allies in Europe. Congress is working on a bipartisan $10bn package of humanitarian and security aid that could facilitate this. Republican senators, including Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham, tweeted their support for Zelenskiy and further measures against Russia following the meeting. Rick Scott, another Republican, said the US should target Russia and Belarus by taking “every action to destroy their economies”. In Ukraine, Russian forces are attempting to shell and encircle the cities of Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv and Sumy, with numerous reports of civilian areas being hit. Odesa, Ukraine’s largest port city, is under repeated attack from Russian ships, according to Ukrainian officials. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, has refused to call off the invasion in face of sanctions that are withering the Russian economy, instead moving to shut down Facebook and Twitter access in the country in an attempt to quell internal dissent. Putin also warned against any Nato-imposed no-fly zone. “That very second, we will view them as participants of the military conflict, and it would not matter what members they are,” he said. The United Nations has warned of a growing humanitarian crisis within Ukraine, with the UN’s World Food Programme saying that millions of people require food aid “immediately”. An estimated 1.4 million people have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries. Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, was in the city of Rzeszow in Poland earlier today, just prior to meeting the Ukrainian foreign minister at the border between Ukraine and Poland. Blinken took part in talks with Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki and foreign minister Zbigniew Rau a day after attending a Nato foreign ministers’ meeting in Brussels. The Associated Press reports: The Nato alliance pledged to step up support for eastern flank members such as Poland to counter the Russian invasion of Ukraine last month. Poland is seeking more US forces on its territory, where there are currently more than 10,000 American troops. Rau said Poland had already taken in more than 700,000 refugees from Ukraine and that he expected hundreds of thousands more in the coming weeks unless Russia backs down. “Poland will never recognise territorial changes brought about by unprovoked, unlawful aggression,” he said, adding that his country will demand that alleged Russian war crimes committed in Ukraine will be prosecuted. Morawiecki and Blinken discussed stepping up sanctions and freezes of assets on Russia, which Morawiecki said should be “crushing” for Russia’s economy. No Russian banks should be exempted from the exclusions from the SWIFT (international bank communications) system, he said. Currently, all but the largest Russian banks have been kicked off the financial messaging service. In addition to talks with his Ukrainian diplomatic counterpart in Poland earlier today, US secretary of state Antony Blinken visited a welcome centre for refugees, set up by Polish authorities in what once was a shopping mall in Korczowa, close to the border with Ukraine, where roughly 3,000 people fleeing the war are taking shelter after the Russian invasion of their homeland. The Associated Press reported: At the refugee centre, America’s top diplomat heard harrowing tales from mothers and their children who described long and perilous journeys and the shock of the sudden disruption and the fear for their lives after fleeing the devastation of the war. “Near our home we heard bombs,” said Venera Ahmadi, 12, who said she came with her brother and sister, six dogs and seven cats from Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, more than 600 kilometers (372 miles) away. “We walked to the border, I don’t know how many hours. We crossed the border on foot.” Her 16-year-old sister, Jasmine, said: “I was scared I would die.” Natalia Kadygrob, 48, reached the centre with her four adopted children from Kropyvnytskyi, almost 800 kilometers (about 500 miles) by bus on their way to her brother’s home in Germany. Her husband stayed behind. “There they bombed planes at the airport,” she said. “Of course we were afraid.” Tatyana, 58, who wouldn’t give her last name, came with her daughter, Anna, 37, and her 6- and 1-year-old daughters, Katya and Kira, from Kharkiv, about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) away. “They were shooting on the street,” Tatyana said. Anna said her home had been destroyed by a shell or a rocket. She was in the basement with her daughters when the explosion happened. “They should be in school,” Anna said. “They are children, they don’t understand.” Blinken then met with Kuleba on a visit to the Korczowa border crossing where Polish authorities escorted small groups of refugees about 20 at a time across the frontier from the Ukrainian town of Krakovets as sporadic snow flakes fell from a gray sky. Groups mainly of women, children and elderly men grimly rolling their possessions in luggage and carrying infants and the occasional family pet made their way into makeshift processing centres set up in tents on Polish territory. In further details on US secretary of state Antony Blinken and Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba’s meeting at the Ukraine-Poland border a little earlier, the American diplomat praised Kuleba and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s leadership as “inspired”. He said support for Ukraine and pressure on Russia to end the war would increase “until this war of choice is brought to an end,” the Associated Press noted. Kuleba thanked Blinken but was firm in urging the Nato alliance to fight directly alongside Ukraine, which the west has expressed determination not to do as it risks an all-Europe conflagration, not to say a possible world war. “We are now in the phase where maybe saying ‘No, we’re not going to do that’, but the time will come,” Kuleba said. As the two top diplomats stood side by side under grey skies with light snow, Kuleba added: “I hope the people of Ukraine will be able to see this as a clear manifestation that we have friends who literally stand by us.” Blinken said: “The entire world stands with Ukraine, just as I am standing here in Ukraine with my friend, my colleague.” Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba just met with US secretary of state Antony Blinken at the Ukraine-Poland border and America’s top diplomat briefly crossed over into Ukraine with his counterpart. The two met for 45 minutes under high security at a border crossing full of refugees fleeing Russia’s invasion, Agence France Press noted. They emerged to speak to the media briefly and make a powerful visual statement standing side by side. They also gave bullish remarks, although Kuleba’s was heavily-qualified, with warnings that his citizens would pay the price if the Nato allies did not impose a no-fly zone to keep Russia’s military out of Ukraine’s skies and if the world tired of imposing sanctions on Vladimir Putin and Russia. Kuleba said: “Ukraine will win this war anyway, because this is the people’s war for their land... The question is the price.” Blinken traveled to Europe earlier in the week and met leaders of the Nato military alliance and leaders of the European Council, the policy-making body of European Union, in Brussels yesterday, before traveling east to Poland. Standing outside on the Polish-Ukrainian border moments ago, Blinken said he believe that Ukraine is “going to prevail” in the face of Russia’s invasion late last month. But the United States, and Nato, have repeatedly said in the last 24 hours that they would not implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine because it would lead to the western allies having to shoot down Russian aircraft, bringing Nato members directly into conflict with Russia, which the alliance is adamant it will avoid. Standing next to Blinken, Kuleba said of that policy: “I think it’s a sign of weakness... It’s the people of Ukraine who will pay the price for the reluctance of Nato to act. AFP added: The top Ukraine diplomat expressed gratitude for global coordination in placing hefty sanctions on Russia in support of Ukraine. But he expressed concern that countries would grow weary of implementing those sanctions, especially as they also have an economic impact on the countries enforcing them. “If our partners continue to take bold systemic decisions to step up economic and political pressure... if they continue to provide us with necessary weapons, the price will be lower,” he said. However, he said: “If anyone in the world one day starts feeling sanctions fatigue, for example, then more people in Ukraine will be dying, suffering.” Hello to all those following the Guardian’s Ukraine crisis live blog, where our global teams are bringing you all the news developments around the clock, as they emerge. The blogging baton now passes across the Atlantic, from Miranda Bryant in London to Joanna Walters in New York. Stay tuned. Here’s where things stand this hour: Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has demanded a new round of sanctions on Russia, reports Reuters. He has been discussing the situation with US secretary of state Antony Blinken, who is in eastern Europe. The International Monetary Fund has announced it could approve $1.4 billion emergency funding as early as next week as the body warns of war’s ‘severe impact’ on the global economy. The United Nations recorded 351 civilians killed and 707 injured in Ukraine, according to the UN high commissioner for human rights, as reported by BuzzFeed. Russia and Ukraine plan another round of talks on Monday, even though previous talks that produced an agreement to a limited ceasefire in order to protect corridors for civilian have not been honoured by Russia. The US government has warned American citizens living or travelling in Russia to “depart immediately”, in new guidelines, published today, by the US state department. Volodymyr Zelenskiy reportedly made a “desperate plea” for eastern Europe to provide Russian-made aircraft to Ukraine. In a call with US senators, he is also understood to have called for a no-fly zone, lethal aid, a ban on Russian oil and a suspension of Visa and Mastercard in Russia. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has demanded a new round of sanctions on Russia, reports Reuters. He reportedly said he had a productive discussion with US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and that the steps they agreed will probably be implemented in the next few days. He also said that humanitarian corridors do not exist in Ukraine because Russia violated agreements. The luxury clothing band Prada has also suspended its retail operations in Russia, reports Reuters. “Our primary concern is for all colleagues and their families affected by the tragedy in Ukraine, and we will continue to support them,” it said in a statement. Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett’s Moscow meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin reportedly lasted around three hours. CNN’s Jerusalem correspondent, Hadas Gold, reports: Puma today became the latest company to suspend operations in Russia. The German sportswear brand, which has 100 stores in Russia, had already stopped deliveries to Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, reports Reuters. Hundreds have gathered in protests across the UK, including central London and Manchester, to protest against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and to stand in solidarity with Ukrainians. In central London, demonstrators gathered in Trafalgar Square, carrying placards staying “Stop Putin” and “No to War”, while singing the Ukrainian national anthem among other protest chants. The Central London demonstration began with a prayer led by Archbishop Claudio Gugerotti, the papal nuncio to Great Britain, who said: “Today we are all Ukrainians.” Speaking to the PA news agency, Volodymyr Shevetovskyy, 31, who attended the protest from Kyiv, said: “What Russians are doing is they’re bombing people from the sky and we are quite weak in that department, Russia’s military is much stronger there and we need the United States, Nato and the UK, the developed world, to step up and to close our skies.” In Manchester, crowds gathered in protest and solidarity at Piccadilly Gardens, at the ‘Manchester Stands with Ukraine” event, the protest having been organised by the Ukrainian Cultural Centre ‘Dnipro’ Manchester group. One of the organisers of the event, Bohdan Ratycz, told the Manchester Evening News: “Our hearts go out to our families - whether they will survive or not survive,” he said. “Ukraine will rise again. It has done it in the past, it will do it in the future.” The UK has said that Russia’s proposed ceasefire in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol was probably an attempt to deflect international condemnation while it reset its forces for another offensive, reports Reuters. “By accusing Ukraine of breaking the agreement, Russia is likely seeking to shift responsibility for current and future civilian casualties in the city,” the British defence ministry said in an intelligence update. Russia said earlier it had opened humanitarian corridors near the besieged cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha and, according to RIA news agency, Russia’s defence ministry accused Ukrainian “nationalists” of preventing civilians from leaving. But Mariupol’s city council said Russia was not observing the ceasefire. The International Monetary Fund has said it expects to bring Ukraine’s request for $1.4 billion in emergency financing to its board for approval as early as next week as it warned the war will have a “severe impact” on the global economy. The IMF also said it was in talks about funding options with authorities in neighbouring Moldova, reports Reuters. The global lender said in a statement that the war in Ukraine was already driving up energy and grain prices amid a growing refugee crisis and unprecedented sanctions on Russia. “While the situation remains highly fluid and the outlook is subject to extraordinary uncertainty, the economic consequences are already very serious,” the IMF said in a statement. “The ongoing war and associated sanctions will also have a severe impact on the global economy,” it said, warning that the crisis was impacting inflation and economic activity when pressures were already high. It said price shocks would be felt across the world and that authorities should provide financial support for poor households and that economic damage would increase if the war continued to escalate. Vladimir Putin is afraid of democracy, openness and progress and fears the world will “move on without him”, British opposition leader Keir Starmer said today in Glasgow. The Labour leader said the Russian president is “afraid of everything that we are most proud of” and his invasion of Ukraine is “an affront to the values of this country”, reports PA. Addressing the Scottish Labour conference in Glasgow, Starmer said the UK must target oligarchs and remove their money and influence from British politics. He said Ukrainian courage is “inspiring the world, just as the actions of Putin repel the world”. The west, he said, would have to “make sacrifices” to oppose the invasion. He said: The events we are witnessing right now will stay with us forever. These are dark days, peace in Europe has been threatened by an imperialist aggressor. Images I didn’t think I would see in my lifetime - Russian tanks rolling into a European country, soldiers kissing their children goodbye, as they stay to fight, and families fleeing for the border. He called for “the strongest sanctions” against Putin - including against oligarchs and their money in the UK. We know Putin’s playbook. He seeks division so we must meet him with unity. He believes the benefits of aggression outweigh the consequences so we must take a stand. And he believes the west is too corrupted to do the right thing, so we must prove him wrong. I believe we can. The UN recorded 351 civilians killed and 707 injured in Ukraine. Between 4am on 24 February and midnight on 4 March the Office of the UN high commissioner for human rights recorded a total of 1,058 civilian casualties in Ukraine, reports BuzzFeed News correspondent Christopher Miller. • This blogpost was amended on 6 March 2022 to correct the timeframe on which the UN casualty figures were based. Russia and Ukraine are to hold a third round of talks on Monday, reports Reuters. Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamiya said in a Facebook post that talks about ending hostilities would resume but did not provide further details. On Thursday, both sides agreed to open humanitarian corridors to allow civilians out of some combat zones. However there have been delays implementing them. Bryan Armen Graham reports for Guardian US: Brittney Griner, one of America’s most decorated women’s basketball players, has reportedly been detained by Russian Federal Customs Service authorities after the discovery of vape cartridges that contained hashish oil in her luggage at an airport near Moscow. The Customs Service confirmed “the detainee is a professional basketball player” who played in the Women’s National Basketball Association and won two Olympic gold medals with the United States in a statement issued on Saturday, but did not release the player’s name. Russia’s TASS news agency identified the player as Griner, a seven-time All-Star center with the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury who helped lead the United States to gold medals at the Rio and Tokyo Olympic Games, citing a law enforcement source. The US government has warned American citizens living or travelling in Russia to “depart immediately”. In new guidelines, published today, the US state department also warned that “some credit and debit cards may be declined” when purchasing flights due to sanctions, that cash is in short supply and that foreigners may face “potential harassment”, reports BuzzFeed News correspondent Christopher Miller. Axios reporter Barak Ravid says that Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett traveled to Moscow in secret: The Russian defence ministry has claimed that Russian forces have taken several towns and shot down four Ukrainian SU-27 jets in a wide offensive, reports Reuters, citing Interfax. The Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow today to discuss the Ukraine crisis, Reuters reports. Israel has previously offered to mediate in the conflict, but officials played down expectations of a breakthrough. Italian state broadcaster RAI today became the latest media operation to suspend its work in Russia “to protect the safety” of its reporters, reports Reuters. It comes after Moscow introduced a law threatening prison terms of up to 15 years for spreading “fake news”. German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF also today said they had suspended coverage from Moscow. They join a growing number of international media companies, including the BBC, the Canadian Broadcasting Company and Bloomberg News to suspend reporting in Russia. “This measure is necessary in order to protect the safety of journalists on the spot and (ensure) maximum freedom of information about the country,” RAI said in a statement. A spokesperson for WDR, a regional affiliate of ARD, said “ARD and ZDF are examining the consequences of the law passed on Friday and are suspending coverage from their Moscow studios for the time being”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, has rounded off an hour-long video call with United States senators in which he called for more support to defend his country from Russia’s invasion. All 100 US senators were invited to the Zoom call, with aides briefing reporters afterwards that Zelenskiy requested the delivery of more planes and drones. James Lankford, a Republican senator, tweeted afterwards that the Ukrainian president also wants “the world to stop buying Russian products (like oil and gas).” Zelenskiy made a “desperate plea” for eastern Europe to provide Russian-made aircraft to Ukraine during a call the call, according to the Senate’s majority leader, Chuck Schumer. “These planes are very much needed. And I will do all I can to help the administration to facilitate their transfer,” Schumer said in a statement, Reuters reported. Congressional leaders are working on a package worth around $10bn in economic and security assistance to Ukraine, with aides briefing that fighter jets may be sent to the conflict via a third country. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, tweeted that Nato should “immediately facilitate the transfer of fighter aircraft from Poland, Romania, and Slovakia to Ukraine.” Western leaders have so far rebuffed Zelenskiy’s request to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. But the senators expressed strong support for the country following the meeting. “I &amp; others reaffirmed US support for Ukraine &amp; discussed additional aid the US will send to our partners in their fight for freedom. All eyes are on Ukraine as it stands on the frontlines defending democracy,” tweeted Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, while Gary Peters, another Democrat, called Zelenskiy “a true inspiration.” Rick Scott, a Republican, called for stronger measures against both Russia and Belarus, tweeting that the US should take “EVERY action to destroy their economies.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy reportedly made a “desperate plea” for eastern Europe to provide Russian-made aircraft to Ukraine during a call with US senators. He is also understood to have called for a no-fly zone, lethal aid, a ban on Russian oil and a suspension of Visa and Mastercard in Russia. Reuters reports that Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, said after the call on Saturday: “These planes are very much needed. And I will do all I can to help the administration to facilitate their transfer.” He also reportedly called for more US businesses to leave Russia in the call which reportedly included Schumer, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar. Jennifer Jacobs, a White House reporter for Bloomberg News, tweeted: Russian forces have seized a psychiatric hospital with 670 people inside in the town of Borodyanka in Ukraine’s Kyiv region, the regional governor Oleksiy Kuleba has said. Today we do not understand how to evacuate these people, how to help them,” Kuleba said. “They are running out of water and medicines,” Kuleba said. “These are people with certain special needs, they need constant help ... many of them have been bedridden for years.” Borodyanka is around 60km from Kyiv. Vladimir Putin has claimed that Ukraine sabotaged the evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha after attempts at ensuring safe passage of civilians failed on Saturday, according to the Associated Press. Ukrainian authorities have said Russian forces continued their attacks, preventing civilians from escaping the cities. The Russian president has also claimed Ukraine’s leadership was casting doubt on the future of the country’s statehood, saying that “if this happens, it will be entirely on their conscience”. Russia’s foreign ministry has vowed to impose tough measures against British interests in Russia in retaliation to what it labelled London’s “sanctions hysteria” after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. It said that Britain had clearly chosen to move towards an open confrontation with Russia, leaving Moscow with no choice but to take measures in response, which “will undoubtedly undermine British interests in Russia”. The measures have not yet been specified. Footage showing the aftermath of a Russian airstrike in Ukraine’s Bila Tserkva, the largest city in Kyiv Oblast and about 40 miles from the capital. The number of civilians killed in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion 10 days ago has reached at least 351, while 707 have been wounded, a UN monitoring mission said in a statement reported by Reuters. The true figures are likely to be “considerably higher”. Most of the civilian casualties were caused by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and from missile and air strikes, monitors from the Office of the UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) said. “OHCHR believes that the real figures are considerably higher, especially in government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intensive hostilities have been going on was delayed and many reports were still pending corroboration,” it said. Hundreds of civilian casualties have been alleged in the town of Volnovakha, which had attempted to open a safe evacuation corridor, but have not yet been confirmed. Vladimir Putin has said that Moscow will consider any country that sought to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine as having entered the conflict. “Any movement in this direction will be considered by us as participation in an armed conflict by that country,” the Russian president said during a meeting with Aeroflot employees reported by Reuters. Imposing a no-fly zone would have “colossal and catastrophic consequences not only for Europe but also the whole world”, Putin said. Putin also dismissed rumours that Moscow plans to declare martial law. “Martial law should only be introduced in cases where there is external aggression ... we are not experiencing that at the moment and I hope we won’t,” he said. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it understood that evacuations of civilians from Mariupol and Volnovakha in Ukraine would not start on Saturday, according to Reuters. “We remain in dialogue with the parties about the safe passage of civilians from different cities affected by the conflict,” the ICRC said in a statement. “The scenes in Mariupol and in other cities today are heart-breaking. Any initiative from the parties that gives civilians a respite from the violence and allows them to voluntarily leave for safer areas is welcome.” The plan had been to evacuate around 200,000 people from Mariupol and 15,000 from Volnovakha. The ICRC is the ceasefire’s guarantor. Only about 400 people were evacuated from Volnovakha and nearby areas during today’s ceasefire, BBC News reports, citing Ukrainian officials. Authorities had been aiming to evacuate more than 15,000 civilians from the region during the partial ceasefire, which began at 7am GMT. But regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said: “Although we had the intention and necessary transport to evacuate a lot more people, we had to stop the movement of the column, because the Russians once again started shelling Volnovakha mercilessly, and it was very dangerous to move there.” US secretary of state Antony Blinken has spoken with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi about Moscow’s “premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified war against Ukraine,” a US state department spokesperson said in a statement reported by Reuters. “The secretary noted the world is watching to see which nations stand up for the basic principles of freedom, self-determination and sovereignty,” spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement. “He underscored that the world is acting in unison to repudiate and respond to the Russian aggression, ensuring that Moscow will pay a high price.” Partial ceasefire talks in the cities of Volnovakha and Mariupol are ‘ongoing’ after Ukraine accused Russia of continuing attacks despite agreeing to allow civilians to flee. Ukraine has said attacks on the cities continued on Saturday, meaning the evacuation of civilians had to be halted. The number of refugees fleeing the Russian invasion could potentially reach 1.5 million by the end of the weekend, the head of the UN refugee agency has said. The figure is currently above 1.3 million. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Nato has given the “green light for further bombing of Ukraine” by ruling out a no-fly zone. Zelenskiy said: “All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity”. Nato warned on Friday that imposing a no-fly zone could provoke full-fledged war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia. “The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send Nato fighter planes into Ukraine’s airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes,” Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said. Britain has urged UK nationals to consider leaving Russia following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. “If your presence in Russia is not essential, we strongly advise that you consider leaving by remaining commercial routes,” the Foreign Office said. President Vladimir Putin has said western sanctions on Russia were akin to a declaration of war. He said Moscow needed to defend Russian speakers in Ukraine’s east as well as its own interests. President Vladimir Putin said western sanctions on Russia were akin to a declaration of war, reports Reuters. He said Moscow needed to defend Russian speakers in Ukraine’s east as well as its own interests. In televised comments to female flight attendants he said Russia wanted Ukraine to be “demilitarised”, “denazified” and to have neutral status. He also said he has no plans to declare martial law in Russia, reports AFP: Here’s an updated summary from Reuters: Russian President Vladimir Putin said Western sanctions were akin to war as his forces pressed their assault on Ukraine on Saturday for a 10th day and the IMF warned that the conflict would have a “severe impact” on the global economy. Moscow and Kyiv traded blame over the failure of plans to impose a brief ceasefire and enable civilians to evacuate two cities besieged by Russian forces. Russia’s invasion has already driven nearly 1.5 million refugees westwards into the European Union. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy made a “desperate plea” for eastern Europe to provide Russian-made aircraft to his country during a call with U.S. senators on Saturday, said the chamber’s majority leader, Chuck Schumer. NATO, which Ukraine wants to join, has resisted Zelenskiy’s appeals to impose a no-fly zone over his country, saying this would escalate the conflict outside Ukraine. But there is strong bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress for providing $10 billion in emergency military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Putin said he wanted a neutral Ukraine that had been “demilitarised” and “denazified”, adding: “These sanctions that are being imposed are akin to a declaration of war but thank God it has not come to that.” Ukraine and Western countries have rejected Putin’s arguments as a baseless pretext for invading and have sought to squeeze Russia hard with sanctions. Sweden and Finland, both of which are not Nato members, have announced that they will further strengthen their security cooperation following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Reuters reports that the Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, made the announcement at a joint news conference with Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, today. The European Union’s peacekeeping force in Bosnia, Eufor, has said that France will conduct fast-jet training flights over Bosnia amid the deteriorating international security situation, reports Reuters. “The Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier is currently conducting operational training in the Mediterranean Sea and, from Monday 7 March, its Rafale aircraft will conduct overflights of the western Balkans including Bosnia-Herzegovina,” Eufor said. It comes after the EU last week announced it was increasing its Eufor force from 600 to 1,100 to prevent potential instability following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Bosnia is facing an increasingly assertive Bosnian Serb separatist movement that is understood to have received support from Moscow, the news agency reports. Like Ukraine, Bosnia has long said it wants to join Nato. About 400 people have been evacuated from the Ukrainian city of Volnovakha, according to reports: Aeroflot, Russia’s flagship carrier, has announced that it will halt all international flights except to Belarus starting 8 March, reports the Associated Press. It comes after the country’s aviation agency, Rosaviatsiya, recommended that all Russian airlines with foreign-leased planes stop passenger and cargo flights abroad, citing the high risk of them being impounded as part of western sanctions. Italian police have seized villas and yachts worth at least €140m (£126m) from four high-profile Russians who were placed on an EU sanctions list after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, sources told Reuters today. A police source said a villa owned by the billionaire businessman Alisher Usmanov on Sardinia, and a villa on Lake Como owned by the Russian state TV host Vladimir Solovyov, had both been seized. In addition, sources confirmed that yachts belonging to Russia’s richest man, Alexei Mordashov, and Gennady Timchenko, who has close ties with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, were impounded overnight in northern Italian ports. Thousands have reportedly gathered in the city of Zaporizhzhia, in south-eastern Ukraine, to join territorial defence forces against Russia. Poland will not recognise any territorial changes brought about by “unprovoked, illegal aggression”, the country’s foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, has said. The comments, reported by Reuters, come after talks with US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And here, scenes of protest from the port city of occupied Berdyansk: More from Kherson, where people have been demonstrating against Russia’s occupation: Ceasefire talks with Russia are “ongoing” to create a humanitarian corridor out of Mariupol and Volnovakha, Ukraine has said after shelling halted the evacuation of civilians. “The Russian side is not holding to the ceasefire and has continued firing on Mariupol itself and on its surrounding area,” said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, reports the Associated Press. “Talks with the Russian Federation are ongoing regarding setting up a ceasefire and ensuring a safe humanitarian corridor.” Meanwhile, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said Russia breached the deal in Volnovakha as well. “We appeal to the Russian side to stop firing,” she said. Zelenskiy has said that they are “doing everything on our part to make the agreement work”. He added: “This is one of the main tasks for today. Let’s see if we can go further in the negotiation process.” More than 1.3 million refugees have fled Ukraine since 24 February, with around half going to Poland. The UN refugee agency has said this figure could reach 1.5 million by the end of the weekend. Ukrainians in the city of Kherson, which was captured by Russia on Wednesday, have held a demonstration against the occupation: The number of refugees fleeing the Russian invasion could potentially reach 1.5 million by the end of the weekend, the head of the UN refugee agency has said. The figure is currently above 1.3 million. “This is the fastest moving refugee crisis we have seen in Europe since the end of World War Two,” the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, told Reuters in a telephone interview. Grandi also said most refugees at the moment were connecting with friends and family already living in Europe, but warned future waves would be more complex. Thousands of people from the rest of Ukraine have been arriving in the western city of Lviv each day. The city is less than 50 miles from the Polish border. More than 1.3 million Ukrainian refugees have crossed the country’s borders after Russia invaded 10 days ago. Most have crossed into the European Union in eastern Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary and northern Romania. Here are some figures via Reuters: Poland has accepted nearly 800,000 Ukrainian refugees since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, according to the country’s deputy minister of internal affairs Pawel Szefernaker. More than 106,000 arrived from Ukraine in the last 24 hours, the highest figure since the invasion. Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said that 140,000 people have crossed into Hungary. Nearly 200,000 have fled to Romania. The government is expected to approve a decree on Saturday to use a buffer fund to finance the costs of housing an average 70,000 people per day for 30 days. Romania is asking for EU help too. Some 20,000 Ukrainians have entered Bulgaria, border police said. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has arrived in Poland to discuss security and humanitarian assistance, Reuters reports. Blinken is in Rzeszow, a south-eastern city close to the Ukrainian border where hundreds of thousands of people have crossed since the invasion began. Blinken will meet Polish officials, including the Nato and European Union member state’s foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau. More than 1 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the invasion began on 24 February, mostly into Poland, according to the UN refugee agency. Much of the military aid provided by Nato members to Ukraine’s government forces is passing through Poland. Nato has refused Ukrainian demands to enforce a no-fly zone over the country. Blinken said on Friday that Nato, which he called a defensive alliance, was seeking to prevent the war from spreading beyond Ukraine. “We seek no conflict, but if conflict comes to us, we’re ready for it,” Blinken said, “and we will defend every inch of Nato territory.” Reuters has this update on the partial ceasefire in Mariupol: Authorities in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol said an evacuation of civilians planned for Saturday had been postponed as Russian forces encircling the city were not respecting an agreed ceasefire. In a statement, the city council asked residents to return to shelters in the city and wait for further information on evacuation. Mariupol’s deputy mayor told BBC News about the difficulties faced by the city’s civilians who were attempting to evacuate. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has called for safe routes to allow civilians to flee Mariupol. Multiple MSF staff members are sheltering in the city with their families – one staff member said: The situation is the same as in recent days. This night the shelling was harder and closer. We collected snow and rain water yesterday to have some utility water. We tried to get free water today but the queue was huge. We also wanted to get ‘social’ bread but it is not clear the schedule and the places of distribution. According to people, multiple grocery stores were destroyed by missiles and the remaining things were taken by people in desperate need. Still no power, water, heating and mobile connection. No one heard about any evacuation yet. Pharmacies are out of medicine.” Christine Jamet, MSF director of operations, called today for safe routes to allow civilians to leave the city, including MSF staff and their families: “Civilians must not be trapped in a war zone,” Jamet said. “People seeking safety must be able to do so, without fear of violence”. From Shaun Walker, the Guardian’s Central Europe correspondent, in Ukraine. Bila Tserkva is the largest city in Kyiv Oblast. Britain has urged UK nationals to consider leaving Russia following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. “If your presence in Russia is not essential, we strongly advise that you consider leaving by remaining commercial routes,” the British government said in a statement reported by Reuters. It comes after Britain on Monday advised citizens against travelling to Russia due to a lack of available flight options and increased economic volatility. The deputy mayor of Mariupol has said that people continue to be shelled as they try to leave the city. Deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov told BBC News: “At first our people said the shelling stops for a little time, but then it continues and they continue to use hard artillery and rockets to bomb Mariupol. People are very scared.” Orlov said authorities in the city had received information that there is fighting “on the road to Zaporizhzhia” making it unsafe. “We understand that [the ceasefire] was not true from the Russian side, and they continue to destroy Mariupol. We decided to move our citizens back because it’s not safe to be on the streets.” He said the shelling of the city and fighting on the road to Zaporizhzhia makes it “impossible to evacuate people”. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will speak to Russia’s Vladimir Putin on Sunday to discuss the war in Ukraine, spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said in a statement reported by Reuters. Kalin said Turkey was ready to help resolve the crisis. Kalin told reporters in Istanbul that Turkey was offering to host talks between Ukraine and Russia and called for an immediate end to fighting. He reiterated that Turkey could not abandon ties with either Moscow or Kyiv. Ukraine will be able to import gas from Poland from from 6 March, including gas from Polish LNG terminals, Ukrainian state-run gas transit system operator said in a statement reported by Reuters. The two transit operators agreed on the introduction of guaranteed capacity for gas imports and “this allows the physical import of gas from Poland, including from the LNG terminal, on a guaranteed basis”, the Ukrainian company said. Ukraine, one of Europe’s biggest gas consumers, has not imported gas from Russia since 2015 and buys it in Europe. Turning towards Beijing for a moment, my colleague Martin Belam has this update from the Winter Paralympics, from which Russian and Belarusian athletes have been expelled. There are reports that the Russian ministry of sport is planning an alternative event with the expelled athletes: Ukrainian athletes have made a winning start at the Winter Paralympics in Beijing, with Grygorii Vovchynskyi and Oksana Shyshkovaboth securing gold medals in biathlon events on the opening morning of the Games. Vovchynskyi said “please, no war in Ukraine” to the camera at the end of his run. He was warmly congratulated by silver medallist Marco Maier of Germany, who finished just over 45 seconds behind. The German Paralympic committee described them as “Medals for peace” in a tweet. The Ukrainian team then went on to sweep the podium in the men’s vision impaired sprint biathlon, with Vitali Lukianenko delivering their third gold medal, ahead of compatriots Oleksandr Kazik and Dmytro Suiarko. In Russia, meanwhile, state-run news agency TASS has reported that the Russian ministry of sport is planning an alternative Winter Paralympics event featuring the expelled Russian and Belarusian athletes, to be held in the venues which hosted the Games in Sochi in 2014. Russian state channel Match TV has so far declined to broadcast any of the the Beijing Games domestically, issuing a statement saying that “We express solidarity with our athletes - live broadcasting of the Paralympic Games has been cancelled.” Mariupol’s city council has said Russian forces were not observing an agreed ceasefire along the entire length of a planned route for the evacuation of civilians, Reuters reports. “We are negotiating with the Russian side to confirm the ceasefire along the entire evacuation route,” it said in a statement. The route of the corridor is Mariupol - Nikolske - Rozivka - Polohy - Orikhiv - Zaporizhzhia. Authorities had previously urged civilians to leave, with mayor Vadim Boichenko saying on Telegram: “When our home city is constantly under the ruthless fire of the occupiers there is no choice other than to allow residents – us – to leave Mariupol safely.” Ukraine’s armed forces claim to have shot down a Russian military helicopter this morning. Its operative command released video of a missile hitting a low-flying helicopter which crashed seconds later. There will be more agreements with Russia to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from front line areas, Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko has said in a statement reported by Reuters. “There will definitely be more agreements like this for all other territories,” he said, referring to an existing evacuation plan for the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. New information about the scope of the partial ceasefire has been shared by Reuters. The Ukrainian government said the plan was to evacuate about 200,000 people from Mariupol and 15,000 from Volnovakha, and the Red Cross is the ceasefire’s guarantor. There was no immediate confirmation that firing had stopped and it was not clear if the ceasefire would be extended to other areas, Reuters reports. About 90% of the city of Volnovakha has been damaged by bombing, local MP Dmytro Lubinets said. Dead bodies lie uncollected and people hiding in shelters are running out of food. My colleagues have more on the humanitarian corridors in Mariupol and Volnovakha announced on Saturday: The European Union said it had joined members of the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) in suspending Russia and Belarus from the Council’s activities, Reuters reports. Its statement said: This decision is a part of the European Union’s and like-minded partners response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the involvement of Belarus in this unprovoked and unjustified aggression,” it said on Saturday. “The EU agrees with the other members of the CBSS (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland and Sweden) that the suspension of Russia and Belarus will remain in force until it is possible to resume cooperation based on respect for fundamental principles of international law,” it added. More detail has emerged on the partial ceasefire in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol this morning. The measure will allow civilians to leave the city during a five-hour period from Saturday morning. From Reuters, citing Russia’s RIA news agency: Civilians will be allowed to leave Mariupol between noon and 5 p.m. Moscow time (0900 - 1400 GMT), Russia’s RIA news agency quoted city authorities as saying. This is 11am to 4pm local time. Russia said earlier on Saturday its troops, which have encircled the Azov Sea port city in Ukraine’s south, would stop firing and allow civilians to pass. Russia also plans a partial ceasefire to allow a humanitarian corridor out of Volnovakha. Civilians will be able to proceed towards the city of Zaporizhzhia and will be able to use specially arranged bus routes or their own cars, the city council said. Saturday’s evacuation will be the first of several stages, the city council said. “Given that our hometown is constantly under ruthless fire from the occupiers, there is no other solution,” the statement quoted Mayor Vadym Boychenko as saying. Hello, I’m Clea Skopeliti and I’ll be bringing you the latest updates on the Russia-Ukraine war on the 10th day of the Russian invasion. Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said 66,224 Ukrainian men had returned from abroad to help fight against Russia’s invasion. That’s how many men returned from abroad at this moment to defend their country from the horde. These are 12 more combat and motivated brigades! Ukrainians, we are invincible,” Reznikov said in statement posted online. There has been no immediate confirmation from Ukraine regarding the reports Russia will stop firing this morning to allow for the evacuation of civilians, according to Associated Press. The details of the arrangement are unclear. Russian state media reported that Russia has agreed on evacuation routes with Ukrainian forces to allow civilians to leave Mariupol in the southeast and the eastern town of Volnovakha “from 10 am Moscow time”. The reports cited a statement by the Russian Defense Ministry statement. It did not state for how long this ceasefire would last. Olga Tokariuk, an independent journalist, describes the defiance of the Ukrainian people in the face of continued attacks by Russian forces in cities across the country. It is still possible to leave the capital, she writes, but those who travel risk being fired at by Russians. “Missiles still rain from the sky,” she writes. PayPal is the latest company to announce it will no longer offer services in Russia. Reuters reports: Payments company PayPal Holdings Inc shut down its services early on Saturday in Russia, citing “the current circumstances,” joining many financial and tech companies in suspending operations there after the invasion of Ukraine. President and Chief Executive Dan Schulman said in a statement that the company “stands with the international community in condemning Russia’s violent military aggression in Ukraine.” A company spokesperson said PayPal will support withdrawals “for a period of time, ensuring that account balances are dispersed in line with applicable laws and regulations. PayPal, which had only allowed cross-border transactions by users in Russia, stopped accepting new users in the country on Wednesday. Reuters reports that Russia’s ministry of defence says forces will stop firing this morning to allow residents of Mariupol and Volnovakha to safely flee their homes. It cites Interfax news agency: Russian forces will stop firing at 1000 Moscow time to allow humanitarian corridors out of the Ukrainian cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha, Russia’s defence ministry said, Interfax reported. The mayor of Mariupol earlier warned the city has been “blockaded” by Russian forces. Mayor Vadym Boychenko said the city has no water, heat or electricity and that supplies of food are low. “They want to wipe Mariupol and Mariupol residents off the face of the earth,” the mayor said, describing indiscriminate shelling of residential areas and hospitals. The port city, home to 400,000 residents, is a strategic target for Russia. If Russia were to control the city, this would help it to build a land corridor between Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, and Russian-backed regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. The town of Volnovakha has also been subject to some of the heaviest Russian attacks. Guardian correspondent Emma Graham-Harrison has reported on the dire situation in the town: In Volnovakha, the attack is still so intense that dead bodies lie uncollected, says local MP Dmytro Lubinets. Ukrainians still brave enough to run rescue missions are going back only for the living. Thousands of them are trapped in basements, with dwindling supplies of food and water, sheltering from an apparently senseless attack on a town Lubinets says has no military defenders in its centre. The line of contact is 20km away, he says. “It never stops, every five minutes there is a mortar landing or artillery shells, some buildings have been hit by multiple rocket systems,” he said by phone. “In the city there is not any building which has not suffered from direct or collateral damage. So some buildings have major destruction, some minor destruction, some are completely destroyed to the ground.” Chinese state TV neglected to translate comments by the president of the International Paralympic Committee condemning the Russian war in Ukraine during its live broadcast of the opening of Winter Paralympics. Associated Press reports: Andrew Parsons, the president of the International Paralympic Committee, declared his horror at the fighting in Ukraine and called on world authorities to promote peace. “Tonight, I want, I must begin with a message of peace,” Parsons said in brief remarks to the athletes and spectators at the Bird’s Nest stadium. “As the leader of an organization with inclusion at its core, where diversity is celebrated and differences embraced, I am horrified at what is taking place in the world right now. Paralympic organizers had initially said that Russians and Belarusians would be allowed to compete in Beijing, but later reversed the decision. AP adds: The live broadcast of the opening on Chinese state TV did not translate Parsons’ condemnation of war and and then lowered the volume of his remarks in English for a while. The Chinese government has been restricting anti-Russia views in state media and online. Unlike the US and Europe, it has not criticized the invasion and opposed sanctions on Russia. Boris Johnson has warned of the risk of nuclear disaster in Europe following the Russian shelling of a Ukrainian power plant, reports PA Media, which cites an interview given to La Repubblica, Die Welt and El Pais. Here is PA’s summary of the interview: Johnson said he believes Putin intends to “double down” on his invasion of Ukraine, as the Russian president envisages “no way out” but to “continue with the destruction”. Johnson recounted his overnight call with Zelenskiy about the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia power station, saying their pair agreed that an attack on a nuclear power plant is “clearly a matter of our common European health and safety”. “Our security is equally involved, equally jeopardised by such an attack,” he said. “We remember what happened with Chernobyl, the radioactive clouds spread over the whole continent, and indeed, also to North America, as far as I can remember. “There is clearly a risk... I am concerned about how we stop a disaster: there are other Ukrainian plants and there are certainly other Ukrainian radioactive nuclear waste sites.” On how nuclear plants can be protected, he said: “We have to make clear to the Kremlin that a civilian nuclear disaster in Ukraine, another Chernobyl, is a disaster for Russia as well as for everybody.” “Therefore, I think that some system of protecting those plants, some system of ensuring that radioactivity levels are monitored by international authorities, such as the UN (United Nations) and the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) on the ground, is going to be extremely important.” A group of eminent writers has appealed to Russian speakers around the world to convey the truth about the war in Ukraine by directly contacting Russian citizens using “all possible means of communication”. The 17 signatories to the appeal include the Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich, a Belarusian author who writes in Russian. She won the Nobel prize for literature in 2015 for writing described as “a monument to courage and suffering in our time”. Another dozen distinguished authors from around the world, including the Nobel laureate JM Coetzee, have backed the appeal. It comes as the Russian government cracked down on access to news and information about the invasion of Ukraine by blocking websites and effectively closing broadcast outlets. The Kremlin has sought to crush independent media by blocking news websites and introducing a law against so-called “fake news”. Here, the investigative editor at the news website Meduza says he left Russia in the middle of the night, with barely the time to call his parents. “Felt a massive door slam shut behind my back,” he writes. Russia’s media watchdog had restricted access to Meduza. “I’m super lucky and privileged to have been spared many hours or even days of waiting on the roadside in the dirt for asylum, to have friends meet me on the other side and take me and my family to a safe place. Unlike millions of Ukrainians right now,” he says. Hello, I’m Rebecca Ratcliffe, bringing you our rolling coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war, which is now entering its 10th day. It is 7.20am in Ukraine. Here is the latest: Russian forces have continued to bombard cities and other sites across Ukraine, launching missiles and artillery attacks. A vast Russian convoy, which is thought to be 40 miles long, remains stalled outside Kyiv, according to Associated Press. The mayor of Mariupol, a strategic port city that has been subject to heavy Russian attacks, said the city has been “blockaded” by Russian forces. Mayor Vadym Boychenko has previously warned the city has no water, heat or electricity and that supplies of food are running out. He has appealed for military assistance and for a humanitarian corridor. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy strongly criticised Nato for refusing to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying the decision has given “the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian towns and villages”. Zelenskiy will address the US Senate on Saturday during a Zoom call that is scheduled for 9.30am Eastern Time. The US Embassy in Ukraine described Russia’s attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, as a war crime, stating: “Putin’s shelling of Europe’s largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further.” Russia blamed a “Ukrainian sabotage group” for the fire at the plant. Major news organisations including the BBC, CNN, Bloomberg, CBS News and the Canadian Broadcasting Company have suspended reporting inside Russia, after it imposed a law that threatens jail terms of up to 15 years for spreading “fake news” about the war in Ukraine. Russia has also blocked Facebook, Twitter and the websites of the BBC, Deutsche Welle and Voice of America, in an attempt to control the flow of information and stamp out independent media coverage. Several leading luxury brands said they will temporarily close stores and halt business operations in Russia. This includes Hermes, the Cartier owner Richemont, LVMH, Kering and Chanel. Samsung has also suspended shipments, after Microsoft and Apple announced similar measures."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jul/05/queensland-coal-push-grows-as-turnbull-tries-to-land-energy-guarantee","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-05T06:56:01Z","webTitle":"Queensland coal push grows as Turnbull tries to land energy guarantee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jul/05/queensland-coal-push-grows-as-turnbull-tries-to-land-energy-guarantee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jul/05/queensland-coal-push-grows-as-turnbull-tries-to-land-energy-guarantee","fields":{"headline":"Queensland coal push grows as Turnbull tries to land energy guarantee","bodyText":"A Queensland-led coal push is intensifying as the Turnbull government attempts to land the national energy guarantee, with the looming weekend state LNP conference set to deal with several motions calling for a new coal-fired power station and an end to renewable subsidies. Several of the state’s branches have endorsed the LNP push for the federal government to build “high energy, low emissions coal-fired power stations and the orderly closing down of older technology coal-fired power stations in order to drive down electricity prices, reduce emissions and promote economic growth”. While the coal push favours government intervention, separate proposals on renewable energy call for the state and federal governments “to apply policies which affirm the LNP’s commitment to the free market provision of least-cost, secure and reliable energy supplies from all technologies where their use is economically viable and technically feasible”. Nuclear power will also be back on the agenda at the LNP conference, with the Fairfax branch pushing for the consideration of “the feasibility of nuclear power generation in Australia”. The weekend motions come as Tony Abbott has attempted this week to exploit internal divisions within the Turnbull government over the Neg in an effort to torpedo the policy. Abbott used a speech to a forum of climate sceptics to declare Australia should withdraw from the Paris agreement – a treaty he joined Australia to while prime minister – as a precursor for dumping the Neg. The government’s energy policy is supported by a majority of Liberals and some Nationals, and there is internal frustration about Abbott’s antics. Some Nationals want Malcolm Turnbull and Josh Frydenberg to agree to provide transitional assistance for the coal sector, either through subsidies for coal stations or bankrolling retrofitting to extend the life of existing plants while lowering emissions. That internal push is being driven out of Queensland. Labor has earmarked at least 10 of the government’s Queensland seats as vulnerable, making the state the potential election swinger, and support for a coal-inclusive energy future is gaining traction with MPs in marginal seats. With pro-coal forces in the government on the march, during the last parliamentary sitting fortnight before the winter recess the Coalition voted with One Nation in the Senate, backing a motion calling on the government “to facilitate the building of new coal-fired power stations and the retrofitting of existing baseload power stations”. While it is clear that agreeing to some assistance for coal would help smooth over the government’s internal divisions on the policy, a coal side deal would create problems with Labor states and territories who have to sign off on the policy in early August. Some Labor states and the ACT will be highly attentive to any deal the Turnbull government strikes internally to prolong the life of coal-fired power plants, given some of them are already of the view the emissions reduction in the Neg is nowhere near ambitious enough for Australia to meet its Paris commitments. Any one of the states or the ACT could scuttle the policy because implementing it requires agreement across participants in the national electricity market. A coal side deal could also derail bipartisan consensus on the Neg with Labor in Canberra. The Turnbull government will need Labor’s support to get the policy through the parliament. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has already warned the government that new subsidies for coal as part of any internal settlement on the Neg will scuttle the chances of securing peace after 10 years of warring over climate and energy policy. Butler said in late June: “We’re not going to agree to a model that seeks to fly in the face of all of the expert advice, from industry and stakeholders, that building new coal-fired power stations would mean there is no way of achieving our commitments under the Paris agreement and also would deliver higher priced electricity to households and businesses.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2020/jun/10/stock-market-rally-fades-as-investors-await-us-fed-federal-reserve-forecasts-coronavirus-covid-19-sterling-eurozone-pound-brexit-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-10T14:00:04Z","webTitle":"Global economy to suffer worst peacetime slump in 100 years, OECD says  - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jun/10/stock-market-rally-fades-as-investors-await-us-fed-federal-reserve-forecasts-coronavirus-covid-19-sterling-eurozone-pound-brexit-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2020/jun/10/stock-market-rally-fades-as-investors-await-us-fed-federal-reserve-forecasts-coronavirus-covid-19-sterling-eurozone-pound-brexit-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Global economy to suffer worst peacetime slump in 100 years, OECD says  - as it happened","bodyText":"An OECD report forecasted that the global economy will contract 6% in 2020, and 7.6% if there is a second wave of Covid-19 infections. It said the pandemic has triggered the most severe peace-time recession in nearly a century The report also found that Britain’s economy is likely to suffer the worst damage from the Covid-19 crisis of any country in the developed world The news caused European stocks to flip flop, with most indices ending up in negative territory after a relatively strong start to the session Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey later said at a private event that there will be elements of a faster-than-usual economic recovery as the government lifts Covid-19 restrictions that that we are seeing elements of that recovery starting already US consumer prices fell for the third straight month. CPI dipped 0.1% month on month in May, worse than economist forecasts for a flat reading All eyes are now turning to the US Fed as the central bank plans to release its first set of economic forecasts since the Covid-19 pandemic took hold That’s all from us today. We’ll be back again tomorrow morning. Thanks for reading and stay safe –KM Wall Street has edged higher at the market open, helping the Nasdaq hit a record high (remember it hit 10,000 for the first time ever yesterday, so it wasn’t a huge feat to beat that level again today) Nasdaq opened up 0.6% at 10,014 points Dow opened 0.1% higher at 27,244 points S&amp;P 500 opened 0.1% higher at 3,211 points Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital, says the US Fed is unlikely to forecast GDP growth above 2.5% for 2021 when it releases projections later today: It is unlikely that the FOMC’s GDP forecast will be much higher than 2.5%, as the Fed can explain such a modest increase in the light of a wide output gap that will take time to recover. A much stronger GDP growth forecast would certainly come to the attention of bond investors, who might think that this would mean a faster-than-expected normalisation of policy. It would also be a surprise if the Fed deviated much from its recent messages to the market of being there to provide policy support for the economy. Fed Chair Powell might also want to again send the message that accommodative policy will be in place for some time – i.e. dovish forward guidance. The potential upset today is that Fed Chair Powell sends an inadvertent hawkish message and/or highlights concerns with new highs in equity markets. More comments being reported from Andrew Bailey: After the doom and gloom of the OECD report, Bailey has said that there will be elements of a faster-than-usual economic recovery as the government lifts Covid-19 restrictions. He adds that we are seeing elements of that recovery starting already. However, there will be a greater degree of natural caution by people after lockdown ends, and he warns that we don’t know how much economic scarring there will be. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is speaking at a private event as part of the World Economic Forums’ “Great Reset Dialogue” series. Thankfully Reuters has a view of what’s being said. Bailey, like almost every BoE official in recent months, has insisted that the financial sector is much more resilient than before the financial crisis and that banks can aid the recovery from Covid-19 by continuing to lend. However, Bailey will they have to consider some reform of the ‘non-bank sector of finance’ after the Covid-19 crisis (though no detail yet over what exactly the issues or or what the potential solutions might be). US CPI dipped 0.1% month on month in May, worse than economist forecasts for a flat reading. That’s the third straight month of declines and follows a 0.8% fall in April which was the biggest decline on record since December 2008. On an annual basis, consumer prices actually rose 0.1% but that was still worse than predictions for 0.2%. Worse than Italy. Worse than Spain. Britain has already had more deaths from Covid-19 than any other European country. Now it faces the possibility of a second embarrassment: the deepest recession of any nation in the developed world, writes our economics editor Larry Elliott. There’s not much in it, according to the latest forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Italy and Spain are also propping up the league table put together by the Paris-based thinktank. A lot can happen between now and the end of 2020, a year that has not yet reached its mid-point. Even so, the OECD’s findings make grim reading. It thinks the economy will contract by 11.5% in the event of a single hit and by 14% if the virus returns later in the year. The 37-member thinktank says one is no more likely than the other. So why is the UK set to do much worse than Germany, which expects output to contract by 6.6% in the event of a single hit? One factor identified by the OECD is the importance of the service sector to the UK economy. Trade, tourism, real estate and hospitality together make up a sizeable chunk of gross domestic products and all have been hard hit by the lockdown. You can read Larry’s full analysis here: Stocks are on a bit of a rollercoaster ride today, with the FTSE 100 edging back into positive territory to trade up 0.1% US futures are also showing some green shoots just a little over an hour before Wall Street opens for trading. Oil prices are continuing their downward slide, with Brent crude down 1.8% and WTI slumping 2.2%. While oil prices had climbed since the initial OPEC+ production cut agreement in April (as well as the recent easing of lockdowns) the long road to recovery from Covid-19 appears to weighing on the minds of investors. Cailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, explains: The global economy is still in a precarious position. The dip in oil prices in recent days most likely reflects the end of the price boost that came from the initial economic re-opening. The global economy is now settling in for a long, slow recovery process, which we only expect to pick up in late 2021, assuming a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available then. Global energy consumption will remain depressed compared with the start of 2020, particularly as demand for travel and hospitality services stays weak. This will require continued production restraint from OPEC+ partners in order to stabilise oil prices around their current level of US$40/b. Boris Johnson has further quashed any hopes of pubs and the wide hospitality industry re-opening this month, saying at PMQ’s that the government was sticking to its plan to hold out until at least 4 July. You’ll remember that there were rumours that there might be an early re-opening of beer gardens around 22 June. Johnson said that guidance for the hospitality industry was being development but there were still risks, and that the government did not want to se a mass of people who could further spread the coronavirus. The US dollar is trading at three-month lows ahead of the conclusion of the US Fed meeting later today. While we’re not expecting any change to interest rates, all eyes are turning to economic projections, particularly in light of the surprise drop in unemployment in May. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: The economic projections will be particularly instructive in the context of whether Fed policymakers believe a v-shaped recovery is likely, and whether they think the worst is behind the US economy. We’ve already seen more details this week of the Main Street Lending program, however it will be on how the Fed intends to manage the recovery process that will be of most interest. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is currently facing Labour leader Kier Starmer at PMQs. You can follow those proceedings at our politics live blog here: Speaking of Germany, there are reports that the country’s finance minister Olaf Scholz is mulling a larger-than-expected extra budget that will involved taking on €50bn worth of fresh debt to fund a coronavirus stimulus package. The cabinet is planning to pass a second supplementary budget on 17 June, according to Reuters, which is citing an unnamed senior official with knowledge of the discussions. It would be on top of a supplementary budget worth €156bn agreed in March, and would bring the federal government’s overall net new borrowing beyond €200bn this year. After a relatively positive start to the session, it’s a sea of red across European stocks. Germany’s XETRA DAX is logging the worst losses, down -9%. The UK government has weighed in on the OECD forecasts (but failed to address the fact that the UK is likely to suffer the worst Covid-19 damage among its peers). Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, said: In common with many other economies around the world, we’re seeing the significant impact of coronavirus on our country and our economy. I’ve been clear that our top priority has always been to support people, jobs and businesses through this crisis- and this is what we’ve done. The unprecedented action we’ve taken to provide lifelines that help people and businesses through the economic disruption will ensure our economic recovery is as strong and as swift as possible. And if you’ve forgotten about the looming Brexit transition period deadline: The OECD has said that if the UK fails to strike a trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020 or put in place alternative arrangements, Brexit threatens to have a strongly negative effect on trade and job in the UK. That’s being reported by Reuters. Sir Martin Sorrell is fond of coining a phrase to describe the shape of an economic recovery and his latest prediction is that the world is likely to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic in a “reverse square root”, Mark Sweney writes. Sorrell, who famously labelled last decade’s advertising recession as “bath shaped”, said that while industry sectors will have their own recovery shapes - V, U, L and even “a chair” - the overall global economy is likely to reset at a lower level. “The best analogy I like is the reverse square root,” he said, speaking at the virtual CogX conference. “A sharp fall, a recovery, but maybe not to the levels we were at before.” The former chief of WPP has always had a hectic globe trotting schedule but, perhaps surprisingly, he says he is enjoying the shift to remote working under lockdown. “I feel much better physically and mentally not rushing around the world,” he said. Sorrell quipped that as the business world moves to less face-to-face meetings, and travel is curtailed, post-coronavirus it was unlikely that his son’s joke that he would pass away “in seat 1A” was now likely to come true. There has been a surge in the number of people looking for a place to rent in London and the home counties since the UK housing market reopened about a month ago, my colleague Julia Kollewe writes. The lettings market has bounced back faster than the home sales market, according to the upmarket estate agent Knight Frank. It says that the number of valuation appraisals for lettings properties jumped to a record high in the week to 6 June, and was 19% above the five-year average. The weekly number of tenants looking to move was 40% above the five-year average. House moves and physical viewings were effectively banned between late March and 13 May, when restrictions were lifted. Estate agents switched to virtual viewings, but the housing market pretty much ground to a halt. Knight Frank says the number of viewings for homes to rent was 1% higher than the five-year average in the week to 6 June, even though physical distancing rules remain in place. By comparison, viewings for properties for sale fell 26% in London. Web viewings remain popular, up 33% higher than the five-year average last week, compared to a 12% decline for sales. Despite the increase, activity in the lettings market is still below where it was during the second half of 2019, when demand was boosted by uncertainty in the sales market because of Brexit. Jon Reynolds, head of lettings at Knight Frank for the City, east and Riverside region in London, said: We expect demand to get even stronger when there is more certainty around how universities will be teaching their courses next year. Those announcements will make a huge difference and demand will be bolstered further as companies reactivate relocation plans that are currently on hold. An interesting graphic by our team showing how the UK’s economy is on track for the worst performance among its peers: Sidenote for all your Bank of England geeks: chief economist Andy Haldane has been re-appointed for another three year term on the rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee. He first joined the MPC in June 2014. Don’t expect much fanfare on Wall Street at the start of trading. US futures are showing the S&amp;P down 0.1% and the Dow down 0.2%. However, there may be some optimism left around tech stocks, with Nasdaq futures up 0.3%. The dismal OECD forecasts have hit UK stocks. The FTSE 100 and more domestically-focused FTSE 250 have reversed their gains and are now down around 0.3% each. Even the first line of the OECD report makes for grim reading: The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis without precedent in living memory. It has triggered the most severe economic recession in nearly a century and is causing enormous damage to people’s health, jobs and well-being. The decision to publish two separate economic forecasts was due to the fact that the OECD believes there is “little prospect of a vaccine becoming widely available this year.” It’s a deflating thought, especially as AstraZeneca and partners race ahead with trials of a potential vaccine that they hope will be on track for manufacturing by September. A second wave of Covid-19 later this year will trigger a return to lockdowns, the OECD said, putting the world economy on track for a worse 7.6% contraction this year, before climbing back 2.8% in 2021. In that scenario, unemployment in the OECD economies would be more than double the rate prior to the outbreaks, with little recovery in jobs next year, it warned. You can read the OECD summary here and the outlook here. (Just a quick note to say that if anyone was patiently waiting for our post on German unemployment or Eurozone PMI data as outlined in the agenda this morning, it actually isn’t due today but was out last week. Apologies. The agenda has since been updated) Britain’s economy is likely to suffer the worst damage from the Covid-19 crisis of any country in the developed world, according to a report by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Phillip Inman writes. A slump in the UK’s national income of 11.5% during 2020 will outstrip the falls suffered by France, Italy, Spain and Germany, the Paris-based thinktank said. Germany’s decline in national income (GDP) will be 6.6% this year while Spain’s GDP will fall by 11.1%, Italy’s by 11.3 and France’s by 11.4%. Highlighting the task awaiting the UK government as it seeks to ease the lockdown, the OECD ruled out a V-shaped recovery for the global economy, saying the path back to previous levels of activity would be hampered by long-lasting effects of the pandemic. The forecast of an 11.5% drop in GDP this year is an improvement on the 14% fall in national income put forward last month as a likely “scenario” by the Bank of England, but will add to pressure on the government after the OECD found that even countries that have come under severe criticism for their handling of the pandemic will fare better than the UK. You can watch the live OECD press conference here: OECD forecasts are out and it’s not a pretty picture. UK GDP is expected to be -11.5% and as low as -14% if there’s a second wave of the outbreak. The US forecasts suggest a -7.3% contraction and -8.5% with a new outbreak. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has criticised the British bank HSBC for supporting China’s move to end Hong Kong’s autonomy, calling it a “corporate kowtow”. Pompeo said the US was ready to assist Britain with whatever it needed after Beijing reportedly threatened to punish HSBC and break its commitments to build nuclear power plants in the country if the UK did not allow the Chinese technology firm Huawei to build its 5G network. “The United States stands with our allies and partners against the Chinese Communist party’s coercive bullying tactics,” Pompeo said in a statement. He added that displays of support for Beijing received little in return, although the Chinese government “continues to use the bank’s business in China as political leverage against London”. Pompeo said China’s treatment of HSBC was a “cautionary tale” and referred to the bank’s Asia Pacific chief executive Peter Wong’s decision to sign a petition supporting Beijing’s plans to enact new security legislation in Hong Kong: The CCP’s browbeating of HSBC, in particular, should serve as a cautionary tale. Just last week, the bank’s Asia-Pacific CEO, Peter Wong, a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, signed a petition supporting Beijing’s disastrous decision to destroy Hong Kong’s autonomy and to break commitments made in an U.N.-registered treaty. That show of fealty seems to have earned HSBC little respect in Beijing, which continues to use the bank’s business in China as political leverage against London. Let’s catch up with some of the Chinese inflation data released overnight which has also weighed on Asian stocks. Both the consumer price index and producer price index figures pointed to a drop in demand last month. Chinese consumer price inflation came in at 2.4% for May, below forecasts for 2.7% and Aprils’ reading of 3.3%. The producer price index, meanwhile, came in at -3.7% against consensus estimates for -3.3%, and worse than the a month earlier when it came in at -3.1%. The Heng Seng fell 0.1% on Wednesday and the Shanghai Stock Exchange posted a near 0.4% loss. But Robert Alster, head of investment services at wealth manager Close Brothers Asset Management, said there were some indications of a further rebound: China was ground-zero for the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis, but it also appears to be leading the global recovery. Auto sales data looks to be strengthening, and with some factory levels almost back to pre-pandemic levels there is a real hope that the worst is in the rear-view mirror. Its role at the heart of the global economy has meant that Chinese inflation has historically acted as an indicator for other countries. It remains to be seen whether that’s still the case in this new environment, where local effects will play a more prominent role in the basket of goods. Hurdles remain for the global recovery, with recent reports that logjams could be on the horizon for the shipping industry and emerging economies projected to shrink for the first time in sixty years. But as the US shows signs of greater bouncebackability, governments and central banks around the world will have their fingers crossed that a v-shaped recovery could be on the cards.” The owner of dozens of magazines including The Week, Minecraft World and Viz has put a quarter of its UK staff into a redundancy consultation process as the coronavirus crisis hammers the publishing industry, the Guardian’s Mark Sweney writes. Dennis Publishing, the company founded by the late media entrepreneur Felix Dennis, has begun a consultation process with 122 of its approximately 480 UK staff. The company is understood to be seeking to cut just over half of those staff involved in the consultation. The company, which was sold to private equity group Exponent two years ago for £166m, has a portfolio of titles mainly in the technology, fitness and cycling sectors. Brands range from Cyclist and Expert Reviews to Fortean Times and an unofficial guide to global phenomenon Fortnite. A spokesman for the company said: The impact of Covid-19 has been significant for the publishing sector.As a result, this week we will begin a redundancy consultation process here in the UK. We are fully committed to supporting employees in impacted groups throughout this period and ensuring that this process is fair and transparent. European stock markets are open for trading. While we’re nowhere near some of the gains we’ve seen in recent weeks, all major indices are in positive territory: FTSE 100 is up 0.3% France’s Cac 40 is up 0.6% Spain’s IBEX is up 0.36% Germany’s XETRA DAX is up 0.8% Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, eurozone and business. Market headlines were dominated last night by news that the Nasdaq hit 10,000 for the first time and that US stocks had actually logged gains for 2020 overall. But the stunning recovery has not reverberated throughout global equity markets, which have not had the benefit of being home to lucrative tech stocks that have rallied as Covid-19 lockdowns took hold. But all eyes are now turning to the US Federal Reserve, which will give its first economic projections since the pandemic started to hit the US in February. Their estimates are expected to point to a collapse in output this year and near-zero interest rates for the next few years. (It’s worth noting that the Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold today, hence why most attention is aimed at the forecasts.) Growing tensions in Hong Kong have also weighed on investor sentiment, with stocks across Asia falling broadly into the red in Wednesday’s session. More than 50 people were arrested in Hong Kong on Tuesday night after thousands of protesters took to the streets in defiance of a police order to mark the first anniversary of the anti-government movement.

Every week, 5 million people listen to The Archers on BBC Radio 4. It is also the broadcaster’s most downloaded radio show. It first aired 70 years ago – that is to say, during the era of the horse-drawn plough and tea on the ration. One of the current cast, June Spencer, who plays the formidable matriarch Peggy Woolley, appeared in the first episode on New Year’s Day, 1951. She is 101 years old. Because it is middle England’s omnipresent soundtrack, it can be easier to see The Archers as some kind of naturally occurring phenomenon than, say, an experimental, durational artwork that blurs the boundaries between fantasy and reality; or a “peculiarly English epic” as its former editor, or showrunner, Sean O’Connor describes it. To the uninitiated, on the other hand, it can appear somewhere on a scale between charmingly quaint, deeply bewildering and insufferably smug. An Irish friend told me she regarded the entire Archers mis-en-scène – “the village green, Bonfire Night, the slightly mysteriously located Big House, the cider club and the posh livery stables, even the Bull’s beer garden” as “utterly exotic”. A puzzled Texan, invited to listen by the hosts of the BBC’s Americast podcast, described it as “like Downton, except without the interesting period detail or drama”. The Archers was pitched in 1950 by Godfrey Baseley, a Birmingham-based producer of farming programmes, as a means of encouraging improved postwar food production. And, though the Ministry of Agriculture ceased sending memos to the BBC about warble fly and swine flu in the 70s, the shadow of this didactic past remains a key part of the show’s unlikely fictive mixture, its longevity, and its success. Abstruse details of pig husbandry and milking-parlour technology are woven into a narrative in which the idealised rituals of rural life (jam-making, the flower and produce show, endless cups of tea), form the weirdly eventless, diurnal backdrop to waves of high drama that may or may not be typical of life in the English countryside. Aside from floods, fraud, suicide, manslaughter, diamond smugglers, spies, a near-fatal stabbing, a plane crash, a collapsing church tower, rape, arson and a formidable tally of horrific motor-vehicle accidents, these have included a hostage-taking situation in the village shop (scripted in the 90s by the great screenwriter Sally Wainwright, before the multiple Baftas), and, recently, the accidental exploding of the kitchen wing of Grey Gables, a country house hotel, by a hapless labourer in the clutches of a villainous modern slaver. It is a mark of The Archers’ status as a British institution that Billy Connolly once jokingly suggested that the show’s theme tune – the aggressively catchy Barwick Green, a “maypole dance” from Arthur Wood’s suite My Native Heath – ought to become the national anthem. While it has not yet ousted God Save the Queen, snatches of it were heard during the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony, and royalty has condescended to appear on the show, as itself, twice: the Duchess of Cornwall in 2011 and Princess Margaret, who was a surprise guest at a charity fashion show in 1984. (Asked by the director to sound a little more as if she were enjoying herself, the latter replied: “Well, I wouldn’t be, would I?”) Some unlikely figures have pitched for cameos in the show. O’Connor told me that in his time he’d received calls from representatives of Bill Gates (“I couldn’t think of how the Women’s Institute would imagine they’d get him”), and from the office of the Evening Standard’s proprietor Evgeny Lebedev (“I told them I’d come back to them if the Borsetshire Echo was taken over by a larger syndicate”). O’Connor invited the Pet Shop Boys to play themselves headlining “Loxfest” in 2015. Neil Tennant told me that despite not being a regular listener, he nevertheless considered himself part of a kind of “ambient listenership” of a show that “has been there all my life”. Appearing on it was, he said, “definitely a highlight of our career”. Ambridge, the village at the heart of the show, is said to be about 20 miles from Birmingham, where the show has always been made – though characters are largely confined, as if by a mysterious force field, to the county of Borsetshire, with its market town of Borchester, cathedral city of Felpersham and scattering of quaintly named villages. The nomenclature of the dwellings in Ambridge is both slightly generic (there must be hundreds of Grange Farms and Home Farms in England) and nostalgically pastoral: Hollowtree, Honeysuckle Cottage, Willow Farm. You won’t find these places on a map, and yet it seems crucial to the drama that it is neither of the south or north of England, but of the Midlands. There is just the faintest trace of Middlemarch, Middle-earth and the Forest of Arden in the DNA of The Archers. Its viewpoint is firmly of the social middle, too. Baseley invented a structure in which the Archer family would be flanked, in class terms, by the “squire” on the one hand, and a less progressive, more foolish farmer on the other – Walter Gabriel, who provided much early comedy of the rude mechanicals variety. Though the social stereotypes have loosened up, The Archers retains this basic shape, with the landed gentry, the Pargetters, on one extreme, and the Grundys and Horrobins forming the community’s lumpenproletariat. This marks it off from the biggest British TV soaps, EastEnders and Coronation Street, which focus, in their urban locales, on working-class characters. It says a great deal about the British weakness for a buffoonish posh boy that the audience has still not quite forgiven its former editor of 22 years’ standing, Vanessa Whitburn, for having Nigel Pargetter plunge to his death from the roof of his stately home a decade ago, as a 60th-anniversary plot shocker. (She received death threats. “Even now, if I give a talk at a Women’s Institute, people ask why I killed him off,” she told me.) On the other hand, former Labour home secretary David Blunkett has recalled that The Archers sharpened his class consciousness as a child. The former Labour leader Neil Kinnock once called for it to be renamed The Grundys and Their Oppressors. The genius of The Archers lies in the fact that farming is inherently dramatic, according to O’Connor. The vagaries of the weather, government policy, Brexit, disease, crop failure – any number of catastrophes may sweep away your livelihood, which is also your home, and your inheritance, and what you hope to pass on to your children – a cue for King Lear-like plots about intergenerational and sibling strife. But its appeal, O’Connor said, lies also in the symbolic power of the English rural landscape. The Archers taps into a myth that the nation’s spirit is most authentically to be found in the countryside, that its irreducible social unit is the village – as if the Industrial Revolution and 19th-century urbanisation were only aberrations. The English dream of a “fair field full of folk” still lingers, however implausible such a notion is to describe Britain in 2021, which is not only 83% urban, but riven by cultural, economic and generational divides so deep that the rural idyll of Ambridge cannot truly contain and represent them. Baseley was alert to the British nostalgia for the land. His pitch, written in August 1950, was focused on a listenership not just of farmers, but of “the general listener, ie, the townsman”. Urban audiences liked – and still like – to feel that they were in touch with the land, with the farming year, with birdsong and lambing and harvest. “There’s a reason Country Life magazine is so popular, and Country Living, and TV programmes like The Great British Bake Off and Springwatch,” O’Connor said. The Archers, wrote its editor of the 70s and 80s, William Smethurst, “is more than a mere drama. It has become a fantasy of England that contains a little bit of the national soul.” * * * ‘Real life overheard” was the impression Godfrey Baseley wanted The Archers to create. He succeeded. “For years the listeners believed it absolutely – whatever we did was real to them,” original cast member June Spencer told me. “When listeners wrote to us, we didn’t disillusion them. If we replied, we replied in character.” She remembers receiving a letter in 1966 solemnly informing her of the scandalous, out-of-wedlock pregnancy of her on-air daughter, Jennifer, and asking why she didn’t seem to know about it: “Don’t you listen to the show?” The producers played hard on the listeners’ credulity, or willingness to suspend disbelief, mingling the real and the make-believe: when Christine Archer, owner of the stables, entered her Red Link for the Badminton horse trials in 1957, a real-life horse of the same name competed. Nor was it just the listeners who were sucked in. Norman Painting, who played Phil Archer until his death in 2009, recalled that as the 50s wore on, the actors – who were expected to appear in character at myriad public events – began to identify more strongly with their roles. The idea of being written out, he wrote in his memoir, Forever Ambridge, felt “akin to murder”. The blurring of fact and fiction had troubling consequences. Amid overwork and sudden celebrity, the actor playing Doris Archer, Gwen Berryman, “started to slip over the edge” in the late 50s, according to Smethurt’s history of the show. She had her personal writing paper printed with the fictional address of “Brookfield Farm, Ambridge” (in reality, she lived in industrial Wolverhampton). She even stopped calling fellow actors by their real names. “Gwen Berryman believed implicitly that she was Doris Archer,” Spencer told me. This somewhat disturbing aspect of The Archers may have faded, but to many longtime listeners, among whom I include myself, The Archers certainly feels real. (This, it is true, requires the swallowing of myriad dramatic conventions, including, but not limited to, the near-universal silence of children until they reach their late teens; the lack of discussion of politics, the telly or social media; and the curious immunity of Borsetshire from the early months of Covid-19.) When, for example, the social-climbing village gossip Susan Carter was imprisoned for harbouring an escaped criminal in 1994, the then home secretary Michael Howard was petitioned by a campaign called Free the Archers One, which argued that her sentence might set a real precedent. Howard declared that he considered the incarceration overly harsh. It is a mark of The Archers’ cultural status that it seemed perfectly natural for a holder of one of Britain’s great offices of state to opine on the fate of a made-up person in a soap. A great deal of The Archers’ illusion of reality derives from its audio form, the way it “drills into people’s brains”, as O’Connor put it. “It gets under the skin: it embeds itself into people’s lives,” said Charlotte Martin, who plays Susan Carter. “Radio does this better than any other medium. Listeners create their own Ambridge.” (In real life, Martin has a second career as a psychologist; one of her research areas is auditory hallucinations.) This effect is magnified by the inexorable drip-drip of material: the show airs six 13-minute episodes a week (four under current pandemic conditions), each of which is repeated. There is also an omnibus on Sundays. If you are a Radio 4 listener, you have to be pretty quick to the off button to keep yourself entirely out of range of its charms, and pretty old for it not to have been around all of your life. I can chart my own life through The Archers: its theme-tune was the first music I recognised, according to family legend; listening with my mother after lunch was the drowsy daily ritual of the school holidays. Voices like that of Patricia Greene, who has played Jill Archer since 1957, or Trevor Harrison, Eddie Grundy since 1979, are as familiar to me as those of my own family. When I listened to archive recordings to research this piece and heard the comforting voice of Norman Painting, I wept, because it was as if I was hearing the voice of a lost relative, and because I was stepping back into memories of my younger self. Attachment to The Archers is expressed in any number of violently opinionated internet forums: there’s a paradox, or maybe a kind of yearning, in the fact that scattered, online communities cluster so strongly around a fictional community sustained, at least before the pandemic, by unlikely amounts of real, physical contact. (In Ambridge, people pop by for a cuppa with a frequency that would doubtless be oppressive in real life. Texting isn’t great on the radio.) The most venerable of these groups is UMRA, dating back to the infancy of the web, but there are many more, catering for every mood, taste or fan subgroup: Ambridge Addicts, Archers Appreciation, even the Archers Singles Social. Roifield Brown, host of the Archers fan podcast DumTeeDum (named for the theme tune’s insistent rhythm), told me that “the way to understand this world is in terms of extreme leftwing or rightwing politics. These groups are the result of endless schisms and splits.” Academic Archers, a Facebook group that came together through #Archers tweetalongs, hosts an annual conference. Four volumes of half-serious scholarly essays have resulted, with titles such as The Ambridge Paradox: Cake Consumption and Metabolic Health in a Defined Rural Population, and Foucault, Freda Fry and the Power of Silent Characters on the Radio. (Fry, after decades of muteness, was swept to her death by the Borsetshire floods of 2015, a flourish O’Connor told me he pinched from the death of Maggie Tulliver in Mill on the Floss.) Conference speakers are well-advised to hold back on showing photographs of cast members, organisers Cara Courage and Nicola Headlam told me, lest members of another longstanding fan group, Archers Anarchists, start booing (I admit that I, too, have resisted seeing pictures of the cast all my life). “The Archers is a real-life fly-on-the-wall documentary about one of the strangest villages in England,” insists the Anarchists’ website. Declaring The Archers a documentary is an arch joke. But in an important sense the show is “real” – in that it is the authentic material of its audience’s lives, of memory and emotion. When, between 2013 and 2016, the show famously ran a storyline about coercive control, there were listeners who understood the iniquity of their own domestic situations for the first time. A harrowing storyline about Alice Carter – pregnant, alcoholic, in denial – is, at the moment, taking some listeners into difficult, but deeply recognisable places. And Ambridge is inescapably part of the actors’ reality, not least in the ordinary ways that workplaces insinuate themselves into private lives: the actors who play trainee vicar Shula Hebden Lloyd and arch-capitalist Brian Aldridge are a married couple, for example. Harrison, who has played lovable chancer Eddie Grundy for 41 years, since he was 22, developed a strong bond with his on-air father, the late Edward Kelsey. “I knew how Ted was going to deliver a line,” he told me, “and he knew how I was going to deliver a line. It was like a real family.” He told me that when he acts in the studio, he sees the faces of his fellow performers – but behind them, in his imagination, the farm, or the field, or the pub where the scene is set. He listens to the show, too, at home in his own Worcestershire village. “I had the radio on on Sunday, and I closed my eyes and transported myself to Grange Farm and the Bull,” he told me. * * * And yet, of course, The Archers is not real. It is the result of a brilliantly fabricated illusion. Not for nothing was Godfrey Baseley known as “God” by the cast; the producers and writers are the deities that preside over the Ambridge universe. Sustaining the illusion of The Archers is the result of a relentless production line. Making the show, Norman Painting recalled, is “like feeding some insatiable monster, some Moloch”. The Archers is created in interlocking five-week cycles, or blocks. “Day dot,” as producer Jessica Bunch calls it, involves an all-day script meeting, usually held in the studio in Birmingham, to prepare the five weeks’ worth of episodes that will be broadcast 10 weeks later. Writers, producers and the agricultural story adviser, Sarah Swadling, come to the meeting armed with a “story pack” issued a few days earlier by producer David Payne. This details the direction of the show, family by family, farm by farm, over the whole cycle. The work of the meeting is to decide how to transform this prose outline into drama. Five out of the 12 writers on the team are assigned to write a week of scripts each. After producing a scene-by-scene synopsis, each writer has two weeks to produce a first draft of their (normally) six episodes. This is quite the deadline: Sally Wainwright, who was driving the number 73 bus in London when she joined The Archers in 1989, told me the only way she could do it was by “getting up at 5am and really putting the hours in – something I’ve done ever since”. She recalled: “You had five scenes per episode, no more than seven characters, and you were supposed to avoid two-handers if you could. You also had to use each character at least twice. But it was a fantastic discipline; it enforced a structure that really worked.” (Wainwright is perhaps the most illustrious alumna of the show, with the possible exception of actor Tamsin Greig, who still appears as the Hungary-based farmer Debbie Aldridge from time to time, and Felicity Jones, who graduated from playing Emma Carter to being nominated for an Oscar for her role as Jane Hawking in The Theory of Everything.) After the second and final drafts of the scripts are signed off, they are recorded over 10 days. Radio acting demands a specific set of techniques, all aimed at “creating a picture in somebody’s mind of something physically happening”, as Barry Farrimond, who plays Edward Grundy, put it. This requires the use of “effort noises”, to convey actions such as bending over, or sitting down – crudely, “sighing and grunting”, according to Ben Norris, who plays the 18-year-old Ben Archer. Since actors are holding scripts, the subtle art of the silent page turn must also be mastered. “Tim [Bentinck, who plays David Archer] favours a delicate turn with tension all the way along the spine and a silent drop,” Norris said. “Arthur [Hughes, who plays Ruairi Donovan] likes to tear out the pages of his script as if he’s disgusted with the writing and screw them up, creating something like a poppadom – rigid, so it doesn’t flap noisily.” The Archers studio, part of the BBC’s Birmingham base, is a curious combination of hi-tech and scruffy, filled with a miscellany of surfaces and objects that magically combine to create the sonic impression of meadows, pig sheds and farmhouse kitchens. A “live” area is covered with parquet flooring conveying the acoustic of large interior spaces: St Stephen’s church, or the banqueting room at Lower Loxley, the Jacobean-fronted pile of the Pargetters. A carpeted “soft” area is used for bedrooms, sitting rooms, the seating area of the Bull; here are some nondescript plastic chairs and an old leather-effect sofa. Leading off from it is a “kitchen” with a lino floor, a row of kitchen units and two sinks: a smart Belfast sink for the grander families and an ordinary metal one for less elevated households. A “dead” area, lined with foam acoustic panels to cut out all trace of echo, is used for exterior locations; beyond that is “the snail”, a short corridor from which characters can seem to enter scenes from a distance, or sit in “the naughty corner” to record the distant half of a telephone call. As the scenes are recorded, a further, ghostly figure is present, performing a curious shadow-play alongside the actors. Vanessa Nuttall creates foley effects – added sounds that, alongside recorded material dropped in from a vast digital library, create the illusion of Ambridge. Known in BBC-speak as a spot-effects artist (since the effects are made “on the spot”, rather than in post-production), her private term for herself is a “spot ninja”, since she creeps around scenes like a “stealth warrior”. If the characters Harrison and Fallon are in bed together, for example, Nuttall will be in there with them, rustling their duvet. If Shula is out riding, Nuttall will be at her side, jangling a bridle. If a meal is in progress at Bridge Farm, she will be creeping around the table, appearing at an actor’s side from time to time to scrape a fork gently against a plate. According to Barry Farrimond, “There’s a really nice synergy that should happen between the actor and the spot-effects person: their movements and your effort-sounds have to synchronise perfectly. There’s no point me making an effort-sound and three seconds later that being expressed through an object. As an actor you are reading the script, watching the spot-effects person out of the corner of your eye, being aware of where the mic is and where your fellow actors are, and how all of that maps together.” Sometimes sound effects are created by the object itself – only a real Aga door closing can adequately communicate its particular solid clink, Nuttall told me. At other times, a sound must be impersonated, either for practical reasons or because it will not successfully “read” when created by the real thing. Piles of old half-inch magnetic tape become undergrowth or straw. An ancient ironing board, opened and closed, stands in for the farm gates. Hands are squelched through a bowl of yoghurt when a lamb is born. When Helen Archer stabbed her husband, it was a knife through a watermelon, and when brothers Ed and William Grundy have one of their punch-ups, a spot-effects artist will be smashing the living daylights out of a cabbage. The day the script required a canine character to eat crisps, Nutall gamely chomped, doglike, through a packet. She even dials a mobile phone when someone makes a call, convinced that however subtle the sound, every detail counts in creating the world of The Archers in the minds of its 5 million listeners. Nevertheless, Farrimond told me: “For all that how constructed it is, when you are in the zone and you are there with those other characters, The Archers is real.” * * * Time itself is a character in The Archers. The story unspools at the pace of real life; its actors age with it, as do its listeners. Its unity of time offers the illusion that we are eavesdropping on lived lives (an aspect of the show that also offers dramatic opportunities, since we so often know more about events than the characters). It also creates the impression that life in Ambridge might even chug along in the absence of its makers. “Just because it doesn’t go out on a Saturday, it doesn’t mean things aren’t happening in Ambridge on a Saturday,” Jessica Bunch told me. “If we stopped the show for a year, I have a pretty good idea of what everyone would be doing all that time. We’d pick them all up again … It exists without all of us, in a funny way.” The day-by-day pace, and continuity of characters, lends the show a kind of resilience. If life takes you away from The Archers for a year or five, it will feel familiar when you return. “I don’t listen to The Archers religiously,” said Wainwright, “but if I drop in I always feel like I know where I am, and who everybody is, and if I don’t, it’s not long before they are talking to someone I know.” TV soaps, with their responsibilities to ratings, are more reliant on the kind of sensational stories that “ravage through characters”, as Wainwright put it, departing after they have served a particular narrative. The Archers, by contrast, with its dynastic focus on a handful of families, can afford to go slow. Once, in Vanessa Whitburn’s time, Tony Archer lost his glasses for an entire year, which became a ridiculous, enjoyable leitmotif. Listeners often claim that this banal, nothing-much-happening quality of The Archers is what they particularly treasure: the passing of the year, the seasonal rituals repeated. But the real-time quality can also bring significant gains for more dramatic storylines – such as the agonising, three-year unfurling of the Helen Archer and Rob Titchener coercive control plot, until Helen finally cracked and stabbed her abusive husband. It is not just this feeling of presentness that gives power to The Archers, but also the ever-deepening territory of its past. The expanding archive of The Archers operates as a kind of “Cumaean Sibyl’s cave”, according to its current editor Jeremy Howe: you can enter it and return with encoded clues to the characters’ possible futures. In practical terms, this archive – which is also the collective memory of its creators and listeners – exists as 20,000 typed index cards, transferred in recent years to a computer database. From here the writers can glean details necessary for continuity: the fact that Brian Aldridge doesn’t like meringue, for instance, or that the Woolleys’ late Staffordshire terrier, Captain, was partial to smoky bacon crisps. But they can also extract “real” memories, such as the books Ruairi Donovan liked as a four-year-old, which, when neatly deployed, can help round out a character’s psyche years later. The past, said Bunch, gives the show “its own momentum … We are the gardeners of this thing, and we plant stuff in different places and shift things around, but we are never starting from scratch.” Nevertheless, it is clear that the editors of the show – its gods – reshape the landscape substantially to reflect their own personalities and preoccupations. William Smethurst’s Ambridge of the 70s and 80s was, for example, identifiably a Tory world, one of conservative class distinctions and gentle social comedy. His impulses, said O’Connor, came from “Austen and Stella Gibbons”. Vanessa Whitburn, who edited from 1991-2013, came in during the era of the big TV soaps such as EastEnders and Brookside. She wanted, she told me, “to re-galvanise the programme. I felt it should have big stories – it had got quiet about that. I was very clear I wanted to have a story about Elizabeth Archer having an abortion. I like stories that allow you to debate the grey areas of life, the pros and cons of what people do.” In Whitburn’s more socially conscious era, for example, Ambridge acquired its first significant non-white character in the form of solicitor Usha Gupta, who was subject to racist attacks. The Grundys were evicted from their farm and rehoused in the ironically named Meadow Rise, a Borchester housing estate. This had the effect – at last – of putting working-class characters at the tragic heart of the show. O’Connor was then a young scriptwriter; he borrowed a motif from Hardy’s Jude the Obscure, he told me, when he had Joe Grundy kill his son’s ferrets with a hammer, incompatible as the creatures were with cramped council accommodation. (Like the murder of Jude’s children, it was “done because we are too menny”.) When O’Connor came to edit the show himself, from 2013-16, there was more creative plundering from the English novel. He put the Archers family and Brookfield at the centre of the action, because: “That’s your Wuthering Heights, your Thornfield, your Mansfield Park, and you need to fight over that.” Aside from presiding over Helen Archer’s coercive control story, O’Connor imperilled Ambridge with floods and a trunk road, and put Brookfield up for sale – almost too much plot for some listeners. By contrast, the current editor, Jeremy Howe, told me he was pulling back from the “very issues-based, or story-based” approaches of his immediate predecessors. “I am character-based,” he said. “The goldmine that is The Archers resides in the characters and the actors who play them. It’s about people.” The futures of these characters are dictated, in practical terms, by a long-term planning document presided over by Bunch, which sets out, month by month, what will happen to each family, business, farm, and character, sometimes many years in the future. In practice, the document exists in a state of flux, affected by a number of factors. These include, naturally, the changing and capricious whims of the makers – but also unintended consequences created by short-term plot devices, unexpected chemistry between particular actors that might spark off new storylines, and real-world events such as Covid-19. O’Connor told me that, had he stayed at The Archers, he would have turned Pip Archer, the future inheritor of Brookfield, into a kind of lonely Bathsheba Everdene figure, beset by dramatic and destructive romances, like the heroine of Hardy’s Far from the Madding Crowd. He also had plans for the charming posh boy Freddie Pargetter, son of the unfortunate Nigel (who died falling off his roof). “My story was going to be that Freddie burns down Lower Loxley, which would then be taken over by hoteliers. He would have to become a businessman to buy the family home back. But you would have to spend 15 years with the story to get that moment.” * * * Brexit is exactly the kind of unstable, real-world event that will affect the characters’ futures; it needs to be accommodated within the story-world of The Archers, not least because the exit from the EU will have such a significant impact on British farming. But so far it has been recognised through only minor motifs, such as the difficulty of finding seasonal fruit pickers. Sarah Swadling, the agricultural story adviser, commissioned an economist to model the effects of a various kinds of post-EU deal (or no deal) on the Ambridge farms. This, Howe told me, will help inform long-term, post-Brexit stories. But this most noisy, divisive and bitter of British debates has so far been all but inaudible. We don’t even know how most of the characters voted – only that Brookfield patriarch David Archer voted to stay, and gay progressive farmer Adam Macy voted to leave. Fans can surely be forgiven if they have enjoyed a space on the radio where talk of Brexit does not have to be endured – I certainly have. Nevertheless, its absence is a clue to an important aspect of the show: that despite its commitment to “real life overheard”, and to Baseley’s early insistence on keeping the show as topical possible, fissures such as Brexit, and arguments over identity politics, have driven themselves so deep into Britain’s soul that the nation is unrepresentable in the form of “Ambridge”. And so The Archers is a parallel universe – an impossible, liberal never-never land of the shires. The Chinese-born writer and film-maker Xiaolu Guo has observed that the drama, with its apparently apolitical presentation of “an oasis of rural England outside the currents of history” is really offering a supremely political position, a peculiarly British ideology: one that privileges endless indirectness and lethargy, endless deflection of real anger and debate, and endless acceptance of the status quo. Limited outbursts of British revolutionary spirit – such as 70s punk – have been, she wrote, “a jagged reaction to the kettle-boiling and cake-baking families who dwelt eternally in the village of Ambridge”. From its first episode in 1951, The Archers “opened a window on to a more desirable world”, wrote Norman Painting, one that offered an antidote to the “apocalyptic, doomsday feeling” that lingered after the war. Ambridge was, and remains, a place to which listeners can retreat: plausible-sounding, but so much safer than real life. There are serious limits on what can be allowed to happen there. Ken Loach’s version of Ambridge – let’s imagine it starring Emma Carter, with an exposé of conditions in the chicken factory and a hard look at the rural housing crisis – wouldn’t quite wash. Nor would Matt Groening’s Ambridge, for a million reasons, including the fact that “you can’t build a nuclear power station on Lakey Hill,” as editor Jeremy Howe put it. (A similar attitude governed The Archers’ depiction of Covid-19: “If you want bodies piled up in front of St Stephen’s church, The Archers is not going to provide it,” he told me back in May.) The ideology of The Archers, in fact, was most clearly set forth as long ago as 1955, after its most sensational episode went out – the death of the glamorous Grace Archer in a fire in the stables at Grey Gables, a broadcasting event that utterly eclipsed the opening night of ITV, Britain’s first commercial television channel. The significant part of the story was not so much the death of the young wife in her husband’s arms, but the dialogue that took place the following day between patriarch Dan Archer (the father-in-law of the dead woman) and his daughter, Christine, who has been played for 67 years by Lesley Saweard. Addressing his distressed daughter, Dan said: “… Me and Simon, there … in the milking shed … we’ve got the same feelings as you and everybody else, but we’ve still had to carry on milking … And all we can do is the same as folks somehow manage to do in similar circumstances. Just carry on.” “Just carry on” is the real story of The Archers. People may die, disaster may strike, but life will endure. There will always be cows to milk, there will be lambs born in the spring, there will be harvest in the autumn. The months roll, the years turn, and The Archers is still there, embodying its own ideology, by itself continuing and enduring. And in this fictional world, everything will be all right, even if it won’t – it really won’t – out here in the real world, in our cold and fractured world. “I don’t know what the final episode of The Archers will be,” said Howe, “and I hope I’m never tasked with it. But whatever happens, it will” – and he slapped his kitchen table twice for emphasis – “end well. All will be well and all will be well and all manner of things will be well.” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here. • This article was amended on 5 January 2021.

A trawl through parliament’s register of interests suggests Conservative politicians are far more likely to accept support from such sources. The Guardian is not suggesting MPs were paid for their votes, which is forbidden by law, but the scorecards highlight the legitimate lobbying activities of outside organisations who have most to lose from action to stop global heating. The data is included on the MPs’ climate scorecards so voters can ask questions of their parliamentary representatives. Salaries, shareholdings and donations from fossil fuel companies Nadhim Zahawi, the Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon, received more than £1m from fossil fuel companies, all of it declared and legitimate. Zahawi spent much of his parliamentary career working as chief strategy officer for Gulf Keystone Petroleum, which paid him £52,325 in backpay in October 2015 and a monthly salary of £20,000 from October 2015, rising to almost £30,000 a month in August 2017, and some £330,000 in bonus payments. He stopped working for the company on becoming a government minister in 2018 (at which time he received a final payment of £116,000). He also declared shareholdings in Genel Energy, an Anglo-Turkish oil and gas exploration and production company, and a donation from Amjad Bseisu, the chief executive of the UK-based oil company EnQuest. Until August 2015 the former oil exploration company Afren and the former Canadian oil company Talisman, which was a major producer from the Alberta tar sands, were clients of Zahawi &amp; Zahawi, a business advisory service. The Guardian contacted Zahawi’s office for comment, but received no reply. Alan Duncan, a former Foreign Office minister, also has close ties to the petroleum industry. After leaving a post in the international development ministry, Duncan, while still an MP, registered as a non-executive chairman of Fujairah Refining in the United Arab Emirates, for which he received £8,000 a month for a job involving three weekend meetings a year. Along with a severance package, payments totalled £90,000. The majority owner of that refinery is the energy company Vitol, owned by the UK businessman Ian Taylor. Duncan formerly headed the Conservative Middle East Council, which arranges trips for Tory MPs with funding from businessmen with ties to Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region. He has made multiple trips to Oman and Saudi Arabia as a guest of the host government or its supporters, and has received gifts of a watch or cufflinks on a number of occasions from the sultanate of Oman. A former employee of Royal Dutch Shell, prior to 2009 Duncan declared incomes from Arawak Energy (an undisclosed amount), a company involved in oil exploration and production, and Harcourt Consultants, a firm he established to advise clients on the oil and gas industry. Duncan told the Guardian: “There is no logic in suggesting that by taking an interest in the Middle East that someone is against carbon reduction. Likewise, all of the votes listed were directed by party whipping not by any supposed link to Middle Eastern politics.” Others who receive incomes from the carbon-producing sector include Alistair Burt, whose 2015 register includes £5,000 income for work as a non-executive director of the oil exploration company President Energy; John Hayes, Conservative MP for South Holland and The Deepings, who has declared an expected £50,000-a-year salary from an oil firm, BB Energy; and Conor Burns, a trade minister, who has declared £10,000 per quarter since 2011 for 10 hours’ work for Trant Engineering, an oil and gas engineering firm, totalling more than £300,000. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, has ignored the Conservative whip on more than 120 occasions, mostly on issues related to Europe, but he has generally followed the party line in voting 10 times against measures that would bring emissions down. He has cast doubt on the reliability of scientific forecasts and blamed “alarmism” for high energy prices. The Guardian contacted Rees-Mogg’s office for comment, but received no reply. There are few direct donations from fossil fuel firms. Michael Gove, the current chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and former environment minister, received £10,000 from Tullow Oil in 2010. Climate contrarian donors Three of the biggest donors to the Conservative party are funders or board members of the climate science sceptic thinktank the Global Warming Policy Foundation: The Australian hedge fund manager Michael Hintze has donated cash to at least 13 current and former Conservative MPs, including £5,000 to Boris Johnson and Phillip Hammond, office expenses for David Davis as well as a donation of £2,000 to his Afghan project, and a transatlantic flight for Liam Fox. He has given other MPs Chelsea football tickets, a Vatican trip and a sprinkling of tickets to black-tie fundraising dinners, including to Theresa May. First Corporate Shipping, which operates Bristol Port and is co-owned by the climate sceptic Terence Mordaunt, donated £25,000 to both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during the recent Conservative leadership contest. Greenpeace said the two candidates in the runoff were being “bankrolled by a director of Britain’s leading climate denial group”. The currency trader Neil Record donates mostly to the former energy and climate minister and now health minister Matthew Hancock (whose voting score stands at 17%), who has registered £24,000 from this one source on seven occasions between 2010 and 2017. The West Suffolk MP has voted against solar subsidies and onshore wind, and supported fracking. Expenses-paid trips to petrostates Saudi Arabia is a major lure for UK parliamentarians despite the oil state’s reputation as a major obstacle at global climate talks. More than 40 MPs have made expenses-paid visits to the kingdom since 2008, the majority of them from the Conservative party. Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates also regularly invite MPs, and Azerbaijan has hosted trips for at least 11 MPs. Although there can be many valid reasons for overseas visits – some MPs go to lobby the kingdom over its dismal human rights record – the fact that they are often paid by hosts has led to questions by watchdog organisations. Steve Goodrich, research manager at Transparency International, said the number of MPs who accepted visits to Azerbaijan – a petrostate with a big corruption and human rights problem – was astonishing. “Unlike political donations, there are no controls on foreign sources paying for parliamentarians’ visits abroad. Saudi Arabia or Azerbaijian can legally ferry out as many MPs as they like on ‘fact-finding missions’, which often look like a crude attempt to burnish the government’s reputation,” he said. Transparency International is campaigning for MPs to be prohibited from taking such trips. Football, rugby and dinner tickets from airports and oil firms Some of the declared interests are relatively small, but show how ties develop through hospitality at sporting events. Eighteen MPs – all but two of them from the Conservative party – have received tickets paid for by fossil fuel companies, transport companies or climate contrarians. This seems to be a key strategy of the aviation industry. Stanstead airport paid for Priti Patel’s match tickets for Arsenal v Crystal Palace. London City airport charitably allowed Bob Neill to attend three West Ham United matches; Alec Shelbrooke to attend two games of the same team; Crispin Blunt to watch Six Nations rugby and James Brokenshire to see an unspecified football game. Manchester Airports Group stumped up for Caroline Nokes to watch England play New Zealand at rugby, while Cardiff airport treated Alun Cairns to a Welsh rugby match. Airbus generously invited three politicians – John Howell, Robert Courts and Stephen Doughty (Labour) – to attend the Royal International Air Tattoo. Oil companies also showed similar hospitality. BP paid for Wimbledon tickets for Graham Brady, while ExxonMobil provided tickets to the SNP politician Douglas Chapman for a Burns supper and the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo. How the leaders fare Boris Johnson recorded the worst possible score, zero. The prime minister, who became an MP in 2015, was only eligible to vote in five of the 16 votes: the renewable energy levy, decarbonisation targets, carbon capture and storage, onshore wind, and vehicle emissions tax. In every case he voted against a positive climate impact. He did not exercise his vote on Heathrow expansion, though he had verbally opposed it. His previous record in this field is patchy. As foreign secretary, Johnson cut the number of climate attaches. As mayor of London, he shrank the congestion zone. As a columnist for the Telegraph, his views have been ambivalent, notably once writing that “global leaders were driven by a primitive fear that the present ambient warm weather is somehow caused by humanity; and that fear – as far as I understand the science – is equally without foundation”. Johnson has accepted support from several sources that are sceptical about climate action. When he ran for leadership of the Conservative party earlier this year, he received a £25,000 donation from First Corporate Shipping, which is run by Mordaunt, a director of the Global Warming Policy Forum (GWPF), which denies the need for urgent climate action. He has previously accepted money from Hintze, another donor to the GWPF, and gone on trips paid for by the government of Saudi Arabia and the American Enterprise Institute, a US thinktank that plays down climate concerns and lobbies for environmental deregulation. A Conservative party spokeswoman said the methodology was unfair. “Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are taking world-leading action on climate change. We have reduced emissions by a quarter since coming to office in 2010, the fastest reduction by any G20 nation, and boosted renewables to record levels.” Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, scored 92%, above the average of 90% for the shadow cabinet. He participated in 13 of the 16 climate votes. In all but one (nuclear energy subsidies), he supported the side most likely to lower emissions. The Labour leader also proposed the declaration of a climate emergency passed by the House of Commons this year. This is not included in any of the scorecards because the motion was approved by general assent, which means there are no records of who was present or which side MPs supported. Labour MPs were far less likely than Conservatives to accept gifts or money related to fossil fuel interests. This is partly because they are in opposition and largely because they tend to rely more on donations from trade unions, most of which usually support climate action. The exception is GMB, which started out as the gas workers’ union and continues to support fracking. Unite has also endorsed the expansion of Heathrow airport because it will create jobs. Very few Labour MPs are considered climate sceptics. The standout exception is Graham Stringer, who serves as an unremunerated director of the GWPF. Jo Swinson scored 50%. The Liberal Democrat leader was present for eight votes and voted positively in four. During the coalition government, the party’s MPs voted against decarbonisation targets and low-carbon subsidies, and twice voted for fracking permits. However, the Lib Dems also supported a 2011 green Energy Act that is not included in this analysis – it was passed without a vote. The Lib Dems now advocate more progressive climate policies. Their more recently elected MPs have higher scores because they were not in parliament during the coalition period. Caroline Lucas scored 92%. The only Green MP in parliament has led from the front on the climate issue. The representative for Brighton voted positively in 11 out of the 12 divisions. The reason she did not score 100% in our analysis is that, in the 2013 vote on nuclear power subsidies, she put wider environmental concerns (risks of radioactive contamination, waste and accidents) ahead of emissions, and argued that the subsidies would be better spent on other, safe forms of renewables. • Additional reporting by Lucinda Campbell, Nur Pirbhai, Christine Parry and Hanako Lowry"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/shortcuts/2018/sep/11/how-many-tears-in-a-bottle-of-gin-why-job-interviewers-ask-such-terrible-questions","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-09-11T17:07:57Z","webTitle":"‘How many tears in a bottle of gin?’: Why job interviewers ask such terrible questions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2018/sep/11/how-many-tears-in-a-bottle-of-gin-why-job-interviewers-ask-such-terrible-questions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/shortcuts/2018/sep/11/how-many-tears-in-a-bottle-of-gin-why-job-interviewers-ask-such-terrible-questions","fields":{"headline":"‘How many tears in a bottle of gin?’: Why job interviewers ask such terrible questions","bodyText":"How many cabs in New York City? How many tears in a bottle of gin? These aren’t just the lyrics to a song by the Australian musician Paul Kelly. They are the kind of questions you are likely to be asked during a job interview. In recent years, it has become common for bosses to ask interview questions that are impossible to answer. There is no right answer to these “brainteasers”. Instead, they are supposed to help an interviewer gauge an applicant’s reasoning skills. What matters is how you come to the conclusion, not what conclusion you arrive at. Brainteasers started out life in management consultancy firms. Young graduates hoping to join the company would be asked: “How many phone booths are there in Manhattan?” They weren’t expected to blurt out a random number – instead, they were expected to show they could solve even the most obtuse problem. As consultants swarmed across other organisations, they bought their inscrutable questions with them. Now, people applying for a job in a call centre can expect to be asked how a nuclear power plant works. While many bosses swear by brainteasers, a research paper published in the journal Applied Psychology found they are useless for spotting the best candidate for the job. What they are great for is boosting the ego of the person asking the question. The study’s findings are not surprising. Studies have repeatedly found that most methods of selecting job candidates are hopelessly flawed. Job interviews are among the worst way of picking the right person for the job. The results of this research raise the question: if interviews are bad at picking the right person for the job, what are they there for? One hunch I have is that many job selection processes are thinly disguised forms of torture, designed to make applicants feel worthless and employers feel like intellectual giants. Think about the extensive list of personal skills required for even the most lowly entry-level job. Or those painful assessment centres where you are supposed to play nice with people you are competing against to get the job. And then there are the firms that ask applicants to make a showreel to convey how awesome they are. All these exercises seem designed not to get the best person for the role, but to assure the boss how great they are, and remind you just how lucky you would be to get this boring job."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/oct/01/german-minister-backs-plan-to-cut-down-forest-to-build-coal-mine","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-01T15:45:29Z","webTitle":"German energy secretary backs forest clearance to build coal mine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/01/german-minister-backs-plan-to-cut-down-forest-to-build-coal-mine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/oct/01/german-minister-backs-plan-to-cut-down-forest-to-build-coal-mine","fields":{"headline":"German energy secretary backs forest clearance to build coal mine","bodyText":"Controversial plans to chop down a German forest to build a vast coal mine should proceed because Germany needs the polluting fuel to keep the lights on, according to the chief of the country’s state secretary for energy. Dozens of treehouses built and occupied by campaigners for years have been recently cleared by police to make way for plans by energy firm RWE, which owns Hambach forest near Cologne, to expand its nearby opencast coal mine. Environmental groups have rallied against the project, which they argue would lock the country into higher carbon emissions, just as a government-appointed commission simultaneously debates a timeline for Germany to phase out coal. “It should go ahead,” said Thomas Bareiß when asked by the Guardian if the Hambach clearance should proceed when the “coal exit commission” is still deliberating. Bareiß said RWE had “a right to do this”, noted that the regional government had already agreed the clearance and said Germany needed the mine to maintain its energy supplies in the short term. “We still need lignite [brown coal] for our reliable coal supply.” He conceded the highly polluting form of coal was disliked by most of the German public but said extracting lignite had a long tradition in some regions. “In general lignite is unpopular. People think it is dirty.” But Bareiß said Germany, which sources nearly 40% of power from coal, would still need its coal plants in the early 2020s. That is partly because Germany is also due to shut its last nuclear power station in 2022. “At end of the decade there is more possibility to shut coal [plants],” he said. The coal exit commission, whose members range from energy companies to Greenpeace, has been tasked with agreeing dates for phasing out Germany’s reliance on coal power stations, ahead of a UN climate summit in Poland this December. Observers think that a compromise cut-off date at some time in the 2030s will be the most likely outcome. Bareiß told an industry audience in London that getting off coal would be a “very expensive transition” but it was necessary and would “work in the long run”. He cautioned that Germany could not move too fast on renewable energy projects, because of multibillion-euro upgrades required to take power from windfarms in the country’s north to the south. Those upgrades are behind target, causing bottlenecks and “large costs”, Bareiß said at the BNEF Future of Energy summit. Fabian Huebner of the Climate Alliance Germany, which is backing a demonstration this Saturday against Hambach’s clearance, said: “Scientists agree: the brown coal under the Hambach Forest will not be needed for the security of electricity supply in Germany.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/sep/29/hinkley-point-ministers-sign-go-ahead-for-nuclear-power-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-29T16:44:03Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point: ministers sign go-ahead for nuclear power plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/29/hinkley-point-ministers-sign-go-ahead-for-nuclear-power-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/sep/29/hinkley-point-ministers-sign-go-ahead-for-nuclear-power-plant","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point: ministers sign go-ahead for nuclear power plant","bodyText":"The UK has signed its £18bn contract with France and China to build the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, giving the final go-ahead for construction at the site in Somerset. The deal was finalised at a low-key ceremony in London, just two months after Theresa May alarmed her French and Chinese counterparts by putting the entire project under review. EDF, the French nuclear contractor, and its Chinese partners had to cancel their previous plans for a signing ceremony at the last minute when the review was announced in July. The project finally got approval this month, after Greg Clark, the business secretary, announced there would be some new restrictions on future investments in critical infrastructure if there were national security concerns. Clark attended the signing ceremony on behalf of the UK, alongside Jean-Bernard Lévy, the chairman of EDF, and He Yu, chair of China General Nuclear. The business secretary said it was a “crucial moment in the UK’s first new nuclear power station for a generation and follows new measures put in place by government to strengthen security and ownership”. The event was also attended by Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French foreign minister, and Nur Bekri, a senior official at the National Energy Administration of China. He Yu said it signifies “CGN’s commitment to the UK as one of the world’s leading developers and operators of nuclear power. This flagship programme is a triple win for China, Britain, and France and is a culmination of years of cooperation between the three countries. CGN looks forward to providing UK consumers with safe, reliable and sustainable energy and maximising opportunities for UK suppliers and the UK workforce.” Unions welcomed the development, saying thousands of skilled jobs would now be created, benefiting firms across the UK. It is expected to produce 7GW of electricity when fully operational, enough to power 6m homes and provide 7% of Britain’s electricity needs for 60 years. However, Greenpeace said it was “no wonder the UK government has opted for a ‘champagne-free’ signing ceremony away from public view”. The environmental group said: “With a stroke of the pen ministers are signing away billions of pounds of billpayers’ money to a project they know is plagued by legal, financial and technical problems. In the unlikely event Hinkley is working some time in the second half of the next decade, renewable energy will be much cheaper, yet British consumers will still be forced to pay over the odds for nuclear power. It’ll be like being locked into an expensive fixed-rate mortgage as interest rates plummet.” Under the new controls, EDF will not be able to sell on its stake in Hinkley without permission. For future projects, the UK government will own a “special share” that means it will have a veto over owners if there are national security concerns. In a sign the new requirements do not appear to be overly stringent, both EDF and CGN said they were delighted by the approval, which they claimed would let them proceed with Hinkley and their wider plans for nuclear construction in the UK in future. The government published documents detailing the contractual obligations it has entered into, including a “value for money assessment” that allowed ministers to make the decision to proceed with the project. According to the documents, UK-based businesses would benefit from more than 60% of the cost of the project and 26,000 jobs and apprenticeships would be created during construction and after its opening. Justin Bowden, the GMB union’s national secretary for energy, said: “With collective sighs of relief all round, it is fantastic news that the Hinkley deal is finally signed and work can start on this vital piece of UK infrastructure. “The formal go-ahead for Hinkley is the first serious sign that UK plc is open for business post-Brexit and holding a secret ceremony did not do justice to such a historic event. Attention must now straight away shift to Bradwell B and Sizewell C.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/jul/03/ofgem-energy-price-cap-shows-mays-help-for-millions-is-off-the-boil","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-03T19:07:18Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C: the government should start planning alternatives | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/jul/03/ofgem-energy-price-cap-shows-mays-help-for-millions-is-off-the-boil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/jul/03/ofgem-energy-price-cap-shows-mays-help-for-millions-is-off-the-boil","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C: the government should start planning alternatives","bodyText":"Hinkley Point C in Somerset will cost £1.5bn more than planned, says developer EDF, and completion could be delayed by 15 months beyond the 2025 target date. In one sense, this news lacks any element of surprise. EDF only seems to build nuclear reactors that are late and over-budget, as witnessed in Finland and on its own patch at Flamanville in Normandy. Yet the timing of EDF’s “clarifications” is a shock. It is very early in the life of this £18.1bn (now £19.6bn, possibly rising to £20.3bn) project to be recasting the numbers. The tricky stages of construction, like pouring the right mix of concrete, lie ahead. The additional costs relate to mundane matters, such as “a better understanding” of UK regulators’ requirements and “the volume and sequencing of work on site”. These are planning areas in which EDF would surely have made allowances for uncertainties. That all that slack, and more, has been used up is puzzling. Sceptics within EDF who argued that Hinkley is too big and too financially risky will feel vindicated already. EDF’s projected rate of return on the project was never high at 9%; now it is down to 8.5% and will fall to 8.2% if the delays materialise. Still, it’s a French problem, right? Didn’t the UK government insulate us by making EDF and its Chinese co-financier shoulder the construction risks? Wasn’t that the trade-off for the UK guaranteeing to buy all Hinkley’s electricity for 35 years at twice the current wholesale price? Well, yes, that’s how the contract is structured, and EDF’s UK boss was full of reassurance on Monday that UK taxpayers remain protected. But no contract of this size is ever so straightforward, as the National Audit Office pointed out in its blistering report last week. “If the HPC [Hinkley Point C] project or developer runs into difficulties, the UK government could come under pressure to provide more support or take on additional risk, particularly given HPC’s potential importance to ensuring energy security,” said the NAO. That dire circumstance remains some way off, but it can’t be ignored. What if real engineering problems follow? What if EDF’s projected returns fall to 7%, which would be closer to the company’s cost of capital? Would EDF seek better terms knowing that Hinkley is scheduled to provide 7% of our electricity? “The [UK] government will hold a stronger negotiating position if it maintains alternative ways of ensuring energy security if HPC runs late or is not completed,” said the NAO. That advice was sound last week, now it looks prescient. It is bad enough that UK consumers are locked into this “expensive and risky” project, as the NAO called Hinkley. It would be calamitous if we end up being bullied into paying more. Ministers need to draw up a proper contingency plan – starting now. Ofgem plan shows May’s ‘help for millions’ is off the boil This is how political U-turns are performed in the energy sector – not with a visible yank on the steering wheel but with some vague words from the secretary of state designed to disguise the manoeuvre in hand. As Ofgem announced a limited price cap that will apply only to yet-to-be-defined “vulnerable” customers, the business and energy secretary, Greg Clark, attempted to suggest the government could yet go further. “I will consider next steps when I have received Ofgem’s proposed actions,” he declared. Next steps? Clark, like everyone else, can see that the gap between Ofgem’s proposal and Theresa May’s promise of a universal price cap is huge. It won’t be closed by a few steps. Ofgem’s proposed “safeguard tariff” is modest and targeted, probably at households that qualify for warm home discounts. May’s idea would have overthrown the entire regulatory philosophy of the past 20 years. What Clark is really looking forward to seeing, one suspects, is everybody forgetting that the prime minister once promised to “protect around 17 million families on standard variable tariffs” by knocking £100 off their energy bills every year. Don’t blame Ofgem, incidentally, for declining to live up to the Conservative party’s election hype. The regulator has technical powers to propose a universal price cap, but it also knows that such a muscular approach would invite an appeal by the energy suppliers to the Competition and Markets Authority. Since the CMA last year rejected a full price cap, the appeal would probably succeed. Parliament, in other words, is the only body that can make a universal cap stick. Clark’s wishy-washy response suggests the idea is virtually dead for now, killed by resistance from those Tory MPs who viewed the proposal as anti-market. Shares in Centrica, owner of British Gas, rose nearly 2%. Investors can see the political U-turn happening."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/dec/11/the-window-is-narrowing-scientists-urge-action-at-un-climate-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-11T14:08:40Z","webTitle":"'Window is narrowing': scientists urge action at UN climate talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/11/the-window-is-narrowing-scientists-urge-action-at-un-climate-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/dec/11/the-window-is-narrowing-scientists-urge-action-at-un-climate-talks","fields":{"headline":"'Window is narrowing': scientists urge action at UN climate talks","bodyText":"Scientists have laid down the gauntlet for political leaders as the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, wrestles with the challenge of cutting emissions without sparking social tensions like those seen recently in France. The UN climate talks – known as COP24 and the most important since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015 – aim to set a new rulebook for governments to reduce greenhouse gases and to raise ambitions, after warnings of dire consequences if global warming rises more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The climate crisis is already here and the risks are growing, said Hoesung Lee, chair of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, who led a study by thousands of scientists on ways to avoid 1.5C of warming via accelerated transition from fossil fuels. “The IPCC made a tremendous collective effort to bring you the best scientific knowledge on the subject. We tell you limiting warming to 1.5C is possible but the window is narrowing,” Lee told a plenary on Tuesday. “The scientific community has delivered, now it is up to governments to take action.” There has been fierce debate about what to do with the study. All but four of the world’s governments want to formally welcome the 1.5C report to spur a more ambitious shift towards renewable energy. However, four oil producing nations – the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait – said the study should merely be “noted”. This issue has overshadowed the past few days of the talks in Poland. Saudi Arabia has claimed there are “gaps and uncertainties” in the study. The US held a long-planned event promoting coal, gas, oil and nuclear power. In a thinly veiled criticism of such tactics, Laurent Fabius, a former prime minister of France and president of the 2015 Paris climate talks, told the plenary that political leaders would play a negative role if they were “not only somnambulists but spoilers”. He noted that global emissions rose by 2% this year, when they need to decline if warming is to be kept to a less dangerous level. “Let us be clear, the real world is not on track. We need to do more and to do it faster,” Fabius said. “The IPCC 1.5C report shows the tremendous importance of every half degree and the disastrous consequences of missing that boundary.” But many delegates said more attention should be focused on the social challenges of rapid change, as workers in old industries, such as coal, lose their jobs and the price of fossil fuels is pushed higher to stimulate the transition to alternative energies. Without greater consideration of how the costs and benefits could be equally shared there could be a violent backlash, as France has experienced with the gilets jaunes protests that were initially about a planned rise in an eco-tax on petrol. Jonathan Pershing, a former US climate envoy, said technology and the markets would drive change, and it was already cheaper to build a new renewable power plant than a new coal or gas plant. “But you have to think about how to manage it. What happens to people who no longer have jobs from the old economy in the new economy? How do you think about new opportunities and the training you give young people? If you close down old facilities, how do you do it in a manner that keeps the communities alive and helps maintain the traditions and cultural structures?” Pershing said. “We don’t do it very often so we don’t have much experience. No report tells us how to manage the political difficulties. We need to manage the transitions. They’re hard.” This was echoed by Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, who said it was important for governments to separate raising tax revenue from addressing climate change. “The yellow vest implications are huge and show the danger if we take wrong moves,” he said. “We haven’t paid enough attention on the short-term impacts [of putting a price on carbon]. The environment movement needs to look at itself in the mirror.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/apr/22/russia-ukraine-war-satellite-images-appear-to-show-mass-graves-near-mariupol-zelenskiy-says-ukraine-needs-7bn-a-month-in-aid-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-23T05:56:02Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: UN secretary general set to meet Putin and Zelenskiy – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/apr/22/russia-ukraine-war-satellite-images-appear-to-show-mass-graves-near-mariupol-zelenskiy-says-ukraine-needs-7bn-a-month-in-aid-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/apr/22/russia-ukraine-war-satellite-images-appear-to-show-mass-graves-near-mariupol-zelenskiy-says-ukraine-needs-7bn-a-month-in-aid-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: UN secretary general set to meet Putin and Zelenskiy – as it happened","bodyText":"Thank you for following our live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

Russian forces “continue to block our units in the area of the Azovstal plant and to launch air strikes around the city,” it said. It also said a unit of engineers had arrived in order to work on the port’s infrastructure. Eight enemy attacks had been defeated in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, and nine tanks, a fuel tanker and other military equipment had been destroyed. “Heavy fighting” continues to take place in Mariupol, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update, despite Russia’s “stated conquest” of the southern port city. The fighting was “frustrating Russian attempts to capture the city thus further slowing their desired progress in the Donbas,” it said. “Despite increased activity, Russian forces have made no major gains in the last 24 hours as Ukrainian counter-attacks continue to hinder their efforts,” it added. “Russian air and maritime forces have not established control in either domain owing to the effectiveness of Ukraine’s air and sea defence reducing their ability to make notable progress.” A western embargo on Russian oil and gas would deal “a very serious blow” to Russian president Vladimir Putin, former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, now in exile in London, has said in an interview with the BBC’s Hardtalk programme. I think if Putin has to redirect oil and gas exports from the European to the Asian markets, he will lose over half of his revenue,” said Khodorkovsky, who was once Russia’s richest man as owner of the country’s largest oil company, Yukos. “It is half the revenue of the federal budget. Would he be able to continue the war and for how long would he be able to continue the war in those circumstances? It is difficult for me to say. After all, I am not a military expert. But I think it would be a very serious blow.” When asked whether western sanctions of Russian oligarchs would make any difference he said, It is important to understand that right now the correct steps are being made but they are based on incorrect assumptions ... oligarchs are people who have the power to play a role in the political decision-making process. These people are not oligarchs in that sense. I was never one. They are Putin’s agents and he uses them to influence, or at least try to influence, the western political system. If asked whether Putin is a war criminal, none of them would be prepared to give a straight answer, even though all of them understand that it is true. What does this mean? It means Putin has a tight grip on them and they will carry out any of his orders. And from this point of view, blocking their bank accounts, limiting their opportunities to influence western politics and the western economic system, is crucial. Asked if he had any sense of responsibility or regret for helping Putin take power in the 1990s, he said “of course”. I started regretting it in 2002, 2003 when I told Putin in the Kremlin that his system was built on corruption and was ruining our country. Canada has delivered a “number of M777 howitzers and associated ammunition” to Ukraine in conjunction with the US, defence minister Anita Anand has said. “We have also provided Ukraine with additional Carl Gustaf ammunition, and we will provide armoured vehicles and other support,” she said in a tweet. In a statement, Canada’s Ministry of Defence said it was “also in the process of finalizing contracts for a number of commercial pattern armoured vehicles, which will be sent to Ukraine as soon as possible, and a service contract for the maintenance and repair of specialized drone cameras that Canada has already supplied to Ukraine.” Broadcaster CBC reported that the howitzers – described by the Ministry of Defence as “lighter and smaller, yet more powerful than any gun of its kind” and capable of accurately hitting targets 30km away – numbered four and were from the 37 that Canada purchased during the Afghan war. A few images of the war from Friday, when Russia confirmed its intention to seize control of southern Ukraine and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that other countries could be next on Moscow’s list: Russia is seeking to “starve out the remaining defenders and civilians in Mariupol’s Azovstal Steel Plant and are unlikely to allow trapped civilians to leave,” the Institute for the Study of War has written in its latest analysis of the conflict. Shelling of the facility, where hundreds of civilians are thought to be holed up with the city’s last remaining Ukrainian fighters, has continued, it cited Ukrainian authorities as saying, adding that Russia had refused requests to establish humanitarian corridors allowing civilians to leave. Russian and DNR [Donetsk People’s Republic] forces continued to consolidate their control of key buildings in Mariupol and are likely setting conditions to set up an occupation government. Several videos circulated on social media of unspecified Russian forces departing Mariupol, but ISW cannot confirm at this time which Russian forces have departed the city or their likely destination. Referring to comments by a senior Russian commander on Friday that establishing control of souther Ukraine would give it access to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, the US-based think tank said it did not “read this as a statement of intent to conduct a major offensive operation toward Moldova” An offensive toward Moldova would likely have been phrased around securing a “land corridor” [сухопутный коридор] to Moldova, much like the Russian land corridor to Crimea. Even if Russian forces did seek to resume major offensive operations toward Mykolaiv and on to Odesa, they are highly unlikely to have the capability to do so. Rustam Minnekayev, acting commander of the central military district, had said that “Russian control of southern Ukraine provides Russia a future capability to conduct an offensive toward Transnistria, rather than announcing an imminent Russian offensive toward Moldova,” it noted. Other key takeaways from the day were: Ongoing purges of Russian general officers for failures in Ukraine will likely further degrade Russian command and control. Russian forces conducted localized attacks and reconnoitered Ukrainian positions south of Izyum and did not make any advances. Russian forces secured minor gains in continuing daily attacks on the line of contact in eastern Ukraine. The Kremlin is setting conditions to create proxy republics in Zaporizhia and Kherson oblasts to cement Russian control over these regions and conscript Ukrainian manpower. The Associated Press has written a moving piece about the families of the sailors who went missing after the sinking of the Moskva warship last week: It took the Russian military over a week to acknowledge that one serviceman died and two dozen others were missing after one of its flagship cruisers sank in the Black Sea, reportedly the result of a Ukrainian missiles strike. The acknowledgment happened after families started searching desperately for their sons who, they said, served on the ship and did not come home, and relatives are posing sharp questions about Russia’s initial statement that the entire crew was evacuated. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Friday in a terse announcement that one crew member died and 27 were left missing after a fire damaged the flagship Moskva cruiser last week, while 396 others were evacuated. The ministry did not offer any explanation for its earlier claims that the full crew got off the vessel before it sank. The loss of the Moskva, one of three missile cruisers of its kind in Russia’s fleet, was shrouded in mystery from the moment it was first reported early on April 14. Ukraine said it hit the ship with missiles. The Russian Defense Ministry would not acknowledge an attack, saying only that a fire broke out on the vessel after ammunition detonated, causing serious damage. Moscow even insisted that the ship remained afloat and was being towed to a port, only to admit hours later that it sank after all — in a storm. No images of the ship, or of the supposed rescue operation, were made available. Only several days later, the Russian military released a short and mostly silent video showing rows of sailors, supposedly from the Moskva, reporting to their command in the Crimean city of Sevastopol. The footage offered little clarity on how many sailors were actually evacuated to safety. Soon came the questions. An emotional social media post by Dmitry Shkrebets alleging that his son, a conscript who served as a cook on Moskva, was missing, quickly went viral. The military “said the entire crew was evacuated. It’s a lie! A blatant and cynical lie!” Shkrebets, a resident of Crimea, wrote on VK, a popular Russian social media platform, on April 17, three days after the ship went down. “My son, a conscript, as the very commanders of the Moskva cruiser told me, is not listed among the wounded and the dead and is added to the list of those missing ... Guys, missing in the open sea?!” Similar posts quickly followed from other parts of Russia. The Associated Press found social media posts looking for at least 13 other young men who reportedly served on the Moskva whose families could not find them. One woman spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, as she feared for her son’s safety. She said her son was a conscript and had been aboard the Moskva for several months before telling her in early February that the ship was about to depart for drills. She lost touch with him for several weeks after that. The news about Russia invading Ukraine worried her, she said, and she started reading the news online and on social media every day. The last time they spoke on the phone was in mid-March. He was on the ship but did not say where it was. She didn’t start looking for him until a day after she learned about trouble aboard the Moskva, because official statements from the Defense Ministry said the crew was evacuated. But no one called or messaged her about her son’s whereabouts, and she started to get agitated. Calls to various military officials and hotlines got her nowhere at first, but she persisted. A call she made on the way to a grocery store brought bleak news — that her son was listed as missing and that there was little chance he survived in the cold water. “I said ‘But you said you rescued everyone,’ and he said ‘I only have the lists’. I screamed ‘What are you doing?!’” she told the AP. “I got hysterical, right at the bus stop (where I was standing), I felt like the ground was giving way under my feet. I started shaking.” The Kremlin statements about the ship’s loss and the crew’s fate follow a historical pattern in which Russia has often met bad news with silence, denials or undercounts about casualties. Previous examples include the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine, the sinking of the nuclear-powered submarine Kursk in the Barents Sea in 2000 and the 1994-1996 Chechen war. The families’ accounts could not be independently verified. But they went largely uncontested by Russian authorities. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to comment and redirected the question to the Defense Ministry when asked by the AP during one of his daily conference calls with reporters about families challenging the official statements about sailors being evacuated. The Defense Ministry did not comment on the outcry either — until Friday, when it finally revealed that 27 crew members were missing and one was confirmed dead. The ministry still did not acknowledge an attack on the ship, however. Political analyst Abbas Gallyamov says the sinking of the Moskva is a major political blow for president Vladimir Putin, not so much because of the outcry from families, but because it hurts Putin’s image of military might. “This trait, might, is under attack now because we’re now talking about the devastation of the fleet,” Gallyamov said. But the families’ woes underscores “that one shouldn’t trust the Russian authorities.” In the meantime, some families with missing sons plan to continue seeking the truth. “Now we will turn to figuring out for how long one can go missing’ in the open sea,” Shkrebets posted Friday. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres will travel to Ukraine on Thursday, where he will meet president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba, his office has confirmed. He will also meet with staff of UN agencies to discuss the “scaling up of humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine”. The visit will take place two days after Guterres travels to Moscow to meet president Vladimir Putin. If you’re just joining us, here’s a rundown of the latest developments: The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has warned Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is “only a beginning” and that Moscow has designs on capturing other countries after a Russian general said it wants full control over southern Ukraine. “All the nations that, like us, believe in the victory of life over death must fight with us. They must help us, because we are the first in line. And who will come next?” Zelenskiy said in a video address late on Friday. Rustam Minnekayev, the deputy commander of Russia’s central military district, was quoted by Russian state news agencies as saying full control over southern Ukraine would give it access to Transnistria, a breakaway Russian-occupied part of Moldova in the west. Moldova’s foreign ministry said it had summoned Moscow’s ambassador on Friday to express “deep concern” about the general’s comments. Moldova was neutral, it said. Moldova last month formally applied to join the European Union, charting a pro-western course hastened by Russia’s invasion. Fears continue to grow for hundreds of civilians holed up in the Azovstal steel factory in the besieged port city of Mariupol, with the last remaining, outgunned contingent of Ukrainian fighters. Russia’s defence ministry said it was ready to allow civilians to leave the steelworks if Ukrainian forces surrendered. But according to Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor, Russian forces are continuing to drop bombs on the plant. Another mass grave has been found outside of Mariupol, the Associated Press has reported, citing the city council and an adviser to the mayor. The city council posted a satellite photo provided by Planet Labs showing what it said was a mass grave 45 metres by 25 metres that could hold the bodies of at least 1,000 Mariupol residents outside the village of Vynohradne. Ukraine deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said that “there is a possibility” a humanitarian corridor could be opened up out of Mariupol on Saturday. She was speaking in an online address to the people waiting to be evacuated. The stated intent of Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, to “introduce ‘new methods of warfare’ is a tacit admission that Russian progress is not going as intended”, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. The MoD said it would take Russia some time to change tactics and improve operations and therefore in the interim there is “likely to be continued reliance on bombardment as a means of trying to suppress Ukrainian opposition”. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has called for the release of prominent Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was detained outside his home in Moscow on 11 April, hours after CNN aired an interview in which he criticised Russia’s actions in Ukraine. The United Nations chief, António Guterres, will meet Putin in Moscow next week, seeking an end to the bloodshed. Guterres could also visit Zelenskiy in Kyiv, the UN announced. Talks between Russia and Ukraine had stalled again, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Friday. The US military expects more than 20 countries to attend Ukraine-focused defence talks it will host in Germany next week that will focus in part on Kyiv’s long-term defence needs, the Pentagon said on Friday. Western allies are preparing to offer Ukraine a series of “security guarantees” that should make the country “impregnable” to a future Russian invasion, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, was reported saying by the Press Association. Zelenskiy has said he is “grateful” to Britain after Johnson announced the reopening of the UK embassy in Kyiv. Russia’s defence ministry has reported that one sailor died and 27 more remain missing after one of its premier warships, the missile cruiser Moskva, sank last week in the Black Sea south of the threatened Ukrainian port of Odesa. Russia has been hiding evidence of its “barbaric” war crimes in Mariupol by burying the bodies of civilians killed by shelling in a new mass grave that could hold as many as 9,000 dead, local officials said. It comes after a US satellite imaging company released photos that appeared to match the site. The UN human rights office said it has seen growing evidence of war crimes in Ukraine, describing the war as a “horror story of violations against civilians”. The UN human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, said “almost every resident” of the town of Bucha had a story about the death of a relative, a neighbour or even a stranger. One person was killed and two were injured on Friday when a transport plane in southern Ukraine descended too low in fog and hit high-voltage power lines, local authorities have said according to Reuters. The accident occurred in the Zaporizhzhia region, the authorities said in a Facebook post. The twin-propellor Antonov An-26 had been on a technical flight from Zaporizhzhia to Uzhhorod, some 970 km (600 miles) away, they said. Another mass grave has been found outside of Mariupol, the Associated Press has reported, citing the city council and an adviser to the mayor. The city council posted a satellite photo provided by Planet Labs showing what it said was a mass grave 45 metres by 25 metres that could hold the bodies of at least 1,000 Mariupol residents. It said the new reported mass grave is outside the village of Vynohradne, which is east of Mariupol. The Guardian was unable to verify the report however Maxar Technologies, a US satellite imagery company, has also released images of the site. Earlier this week, satellite photos from Maxar Technologies revealed what appeared to be rows of more than 200 freshly dug mass graves in the town of Manhush, located to the west of Mariupol. Moldova has expressed “deep concern” and summoned the Russian ambassador following comments by a Russian military commander who said Moscow’s new aim was to seize control of southern Ukraine, which would also give it access to Transnistria, a pro-Russian breakaway region of Moldova. These statements are unfounded and contradict the position of the Russian Federation supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova, within its internationally recognized borders,” Moldova’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. In a meeting with Russian ambassador Oleg Vasnetov, the ministry “reiterated that the Republic of Moldova, in line with its Constitution, is a neutral state and this principle must be respected by all international actors, including the Russian Federation,” it continued. US secretary of state Antony Blinken has called for the release of prominent Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was detained outside his home in Moscow on 11 April, hours after CNN aired an interview in which he criticised Russia’s actions in Ukraine. The Kremlin’s preposterous charges against Vladimir Kara-Murza – ‘disseminating false information’ about the brutal war in Ukraine – is yet another cynical attempt to silence those who speak the truth. Mr. Kara-Murza should be released immediately,” Blinken tweeted. Kara-Murza was jailed for 15 days for disobeying a police officer, the Associated Press reported. Russia adopted a law criminalising the spreading of false information about its military shortly after its troops rolled into Ukraine in late February, in an attempt to control the narrative around the invasion. The offence is punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Human rights advocates have so far counted 32 cases under the new law. Kara-Murza has twice been hospitalized with poisoning symptoms, in 2015 and 2017. He is a a journalist and associate of late Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov and oligarch-turned-dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is only the beginning and comments by a senior Russian commander on Friday indicate Moscow will attack other countries too, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned in his latest nightly address. This only confirms what I have said many times: the Russian invasion of Ukraine was intended only as a beginning, then they want to capture other countries Rustam Minnekayev, acting commander of the central military district, said on Friday that Russia’s new goal was to gain control of southern Ukraine, giving it access to Transnistria, a pro-Russian breakaway region of Moldova. In Moldova, Zelenskiy noted, Russia has claimed that the rights of Russian speakers have been violated. Although, to be honest, the territory in which Russia should take care of the rights of Russian-speakers is Russia itself. Where there is no freedom of speech, no freedom of choice. Where there is simply no right to dissent. Where poverty thrives and where human life is worthless. To the extent that they come to us, go to war to steal at least something that resembles a normal life. You know they used to talk about their biggest dream: to see Paris and die. And their behavior is now just shocking. Because their dream now is to steal the toilet and die. Zelenskiy also said he was “grateful” to Britain after prime minister Boris Johnson announced the reopening of the UK embassy in Kyiv. I am grateful to our British friends for the important symbolic decision announced today to return the embassy to Kyiv. The United Kingdom became the twenty-first country to return a diplomatic mission to our capital. And this shows that we are not the only ones who believe in the victory of life over death,” he said in his latest video address to the nation. Hello, this is Helen Livingstone here to bring you the latest on the war in Ukraine. The stated intent of Russia’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu to “introduce ‘new methods of warfare’ is a tacit admission that Russian progress is not going as intended,” the UK’s Ministry of Defence has written in its latest intelligence update. While it may indicate an understanding that the war is not progressing as planned, it will take some time to translate this into adapted tactics, techniques and procedures, and then implement for improved operational effect particularly in regards to land-based manoeuvre warfare. Therefore, in the interim there is likely to be a continued reliance on bombardment as a means of trying to suppress Ukrainian opposition to Russian forces. As a result, it is likely that Russian forces will continue to be frustrated by an inability to overcome Ukrainian defences quickly. That’s it from me, Johana Bhuiyan, in New York. Here’s what’s happened so far. Fears are growing for hundreds of civilians holed up in the Azovstal steel factory in Mariupol, with the last remaining, outgunned contingent of Ukrainian fighters. Russia’s defence ministry said it was ready to allow civilians to leave the steelworks if Ukrainian forces surrendered. But according to Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor, Russian forces are continuing to drop bombs on the plant. The US military expects more than 20 countries to attend Ukraine-focused defence talks it will host in Germany next week that will focus in part on Kyiv’s long-term defense needs, the Pentagon said on Friday. A senior EU official said Russia will likely increase its military attacks in eastern Ukraine and along the country’s coast. The “next couple of weeks” could be potentially decisive for the war, the official said. Western allies are preparing to offer Ukraine a series of “security guarantees” which should make the country “impregnable” to a future Russian invasion, Boris Johnson has said, as the Press Association reports. A Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said Russia plans to take full control of Donbas and southern Ukraine as part of the second phase of its military operation. Russia intends to forge a land corridor between Crimea and Donbas, he said, adding that control of Ukraine’s south will give Russia another gateway to Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria. Russia’s defence ministry has reported that one sailor died and 27 more remain missing after one of its premier warships, the missile cruiser Moskva, sank last week in the Black Sea south of the threatened Ukrainian port of Odesa. Ukraine deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that “there is a possibility” a humanitarian corridor could be opened up out of the port of Mariupol on Saturday. Russia is shifting its elite military units away from the besieged city of Mariupol to eastern Ukraine, where they “pounded away at cities across the region”, according to the Associated Press. Russia’s chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, confirmed reports that “several long conversations” had been held with Ukraine today but he gave no details. Separately, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who has previously accused Ukraine of dragging out the peace process, said diplomatic efforts to end the war remained stalled. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, will visit Moscow on Tuesday to meet with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, where he “hopes to talk about what can be done to bring peace to Ukraine urgently”, his spokesperson said. Guterres will also have a working meeting and lunch with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, held a call with Vladimir Putin this morning. An EU official said Michel urged the Russian leader to engage directly with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The Kremlin said Putin accused the Ukrainian side of being “inconsistent” in negotiations. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said he was planning to hold phone calls with Zelenskiy and Putin in the coming days. Russia has been hiding evidence of its “barbaric” war crimes in Mariupol by burying the bodies of civilians killed by shelling in a new mass grave that could hold as many as 9,000 dead, local officials said. It comes after a US satellite imaging company released photos that appeared to match the site. The UN human rights office said it has seen growing evidence of war crimes in Ukraine, describing the war as a “horror story of violations against civilians”. The UN human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, said “almost every resident” of the town of Bucha had a story about the death of a relative, a neighbour or even a stranger. The head of the UN atomic watchdog, Rafael Grossi, said he will visit Ukraine’s Chernobyl nuclear plant next week. Grossi will head an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission “to deliver vital equipment and conduct radiological and other assessments at the site”, which was held by Russian forces for five weeks, the agency said in a statement. Boris Johnson has said he will close loopholes to ensure UK exports to India cannot end up being used in Russian weapons. Speaking in Delhi at the end of a two-day visit, the UK prime minister conceded the war in Ukraine could go on until the end of next year, and Russia could win. Johnson also announced that Britain is to reopen its Kyiv embassy. Maxar Technologies, which collects and publishes satellite images of Ukraine, said it had spotted a second mass cemetery in Mariupol, Reuters is reporting. The company said it appears the cemetery has expanded over the last month and includes long trenches which may become new grave sites. On Thursday, Maxar said it had spotted the first grave site, with 200 new graves appearing in March and April. The alleged mass grave could contain as many as 9,000 bodies, according to NBC News. The Guardian could not independently confirm the existence of the grave sites. The European Commission said on Friday that European companies won’t violate sanctions if they pay for Russian gas in euros and dollars which are then converted into Russian rubles. Russia has demanded in a new decree that gas payments be delivered in rubles, which could run afoul of current sanctions on the country. “EU companies could make a clear statement that they intend to fulfil their obligations under existing contracts and consider their contractual obligations regarding the payment already fulfilled by paying in euros or dollars, in line with the existing contracts, as before the adoption of the Decree,” the commission said in a document distributed to all the member states. Austria’s finance minister, Magnus Brunner ,said in an interview with CNN that the country supported all sanctions on Russia except for a gas embargo. Austria is extremely reliant on Russian gas exports, he said, so the country had “no choice”. “Once a sanction hits yourself more than the one targeted by the sanction, I think there’s not much use,” Brunner said. The US and UK have already sanctioned Russian oil. Russia is shifting its elite military units away from the besieged city of Mariupol to eastern Ukraine where they “pounded away at cities across the region”, according to the Associated Press. Cities and villages across Donbas – an industrial region in the eastern part of Ukraine – were bombarded as the Kremlin sent over more than 100,000 new troops from Syria and Libya into Ukraine. From the AP: Mariupol has taken on outsize importance in the war. Capturing it would deprive the Ukrainians of a vital port and complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which Putin seized from Ukraine in 2014. It would also enable Putin to throw more of his forces into the potentially climactic battle for the Donbas and its coal mines, factories and other industries, or what the Kremlin has now declared to be its main objective. [Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defense council] reported that some 12 to 14 of Russia’s elite military units have, in fact, left Mariupol and begun moving to the east to take part in the fighting there. “It will now be difficult for our forces, because our guys in Mariupol were taking [those units] on themselves. It is their courage and feat,” he said. Danilov also said Kyiv was able to deliver weapons via helicopter at great risk under cover of night to the Mariupol steelworks, which have been bombarded for weeks. Ukraine deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that “there is a possibility” a humanitarian corridor could be opened up out of the port of Mariupol on Saturday, Reuters is reporting. Vereshchuk relayed the message in a video address to people waiting be evacuated from the besieged city. “Watch the official announcements tomorrow morning. If all goes well, I will confirm,” she said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said comments from a Russian commander earlier today indicating Russia planned to create a “land corridor” from the Donbas region in Ukraine to Moldova showed that the attack on Ukraine was only the beginning. “One of the tasks of the Russian army is to establish full control over the Donbas and southern Ukraine. This will provide a land corridor to the Crimea, as well as influence the vital objects of the Ukrainian economy,” said Russian military commander Rustam Minnekaev on Friday at a meeting with the Union of Defense Industries. “Control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria, where there are also facts of oppression of the Russian-speaking population.” Transistria is a separatist enclave in Moldova. In a video address on Friday, Zelenskiy also said that the allies have begun to deliver the arms they’ve promised which “would help save the lives of thousands of people”, according to Reuters. The pressure is on to impose sanctions on Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich after he failed to revive peace talks on a recent trip to Kyiv, Ukraine, Bloomberg is reporting. Unnamed US senior officials are pushing to renew talks to sanction Abramovich after his talks with the chief of staff of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy did not progress, sources told Bloomberg. From Bloomberg: The billionaire’s role as an unofficial mediator has been controversial from the start, with critics claiming Russia’s 10th-richest man was only seeking to protect his vast wealth from the penalties unleashed against other business leaders over President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. On the day the war started, Abramovich accepted a request from Zelenskiy, passed through an intermediary, to get involved in negotiations to end the fighting, according to three people familiar with the situation. He threw himself into trying to broker a cease-fire, shuttling between Moscow, Kyiv, Belarus and Istanbul for talks behind the scenes, they said. Early on, Abramovich asked Zelenskiy to request that Western nations not sanction him while he was trying to act as a mediator, the people said. Despite opposition from some members of his administration, US President Joe Biden honored Zelenskiy’s appeal and has not targeted the tycoon, according to the people familiar with the administration’s position. Europe can get by without Russian gas for six months, but beyond that, the economic impact would be severe, a senior International Monetary Fund (IMF) official has told Agence France-Presse, the agency writes. Alfred Kammer, head of the IMF’s European department, urged countries in the region to take a series of steps to ease the blow, including reducing consumption to build up inventory. The region relies on Russia for the vast majority of its energy needs, especially natural gas, and IMF economists looked at the economic cost of losing Moscow’s supply. Speaking on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank’s spring meetings, Kammer told AFP: Over the first six months, Europe can deal with such a shutoff [by] having alternative supplies [and] using existing storage. However, if that gas shut off were to last into the winter, and over a longer period, then that would have significant effects. Western countries have considered putting an embargo on Russian energy in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, while Moscow could also shut off exports to hit back at the damaging sanctions already imposed on the government. The International Monetary Fund projects that a total loss of Russian gas and oil supplies could cost the European Union 3% of GDP, depending on the severity of the winter. He called for steps to prepare for the possibility. “There is no single option, which has a large impact, but lots of smaller measures will have a larger impact,” he said, including by finding alternative suppliers, which some countries already have begun to do. Consumers also have an important role to play and governments can raise awareness among their population through “public campaigns to reduce energy consumption”. “The consumer can act now,” he said, and reducing consumption meant more fuel could be stored in case supplies are interrupted. Although the war in Ukraine has slowed growth sharply, Kammer said it “will not derail the recovery” and he does not expect a Europe-wide recession. The major eurozone economies, with the exception of Spain, will be “weak in 2022” and will see a quarter or two of near-zero growth or even a technical recession with two negative quarters. But the IMF expects these economies to recover in the second half of this year. The Russian attack on its neighbor has caused a flood of about five million refugees, creating a challenge for European countries which face strains on their budgets as they deal with the influx. Poland, which which has taken in the most Ukrainians, is particularly affected. What happens to those people, mostly women and children, after the war remains a question. “Some of these refugees will stay in Europe, I’m sure about that,” said Kammer, who noted that could be “a boon” for countries faced with ageing populations and a lack of workers. “But it could be a bad for Ukraine if too many of the refugees are going to stay.” Russia’s defence ministry has reported that one sailor died and 27 more remain missing after one of its premier warships, the missile cruiser Moskva, sank last week in the Black Sea south of the threatened Ukrainian port of Odesa. A further 396 crew members were rescued, RIA news agency has said, citing Russia’s defence ministry on Friday, Reuters reports. Moscow says the Moskva, the flagship of its Black Sea fleet, sank after a fire sparked an ammunition blast. Ukraine says it hit the vessel with an anti-ship missile, an account backed by western intelligence findings and supported by recently emerging pictures and video. Earlier this month, Ukraine said it had struck the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles while distracting its crew with an aerial drone, causing it to start sinking and forcing the crew of 500 to abandon ship. The ship sank as it was being towed south towards the port of Sevastapol. The apparent attack on and sinking of the Black Sea fleet’s flagship – 50 days after Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine – represents a symbolic blow to the Kremlin. The Moskva was the pride of its fleet and the most prestigious vessel involved in the war against Ukraine. “The sinking of the Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, is not just a significant loss, it is emblematic of the shambolic Russian military campaign,” said Michael Kofman, research programme director and Russia expert at the US government-funded Center for Naval Analyses. Family members of crew had been demanding answers from the Russian government, after little information was forthcoming following the sinking. Western allies are preparing to offer Ukraine a series of “security guarantees” which should make the country “impregnable” to a future Russian invasion, Boris Johnson has said, as the Press Association reports. Here’s more of what the British prime minister has been talking about during his visit to India. Johnson said it was essential to step up immediate military support to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, as he warned there was a “realistic possibility” that the conflict could drag on for a “long period”. He said Britain was looking to send tanks to “backfill” in Poland so Soviet-era T-72s – with which Ukrainian crews are familiar – can be released to the government in Kyiv. But, speaking in the Indian capital, Delhi, while on a visit, Johnson said a long-term vision for Ukraine’s place in the future “security architecture” of Europe also needed to be developed. While he said it would not be the same as the Nato Article 5 guarantee – in which an attack on one member state of the US-led military alliance is considered to be an attack on all members – he hoped it would offer “deterrence by denial”. Johnson said: What the Ukrainians want – and I think are now going to get – is a collection of guarantees from like-minded countries about what we can do to back them up with weaponry, with training and with intelligence-sharing. It will, I hope, enable the Ukrainians to offer deterrence by denial and make sure their territory is so fortified as to be impregnable to further attack from Russia. That is what we need to do. Johnson earlier took what could be seen as a pessimistic or a realistic stance when he said that, having made a “catastrophic blunder”, Russian president Vladimir Putin could get bogged down in a “grinding” offensive that lasts at least the rest of this year but ends in military defeat for Ukraine. The US military expects more than 20 countries to attend Ukraine-focused defence talks it will host in Germany next week that will focus in part on Kyiv’s long-term defense needs, the Pentagon said on Friday, Reuters reports. However, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby appeared to play down expectations of announcements about long-term assistance at the 26 April talks. “We’re not going into this with a pre-cooked set of endings here,” he said. He added that about 40 countries were invited to attend the talks, which were not being organized under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) alliance umbrella, and include non-Nato nation states. Some countries have been moving their Ukrainian embassies back to Kyiv since Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s forces apparently deterred the Russian military, which had been advancing on the capital, then stalled and withdrew in recent weeks. This includes the UK. But the US is not currently in active planning to do likewise, three sources familiar with “ongoing conversations” tell CNN. Joe Biden’s administration, according to US state department officials, is still wary of possible Russian strikes on the Ukrainian capital, not necessarily aimed at the US embassy, but generally, such as an errant missile strike. “We are constantly reassessing and evaluating the security situation because the safety and security of our employees is our top priority,” a state department spokesperson told the channel on Friday. The US ceased operations at the US embassy in Kyiv more than a month ago, but that closure is not permanent. “We don’t have specifics on timing, but our team is actively planning and we very much look forward to resuming embassy operations in Ukraine to facilitate our support to the government and people of Ukraine as they bravely defend their country,” the spokesperson said. Meanwhile, the Guardian’s US team is now taking the reins on our global, round-the-clock live blog on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and we’ll bring you developments as they happen over the next few hours. It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: Fears are growing for hundreds of civilians holed up in the Azovstal steel factory in Mariupol, with the last remaining, outgunned contingent of Ukrainian fighters. Russia’s defence ministry said it was ready to allow civilians to leave the steelworks if Ukrainian forces surrendered. But according to Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor, Russian forces are continuing to drop bombs on the plant. A senior EU official said Russia will likely increase its military attacks in eastern Ukraine and along the country’s coast. The “next couple of weeks” could be potentially decisive for the war, the official said. Russian military official, Rustam Minnekayev, said Russia plans to take full control of Donbas and southern Ukraine as part of the second phase of its military operation. Russia intends to forge a land corridor between Crimea and Donbas, he said, adding that control of Ukraine’s south will give Russia another gateway to Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria. Russia’s chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, confirmed reports that “several long conversations” had been held with Ukraine today but he gave no details. Separately, Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who has previously accused Ukraine of dragging out the peace process, said diplomatic efforts to end the war remained stalled. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, will visit Moscow on Tuesday to meet with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, where he “hopes to talk about what can be done to bring peace to Ukraine urgently”, his spokesperson said. Guterres will also have a working meeting and lunch with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, held a call with Vladimir Putin this morning. An EU official said Michel urged the Russian leader to engage directly with Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The Kremlin said Putin accused the Ukrainian side of being “inconsistent” in negotiations. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said he was planning to hold phone calls with Zelenskiy and Putin in the coming days. Russia has been hiding evidence of its “barbaric” war crimes in Mariupol by burying the bodies of civilians killed by shelling in a new mass grave that could hold as many as 9,000 dead, local officials said. It comes after a US satellite imagery company released photos that appeared to match the site. The UN human rights office said it has seen growing evidence of war crimes in Ukraine, describing the war as a “horror story of violations against civilians”. The UN human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, said “almost every resident” of the town of Bucha had a story about the death of a relative, a neighbour or even a stranger. The head of the UN atomic watchdog, Rafael Grossi, said he will visit Ukraine’s Chernobyl nuclear plant next week. Grossi will head an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission “to deliver vital equipment and conduct radiological and other assessments at the site”, which was held by Russian forces for five weeks, the agency said in a statement. Boris Johnson has said he will close loopholes to ensure UK exports to India cannot end up being used in Russian weapons. Speaking in Delhi at the end of a two-day visit, the UK prime minister conceded the war in Ukraine could go on until the end of next year, and Russia could win. Johnson also announced that Britain is to reopen its Kyiv embassy. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today as I hand the blog over to my colleague, Joanna Walters. I’ll be back on Monday. Thank you for reading. Seven Russians now under sanctions were awarded controversial “golden visas” by the UK after Vladimir Putin’s regime first invaded Ukraine in 2014, the government has admitted. The government closed the “tier 1 investor visa” scheme in February amid the build-up of Russian forces on Ukraine’s border as it prepared to broaden its occupation beyond Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. Since the invasion, sanctions targeted at many of Russia’s richest businessmen have become a key part of the response by the UK and its allies. The measures have also prompted awkward questions for the government, with critics accusing it of offering an open door to kleptocrats and oligarchs, who in some cases are thought to have expropriated wealth from the Russian state on a massive scale. Much of that wealth has been used to buy luxury property in London. The golden visa scheme allowed people with at least £2m in investment funds and a UK bank account to apply for residency rights, along with their family. Before 2018 it is thought that minimal checks were carried out on investors or the source of their wealth. The government revealed that 10 Russians who received golden visas are now subject to sanctions, an increase from the eight previously admitted, in a written answer to a question from Stephen Kinnock, Labour’s shadow immigration minister. Here’s more on the meeting between the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow next week. Guterres will also have a working meeting and lunch with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, a spokesperson for the UN chief, Eri Kaneko, told reporters. Kaneko said Guterres “hopes to talk about what can be done to bring peace to Ukraine urgently”. His office is also working with the Ukrainian government on scheduling and preparations for a visit to Ukraine, she said. On Tuesday, the UN secretary general asked Putin to receive him in Moscow and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to receive him in Kyiv, in separate letters handed to their countries’ permanent missions to the UN. Guterres also called for a four-day Orthodox Easter humanitarian pause in fighting in Ukraine beginning on Thursday to allow for the safe passage of civilians from areas of conflict and the delivery of humanitarian aid to hard-hit areas. He was “not so much disappointed that his own personal call was not heeded, but more that there has been no truce”, his spokesperson said. An embargo on Russian gas imports triggered by a further escalation of the war in Ukraine could plunge Germany into a recession, the Bundesbank warned on Friday, but Europe’s largest economy would probably shrink less severely than during the first year of the coronavirus pandemic. An immediate EU ban on Russian gas would cost Germany the equivalent of €165bn (£138bn) in lost output this year, according to the country’s central bank. “In the severe crisis scenario, real GDP in the current year would fall by almost 2% compared to 2021,” the Bundesbank said in its latest monthly report. Germany’s manufacturing-heavy economy would feel the painful consequences of gas-shortages for the coming years, the bank’s report said. “In addition, the inflation rate would be significantly higher for a longer period of time.” Before the start of the war in Ukraine, Russian natural gas accounted for 55% of Germany’s gas needs, with roughly a third used for industrial production, including steel and chemicals. “Natural gas prices are likely to rise the most, as Russian deliveries are difficult to replace in the short term,” the bank said. However, in a heated German debate over the economic price the country should be prepared to pay to help cut off financial support for Putin’s war economy, some have taken the Bundesbank report as positive news. “The economic slump would with high probability be less severe than during the corona crisis,” wrote conservative broadsheet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. “It puts even more pressure on the government to justify itself”. Ukraine’s top prosecutor has accused the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, of having a pre-hatched plan for his troops to torture, rape and execute civilians in Ukraine who refuse to capitulate. Speaking to Sky News, Iryna Venediktova said her team is working on almost 8,000 war crimes cases from around Ukraine, including summary executions, sexual violence and the forced deportation of children to Russia. There are a “huge number of cases” of Russian troops killing Ukrainians simply because they did not like them, Venediktova said. In the Kyiv region alone, her team had information on more than 1,000 civilians killed in areas previously occupied by Russian forces, although the total number could well be higher, she said. Asked whether she thought the shooting of civilians, execution-style, had been pre-planned by Russia before the invasion, Venediktova said: I think it is a strategy of their chief of commander, because we see the same strategy in other countries. They have Plan A: cities should capitulate, if a city does not capitulate it means Plan B: to scare this population to the maximum. Kill, rape, torture, and other brutal things. It is a strategy of war. A senior EU official said Russia will likely increase its military attacks in eastern Ukraine and along the country’s coast. The “next couple of weeks” could be potentially decisive for the war, the official said, adding: This is not a fairy tale with an imminent happy ending. I think we are likely to see a very significant increase in the intensity of Russian military attacks in the east, I think we are likely to see an intensification of Russian military attacks along the coast. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, will visit Moscow on Tuesday to meet with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, a spokesperson for Guterres said. Guterres will also have a working meeting and lunch with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, the spokesperson said. Russia’s chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, confirmed reports that “several long conversations” had been held with Ukraine today but he gave no details, Reuters reports. Separately, Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said diplomatic efforts to end the war remained stalled. Lavrov, who has previously accused Ukraine of dragging out the peace process, told a briefing: They have now stalled because our latest proposal that was handed to the Ukrainian negotiators some five days ago and formulated taking into account the comments we received from them remains unanswered. The Kremlin said earlier this week that Moscow had submitted a new written proposal. In response, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had neither seen nor heard about the document. In a phone call earlier today with the European Council president, Charles Michel, Vladimir Putin accused the Ukrainian side of being “inconsistent” in the negotiations. It’s almost 7pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: Fears are growing for hundreds of civilians holed up in the Azovstal steel factory in Mariupol, with the last remaining, outgunned contingent of Ukrainian fighters.

Russia has been hiding evidence of its “barbaric” war crimes in Mariupol by burying the bodies of civilians killed by shelling in a new mass grave that could hold as many as 9,000 dead, local officials said.

Ivan Ariefiev, the military press secretary for the region, said investigators were working to establish the cause. The Guardian’s correspondents at the scene saw one dead man among the wreckage. Russia has opened a criminal case against a prominent opposition activist on suspicion of spreading false information about Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine, his lawyer said. Vladimir Kara-Murza was detained outside his home in Moscow on 11 April, hours after CNN aired an interview in which he criticised Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you to bring you all the latest news in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russia of planning to “falsify” an independence referendum in the partly occupied southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, telling Ukrainians there not to give personal information to occupying forces. Russian forces are continuing to drop bombs on the Azovstal iron and steelworks, according to Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Fears are growing for hundreds of civilians holed up in the steel factory on Mariupol’s left bank, with the last remaining, outgunned contingent of Ukrainian fighters. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, yesterday ordered his forces not to storm the factory complex after his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, admitted the Russian army was still fighting thousands of Ukrainian soldiers there. According to local officials, between 300 and 1,000 people, including women and children, could still be trapped in the steelworks. Andryushchenko told Associated Press: Every day they drop several bombs on Azovstal. Fighting, shelling, bombing do not stop. On Thursday, Mariupol’s mayor, Vadym Boichenko, accused Russia of hiding evidence of its “barbaric” war crimes in Mariupol by burying the bodies of civilians killed by shelling in a new mass grave in the nearby village of Manhush. Andryushchenko said: The graves have been dug up and corpses are still being dumped there. Initial estimates from the Ukrainians said the apparent mass graves could hold 9,000 bodies, but Andryushenko said there could be more. A Ukrainian Antonov AN-26 military transport plane came down in a field near Mykhailivka, a village in the Zaporizhzhia region. Ivan Ariefiev, the military press secretary for the region, said investigators were working to establish the cause. A power line on the edge of the field had been broken. The Guardian’s correspondents at the scene saw one dead man among the wreckage. Ariefiev said he was the only passenger. Ariefiev said the two pilots of the Antonov survived and were being treated in hospital. The plane, said Ariefiev, was carrying out a technical flight. Local residents said they did not hear a crash but saw the emergency services rush to the scene just after 9am. Guardian correspondents who were in the region that morning noticed fog. The head of the UN atomic watchdog has said he will visit Ukraine’s Chornobyl nuclear plant next week. Rafael Grossi will head an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission to step up efforts to help prevent the danger of a nuclear accident during the conflict in the country, the agency said in a statement. The team of nuclear safety, security and safeguards staff will be in Chornobyl from 26 April “to deliver vital equipment and conduct radiological and other assessments at the site”, which was held by Russian forces for five weeks before they withdrew on 31 March, it said. Grossi said: The IAEA’s presence at Chornobyl will be of paramount importance for our activities to support Ukraine as it seeks to restore regulatory control of the plant and ensure its safe and secure operation. He added that more IAEA missions to Chornobyl and other nuclear facilities in Ukraine would follow within weeks. Taiwan’s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, told Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, that his country was feeling the situation faced by Ukraine “as though it is happening to ourselves”, Reuters reports. The war in Ukraine has garnered broad sympathy in Taiwan, with many seeing parallels between Russia’s invasion and military pressure from China, which views Taipei as its own territory. Taiwan has joined western-led sanctions and donated $20m (£15.5m) for Ukrainian refugees, mostly raised by the public. Speaking by video conference, Wu told Klitschko that Taiwan and Ukraine were both democracies “on the front line of resisting the expansion of authoritarianism”, the Taiwanese foreign ministry cited him as saying. Wu said: The Taiwanese government and people also face a high threat from the authoritarian regime across the Taiwan Strait, and therefore feel the current situation faced by Ukraine as though it is happening to ourselves. Taiwan will donate $3m (£2.3m) to Kyiv city and $5m (£3.9m) to six Ukrainian medical institutions, Wu said. Following their conversation, Wu tweeted a picture of himself talking to Klitschko, a former champion boxer, writing: Champ, we’ll continue to stand with you &amp; your people. Freedom will prevail! British prime minister Boris Johnson’s trip to India has been dogged by the so-called “Partygate” controversy at home, and questions about how the UK can conclude a trade deal with India while the world’s largest democracy continues to offer limited criticism of Russian aggression in Ukraine. Heather Stewart in Delhi and Dan Sabbagh report for us on the latest development: Boris Johnson has said he will close loopholes to ensure UK exports to India cannot end up being used in Russian weapons, as he conceded the war in Ukraine could go on until the end of next year, and Russia could win. Speaking in Delhi at the end of a two-day visit, the UK prime minister warned that Vladimir Putin was resorting to a “grinding approach” in Ukraine; and suggested the UK would help to “backfill” countries including Poland if they provided heavy weaponry such as tanks to Kyiv. Johnson was asked a report by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), warning that India was one of a number of major routes for smuggling arms to Vladimir Putin’s regime. He pointed to the ban on exporting technology products to Russia, saying: “We want to ensure we keep that tight. We’ll be making sure that we don’t allow any loopholes of any kind … we will take steps to make sure that stuff doesn’t go through other routes to Russia.” Read more of Heather Stewart in Delhi and Dan Sabbagh’s report: Johnson vows to stop UK exports to India ending up in Russia Here is Lorenzo Tondo’s latest report for us from Kyiv: Fears are growing for hundreds of civilians holed up in the Azovstal steel factory on Mariupol’s left bank, with the last remaining, outgunned contingent of Ukrainian fighters. According to local officials, between 300 and 1,000 people, including women and children, could still be trapped in the steelworks, a sprawling mass of tunnels and workshops spread over four square miles in the south-east of the city, scene of the worst humanitarian crisis of the nearly two-month war. The mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boichenko, appealed on Friday for the “full evacuation” of its devastated city, where, according to local officials, 100,000 people remain trapped. “We don’t know the precise civilian figure because we haven’t been able to get them out. We need a day’s ceasefire for this to happen,” Boichenko, who is no longer in Mariupol, said. “The civilians were living in desperate conditions in a network of underground tunnels, surrounded by Russian troops.’’ The Russian president Vladimir Putin described a plan to penetrate the complex as impractical, and called instead for blockade of the area “so that a fly can’t get through”. Putin told defence minister Sergei Shoigu, in remarks broadcast on state television: “There is no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground.” However, due to the lack of telecommunication in the city, after the Russian troops bombed radio towers in Mariupol during the first days of invasion, concerns are rising over the fate of civilians and soldiers. Read more of Lorenzo Tondo’s latest report for us from Kyiv: Fears for hundreds of civilians trapped in Mariupol steel plant Russia’s embassy in Iceland has put out a statement accusing western countries of continuing to “actively ‘stuff’ Ukraine with heavy armament” and criticising the actions of the Icelandic government. It says: “Among the countries that actively support the Ukrainian neo-nazis with weapons are also the UK, Canada, Germany, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and others” and goes on to single out Peter Stano, an EU spokesperson for external affairs. The embassy says he “cynically declares the European commitment to a diplomatic settlement of the situation and claims that more weapons do not mean more war. It is obvious that there is no logic at all in such an approach. It seems that neither Europe nor the United States want peace in Ukraine, prompting Kyiv ‘to fight till the last Ukrainian’.” The embassy is openly critical of the Icelandic government, saying: Unfortunately, we have to state that Iceland also ‘contributes’ to ensuring the military supplies to Ukraine and thereby to prolonging the Ukrainian crisis. Iceland has organised 13 flights to transport military equipment. We hope that the Icelandic authorities are aware of responsibility for the negative consequences of such actions. We would like to draw your attention that Russia reserves the right to consider foreign military cargo and equipment on the territory of Ukraine as a legitimate target. At the same time, we would like to point out that the ‘pumping’ of the Kyiv regime with weapons will not lead to the results pursued by the west. The goals of the special military operation to demilitarise and denazify Ukraine set by the Russian authorities will definitely be achieved. Here is a map with a bit of geographical context for those comments earlier by the deputy commander of Russia’s central military district, Rustam Minnekayev. At a meeting in Russia’s central Sverdlovsk region, he said that the country intends to take full control of Donbas and southern Ukraine and forge a land corridor between Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and Donbas. He also said that “Control over the south of Ukraine is another way to Transnistria, where there is also evidence that the Russian-speaking population is being oppressed.” Here is what our Andrew Roth wrote earlier to explain the current situation in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria: Transnistria is a Russian-controlled territory of Moldova that has hosted Russian troops since the fall of the Soviet Union. With Russian backing, Transnistria fought a war against Moldova in the 1990s that left the territory with de facto independence and a garrison of 1,500 Russian troops. The region is recognised as part of Moldova. The unrecognised state is strongly influenced internationally by nostalgia for the Soviet Union and its affinity for Russia, which is fostered by state propaganda. Russia has opened a criminal case against a prominent opposition activist on suspicion of spreading false information about Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine, his lawyer said. Vladimir Kara-Murza was detained outside his home in Moscow on 11 April, hours after CNN aired an interview in which he criticised Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Reuters reports he was later sentenced to 15 days in jail for disobeying police orders upon being detained, Kara-Murza’s lawyer, Vadim Prokhorov, said at the time. Kara-Murza has not been formally charged and Prokhorov denies his client broke the law. “Vladimir Kara-Murza is now at the main investigation Department of Russia’s Investigative Committee,” Prokhorov wrote on Facebook. “A criminal case has been opened... for ‘public dissemination of deliberately false information about Russia’s armed forces.’” Prokhorov did not say when precisely the case had been opened. This is Martin Belam back on the blog for an hour. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, held a call with Vladimir Putin this morning where he urged the Russian leader to engage directly with Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, an EU official said. Michel stressed in “no uncertain terms” the unacceptability of Russia’s war and detailed the sanction costs the EU is imposing on Russia, the EU official said. He also called for a ceasefire in Ukraine on the occasion of the upcoming Orthodox Easter and for safe passage for civilians seeking to leave besieged cities such as Mariupol, the EU official said. In Moscow’s readout of the call, the Kremlin said Putin told Michel he would only hold direct talks with Zelenskiy if ongoing discussions between the two countries produce concrete results. Putin told Michel that Kyiv was showing it was not ready to seek mutually acceptable solutions and accused the Ukrainian side of being “inconsistent” in negotiations, the Kremlin said. Ukraine has officially registered the Russian warship Moskva lying at the bottom of the Black Sea as a “national underwater cultural heritage site”, according to the Kyiv Independent’s Illia Ponomarenko. Moskva, Russia’s flagship Black Sea missile cruiser, sank last week after an explosion caused by an unexplained fire, the Russian defence ministry said, while Ukraine said it had hit the ship with a missile or missiles. The UK’s ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, said she’s heading back to Kyiv after Boris Johnson earlier announced the reopening of Britain’s embassy in the capital. Russia’s defence ministry said it was ready to allow civilians to leave the Azovstal steelworks in the besieged city of Mariupol if Ukrainian forces surrender, AFP reports. In a statement, the defence ministry said Russia is “ready at any moment” to announce a “humanitarian pause” for the evacuation of civilians. The ceasefire would start with the “raising of white flags” by Ukraine’s forces “along the entire perimeter or in certain areas of Azovstal”, the ministry said. If such signs are found in any part of the Azovstal metallurgical plant, Russia’s armed forces … will immediately stop any hostilities and provide a safe exit. According to the ministry, civilians will be escorted to either territories controlled by Ukraine or to Russia “at the evacuees’ own discretion”. It said Ukrainian soldiers who have surrendered will be “guaranteed” their life. The mayor of Mariupol said “one clear day of ceasefire” is needed to evacuate civilians sheltering in the Azovstal steel iron and steelworks in the besieged Ukrainian city. Hundreds of soldiers and civilians are believed to be in the massive plant that has become the last remaining Ukrainian stronghold in Mariupol. On Thursday, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin ordered his forces not to storm the steelworks, calling instead for Russian troops to blockade the area “so that a fly can’t get through”. Speaking to CNN today, Mariupol mayor Vadym Boichenko said: The day before yesterday, we planned to open up an evacuation route that these people [inside the plant] could join. However, the Russian forces continued bombarding the plant and shelling the plant and we weren’t able to get the people out of there. Boichenko said the devastation of Mariupol has been “very painful and sad”, describing the city before the invasion of Russia as “blossoming”. It was turning into a modern city. We were developing it as a modern, state-of-the-art city to fulfil people’s dreams as we imagined. I feel as if my heart has been torn out. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said he was planning to hold phone calls with Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy and Russia’s Putin in the coming days. When asked about peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow, Erdoğan told reporters that he was “not without hope”, adding: Our friends will get in touch with them today, we plan to hold a call again with (Russian president Vladimir) Putin and (Ukrainian president Volodymyr) Zelenskiy today or tomorrow. He added: With the calls, we plan to carry the process in Istanbul to the leaders’ level. FC Desna’s stadium in Chernihiv, 100 miles north of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, has suffered huge damage due to heavy shelling in the area. A large crater can be seen in the middle of the playing field, while the stands and other facilities are either crumbling or covered in debris. Desna were playing in the Ukrainian Premier League before it was suspended due to the ongoing Russian invasion, and played their first European game in 2020, against Wolfsburg in the Europa League. The stadium, officially named the Chernihiv Olympic Sports Training Centre, was once named after the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. Moldova has submitted a first questionnaire on European Union membership, the country’s president, Maia Sandu said. Japan has described four disputed islands as “illegally occupied” by Russia for the first time in nearly two decades amid deteriorating relations over the war in Ukraine. The islands, which Moscow calls the Kurils and Tokyo the Northern Territories, have been held by Russia and claimed by Japan. In its annual diplomatic report published today, the Japanese foreign ministry states that the “greatest concern between Japan and Russia is the Northern Territories”, calling them “Japanese territories over which Japan holds sovereign rights, but are currently illegally occupied by Russia”. Japan has not referred to the islands as being “illegally occupied” since 2003, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. Japan and Russia have long been engaged in attempts to agree to a post-second world war treaty, but the Japanese foreign ministry said the Ukraine crisis would stall talks with Russia. Last month, Moscow said it would drop the talks, citing the “impossibility” of continuing discussions as Tokyo was “striving to cause harm to the interest of our country”. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the islands are “inalienable territory of the Russian Federation”. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has been speaking to reporters at a press conference in New Delhi. Johnson was asked what pressure he has exerted on India – and what more he will exert – to stand up to Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Johnson said India has “come out and been very strong in their language about what’s happened in Bucha”. He acknowledged that a Russian military victory in Ukraine is a “realistic possibility”, adding: Putin has a huge army. [But] he has a very difficult political position because he’s made a catastrophic blunder. The only option he now has really is to continue to try to use his his appalling, grinding approach – led by artillery – trying to grind the Ukrainians down. And he’s very close to securing a land bridge in Mariupol. The situation is “unpredictable” at this stage, Johnson said. But what we’ve also seen is the incredible heroism of the Ukrainians and their willingness to fight. And I’ll tell you something: I think, no matter what military superiority Vladimir Putin may be able to bring to bear in the next few months – and I agree it could be it could be a long period, he will not be able to conquer the spirit of the Ukrainian people. He added: We’ve got to look at what more we can do militarily. We’ve got to keep intensifying the economic sanctions. And that’s what we’re doing. We want to make sure that there is wave after wave of intensifying pressure on on Putin. The United Nations human rights office said it has seen growing evidence of war crimes in Ukraine, describing the war as a “horror story of violations against civilians”. The UN monitoring mission in Ukraine has documented the unlawful killing of 50 people in the town of Bucha, including by summary execution, it said in a statement. The UN human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, said “almost every resident of Bucha” had a story about the death of a relative, a neighbour or even a stranger, adding: We know much more needs to be done to uncover what happened there and we also know Bucha is not an isolated incident. The mission has received allegations of more than 300 unlawful killings of civilians in the regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy, all areas that were previously occupied by Russian armed forces, it said. Allegations of sexual violence against women, men, girls and boys by members of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine have “increasingly surfaced”, it said. Bachelet said: Our work to date has detailed a horror story of violations perpetrated against civilians. First and foremost, this senseless war must stop. She urged all those fighting to strictly respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law, adding: This means distinguishing between civilian and military objects. It means not targeting or deliberately killing civilians. It means not committing sexual violence. People, including prisoners of war, must not be tortured. Civilians, prisoners and others hors de combat must be treated humanely. Britain is to reopen its Kyiv embassy, Boris Johnson has announced, more than two months after moving it out of the Ukrainian capital before the Russian invasion. Since the embassy’s closure in February, the UK has retained a diplomatic presence in Ukraine, but has not been providing in-person consular assistance The Foreign Office (FCDO) said at that time that the embassy was relocating temporarily and staff were operating from an embassy office in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. However, the embassy is expected to reopen early next month after Russian forces were pushed back or withdrawn from the region around Kyiv in the face of Ukrainian resistance. The announcement, which the prime minister made at a press conference during his trip to India, comes after he met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during an unannounced visit to Kyiv earlier this month. Our Russia affairs correspondent Pjotr Sauer tweets that earlier comments by a Russian military official that Moscow plans to control the whole of southern Ukraine to give Russia another gateway to Transnistria represent the “most concrete Russian threat to Moldova” since the start of the conflict. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you as we unpack all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Russian military official Rustam Minnekayev says Russia plans to take full control of Donbas and southern Ukraine as part of the second phase of its military operation. “Control over the south of Ukraine is another way to Transnistria, where there is also evidence that the Russian-speaking population is being oppressed,” he said at a meeting in Russia’s central Sverdlovsk region, referring to a breakaway pro-Russian region of Moldova. Russia has been hiding evidence of its “barbaric” war crimes in Mariupol by burying the bodies of civilians killed by shelling in a new mass grave, the city’s mayor said, as a US satellite imagery company released photos that appeared to match the site. The graves could hold as many as 9,000 dead, the Mariupol city council said yesterday in a post on the Telegram messaging app. The mayor of Mariupol has issued a new appeal for the “full evacuation” of the southern Ukrainian city, which Russia claims has fallen into its hands apart from the Azovstal metalworks, which President Vladimir Putin has ordered to be blockaded. Putin’s decision to blockade Mariupol’s Azovstal steel plant probably indicates a desire to contain Ukrainian resistance in the city and free up Russian forces to be deployed in eastern Ukraine, British intelligence suggests. US officials have dismissed Putin’s claim that his forces have “liberated” Mariupol as disinformation. There will be no humanitarian corridors open today in Ukraine, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has announced, due to “the danger on the routes”. Russia’s defence ministry said it struck 58 military targets in Ukraine overnight, including sites where troops, fuel depots and military equipment were concentrated. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russia of planning to “falsify” an independence referendum in the partly occupied southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The physical damage to Ukraine’s infrastructure has reached $60bn and will rise further as the war continues, World Bank President David Malpass has said. Ukraine needs $7bn each month to keep its economy afloat amid the “economic losses” inflicted by Russia, Zelenskiy has said. Zelenskiy said Russia rejected a proposed Easter truce, but that he remains hopeful of prospects for peace. Nato must avoid a direct military confrontation with Russia that could lead to a third world war, German chancellor Olaf Scholz said in an interview with Der Spiegel. Germany will supply Ukraine with heavy weaponry very quickly through a three way exchange with Ukraine and some of Germany’s Nato partners, the country’s Europe minister, Anna Lührmann said. UK prime minister Boris Johnson has revealed that dozens of Ukrainian soldiers are training in the UK, learning how to use 120 British armoured vehicles before returning with them to fight. Plans for Pope Francis to meet in Jerusalem in June with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill, who has backed Russia’s war in Ukraine, have been suspended by the Vatican. The EU is urging people to drive less, turn down air conditioning and work from home three days a week, to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas. Counter-terror police from the UK gathering evidence of potential war crimes in Ukraine say they have been struck by the “incredibly harrowing” material and witness accounts from the frontline of the conflict. Russia has slapped “indefinite’ travel bans on US vice- president Kamala Harris and Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg as well as dozens of prominent Americans and Canadians in retaliation for sanctions. Seven people have been killed after a huge fire broke out at a key Russian defence research institute in Tver, north-west of Moscow. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. I am now handing you over to Léonie Chao-Fong. Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us from Ukraine over the newswires. A Russian military official is being quoted this morning saying that it intends to control the whole of southern Ukraine. The Interfax news agency reports the deputy commander of Russia’s central military district, Rustam Minnekayev, said it plans to take full control of Donbas and southern Ukraine as part of the second phase of the military operation. Reuters notes he was also cited as saying that Russia planned to forge a land corridor between Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and Donbas. And in a line that will be concerning to Chișinău, he is also reported to have said that control of Ukraine’s south will give Russia another gateway to Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria. “Control over the south of Ukraine is another way to Transnistria, where there is also evidence that the Russian-speaking population is being oppressed,” Tass quoted Minnekayev as saying at a meeting in Russia’s central Sverdlovsk region. Nato must avoid a direct military confrontation with Russia that could lead to a third world war, German chancellor Olaf Scholz said in an interview with Der Spiegel when asked about Germany’s failure to deliver heavy weapons to Ukraine. Reuters reports he said there was no rule book that stated when Germany could be considered a party to the war in Ukraine. “That’s why it is all the more important that we consider each step very carefully and coordinate closely with one another,” he was quoted as saying. “To avoid an escalation towards Nato is a top priority for me. “That’s why I don’t focus on polls or let myself be irritated by shrill calls. The consequences of an error would be dramatic.” Germany will supply Ukraine with heavy weaponry very quickly through a three way exchange with Ukraine and some of Germany’s Nato partners, the country’s Europe minister, Anna Lührmann, told BBC radio. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has been facing a storm of criticism domestically and overseas for his lukewarm approach to meeting Ukrainian calls to supply heavy weaponry. The criticism has also been coming from Greens inside the German coalition government, and there is likely to be a motion in the Bundestag tabled by the conservative CDU backing the delivery of heavy weapons . But Lührmann, herself a Green, said Germany was completing a three-way exchange in which Nato partners will send heavy equipment to Ukraine that its army are trained to use, while Berlin will then refurbish the partners with modern German equipment. She said: “We are getting ready to supply heavy weapons by way of a three way exchange. What is the priority right now is Ukraine gets these heavy weapons as soon as possible. We have some Nato partners who can supply their weapons that they can do swiftly and we will refurbish them”. She said these weapons including tanks could be supplied “very fast”, but set no timeline. She said Ukraine was not well-equipped to use Nato weaponry, but could use old Soviet weaponry. It is expected Nato member Slovenia will hand to Ukraine several T-72 main tanks, and receive the Marder infantry fighting vehicle and the Fuchs wheeled armoured vehicle from Germany in return. Lührmann also urged Nato partners not to get involved in finger-pointing, adding she hoped Nato partners would follow the German example and take as many as 360,000 Ukrainians refugees. In remarks likely to be directed at London, she said: “I hope other partners in Nato will also be able to welcome as many Ukrainians.” On a visit to London, she also stressed she saw little point in airing differences within her governing coalition. “The important thing is that we remain united – anything else does not help anyone but Putin. Pointing fingers does not help here”. She added the German government from the very first day had been working on phasing out imports on fossil fuels from Russia. “Oil imports from Russia would be phased out within this year and very soon gas will follow.” Plans for Pope Francis to meet in Jerusalem in June with the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill, who has backed Russia’s war in Ukraine, have been suspended, the pope has told an Argentinian newspaper. Reuters reports Francis told La Nación in an interview that the plan was “suspended” because Vatican diplomats advised that such a meeting “could lend itself to much confusion at this moment”. Pope Francis has been outspoken about the conflict in Ukraine, and has been pictured at the Vatican holding a Ukrainian flag from the town of Bucha, which he described as being martyred. Russia’s defence ministry said it struck 58 military targets in Ukraine overnight, including sites where troops, fuel depots and military equipment were concentrated. Reuters reports the ministry said it had also struck three targets using high-precision missiles in Ukraine, including an S-300 air defence system and a large concentration of Ukrainian troops with their equipment. The claims have not been independently verified. On Telegram, Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk Oblast, has posted an image of a damaged car tyre with the message: We will try to get to the southern part of Rubizhne by car and bring food there, because people are waiting to be taken away. Unfortunately, the evacuation bus did not arrive – heavy artillery fire began. The Russians are not allowing the civilian population to be saved, they are blocking people in cities that are constantly under fire. We have a short video report on the fire in Tver. Seven people have been killed after a huge fire broke out at a key Russian defence research institute in Tver, north-west of Moscow, according to reports. Local authorities said 25 people had also been injured in Thursday’s fire, Tass news agency reported, citing emergency services, and that at least 10 people were missing. The death toll was initially put at five but Tass said it had increased to seven. “We confirm a number of seven deaths at the moment,” Tass cited the source as saying. It added that the number of casualties could increase. Counter-terror police from the UK gathering evidence of potential war crimes in Ukraine say they have been struck by the “incredibly harrowing” material and witness accounts from the frontline of the conflict. The Metropolitan police’s war crimes team, which is a unit within its counter-terrorism command (CTC), said it had already received around 50 referrals from people with a link to the UK, including those who have directly fled the conflict in the last two months since Russia began invading. Det chief supt Dominic Murphy, providing an update on the evidence gathering operation as CTC head of operations, told the PA Media news agency: “What we’re seeing is incredibly harrowing, beyond comprehension. In not far off 17 years in counterterrorism, (it is) some of the worst possible footage you could imagine seeing.” He said it would be up to the judicial authority to decide whether the material and testimonies gathered so far – which are being tested to a UK evidential standard – could be used to support a charge of genocide. Murphy said: “Does it provide evidence of a war crime? Quite possibly. Does it provide evidence of other international crimes? Quite possibly. And then it’s for those prosecuting agencies that we provide the information to to make those sorts of judgments and decisions.” Scotland Yard announced last month that it was supporting the international criminal court probe into alleged war crimes, and appealed for anyone with direct evidence to come forward. The Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who is chair of the defence select committee in the UK parliament, has told Sky News that the government in the UK needed to plan for the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He said: Our policy in Ukraine began back in 2014, under a very different prime minister, who sought to arm and train the Ukrainian forces. That’s been upgraded today. We’re moving even further than that. And there is going to be a lull around the corner where Ukraine activities will die down, for us to then look at domestic affairs. The security in Europe is about to decay over the next decade. We’re still absent of a strategy. You know, what does all this weapon systems that we’re giving to Ukraine, where does it lead to? Are we content with seeing part of Donbas remain in Russians hands? Or are we going to go back to 2000, pre-2014 borders, and push Russia out? This is where I would like to go. Otherwise, Putin will simply do all this again, because he’ll survive, and then he’ll attack another country in a couple of years’ time. Our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour tweets that Germany is planning to supply Nato with new heavy weaponry, which will facilitate the transfer of older equipment to Ukraine that the armed forces there are already trained to use. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has been in Bucharest this morning, meeting Romania’s prime minister Nicolae Ciucă. He tweeted pictures of them together and said: We discussed developing trade, energy and infrastructure cooperation, focused on ways to diversify routes for Ukrainian exports. Grateful to Romania for supporting Ukraine and welcoming Ukrainian refugees. The EU is urging people to drive less, turn down air conditioning and work from home three days a week, to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas. The European Commission says the measures, drawn up with the International Energy Agency, would save households close to €500 a year on average. If all EU citizens followed the nine-point plan, entitled “Playing My Part,” this would save enough oil to fill 120 super-tankers and enough natural gas to heat almost 20m homes. The EU and IEA said: People across Europe have helped Ukraine by making donations or aiding refugees directly, and many would like to do more. Most households are also experiencing higher energy bills because of the energy crisis exacerbated by the war. Using less energy is not only an immediate way for Europeans to reduce their bills, it also supports Ukraine by reducing the need for Russian oil and gas, thereby helping to reduce the revenue streams funding the invasion. According to the plan, turning down the thermostat by 1C would save about 7% of the energy used for heating, while setting an air conditioner 1C warmer could reduce the amount of electricity used by up to 10%. They called on citizens to: Turn down the heating in the winter and use less air conditioning in the summer. Adjust the boiler’s settings. Use their car more economically. Reduce their speed on highways, with the car air conditioning turned down. Leave their car at home on Sundays in large cities. Walk or cycle short journeys instead of driving. Use public transport. Use the train instead of flying. The mayor of Mariupol has issued a new appeal for the “full evacuation” of the southern Ukrainian city which Russia claims has fallen into its hands apart from the Azovstal metalworks, which President Vladimir Putin has ordered to be blockaded. “We need only one thing – the full evacuation of the population. About 100,000 people remain in Mariupol,” Reuters reports mayor Vadym Boichenko said on national television. The Ukraine armed forces have issued their latest operational report on the war. As well as suggesting there has been Russian activity across large swathes of the east of the country, they claim to have inflicted more losses on the Russian forces: According to the available information, on 20 April 20, another consignment of wounded servicemen of the Armed Forces of the Russian federation (about 220 people) and more than 50 bodies of the killed invaders were taken to the central district hospital of Novoaydar. In addition, the battalion tactical group of the 136th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade of the 58th Combined Arms Army of the Southern Military District, operating in the Kurakhiv area, suffered significant casualties (up to 250 men) and lost up to 10 rocket and artillery. The operational report also claims that the personnel of the 150th Motorized Rifle Division of the 8th Guards Combined Arms Army of the Southern Military District did not get paid by Russia. Ukraine’s armed forces also allege more mistreatment of civilians, claiming: In the temporarily occupied territories, Russian enemy units continue to block the movement of local people, looting and [making] the humanitarian crisis - destroying critical infrastructure and blocking the delivery of humanitarian goods from Ukraine. There have been cases of executions of civilians and volunteers. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine’s parliament has issued updated figures for child casualties of the war on Twitter. They say the total number of children affected by the Russian invasion is 594. There have been 208 deaths and 386 injuries among the nation’s children. The numbers have not been independently verified, and do not include casualty or deaths in besieged areas of the country such as Mariupol. There will be no humanitarian corridors open today in Ukraine, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has announced on Telegram. She said: Due to the danger on the routes today, 22 April, there will be no humanitarian corridors. I appeal to all those who are waiting for the evacuation: be patient, please hold on! Earlier this week, the country went three consecutive days with no escape routes fro civilians being arranged. Four buses carrying 80 people did reach the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia on Thursday after escaping in a convoy from Mariupol. This is Martin Belam taking over the blog. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com The physical damage to Ukraine’s infrastructure has reached $60bn and will rise further as the war continues, World Bank President David Malpass has said. Malpass told a World Bank conference on Ukraine’s financial assistance needs that the early estimate of “narrow” damage costs does not include the growing economic costs of the war to Ukraine. “Of course the war is still ongoing, so those costs are rising,” Malpass said. During an address to leaders of the World Bank and IMF via video link on Thursday, Zelenskiy said Ukraine needs $7bn each month to keep its economy afloat. Here are some of the latest images to land on our newswires out of Ukraine today. Boris Johnson has revealed that dozens of Ukrainian soldiers are training in the UK, learning how to use 120 British armoured vehicles before returning with them to fight in the war against Russia. British forces are also training Ukrainian counterparts in Poland on how to use anti-aircraft missiles, the prime minister said. I can say that we are currently training Ukrainians in Poland in the use of anti-aircraft defence, and actually in the UK in the use of armoured vehicles,” Johnson said. Britain has agreed to send at least 120 armoured vehicles, 80 of which are the Mastiff, Husky and Wolfhound protected mobility vehicles, which the British army says are designed to be used in “combat, combat support and combat service roles” driving troops behind and up to the frontlines. The other 40 vehicles are for combat reconnaissance, including the Spartan, which can carry four soldiers plus a crew of three, Samaritan ambulances, Sultan armoured command vehicles, and Samson armoured recovery vehicles. Training on them takes a few weeks, defence sources said, largely so that the Ukrainians can become familiar with the control systems available. British forces in Poland are understood to be training the Ukrainian military in using the Starstreak air defence missile system and the Stormer vehicles from which the weapons are launched. We are moving, in conjunction with our allies, to providing new types of equipment that perhaps the Ukrainians wouldn’t have had previous experience of, so it’s only sensible that they get the requisite training to make the best use of it,” Johnson’s spokesperson said. Ukraine needs $7bn each month to keep its economy afloat amid the “economic losses” inflicted by Russia, President Zelenskiy has said. Zelenskiy addressed leaders of the World Bank and IMF via video link on Thursday: The Russian troops are deliberately destroying all facilities in our country that could provide an economic basis for life. Railway stations, food warehouses, bakery plants, oil terminals, etc … As of now, given the economic downturn and broken economic ties, we need up to $7bn in financial support each month. Ukraine will need hundreds of billions of dollars to recover from this war. I’m sure each of you has these calculations, I’m sure of it.” Putin’s decision to blockade Mariupol’s Azovstal steel plant likely indicates a desire to contain Ukrainian resistance in the city and free up Russian forces to be deployed in eastern Ukraine, British intelligence suggests. A report released just before 7am BST reads: Putin’s decision to blockade the Azovstal steel plant likely indicates a desire to contain Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol and free up Russian forces to be deployed elsewhere in eastern Ukraine. A full ground assault by Russia on the plant would likely incur significant Russian casualties, further decreasing their overall combat effectiveness. In the eastern Donbas, heavy shelling and fighting continues as Russia seeks to advance further towards settlements including Krasnyy Lyman, Buhayikva, Barvinkove, Lyman and Popasna as part of their plans for the region. Despite Russia’s renewed focus they are still suffering from losses sustained earlier in the conflict. In order to try and reconstitute their depleted forces, they have resorted to transiting inoperable equipment back to Russia for repair.” Russia has been hiding evidence of its “barbaric” war crimes in Mariupol by burying the bodies of civilians killed by shelling in a new mass grave, the city’s mayor said on Thursday, as a US satellite imagery company released photos that appeared to match the site. The mayor, Vadym Boichenko, said Russian trucks had collected corpses from the streets of the port city and had transported them to the nearby village of Manhush. They were then secretly thrown into a mass grave in a field next to the settlement’s old cemetery, he said. The invaders are concealing evidence of their crimes. The cemetery is located near a petrol station to the left side of a circular road. The Russians have dug huge trenches, 30 metres wide. They chuck people in.” “The bodies of the dead were being brought by the truckload and actually simply being dumped in mounds,” an aide to Boychenko, Piotr Andryushchenko, said on Telegram. The graves could hold as many as 9,000 dead, the Mariupol city council said on Thursday in a post on the Telegram messaging app. The mayor estimated that more than 20,000 Mariupol residents had been killed since Russian forces began attacking the city during the early days of Vladimir Putin’s invasion. Most bodies had now been removed, he said, with some disposed of in mobile crematoriums. Later on Thursday, the US company Maxar Technologies released images of what appeared to be a mass grave in the same area. The site had been expanded in recent weeks to contain more than 200 new graves, Maxar said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russia of planning to “falsify” an independence referendum in the partly occupied southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Zelenskiy urged residents of areas under Russian occupation to not provide any personal information, like their passport numbers, to the Russian forces, in a video message aired late on Thursday evening. I urge the residents of the southern regions of Ukraine – Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions – to be very careful about what information you provide to the invaders. And if they ask you to fill out some questionnaires, leave your passport data somewhere, you should know – this is not to help you … This is aimed to falsify the so-called referendum on your land, if an order comes from Moscow to stage such a show. And this is the reality. Be careful.” Zelenskiy also issued a warning to ‘Kherson People’s Republics’ saying their plans “are not going to fly”. “If someone wants a new annexation, it can only lead to new powerful sanctions strikes on Russia. You will make your country as poor as Russia hasn’t been since the 1917 civil war. So it is better to seek peace now.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments until my colleague, Martin Belam, takes the reins a little later in the day. It is just past 7am in Ukraine. Here’s what we know so far: Russia plans to “falsify” an independence referendum in the partly occupied southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy claimed. Zelenskiy urged residents of areas under Russian occupation to not provide any personal information, like their passport numbers, to the Russian forces, in a video message aired late on Thursday evening. Russia has been hiding evidence of its “barbaric” war crimes in Mariupol by burying the bodies of civilians killed by shelling in a new mass grave, the city’s mayor said, as a US satellite imagery company released photos that appeared to match the site. Civilians are trapped under buildings in Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks plant, deputy commander Svyatoslav Palamar from Ukraine’s Azov regiment has said. “We have wounded and dead inside the bunkers. Some civilians remain trapped under the collapsed buildings,” he told the BBC. Some children are believed to be as young as three months old. US officials have dismissed Vladimir Putin’s claim that his forces have “liberated” the port city of Mariupol as disinformation. The Russian president made the claim despite an admission by his defence minister that Russia’s military was still battling thousands of Ukrainian troops holed up in Azovstal steelworks. Western officials said Putin is “still in a position to win” in Ukraine despite failing in his pre-war objectives. Russia had started to address some of the issues that had hindered its army at the start of the invasion, one official said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russia rejected a proposed Easter truce, but that he remains hopeful of prospects for peace. Earlier this week Russia rejected the same request from the UN, claiming it was not “sincere” and would give Ukrainian fighters more time to arm themselves. Zelenskiy also told leaders of the World Bank and IMF that Ukraine will need “hundreds of billions of dollars” to recover from war. Ukraine needs $7bn each month to keep its economy afloat amid the “economic losses” inflicted by Russia, Zelenskiy said via video link. He also proposed a special war tax on Russia. World Bank president David Malpass said the physical damage to Ukraine’s infrastructure has reached $60bn. Germany will provide a further €37m ($40.12m) to Ukraine for reconstruction as a result of the war, Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper reported, citing development ministry sources. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, confirmed war crimes experts are helping Ukraine “to ensure the inevitability of Russia’s responsibility”. The United States said it has also been in contact with Ukraine’s prosecutor and is assisting with the preservation and collection of evidence of war crimes committed by Russia, US Attorney General Merrick Garland said. More than 7,600 war crimes committed by Russia have been recorded, Venediktova claimed. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister apologised to residents of Mariupol for failed evacuation efforts from the besieged port city. She added that authorities will not give up. Officials estimate that 100,000 people are currently trapped in the city. The US defence secretary will host Ukraine-focused defence talks with allies in Germany next week, the Pentagon has confirmed. Lloyd Austin will meet allies on 26 April at the Ramstein Air Base in south-western Germany, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said. The pentagon also confirmed newly disclosed ‘Ghost’ drones are part of America’s latest arms package for Ukraine. Russia has slapped “indefinite’ travel bans on US vice president Kamala Harris and Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg as well as dozens of prominent Americans and Canadians in retaliation for sanctions imposed over Ukraine. The Russian foreign ministry said the travel restrictions on 29 Americans and 61 Canadians - which also includes defence officials, business leaders and journalists from both countries - would remain in effect indefinitely. UK prime minister Boris Johnson revealed that dozens of Ukrainian soldiers are training in the UK, learning how to use 120 British armoured vehicles before returning with them to fight in the war against Russia. British forces are also training Ukrainian counterparts in Poland on how to use anti-aircraft missiles, the prime minister said. About 120,000 civilians are blocked from leaving Mariupol, Zelenskiy said. Three school buses filled with people from Mariupol arrived in Zaporizhzhia today after crossing through territory held by Russian forces, but Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said the number of evacuees was far smaller than had been hoped for. Russian forces captured dozens of villages in the eastern Donetsk region on Thursday, an aide to Zelenskiy’s chief of staff said. The bodies of 1,020 civilians are being stored in morgues in and around Kyiv after Russian troops withdrew, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Olga Stefanishyna, told Agence France-Presse. Her comments came after police said they discovered the remains of nine civilians in the town of Borodianka, 54km (34 miles) from the capital, buried in communal graves and showing signs of torture. Joe Biden announced that the US will provide another $800m (£614m) military assistance package to Ukraine to “further augment Ukraine’s ability to fight in the east, in the Donbas region”. The new US weapon deliveries will include 72 howitzers and their towing vehicles along with 144,000 artillery rounds and more than 120 drones tailored for Ukraine’s needs. Biden also announced that the US will accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees under a new programme. Seven people were killed after a huge fire broke out at a key Russian defence research institute in Tver north-west of Moscow, according to reports. Local authorities said 25 people had also been injured in Thursday’s fire, Tass news agency reported, citing emergency services, and that at least 10 people were missing.

After all, in the blink of an evolutionary eye we have gone from being able to stand upright to being able to fly off our planet, from believing that the horizon was the end of the earth to being able to peer into deep space-time, from understanding how our bodies work to being on the verge of being able to create life itself. We love to compete and we love to collaborate, often combining both activities in the name of sport. We are inherently social and have formed our immensely complex civilisation on the basis of agreeing what is “socially acceptable” and enshrining that with laws and rules. With climate change, where we have gone astray is failing to update those laws and rules to cope with our burgeoning population, especially in our relationship with nature and the functioning of our economy. There are two actions we could take that would transform our chances of surviving into the future. The first would be to enact a law of ecocide – the death of whose principal proponent was sadly reported in the same issue (Polly Higgins, tireless advocate for ecocide law, dies aged 50, 23 April). And the second would be to change the rules of accounting so that all companies using natural resources had to reinvest, say, 2% of their revenues in the restoration and repair of the natural environment. In Extinction Rebellion and the UK Student Climate Network, we are seeing the emergence of social acceptance that it is wrong to not just allow but to actively reward the destruction of our future. We now need to press for these rule changes that would bring our destructive economy under control. Harold Forbes Wareham, Dorset • Greta Thunberg hits the nail on the head in calling for more support from the older generation and for the unions to get more active in tackling climate change (Activist lends support to general strike for the climate, 23 April). A crucial part of generating this support is to recognise that any effective response to the climate threat will mean a massive green infrastructure programme which will generate jobs in every constituency. This would include a labour-intensive upgrading of the energy efficiency of every building countrywide, plus the upgrading of local transport systems and recycling provision. To get support for this approach not only from older people, but also more conservative ones, it will be imperative to emphasise the advantages for small and medium-sized businesses, as well as the investment and savings opportunities involved in addressing climate change. Add to this the concerns of these sectors of society about the future of their children and grandchildren, and this approach should result in a broader range of support for a net zero-carbon future. As such it should appeal to all political parties and so help ensure the urgent demands of Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion can be more swiftly met. Colin Hines Convener, UK Green New Deal Group • While I applaud the awareness being raised by Extinction Rebellion campaigners, I object to Gaby Hinsliff saying “past generations were oblivious” (Opinion, 20 April). I am 73 and was brought up just after the war. We had no plastic bags and walked to the shops with our own bags. We got 2d on returned glass bottles. We walked to school. We beat cakes with a wooden spoon. We dried our clothes on the line. There was no bubble wrap – we used scrunched-up newspapers for fragile things and also for takeaway fish and chips. We pushed lawnmowers and we didn’t drive to the gym to get our exercise. I could go on! As soon as new products came in, such as plastic and labour-saving electrical goods, some of us realised they were polluting and led to tremendous waste, so I don’t feel our postwar generation should be held entirely responsible for our present appalling climate problems and ocean pollution. Elizabeth Earl Chard, Somerset • We are experiencing two protest movements – Extinction Rebellion and Brexit – which might seem to be diametrically opposed. But to what extent do they reflect a shared understanding – that, at least for rich and ageing societies, the costs of a growing GDP are simply too high? For some those costs are represented by the need for an immigrant workforce; for others they are the destruction of the environment. But both movements can be seen as a call for deceleration – a call that traditional politicians simply do not have the language to meet. The empty branding that characterises our main political parties no longer reflects any significant values; the chasms within those parties make that abundantly clear. The response to both these protests – however different they appear – will require a new narrative of interdependence between citizens, particularly between young and old; we need a revised vocabulary to enable new kinds of conversation. Charlotte Roueché London • I write in response to letters published on 20 April. I can assure Jean Corston that many Extinction Rebellion members go far beyond using a green energy supplier. We can also tell her that individuals’ energy suppliers don’t count for much if your government’s energy policy is fracking and nuclear power stations. Yes, Andy Brown, most protesters are white but, as I said to a fellow protester, if I were a young black man I would not want to risk being arrested for fear of how a historically institutionally racist judiciary and job market might treat me. Incidentally, the only people to verbally abuse me were white; the many black and non-British people who stopped to talk were all very supportive. Finally, I can tell Colin Baker that, apart from the initial jams last Monday, the police did an admirable job in keeping traffic flowing and minimising disruption. What will be interesting to see is the pollution records for London over the week. Many car journeys in central London are unnecessary, and if we showed some people an alternative way to travel, that can only be for the good of all of our lungs. I did not take part in acts of civil disobedience lightly, but to help protect the beautiful country, and world, that I live in – not just for my son but for future generations. Rebecca Fricker Loughton, Essex • I welcome the contributions from Mark Carney and Larry Elliott (Mark Carney’s warning on climate change is only a start, 18 April) on the role of finance and global heating, but as I returned home after five days on the bridge, what struck me most was the silence from our politicians. Perhaps I was too busy handing out sunscreen or enjoying the atmosphere and music. Or is it because our government has nothing to say on anything? Paradigm shifts in public attitudes and even revolutions occur when the right time comes. Extinction Rebellion have, unlike our politicians, through long preparation and some luck, appeared on the scene just when our politicians’ minds have been emptied of coherent thought, and the supporting establishment (here business and the cut-to-the-bone police) has lost confidence in them.

The government insisted the new plant in Somerset was only being approved with “significant new safeguards” to make sure China and other foreign investors could not own stakes in British nuclear plants without UK government approval. However, Labour and environmental groups said the new security measures were merely “window dressing” and “hot air” that changed very little about the project, as the price remains the same and the new security powers already exist in law. Under the proposals, EDF, the French firm building the plant with a £6bn investment from a Chinese state nuclear firm, will not be able to sell on its ownership without permission. For future projects, the UK government will own a “special share” that means it will have a veto over owners if there are national security concerns. In a sign the new requirements do not appear to be overly stringent, both EDF and China General Nuclear said they were delighted by the approval, which they claimed will let them proceed with Hinkley and their wider plans for nuclear construction in the UK in future. The Chinese are keen to proceed with a new plant at Bradwell in Essex in particular because it will be their own design built under the UK’s tough safety regulations, allowing the company to use it as a showcase to the rest of the world. “We are now able to move forward and deliver much-needed nuclear capacity at Hinkley Point, Sizewell and Bradwell with our strategic partners, EDF, and provide the UK with safe, reliable and sustainable low-carbon energy,” CGN said. “CGN and EDF have worked together in close cooperation for decades and this has laid a solid foundation for these three new nuclear projects. CGN looks forward to leveraging its 30 years’ experience in nuclear construction and operation and playing an important role in meeting the UK’s future energy needs.” The shadow energy secretary, Barry Gardiner, said the government has “backed down with a whimper” over its security concerns about Chinese involvement, saying it had announced “new powers they already possess”. He told Greg Clark, the business secretary: “They have claimed they introduced significant new safeguards into this package. The secretary of state already has such powers. Will the secretary of state acknowledge that he can prevent the sale of any element of critical infrastructure?” John Sauven, the Greenpeace executive director, also said the government’s review “appears to have been a lot of hot air”. “The prime minister has baulked at the political embarrassment of irritating the French and offending the Chinese. Consequently, even if EDF manages to get the technology to work, the UK will pay the price by saddling themselves until 2060 with an out of date, flawed and expensive technology,” he said. Clark, the business and energy secretary, said the new security restrictions were an improvement, claiming EDF would have been at liberty to sell its stake on without the revised contract. His Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy confirmed that this was the only new security requirement for Hinkley to proceed. The controversial scheme in Somerset was approved six weeks after May unexpectedly placed the project under review, causing tensions with Beijing. Following the review, the government is keeping a guaranteed price of £92.50 to EDF for every megawatt hour of electricity generated, despite concerns that is far higher than the market rate. Chinese officials have previously given a series of veiled warnings that a decision by Britain to halt their investment in UK nuclear would be seen as a snub and would put at risk a supposed golden era of relations between the two countries. The decision means Hinkley will be the first new nuclear reactor built in Britain in two decades. Before an announcement in the House of Commons, Clark said: “Having thoroughly reviewed the proposal for Hinkley Point C, we will introduce a series of measures to enhance security and will ensure Hinkley cannot change hands without the government’s agreement. Consequently, we have decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation. “Britain needs to upgrade its supplies of energy, and we have always been clear that nuclear is an important part of ensuring our future low-carbon energy security.” The wider changes to the government’s approach to the ownership of critical infrastructure are designed to ensure fuller scrutiny for the purposes of national security. This marks a departure from the more laissez-faire approach of David Cameron’s administration. A government statement said: “Following a comprehensive review of the Hinkley Point C project, and a revised agreement with EDF, the government has decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation. However, ministers will impose a new legal framework for future foreign investment in Britain’s critical infrastructure, which will include nuclear energy and apply after Hinkley. “The changes mean that, while the UK will remain one of the most open economies in the world, the public can be confident that foreign direct investment works in the country’s best interests,” it said. The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, tweeted that it was excellent news that the project was going ahead and that it would be a boost for jobs in France. The economy minister, Michel Sapin, said it was an “undeniable success for French industry” and would be “a big contribution to supporting employment in France”. Jean-Bernard Lévy, the chief executive of EDF Group, said: “The decision of the British government to approve the construction of Hinkley Point C marks the relaunch of nuclear in Europe.” But the news was met with dismay by environmental campaigners, who had been given hope it would be cancelled when May placed it under review. Greenpeace’s Sauven said the potential political embarrassment of scrapping the deal must have proved too great. But he added: “This decision is unlikely to be the grand finale to this summer’s political soap opera. There are still huge outstanding financial, legal and technical obstacles that can’t be brushed under the carpet. There might be months or even years of wrangling over these issues. That’s why the government should start supporting renewable power that can come online quickly for a competitive price.” Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green party, said it was absurd and disappointing that the deal was to proceed when the government was reducing support for cheaper, safer and more reliable renewable alternatives. “Instead of investing in this eye-wateringly expensive white elephant, the government should be doing all it can to support offshore wind, energy efficiency and innovative new technologies, such as energy storage,” she said. However, business groups, engineers and trade unions welcomed the decision to proceed, saying it would create jobs and ensure a secure supply of energy. Claire Jakobsson, of the EEF manufacturers’ organisation, it was a “relief to see Hinkley proceeding after months of delays and uncertainty”, but called for significant reductions in the price of electricity generated by future nuclear projects. Brian Rye, acting general secretary of Ucatt, the construction union, said: “The go-ahead was vital for the construction industry, which desperately needed the confirmation of such a major project following a slowdown in the industry caused by the Brexit vote. It is also good news for the overall economy as it helps to guarantee the stability of our future energy supply.” The French secretary of state for industry, Christophe Sirugue, told France Info the Hinkley decision was good news because it validated French industrial strategy to invest in nuclear. He said it would create 4,500 jobs in France. Questions remain over the difficult financial position of the French state-owned power company EDF, which will assume up-front costs, which some unions in France argue could jeopardise the firm’s survival. Sirugue said the state had “taken serious account” of the concerns and would be reorganising and helping out the firm. He added that it was “extremely important” that the Hinkley project went ahead in terms of France “demonstrating our industrial savoir-faire” to the international market. Timeline November 2005 Tony Blair launches UK energy policy review. May 2006 Blair declares that failing to take action on the UK’s nuclear plants would be a “dereliction of duty”. July 2006 Government gives the green light to new nuclear power plants. The industry secretary, Alistair Darling, says the private sector will have to “initiate, fund, construct and operate” the nuclear plants. February 2007 The UK chief executive of French state-owned EDF says Britain will be cooking its Christmas turkeys on new nuclear power by 2017. August 2007 Safety checks begin on the EPR (European pressurised reactor) power plant design that will be used at Hinkley. January 2008 The government says the first new plant will be completed “well before 2020”. September 2008 EDF buys British Energy, a key player in the UK nuclear industry, for £12.5bn. October 2010 UK government names Hinkley Point as one of eight candidates for a new power station. October 2011 EDF submits 55,000-page planning application for Hinkley Point C. December 2011 First new reactor will not be operational until 2019, says government. November 2012 EDF awarded first new site licence for a UK nuclear power station in 25 years, at Hinkley Point. October 2013 Government announces subsidy deal for Hinkley Point, which will now not produce power until 2023, according to EDF. May 2014 European commission approves state aid for Hinkley Point and costs the plant at £24.5bn. October 2015 EDF signs Hinkley development deal with China General Nuclear Power Corporation, which will provide one-third of the cost, now estimated at £18bn. March 2016 Finance chief of EDF quits, amid fears Hinkley Point C could jeopardise the company’s financial position. EDF’s chief executive promises long-delayed final investment decision will be made soon. 28 July 2016 EDF decides to press ahead with building Hinkley Point C. But government takes everyone by surprise by postponing its final decision on the project until the early autumn. 15 September 2016 Theresa May finally gives £18bn project go-ahead, but adds “significant new safeguards” to ensure national security."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/may/26/observer-letters-george-orwell-dystopia-with-us-today","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-26T04:59:02Z","webTitle":"George Orwell’s dystopia is with us today | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/26/observer-letters-george-orwell-dystopia-with-us-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2019/may/26/observer-letters-george-orwell-dystopia-with-us-today","fields":{"headline":"Letters: George Orwell’s dystopia is with us today","bodyText":"Your article on George Orwell’s prescient novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four, coincided with several stories showing that his dystopia is upon us (“Big Brother’s long shadow”, New Review). From tales of people being fined for not showing their face (Kenan Malik, Comment) to accounts of remote surveillance via mobile phones (John Naughton, New Review), it seems we are always under observation. Rachel Cooke’s dispiriting experience in New York, being forced to order her meal via a machine (Observer Food Monthly) is a further sign of the dehumanisation taking place in commerce and at work. Capital is using technology to eliminate labour and government is using it to control behaviour. Absent a major political movement against this threat, our only choice is to resist as individuals: never shop online, always pay cash, give up Google maps. How many of us are ready to trade convenience for freedom? Antony Crossley Chobham, Surrey Nineteen Eighty-Four is surely one of the worst novels ever published. Not only is it quite unfinishable, about a third of its content towards the end being a dull political rant, but it is also extremely badly put together and completely lacking in editing. Orwell patronises the working class, coining the derogatory term “proles”, and his attempts at love interest and erotic writing add a new dimension to the word cringeworthy. The book is also quite clearly antisemitic, in a horrible prewar English upper-class jealousy against imaginary “Jews” manifested in the crude stereotype of Goldstein. As an anagram of “1948”, the novel was intended as a warning of what would become of Britain under socialists. The Attlee administration attacked by Orwell proved to be this country’s greatest and most beneficial government. As Dorian Lynskey points out, it is more the broad ideas expressed (Big Brother, newspeak, ministry of truth) than any merit as a text that makes the novel influential. George Orwell could write beautifully, especially in his journalism, but Nineteen Eighty-Four is a ghastly failure as a novel. Its ill-judged use as an exam set text must have put thousands of children off literature for life. Ralph Lloyd-Jones Nottingham Lights, camera, diversity Vanessa Thorpe’s piece was bang on (“Wanted: sound engineers, make-up artists. No nepotists, please”, News). Having worked in the film, set-building and fabrication industries, I know only too well the lack of diversity, the sexism and gender pay gap within these fields – not to mention the lack of financial stability, recognition and health costs. Those recruited have more often than not received a decent education, myself included, and are lucky to be able to pursue a creative career. A wider variety of people would be an absolute dream. But for this to happen, fundamental changes need to be made to these industries and to our society. Sophie Fishel Bromley, Kent Assad is not all bad Simon Tisdall, in an otherwise excellent article on Iran-US tensions, slips in a reference to “Assad’s Alawite regime” (“Old grudges, new weapons… is the US on brink of war with Iran?”, Focus). The religious slur has a nasty sound to it but it’s also absurd, since the Syrian government has unquestioned majority support, not only of the relatively few Alawites, but of the Druze, several Christian denominations, even Shias and Sunni Kurds. You may not like Assad, but he has a large and genuine constituency. With the support of Iranians and Russians, Syrian forces managed to halt the previously unstoppable advance of Isis at Palmyra, for which the rest of us might well be grateful. Professor Robin Milner-Gulland Washington, West Sussex BBC Scotland is not for me Fifty years ago I was a regular complainer to the BBC about programmes that were preceded by the announcement “except for viewers in Scotland”. So I was looking forward to the new BBC Scotland channel as I thought I would no longer have to miss network programmes due to the substitution of Scottish ones (“Derided before its launch, BBC Scotland has silenced the critics with its excellence”, Comment. How wrong I was: still there is substitution and I am bombarded in the breaks between programmes for trailers that don’t encourage me to watch anything shown. Kevin McKenna highlights Getting Hitched Asian Style, but this has already been shown on the BBC as a substitute for a network programme. The programmes seem to be made for 19- to 34-year-olds and viewers in the central belt of Scotland. Margaret Vandecasteele Wick, Caithness A model exam? Letter-writer Bernie Evans doubts whether the Cambridge IGCSE was subject to the same reforms as GCSEs (“Playing the exam game”). In fact, Cambridge IGCSE qualifications were a model for the reforms to GCSEs in England. Recent comparison between Cambridge IGCSE and GCSE results shows close alignment of the standard. Cambridge International would be very pleased to see state schools in England having the same choice of qualifications as independent schools, including our many syllabus subjects (such as global perspectives) that are not available as GCSEs. This is a decision that government could make, now that its reforms of GCSE are embedded. Christine Özden, chief executive Cambridge Assessment International Education Cambridge Electricity: the way ahead My reaction to your important business leader (“Labour’s plans for publicly owned green energy are no more than electric dreams”) is one of severe disappointment. Although in many respects you seem to agree with Labour’s proposals for renationalising the UK’s energy supply companies, in the end all you do is rubbish their ideas on points of detail, rather than engage constructively to improve them. If the UK is not to abandon all serious effort to avoid calamitous climate change, we know that in 30 years’ time the electricity generating and gas supply industries will have to have been utterly transformed. Electricity generation, instead of being based as at present on CCGT plant fired by natural gas, with significant support from nuclear power, must be metamorphosed into a system based on renewable energy, principally wind and solar, with minimal support from nuclear (Hinkley Point C). The gas supply industry should no longer dispense natural gas but (if it exists at all, as I firmly believe it should), hydrogen, the only acceptable “green” gas (in an echo of the town gas for which it was originally developed in Victorian times). The oil industry must also be transformed, with sales of petrol, diesel and heating oils reduced to a tiny fraction of their present level. This is not a dream, but foresight of reality. As a start, I suggest that firm plans are drawn up by a competent, government-nominated body for several thousand megawatts of wind power and several thousand MW of solar power within the next one or two years. Early experience with such projects is sure to expose all kinds of planning, technological and economic difficulties, which will have to be faced up to and dealt with as they arise, including in particular problems inherent in relying on intermittent energy sources, which call in their solution for large-scale energy storage. Further ahead, a rolling programme will need to be established to ensure that the ultimate objective of zero net carbon dioxide emissions is achieved. We must of course also do what we can to try to ensure that the rest of the world follows as ambitiously. Jim Waterton Glasgow If I won a million… Were I to receive a windfall of £1m, or another substantial sum – unlikely, since the sum total of my gambling is the monthly raffle at my local Labour party meeting, but hypothetically – I would not buy a Mercedes or jet off to the Maldives (“Pennies from heaven”, Magazine). I am content with my modest lifestyle and would not know how to spend such sums on selfish activities. Nor would I wish to increase my contribution to the climate crisis. Where is the imagination or the public spirit? My problem would be in choosing which campaigning group would most deserve a boost.

But in almost every way, the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station offers only expensive and risky solutions from the 20th century. A nuclear power station is about as useful in solving the dilemma as a 20th-century nuclear weapon is in ending a 21st-century guerilla insurgency, because a ground-level energy revolution is taking place. The old regime of large, centralised power plants is being replaced a smart, efficient and widely distributed network, powered by increasing amounts of renewable energy. If that sounds radical, it’s not – it’s just how the internet works to provide fast and reliable communications. If it sounds like a hippy dream, it’s not – New York State’s energy plan has embraced it in order to deliver 50% renewable electricity by 2030 and a 23% cut in energy use by buildings. In the UK, this government aims to improve the energy efficiency of just half the homes retrofitted by the last one. If you think New York State is alone in its thinking - it’s not. Bodies including the government’s own National Infrastructure Commission (NIC), the National Grid and industry group Energy UK all point to a smart system that is more secure, cheaper and faster to build and they all use the same word: “revolution”, while the International Energy Agency talks of a rapid “transition”. The momentum behind the revolution is straightforward: cost. While renewable energy and other energy technologies are plummeting in price, nuclear power continues its historical trend of getting ever more expensive. Even if the UK negotiates a sharp cut in the subsidies for Hinkley, it still could not be built before 2026 at the earliest. By then, a capacity crunch will have hit the UK as old power stations close. Hinkley puts a lot of generation capacity in one plan , which is very risky given the financial, legal and technical obstacles it faces. EDF, the French company leading the project, is taking on considerable financial risk, with Martin Young, an energy analyst at investment bank RBC Capital Markets, saying the project “verges on insanity”. Court challenges – including from EDF’s own trade unions – abound and the fiendishly complex project has been described by one nuclear engineer as unconstructable. Two attempts to build the same reactor in France and Finland are miles over budget and behind schedule. In contrast, energy efficiency could deliver six Hinkleys’ worth of electricity by 2030, according to the government’s own research. Four Hinkleys’ worth could be saved by increasing the ability to store electricity and making the grid smarter, with the latter alone likely to save billpayers £8bn a year. Capturing and storing carbon from fossil fuel plants is also vital, but has received scant attention from the government compared with Hinkley. It would halve the cost of beating global warming, according to government’s own official advisers, but in November ministers abruptly canned its plan. The government will not be able to get out of the Hinkley deal, however. Once signed, the deal with EDF contains a “poison pill” which could leave taxpayers with a £22bn bill if a future UK government shuts down the plant. The government has remained adamant that Hinkley, which could provide 7% of the UK’s electricity, is a vital part of a secure low-carbon future. But it is not just the idea of EDF’s partner, a Chinese state company, being involved that creates security fears. Nuclear power plants are prone to shutdowns, over safety concerns or even invasions of jellyfish into cooling waters as happened at Torness, in Scotland in 2011. Closing down such a giant plant at short notice immediately puts the security of the nation’s electricity supply at risk. One back-up option recently favoured by the government is to deploy farms of diesel generators, which emit large volumes of carbon dioxide, ready to start up when needed. Yet in a smart, distributed system, knocking out one wind turbine or solar panel is barely noticed by the grid. The risk with Hinkley is that will it bring about the mutually assured destruction of both EDF and UK energy policy, with an expensive, hard-to-build reactor, in which the taxpayer will end up footing the bill."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/aug/14/wednesday-briefing-mind-the-gap-between-ticket-prices-and-wages","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-14T05:26:17Z","webTitle":"Wednesday briefing: Mind the gap between ticket prices and wages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/14/wednesday-briefing-mind-the-gap-between-ticket-prices-and-wages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/aug/14/wednesday-briefing-mind-the-gap-between-ticket-prices-and-wages","fields":{"headline":"Wednesday briefing: Mind the gap between ticket prices and wages","bodyText":"Top story: ‘Every penny should be invested in railways’ Good morning – Warren Murray putting today’s big stories at your fingertips. An increase of about 2.9% in train ticket prices is expected to be confirmed this morning, capping a decade when fares have risen at double the rate of wages. Campaigners and unions have warned that the latest increase risks driving passengers off the railway. The overall cost of taking the train has gone up by 46% since 2009, while wages have only grown by 23%, according to analysis by the TUC, which said operators paid £200m in dividends to shareholders in 2017-18 and received £3.8bn in public subsidy. “It’s time to take the railways back into public hands,” said Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary. “Every single penny from every single fare should be invested into our railways.” Campaigners and unions will stage protests against the fare increases at stations around Britain today. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; The search for answers continues after the body of missing Nora Quoirin, 15, was found in the Malaysian jungle.

The group has written to Johnson accusing him of setting impossible terms for the EU to agree to a deal. The intervention is a sign that Tories opposed to a no-deal Brexit are prepared to vote with opposition parties to prevent Johnson crashing the UK out of the EU on 31 October. John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, has vowed at an Edinburgh festival fringe event to fight attempts to sideline parliament “with every breath in my body”. He said he would insist on the right of parliament to continue to sit and debate. * * * Hinkley mental health crisis – Hinkley Point nuclear power station, Britain’s biggest construction project since the second world war, is grappling with a mental illness crisis. The Unite union says it has been told of 10 suicide attempts in the first four months of 2019 and the Guardian understands at least two workers connected to the project have taken their own lives. The main causes of the distress appear to be loneliness, relationship breakdown and the struggle of being sometimes hundreds of miles away from family. Suicide rates in the construction industry are more than three times the national average for men. The owner EDF is implementing a mental health programme on the site, including posters urging troubled contractors to open up and one in 20 workers now trained as a mental health first aider, or “buddy”. • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Eighteen people were killed and more than 650 injured when cavalry charged at pro-democracy protesters on 16 August 1819. The reformer Henry Hunt was speaking at the protest. Haigh Allen, a magistrate from Huddersfield, wrote: “Gents … The meeting took place at 1 o’clock. Hunt in the chair with 16 flags and 7 caps of Liberty hoisted up amongst upwards of 60,000 people, the cavalry has just broke in upon them, the flags are taken, Hunt and his party secured, several lives are lost and a number wounded. The cavalry are now securing the streets in all directions, ½ past 2 o’clock, yours H.

Excited analysts claimed that last week’s Syrian upheaval foreshadowed an end to US regional leadership, even to Washington’s international dominance. A commentator for The Hill, a website reporting on American politics, compared the withdrawal to another famous turning point – Britain’s “east of Suez” retreat in 1968. Syrian developments were also taken by some observers as proof that an increasingly isolationist America is turning in on itself and giving way – as failing empires inevitably do – to a successor world order shaped by emerging global powers, principally China. But is the Syrian crisis really a watershed moment? And if it is, who are the contenders for America’s crown as no 1 global superpower – and what are their own strengths and weaknesses? The perception of gradual, broad US international disengagement is widely held. But as historians know, it is hard to tell exactly when a specific, definitive turning point is reached. Contemporary observers, caught up in fast-moving events, are often the least qualified to do so. Identifying such transformative tipping points can still be problematic hundreds of years later. Asked about the significance of the 1789 French revolution, Zhou Enlai, the former Chinese Communist party leader, reportedly quipped: “It’s too soon to say.” Permanent changes in the strategic and geopolitical balance of power rarely come out of the blue. With hindsight, such shifts are frequently seen as the long-signalled culmination of preceding policy decisions, unconnected political and military moves, mishaps and miscalculations. By general agreement, 1945 was a watershed year, marking the final defeat of fascism and the creation, through the UN, of what is known as the “rules-based international order”. In much the same way, 1989 is seen, in the US at least, as the year when the west “won” the cold war with the Soviet Union. Yet it can be argued (as Russians do) that the battle of Stalingrad, which concluded in 1943 with a decisive Red Army victory over the invading Nazis, was the true turning point of the second world war. Likewise, some say the cold war merely paused in 1989, only to resume a decade later in a different guise. Looking back in time, the true significance of other big moments, trumpeted as critical turning points when they occurred, appears similarly open to question. For example, Britain’s post-imperial “east of Suez” retreat was initially triggered by India’s independence in 1947. By 1968, it was already long under way. In 1992, the Maastricht treaty creating the European Union was cheered, and condemned, as opening the door to a federal Europe – an aspiration unfulfilled more than a quarter of a century later. Tony Blair’s New Labour landslide in 1997 was hailed as a bright new dawn, but quickly clouded over. In the Middle East, the “historic” 2011 Arab spring pro-democracy revolts, source of much instantaneous hope and joy, proved to be a cruelly deceptive mirage – precursors of a new epoch of intensifying, region-wide conflict and repression, typified by Syria. The early rebel failure to topple Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s president, when combined with Donald Trump’s 2016 pledge to end US involvement in “endless” foreign wars” and age-old Turkish-Kurdish enmity, arguably predetermined events that led predictably, if not inevitably, to last week’s ultimate strategic crunch. Nor do the Syrian regime’s advances represent a sudden, unexpected twist. Assad has been steadily re-establishing control over the main populated areas in recent years. Neighbouring Arab leaders have been mending fences in the belief that Assad has won the war. European governments mostly share this view, though they do not say so publicly. The bigger claim – that the latest developments amount to a pivotal moment for expanding Russian influence in the Middle East – is also contentious. Since intervening in Syria in 2015, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has ably exploited ambivalent and confused US policies. While Trump has recklessly stoked confrontation with Iran, Putin has cautiously cultivated cordial working relationships with the main regional actors and adversaries, including Israel, Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt, based on shared interests in counter-terrorism, arms sales, and oil and gas production. In other words, Russia’s influence across the Middle East has been growing for some time. That is partly the result of US strategic incoherence, partly of Putin’s diplomatic acuity. Russia’s latest success in Syria follows this trend. While it’s significant, it probably does not amount, by itself, to a “watershed moment”. What the Syrian upheaval does do, however, is provide additional, confirmatory evidence that the global balance of power is slowly and incrementally shifting in ways that are not yet fully understood and with consequences not yet glimpsed. This process resembles not so much a sudden earthquake as a long-drawn-out series of tremors and shocks. And while it’s clear that the grip of the old, post-1945 US-dominated international order is weakening, it is unclear what will replace it – and who will come out on top. The main global contenders – the US, China, Russia and Europe and their respective allies, dependents and satraps – remain the same. But the relative ability, and desire, of each power bloc to shape and lead the 21st century by outmanoeuvring and outperforming rivals may be fundamentally changing. Whether last week was a watershed moment or not, it’s plain that the new world order is coming up for grabs. The US: defending champion on the ropes Although the US remains, by most measures, the world’s most influential and powerful country, the advent of Donald Trump has encouraged talk of an end to its global dominance. Yet if this is indeed happening, the change began not with Trump but as far back as the 1989-93 presidency of George HW Bush. By declaring victory in the cold war and promising a domestic peace dividend paid through reduced military spending, Bush helped nurture a delusional mindset that believed US global hegemony and the newly found status of the US as sole superpower were forever set in stone. The idea gained ground that America could, and should, do exactly as it pleased. Such complacent thinking was given superficial intellectual weight by Francis Fukuyama’s much-mangled thesis, The End of History?, first published as an essay in 1989. Part of its attraction lay in its connections to the original isolationist, unilateralist “America First” era that died a sudden death at Pearl Harbor in 1941. The illusion that the US could stand apart, and stand above, the world was shattered for a second time on 11 September 2001. But since then, unlike in the post-1945 period, US foreign policy and war-making have been essentially defensive, self-interested and reactive in nature. The proactive, exemplary global vision of democracy, prosperity and freedom, delivered to the world from a “shining city upon a hill”, as Ronald Reagan put it in 1989, has been obscured. With its perspectives and instincts fatally distorted by the “war on terror”, America has lost its sense of mission. Swingeing cuts to foreign aid budgets, hostility to the UN and multilateralism in general, and an ideologically driven, post-Iraq aversion to “nation-building”, symbolise this change. In this respect, Trump is but the crude, know-nothing legatee of a regressive process long in the making. Relative US economic decline arising from globalisation, deindustrialisation and increased competition for resources and markets have helped narrow US horizons. Trump’s dislike of costly “foreign entanglements” such as Syria oddly echoes the Founding Fathers and White House predecessors such as James Monroe. All the same, he is a modern aberration whose vow to “make America great again” is having the opposite effect. The US still leads, mostly, in key areas such as digital, cyber, AI, medical science, tech innovation and space exploration. Its wealth is unmatched. It recently became the top global producer of oil and gas. And it remains the foremost military power. It is said that Trumpism has permanently changed America’s outlook. That may be true but it’s a fair bet that his successors, whoever they are, will try to halt America’s retreat. Future presidents will not cede global leadership to others, as he has done, and may move aggressively to restore America’s reputation and leading role in the 21st century world. Europe: down for the count The European Union is good at values: it stands for individual human and civil rights, inclusive democratic governance, equality of opportunity and multilateralism – meaning a collective, collaborative approach to global problems such as the climate crisis and migration. Many of these values, promulgated by 18th-century Enlightenment thinkers, were enshrined in the US constitution, and bind the Old World to the New. Europe and the US appear natural partners. Yet the story of recent years is one of growing division and rivalry. There have been damaging splits and rows over issues such as the Iraq war, trade protectionism, the importance of international institutions such as the United Nations, the future of Nato, transnational justice, health and food standards, and environmental policy. The EU is divided from within, too, over the way the eurozone operates, budget fairness and French-led plans for a more integrated, federal Europe. There are also east-west and north-south splits, dramatised by the rise of hard-right populists in Italy and by Poland’s and Hungary’s governance disputes with Brussels. Recent polling suggests most people in most member countries support the EU, but there are wide divergences over what it is for and what it should do. Voters believe that Europe carries more clout in the world if it acts in unison. But that often proves difficult. Last week saw the EU split over a proposed arms embargo on Turkey. Meanwhile, Britain’s defection prospectively weakens its ability to influence events. EU enthusiasts argue that the bloc should do more to boost Europe’s standing as a key player on the world stage. But even if all its divisions were somehow magically healed, the idea that the EU may one day be in a position to challenge American or Chinese global leadership still seems far-fetched. Russia: punching above its weight Given the chaotic post-communist legacy bequeathed by Boris Yeltsin, Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, has made the best of a bad job. The former KGB spy once bemoaned the collapse of the Soviet empire as the “greatest geopolitical catastrophe” of the last century. In contrast, Russia in the 21st century punches above its weight. Yet Putin’s diplomatic, military and strategic successes, notably in the Middle East, cannot disguise fundamental domestic weaknesses: chronic underinvestment, overreliance on energy export revenues, poor infrastructure and social provision, endemic corruption, rising political discontent, and a pervasive, fearful sense of state lawlessness. Putin has largely defined his foreign policy in disruptive opposition to the US and the EU – by slavishly befriending China, courting Eurosceptic east Europeans, meddling in the Balkans, backing outlier regimes such as Iran, selling arms to anybody who asks, manipulating other people’s elections (and his own), and generally subverting democratic states. But as a plausible alternative to either the US or China in terms of global leadership, Russia is outmatched and outclassed. Putin lacks a positive, constructive vision for his own country, let alone the world – and, opposition leader Alexei Navalny apart, there is no sign yet of a Russian leader who has one. China: boxing clever Xi Jinping, China’s president, makes no secret of his ambition to restore the Middle Kingdom to its once unchallenged leadership position at the centre of international events. His oddly named Belt &amp; Road Initiative, involving infrastructure development and capital investment in more than 150 countries, is probably the most rapidly expansionist global strategy ever devised by a single state. In previous eras, Britain and other imperial powers used superior military might, physical control of territory, and divide-and-rule tactics to project their national interests around the globe. Xi’s empire-building is less adversarial, primarily economic and financial in nature. China calls it a win-win strategy. Critics call it ruthless debt diplomacy. Under Xi’s leadership, China has grown increasingly assertive and competitive in its relations with other powers, principally the US. Large Chinese companies such as Huawei, ultimately subject to state control, are successfully challenging equivalent American and European businesses in growth areas such as telecoms and nuclear power. China’s military capabilities are growing rapidly, too, notably its “blue water” naval surface and submarine fleet whose evident aim is to challenge American control in the western Pacific. This looks certain to increase tensions with western powers around flashpoints such as Taiwan and disputed areas of the South China Sea. Xi’s China also offers the world an alternative governance model – an authoritarian, paternalistic system, reinforced by mass surveillance, that ostensibly guarantees the wellbeing and safety of citizens in return for their political acquiescence and public silence. This model is plainly not working in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. As China’s middle class grows, it may not work much longer in mainland cities, either. China’s dramatic economic growth has slowed. While this may be temporary, the Communist party’s lack of democratic legitimacy and the absence of consent pose the biggest long-term threat to China’s 21st-century global ambitions. If Xi can overcome that obstacle, there may be no stopping him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/sep/16/marine-life-nuclear-power-and-clever-crows-green-news-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-16T16:04:13Z","webTitle":"Marine life, nuclear power and clever crows – green news roundup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/16/marine-life-nuclear-power-and-clever-crows-green-news-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/sep/16/marine-life-nuclear-power-and-clever-crows-green-news-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Marine life, nuclear power and clever crows – green news roundup","bodyText":"Environment news New inhaler protects lungs against effects of air pollution Arctic sea ice shrinks to second lowest level ever recorded Humanity driving ‘unprecedented’ marine extinction UK to ban fishing from a million square kilometres of ocean Spain could be first EU country with national park listed as ‘in danger’ One in 10 UK wildlife species faces extinction, major report shows Military experts say climate change poses ‘significant risk’ to security August ties with July as hottest month on record UK must move now on carbon capture to save consumers billions, says report Obama to establish first marine national monument in the Atlantic Ocean Features and comment Nuclear power is risky and expensive; here’s a better idea Undercover bike cops launch ‘best ever’ cycle safety scheme in Birmingham Animal-free dairy products move a step closer to market The man who thinks trees talk to each other Endangered Hawaiian crows join elite list of animals known to use tools Multimedia Lives in the balance: climate change and the Marshall Islands The week in wildlife – in pictures And finally...

In a political embarrassment for the government, the verdict found that the UK had not complied with the Aarhus convention, an international agreement on involving citizens in environmental matters. The Aarhus committee’s finding followed a complaint by a German Green party politician, who said the UK should now halt work on the project to properly consult with the public in neighbouring countries. Sylvia Kotting-Uhl told the Guardian: “If the government does not want to ridicule the trans-boundary participation procedure that is now due, construction works should be suspended until the procedure is completed.” While the ruling is very unlikely to affect the project, which began construction last year, the breach comes on top of a fortnight of bad news for the two atomic reactors. EDF, the French state-owned developer of Hinkley Point C, admitted this week that costs were likely to rise by £1.5bn and there was a risk of a 15-month delay, just days after the public spending watchdog called the project “risky and expensive”. Kotting-Uhl originally complained to Aarhus’s compliance committee in the summer of 2013, before the UK had agreed commercial terms with EDF. She said the UK government had discriminated against Germans by not giving them opportunities to take part in the environmental impact assessment procedure for Hinkley, as the Aarhus convention requires. The committee agreed. In conclusions published recently, the committee said: “By not ensuring that the public concerned in Germany had a reasonable chance to learn about the proposed activity and the opportunities for the public to participate in the respective decision-making, the party concerned failed to comply with article 6, paragraph 2, of the convention.” Named after the Danish city of Århus, the convention covers the involvement of the public on environmental matters relating to developments such as power stations or new roads – including access to information, the public’s participation in decision-making, and access to justice. The UK ratified the agreement in 2005. The former UN secretary general Kofi Annan called it “the most ambitious venture in the area of environmental democracy so far undertaken under the auspices of the United Nations”. The Aarhus committee said that ministers should put in place a legal framework to ensure that the failure to inform the public about Hinkley’s potential risks is not repeated. In the case of nuclear power stations, it said: “Public authorities are required to consider the magnitude of the effects if an accident would indeed occur, even if the risk of an accident is very small.” The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “The government has cooperated fully with the Aarhus compliance committee investigation and there was extensive public consultation on proposals for Hinkley Point C before development consent was granted.” The spokeswoman added that the government was confident Hinkley would have “no significant adverse effect on the environment of any other country”. The issue of notification around Hinkley is due to be discussed at a meeting in September of the 46 countries signed up to the convention. EDF said: “We have carried out all the environmental impact assessments (EIA) required for Hinkley Point C, including assessing any likely significant transboundary impacts. In considering the EIA the UK Planning Inspectorate concluded there was no likelihood of significant transboundary effects.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/jun/26/iran-nuclear-deal-must-be-allowed-to-thrive","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-26T18:22:43Z","webTitle":"Iran nuclear deal must be allowed to thrive | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/26/iran-nuclear-deal-must-be-allowed-to-thrive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/jun/26/iran-nuclear-deal-must-be-allowed-to-thrive","fields":{"headline":"Iran nuclear deal must be allowed to thrive","bodyText":"The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal) is excellent; it is far better and more extensive than I ever expected (Don’t upset the balance of power in the Middle East, 23 June).

In 1807, in the midst of a struggle with Napoleonic France, HMS Leopard, a Royal Navy ship of the line, attacked, boarded and captured an American frigate, USS Chesapeake, off Norfolk, Virginia. The British claimed their action was justified by the presence on the American ship of four English deserters, whom they arrested. But, for President Thomas Jefferson, it was an outrageous, illegal infringement of the sovereignty and independence of the infant republic, eventually leading to the 1812 war. It’s fair to say the Americans never forgot lessons drawn from the Chesapeake humiliation – and have been faithfully following Britain’s script ever since. As its power grew, the US, too, assumed the right to extend its national writ beyond its shores. One modern example is the way the US justice department ruthlessly pursues foreign nationals, such as the Scottish hacker Gary McKinnon, who are deemed to have broken US law. McKinnon’s extradition was ultimately blocked in 2012 by Britain’s then home secretary, Theresa May, after a public outcry. Donald Trump’s threat to impose sweeping penalties on any country or individual, anywhere in the world, that dares to ignore his unilateral embargo on Iran’s oil exports is another instance of extra-territorial over-reach. Like an Oriental pasha of old, Trump has graciously deigned to issue exemptions to supplicants who beg for relief. But the overall principle is clear: in its view, the US has the right to direct and control the actions of sovereign states using threats, sanctions and almost any other means at its disposal. Even liberal-minded Americans see no particular problem with such overweening, imperial power-plays – for who, some argue, can doubt that the US, as the pre-eminent guardian of enlightened values, acts for the best? Yet American power is no longer as all-pervasive, or trusted, as perhaps it was 30 years ago. Many contemporary states, allies included, do harbour serious doubts about US motives and intentions. Foremost among them is China – a rival, not a friend – whose furious reaction last week to the arrest in Canada, on a US warrant, of the top Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, showed how Washington’s presumptuous attempts to exercise universal jurisdiction have become outdated, objectionable – and increasingly unenforceable. Meng is ostensibly wanted for breaching Iran sanctions. But the wider context is more instructive than the specific, alleged offence. Huawei is the world’s largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones, with revenue of about $92bn last year. Western spy chiefs believe its market dominance, and close association with China’s communist regime, pose a security risk. The US, Australia, New Zealand and Japan have all recently restricted use of Huawei technology. In Britain, Huawei has pledged to spend $2bn to fix security loopholes that the National Cyber Security Centre, an offshoot of the GCHQ spy agency, fears could be exploited for surveillance and data-collection. The promise followed a reportedly bad-tempered meeting last month with British officials. Huawei insists that neither Meng, nor the company, have broken the law or pose any kind of security risk. The row will intensify existing worries about Chinese state-approved investment in Britain’s next generation of nuclear power stations. Meanwhile, in a public speech, Alex Younger, the head of MI6, said Britain must decide whether it was “comfortable” with using Chinese technology in critical national infrastructure. Last week, BT gave its answer, confirming it was removing Huawei equipment from its 4G network. More broadly still, the backdrop of intensifying US-China strategic, geopolitical and economic rivalry is also germane to Meng’s arrest, as is both countries’ blatant disregard for international law. The US warrant has embarrassed Canada, partly due to suspicions that it is a politically motivated abuse of the extradition system. Although it will not admit it, China’s action last week in detaining two Canadian citizens was direct retribution, intended to pressure Ottawa into releasing Meng. There can be little doubt Meng is a highly symbolic victim of this global rivalry. Typically clueless, Trump gave the game away when he explicitly linked the possible dropping of the case against her to resolving the US-China trade war. Trump’s clumsy intervention – rapidly disavowed by his own justice department – left the US looking no better than Beijing. Both sides appear guilty of what amounts, in effect, to hostage-taking – not what the world expects from superpowers. But perhaps it’s no surprise. After all, it is learned behaviour, courtesy of the Royal Navy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2021/may/06/bank-of-england-uk-recovery-ftse-pound-services-eurozone-us-jobs-stock-markets-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-06T17:40:40Z","webTitle":"Bank of England raises growth forecasts; FTSE 100 hits 14-month high – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2021/may/06/bank-of-england-uk-recovery-ftse-pound-services-eurozone-us-jobs-stock-markets-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2021/may/06/bank-of-england-uk-recovery-ftse-pound-services-eurozone-us-jobs-stock-markets-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Bank of England raises growth forecasts; FTSE 100 hits 14-month high – as it happened","bodyText":"And finally... here’s Richard Partington’s updated news story on the Bank of England’s forecasts: UK set for strongest economic growth since WWII, forecasts Bank of England Britain is on track for the strongest growth since the second world war this year as it stages a faster-than-expected recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the Bank of England. The Bank raised its estimate for UK GDP growth to 7.25% in 2021, up from a previous forecast in February for growth of 5% this year, as rapid progress with the Covid-19 vaccine and easing of restrictions paves the way for a boom in pent-up demand. The growth rate would be the fastest since an 8.7% expansion in 1941, when production was being pushed to the limit during the second world war. However, it follows a collapse of almost 10% in 2020, the worst decline for more than three centuries. Setting out upbeat forecasts for growth and jobs as the economy reopens, the central bank’s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at record-low level of 0.1%. Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s governor, said there was “very strong, good news” from the economy as lockdown measures are relaxed. However, he warned two years of GDP growth had been lost to the global health emergency, and said there were still risks on the horizon – including high rates of coronavirus in India and some other countries. “Let’s not get carried away. It takes us back by the end of this year to the level of output we had essentially at the end of 2019 pre-Covid. So that is good news in the context of where we’ve been, but it still means that two years of output growth have been lost to date,” he said. “So I would give this a balanced message: there is good news, clearly very good news given what we’ve been through. But let’s put it into perspective.” Reflecting the pace of the recovery, the Bank said it expected the UK economy to recover to its pre-pandemic level by late 2021 and that unemployment would hit a much lower peak than previously forecast. Supported by the extension of furlough until the end of September, Threadneedle Street said it estimated the jobless rate would peak at just under 5.5% in the autumn.... Here’s the full story: And here’s an emoji-filled summary :) Goodnight. GW Here’s a curious thing... Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway stock price is so high, the Nasdaq can’t cope. Berkshire Hathaway’s Class A stock has hit a fresh record high today, trading at a stratospheric $432,400 each. That, rather fabulously, is more than certain market operators such as Nasdaq can handle. That’s because they use a computer format using 32 bits (binary, so either 1 or 0). The WSJ explains: The biggest number possible is two to the 32nd power minus one, or 4,294,967,295. Stock prices are frequently stored using four decimal places, so the highest possible price is $429,496.7295. The best thing about this story is that Buffett has always refused to allow the A shares to split - which is what normally happens when a stock’s value climbs to levels that put it outside a small investor’s pocket. The logic, as Investopedia explains here, is that the Sage of Omaha wanted to attract long-term investors, rather than speculators who would pile in and out of a ‘cheaper’ share (although they can still trade B class shares, at a more affordable $286 today). But this isn’t actually stopping the A shares trading in New York - as you can see on CNBC here. They’re also trading on my Reuters terminal: The London stock market were lifted by relief that the Bank of England wasn’t rushing to tighten policy, despite the improving economy. So says Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell: “You could almost hear the exhale as the Bank of England announced it was making no changes to its current policies despite a brightening economic picture. The relief turned into exuberance and a late flurry catapulted the FTSE 100 to a 14-month high. Anticipation is so thick it’s almost palpable, but sometimes gratification is delayed. Take the UK’s travel sector which had to cool its jets for another day before it gets long awaited clarity on government plans for summer holidays. “Over on Wall Street vaccine makers pulled down the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 reacting to President Biden’s stance on intellectual property waivers; only London based AstraZeneca seemed to escape unscathed. Even Moderna stocks slumped despite the company reporting its first ever profitable quarter and raising its vaccine sales forecast. Recovery comes with hidden costs but making sure that recovery is truly global has in this case outweighed other considerations. And the slump was short-lived, chased off by another fall in US jobless claims which propelled the Dow to a record of its own.” Pharmaceuticals firms are not joining today’s rally. Pfizer, Moderna and BionTech have all dropped today, after the US government threw its weight behind global plans for a patent waiver on Covid-19 vaccines - to help get more produced quickly. Here’s the details: Our economics editor Larry Elliott has dipped into the history books, to put today’s growth forecasts into context: If the Bank of England is right, Britain is on course for its strongest annual growth since 1941 – the year of Pearl Harbor and Hitler’s invasion of Russia, our economics editor The latest forecasts from Threadneedle Street are stronger in every respect than those it came up with three months ago: the hit to growth during the first-quarter lockdown has been less severe, the bounce back will be more rapid, and the peak in unemployment will be significantly lower. This represents a classic V-shaped recession – a deep plunge in output followed by a fast recovery. It took half a decade for national output to regain its pre-crisis peak after the financial crash of 2008, but this time it will do so in less than two years. That, as the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, pointed out is “very good news” because it means fewer people lose their jobs and fewer businesses go bust... But that doesn’t mean the UK is in the sunlit uplands, as Larry explains here: America’s Dow Jones industrial average has also rallied, hitting a new record high. The Dow traded as high as 34,435 points, and is currently up 0.5% or 163 points at 34,394 points. The fall in jobless claims may have boosted hopes of a recovery, as traders set aside their worries that the recovery could drive up inflation and force interest rates to rise sooner than expected. Britain’s blue-chip FTSE 100 index has just closed at a fresh 14-month high, as economic recovery hopes build. The Footsie ended the day 37 points higher at 7076 points, up 0.5% today. That’s its highest close since the last week of February 2020, during the early stages of the market crash caused by the first wave of Covid-19. It means the FTSE 100 has gained over 9% so far this year (although it’s still below its record high above 7,903 points set back in May 2018). Nearly every sector rose today, led by utilities, consumer non-cyclicals, real estate firms, energy and miners. The weaker pound will have given multinationals a small lift, as it makes their overseas earnings more valuable in sterling terms. Silver miner Fresnillo (+6.2%) topped the risers, followed by tobacco firms BAT (+3.2%) and Imperial (+3%). Other risers included commercial property firm Land Securities (+2.3%), financial services company Legal &amp; General (+2.7%), and luxury fashion maker Burberry (+2.1%). The smaller, more UK-focused FTSE 250 index also rallied, gaining 0.5%. It was partly lifted by the possible takeover of John Laing; its shares surged 19.5% by the close to the highest since January 2020. However, technology shares have remained under pressure, with online grocer Ocado falling 3% and electricals e-commerce firm AO World down 3.3%. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: After a solid rebound yesterday, European stocks have been slightly more subdued today, and somewhat mixed, with tech shares acting as the main drag, although any weakness has been much more modest than was the case on Tuesday. The FTSE100 is looking a little more solid, hitting a new 14-month high, while the FTSE250 is also looking good, helped by the more defensive elements of the index, and a slightly weaker pound. The Bank of England’s more upbeat forecasts clearly haven’t worried City investors today -- as Sandra Holdsworth, Head of Rates UK at Aegon Asset Management, explains: It was a much more upbeat report than in previous meetings. GDP was upgraded and one of the members, Andy Haldane voted for curtailing asset purchases by August of this year reducing the target for gilt purchases by £ 50bn. However policy was maintained at current levels . Bank rate remains at 0.1% and the asset purchase programme was also maintained at £895bn . The weekly pace of gilts to be purchased was reduced to £3.4bn per week although the Bank of England was at pains to stress that this is purely operational rather than a change in policy . “As well as revising up economic growth forecasts , the Bank of England also revised up the ability of the economy to add new capacity thus meaning that the higher GDP forecasts didn’t lead to higher inflation rates . Inflation is expected to rise in the short term because of base effects but return to target levels over the forecast period. With this benign outlook for inflation the Bank appeared to be in no hurry to start thinking about higher interest rates.” America’s economy is also strengthening, as Covid-19 vaccinations allow firms to reopen. The number of people filing new jobless claims dropped to a fresh pandemic low last week, at 498,000. That’s the lowest since the first wave of Covid-19 hit the US economy in March 2020. Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, says it shows the US labor market is improving -- and could herald a strong American jobs report on Friday. “The great gains in jobs continued, with weekly state claims falling below 500,000 for the first time since the economy crashed a year ago. More good employment news is expected tomorrow, when the April jobs report should show about 1 million jobs added last month. While forecasts put a return to pre-pandemic employment two years off, job gains are cutting financial stress and poverty by leaps and bounds now, and this strong trend should continue at least through the summer.” Back in the markets, news of a possible takeover offer for infrastructure investor John Laing have sent its shares soaring 17%. John Laing develops greenfield infrastructure projects - typically in Public Private Partnerships. That includes building courts, hospitals, high-speed trains, roads, bridges, and renewable energy systems such as biomass plants, onshore wind farms and solar PV. John Laing told the City that it was in talks with private equity firm KKR, although there’s no certainty of an offer. KKR has until 5pm on 3rd June to make a bid, or walk away. Share in John Laing, which had been rising already today, promptly jumped sharply higher. They’re trading at 371p now in late trading (a level not seen since late May 2020). John Laing was founded in 1848 as a building company in Carlisle. It listed on the stock exchange in 1953, but was taken private in 2006, only to float again nine years later. As we wrote back in 2015: After working on projects such as the M1 motorway and the Sizewell B nuclear power station, it increasingly focused on infrastructure work and in 2001 decided to concentrate solely on such projects. Back in the markets, the pound has slipped lower despite the Bank’s upgraded growth forecasts, and its decision to slow the speed (but not the size) of its bond-buying programme. Sterling is now down 0.3% against the US dollar at $1.387. Against the euro, it’s down 0.65% at €1.151. It was a volatile session - after a sudden jolt at noon, the pound then hit a one-week high against the dollar, before subsiding as traders digested the report. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says it was a ‘whipsaw’ move., adding: Looks as though the slowing of bond purchases to a weekly rate of £3.4bn from £4.4bn amounts to a taper, but it appears to be not much more than the kind of technical taper that had already been flagged in February. Although the Bank insists this is an ‘operational decision’, it does show some confidence in the economic recovery, Wilson adds - otherwise the Bank could have kept buying £4.4bn of bonds each week, and pledged to do more QE if needed. The press conference ended with Andrew Bailey warning that crypto assets are risky and have ‘no intrinsic value’. Q: Some people say that bubbles are forming in financial markets, with people ploughing money into all sorts of crazy things. What does cryptocurrencies say about the state of financial markets? Have you any concerns about the impact of ultraloose policies on markets? Governor Andrew Bailey says the Bank watches the markets very carefully. There have been a number of developments in the last few months. On their own, they’re not a financial stability risk, but the Bank’s Financial Policy Committee will look very carefully at the overall picture as it draws up the next Financial Stability Report, Bailey explains. And on crypto - he insists that they are assets, not currencies. Bailey repeats a point he’s made a few times in recent years -- only buy them if you’re prepared to lose all your money. As Bailey puts it: I’m afraid they have no intrinsic value. Now, that doesn’t mean to say people don’t put value on them, because they can have extrinsic value. But they have no intrinsic value. I’m going to say this very bluntly again. Buy them, only if you’re prepared to lose all your money. Q: Which sectors are going to benefit from this recovery? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent predicts that sectors who saw the weakest growth in lockdown should see the strongest growth coming out. (He doesn’t specify which, but clearly it would include hospitality and leisure). Q: Why has the Bank of England doubled its estimate for how much of their excess savings households will spend, from 5% to 10%? Andrew Bailey says the Bank has benefitted from recent survey data since its last forecasts in February, which suggests that 5% was an underestimate. This is a very unusual situation, the governor explains. There has been very big build up in unanticipated savings under the lockdown. But it isn’t evenly distributed - it’s concentrated among those whose incomes have been supported, and those who have had “much reduced” chances to spend. As Bailey puts it: It is concentrated in the better off and the elderly, particularly. Bailey adds that the Bank was cautious about its forecasts about how these rising savings would affect the “marginal propensity” to spend [this is typically lower for people on higher incomes, research shows] Q: Do your forecasts include the possibility of another rise in Covid-19 cases? Governor Bailey says the Bank is ‘enormously grateful’ to Chris Whitty, the UK Chief Medical Officer, who has met with the MPC for an hour before each forecast round, to answer their questions on the pandemic. Whitty has cautioned us that yes, there is a risk of a new strain of Covid emerging, Bailey says, and that’s factored into the Bank’s forecasts. In terms of timing, Bailey wouldn’t put too much emphasis on the possibility of a summer surge, saying forecasts of a summer pickup have a very large confidence band (meaning there’s a lot of uncertainty about the projection). There’s also an argument that Covid has a seasonal pattern, he continues (so any new strain might be more likely to come in the winter). So that’s one reason the Bank’s current forecasts have a relatively large short-term downside risk, Bailey concludes, because there is the possibility that the UK could get a variant, so the question would then be how much protection existing vaccines give. Extending the furlough scheme until September, rather than ending it in April, will have a big impact on unemployment this year, the BoE explains. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says that the furlough scheme effectively removes the supply of labour, as the pandemic removes demand. So now, more people should go back into work as lockdown ends, which is why the Bank thinks unemployment will peak below 5.5%, not around 7.75%. “Essentially what’s happened in this forecast relative to February is that more of the people who were on furlough and who might have been eventually employed but only after a period of unemployment, more of those people were able to go directly back into employment. And that’s why you get such a big difference in the unemployment profile.” Another historical question.... Q: It looks like this recession will be much less severe with much less scarring than the one after the 2008 financial crisis. Why? Andrew Bailey says research shows that recessions linked to financial crises tend to be more severe and have a longer-lasting impact. We have not had a financial crisis this time - the reforms introduced after the last crisis have stood the test, Bailey replies. There was a lot of debate last summer about the prospect of a V-shaped recovery -- and some criticism that the Bank was too optimistic, Bailey says. But today, the ‘basic mechanics’ of that shape of recovery remain reasonably strong, partly on the back of a “hugely successful vaccination programme”, Bailey adds -- although a year ago, the return of Covid (causing the current lockdown) wasn’t expected. Q: Are their any historical comparisons for this year’s bounceback, such as the roaring 20s? Andrew Bailey says the UK hasn’t seen a bounceback quite of this nature in modern times. The strong growth recorded in 1941 was heavily influenced by wartime conditions, he points out, explaining: I don’t think we’ve had a bounce back quite of this nature, certainly in modern times. We possibly saw some of those effects during the Industrial Revolution, Bailey continues (he did his PhD on this period). There were one or two quite strong numbers in the 1870s. But the important point is that this is a bounceback from 2020, Bailey adds. In a way, thank goodness. Let’s remember, this time last year when we were having this session, we were talking about the largest fall in GDP possibly since the early part of the 18th Century...1709. [1709 was the year of the Great Frost] Q: Your forecasts predict there will be excess demand by the end of 2021. People will worry about this causing inflation, but you say it is temporary. How will you judge if you’re right? Governor Bailey explains that there are a lot of uncertainties, beyond the pandemic itself. There are very big questions about the path of supply and demand, and the structure of the economy, depending how many of the changes in spending and working patterns remain, and which do not. So the Bank will watch it very carefully. Q: Is the 7.25% growth expected this year simply a natural arithmetic rebound from last year’s 10% slump, or is it more of a self-sustaining, stable recovery? Governor Andrew Bailey says it’s important to put today’s forecast of a faster recovery into proper context. Given the UK had such a large fall in output last year, it is good news that we’re getting a recovery this year, he explains. There is very strong and good news in the state of the economy at the moment, as represented in the forecast in the report. However, “let’s not get carried away”, he adds. It takes the UK back, by the end of this year, to the level of output at the end of 2019, pre-Covid. That is good news in the context of where we’ve been. But another way of expressing that is that two years of output growth have been lost to date. On Brexit, Bailey says that the early evidence is that many firms are adjusting to the new trade arrangements between the UK and the EU. “It remains too early to judge whether the effects, both in terms of the short-term disruption and the longer-term effects on supply growth are in line with the assumptions underlying the MPC’s forecasts. “The MPC has retained its assumption that trade and activity will be lower in the first half of this year as firms adjust to the introduction of new trading arrangements. These additional effects on trade are assumed to dissipate by the end of this quarter.” Governor Bailey also confirms that the Bank is slowing the pace of its QE bond-buying scheme, but the overall size of the package remains unchanged (at £895bn). Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is holding a press conference now to explain today’s Monetary Policy Report. He explains the impact of the latest restrictions have been smaller than anticipated this year, which is why the Bank expects a smaller contraction in Q1 (around 1.5%), and a recovery to pre-crisis levels by the end of the year. These projections are conditioned on Covid restrictions in the UK being eased in the near term, with most lifted by the end of Q2. Demand will also be supported by households running down around 10% of the savings built up in the lockdown -- higher than expected three months ago. Bailey warns that there are risks to its forecasts - including the possibility of renewed waves of infections in the UK and other countries. On balance, the MPC judges the risks to its GDP forecast are skewed to the downside in the first year of the forecast, but ‘broadly balanced’ further out. Bailey also explains that extending the furlough scheme will limit the rise in unemployment this year, with most workers on furlough expected to return to work later this year as the scheme ends (as flagged earlier). The Bank’s upgraded growth forecasts reflect how the economic outlook has improved since February, say experts. Charles Hepworth, investment director at GAM Investments, says it’s a ‘big upgrade’ On the back of recent central bank action across the world, the Bank of England followed the narrative of holding interest rates at record lows of 0.1% and continuation of its asset purchase plan at £875bn. There was one dissenter in the ranks with Andy Haldene voting for a tapering of the purchases by £50bn. He does leave the committee after the next meeting so it may be a last sole voice but it could hint to a shifting view that could potentially be building within the committee that the recovery we are now firmly in warrants perhaps less stimulation. They raised the UK growth forecast for this year to 7.25% vs 5% previously, so a big upgrade and reflective of the bounce in real recent data and this means the economy returns to pre-pandemic levels over this year. They still view inflation as only being transiently higher, a now common central bank mantra, but either way the growth outlook following the rapid vaccination roll-out is flying to the upside and this can only build in inflationary pressures over the longer term. Silvia Dall’Angelo, senior economist at the International Business of Federated Hermes, says the latest stimulus measures are supporting growth: “Updated forecasts included a range of upward revisions concerning economic activity and the labour market, which reflected positive developments since the February forecasting round. Most notably, domestically, the March Budget provided fresh fiscal stimulus, while the vaccine rollout has made further significant progress. Accordingly, the Bank of England now expects UK GDP to go back to its pre-crisis level by the end of this year, a quarter earlier compared to its February forecasts. In addition, following the extension of the furlough scheme, the unemployment rate is expected to peak lower at 5.4% in Q3 of this year, rather than close to 8% as per February’s forecasts. Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicts that interest rates will still remain low for some time, though: “Markets were eagerly awaiting to see if the Bank of England would lean further towards the hawkish end of the central bank spectrum, and those who expected this to be revealed today were not disappointed. The Bank’s decision to slow the pace of purchases was inevitable at some point and doing so now means there will be less of cliff edge later in the year. The upgrades to the growth outlook were also widely expected considering the recent Budget, but the message is still one of caution. The Bank said that clear evidence that progress is being made will be needed before they consider their next policy move. In our view, this points to the Bank keeping base rates unchanged for some time yet. This low interest rate environment will support equity markets as the UK and global economy continues to recover. Britain is on track for the strongest growth since the second world war this year as it stages a faster than expected recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the Bank of England. The Bank raised its estimate for UK GDP growth to 7.25% in 2021, up from a previous forecast in February for growth of 5% this year, as rapid progress with the Covid-19 vaccine rollout and easing of restrictions fuels a boom in pent-up demand. Reflecting the pace of the recovery, the Bank said it expected GDP to return to pre-pandemic levels over the course of this year. Threadneedle Street’s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) also voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at record-low level of 0.1%. The central bank said it would slow its bond-buying to £3.4bn a week between May and August, down from its current pace of £4.4bn. The MPC said: “The expected completion point of the purchase programme remained unchanged. This operational decision should not be interpreted as a change in the stance of monetary policy.” The Bank of England is predicting that the UK will see the strongest growth since the second world war this year, with a 7.25% increase in GDP. That follows the worst downturn in centuries, with GDP falling 9.8% in 2020. It’s a relatively bullish forecast, too. Last month, a round-up of City forecasts from the Treasury showed an average forecast for UK growth in 2021 of 5.7%, while the EY Item Club predicted 6.8% growth. The Bank of England has also cut its unemployment forecast, following the government’s extension of the furlough scheme in March’s budget. It now expects the unemployment rate will peak at just below 5.5% in the third quarter of this year, down from around 7.75% it expected back in February. This downward revision “largely reflects” the extension of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme in the Budget, the Bank says. The furlough scheme, alongside a projected recovery in activity and demand for labour, is expected to support employment. Job vacancies – an indicator of labour demand – had already begun to pick up during Q1. However, unemployment is nevertheless expected to rise as more people start to search for jobs as social distancing measures ease, and so some of the fall in labour market participation unwinds. This fan chart shows the latest forecasts for unemployment and inflation (darker areas are more likely). On inflation, the Bank of England predicts the consumer prices index will rise temporarily above its 2% target towards the end of 2021, largely driven by energy prices and rising raw material costs. It then sees inflation returning to around 2% in the medium term. Today’s Monetary Policy Report forecasts that: As previous falls in fuel and utility prices drop out of the annual calculation, and more recent rises in energy prices feed through to household bills, inflation rises. There is also some upward near‑term price pressure from recent increases in other input costs, for example higher freight and raw material prices. Inflation is projected to peak in 2021 Q4 at around 2½%. The Bank of England has lifted its growth forecasts for the UK, saying the economy looks stronger than expected back in February. In 2021, annual average GDP growth is projected to be around 7¼%, compared with around 5% in the February Report. It now predicts the economy shrank by less than expected in the first three month of this year, during the lockdown, followed by a sharp recovery in April-June. And it also predicts the economy will recover to pre- Covid levels in the fourth quarter of 2021, as pandemic restrictions are lifted. Its new forecasts predict that UK GDP “recovers materially as Covid-related restrictions are eased”. Overall, GDP is projected to rise materially over 2021, and to exceed its 2019 Q4 level in 2021 Q4. Here’s the details: UK GDP is expected to have fallen by around 1½% in 2021 Q1, less weak than was assumed in the February Report. New Covid cases in the United Kingdom have continued to fall, the vaccination programme is proceeding apace, and restrictions on economic activity are easing. Reflecting these developments, GDP is expected to rise sharply in 2021 Q2, although activity in that quarter is likely to remain on average around 5% below its level in 2019 Q4. GDP is expected to recover strongly to pre-Covid levels over the remainder of this year in the absence of most restrictions on domestic economic activity. Demand growth is further boosted by a decline in health risks and a fall in uncertainty, as well as announced fiscal and monetary stimulus. Consumer spending is also supported by households running down over the next three years around 10% of their additional accumulated savings. After 2021, the pace of GDP growth is expected to slow as the boost from some of those factors wanes. The level of activity is higher in each quarter of the forecast than in the February projections. The Bank’s Monetary Policy committee has also voted 8-1 to keep its asset purchase programme at £895bn, including buying up to £875bn of government bonds. But chief economist Andy Haldane (who is leaving to become chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts thinktank) wanted to lower the size of the programme. The Bank says: One member (Andrew Haldane) voted against this proposition, preferring to continue with the existing programme of UK government bond purchases but to reduce the target for the stock of these purchases from £875 billion to £825 billion. But the Bank is slowing the pace of its bond-buying, as some economists had predicted might happen. It says: As envisaged since the announcement of the programme in November 2020 and consistent with developments in financial markets since then, the pace of these continuing purchases could now be slowed somewhat. The expected completion point of the purchase programme remained unchanged. This operational decision should not be interpreted as a change in the stance of monetary policy. The Bank of England has voted unanimously to leave UK interest rates unchanged at their current record low of 0.1%..... The pound is currently flat against the US dollar at $1.39, as we await the Bank of England’s interest rate decision. Against the euro, it’s down around 0.3% at €1.154. Sophie Griffiths, Market Analyst at OANDA, says tensions off the coast of Jersey could keep sterling in check. The pound has barely moved despite impressive service-sector activity data. While on the one hand, the BoE could support further gains for sterling as the economic outlook improves. On the other, escalating Brexit tensions between France and the UK and the arrival of Navy patrol ships in Jersey could keep the lid on any BoE-inspired gains. No change in policy is expected from Andrew Bailey &amp; Co. However, an upward revision to the quarterly inflation report could be on the cards... Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, makes some interesting points on the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Report (due in just over 30 minutes). Mining giant Rio Tinto has just been given a bruising bloody nose by investors over the lucrative exit package handed to former CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques. Jacques quit last year after the huge outcry over Rio’s destruction of the sacred 46,000-year-old rock shelter at Juukan Gorge to expand an iron ore mine. And today, more than 60% of Rio shareholders have opposed last year’s Directors remuneration report, a major revolt by City standards, unhappy that the company hadn’t clawed back more of Jacques’ pay. Jacques did lose bonuses worth around £2.7m after the Juukan Gorge destruction. But Institutional Shareholder Services, the influential proxy adviser, called for a deeper clawback, estimating that he still holds performance shares worth £27m. Clearly many investors agreed with ISS that Rio should have used its powers to reduce the number of “performance shares” held by Jacques under a long-term incentive plan. Here are the details. Back in the eurozone, retail sales jumped 2.7% in March, in another sign that its pandemic downturn is easing. ING’s Bert Colijn says retail spending should keep rising as lockdowns are eased, helping economies recover. This marks the second monthly increase in a row, indicating that January marked the second wave bottom in terms of retail sales. The recovery therefore already started over the course of the first quarter and we expect it to continue from here. Among the larger countries, Germany and Netherlands showed the strongest improvements at 7.7 and 8.4% respectively, while France lagged with a -1% decline. This shows how important restrictions continue to be for the retail sector, dominating the growth profile. Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, predicts growth will accelerate in the coming months, following April’s jump: “Service sector companies were creating jobs at a level last seen since in October 2015 and paying more in wages to get the best talent; a sign of ever-increasing confidence about the year ahead. This chipper atmosphere was built on a solid foundation of the biggest rise in activity since October 2013 as firms enjoyed a deluge of new work following lockdown easing and improved economic conditions. Brock warns, though, that stretched supply chains and rising inflation could weigh on growth. Economist Julian Jessop says the recovery is gathering pace: EY Club’s Howard Archer says the economy made a ‘robust’ start to the April-June quarter. The jump in service sector activity last month helped to push total private sector growth to its highest in over seven years: Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, says “a surge of pent up demand has started to flow through the UK economy” as pandemic restrictions lift. The roadmap for reopening leisure, hospitality and other customer-facing activities resulted in a sharp increase in forward bookings and new project starts across the service sector. If the rebound in order books continues along its recent trajectory during the rest of the second quarter, then service sector output growth looks very likely to surpass the survey-record high seen back in April 1997. The vaccination programme is boosting business confidence, he adds, meaning some firms can’t find enough workers: “The successful vaccine roll out continued to underpin expectations of a strong recovery in the year ahead, with service providers responding by boosting employment and investment spending during April. Job creation was the strongest for five-and-a-half years and, for the first time since the start of the pandemic, there were reports citing staff shortages as a factor holding back growth UK services firms are also facing higher costs, including transport bills, with some saying they’re paying higher wages due to staff shortages. The Services PMI report says inflationary pressures remained high last month: Input prices rose at the strongest pace for just over four years. The wide range of factors cited as pushing up operating costs included transport surcharges, staff wages, and the pass through of higher imported raw material costs by suppliers. Efforts to mitigate rising input prices resulted in a robust increase in average charges among service providers during April. However, the rate of prices charged inflation moderated very slightly from the 40-month high seen in March. Britain’s services sector has posted its fastest growth in more than seven years, highlighting how the economy is recovering from the pandemic. The latest Service PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, has jumped to 61.0 for April, its highest reading since October 2013 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Companies say they saw a sharp increase in business and consumer spending last month. New projects and forward booking jumped, with new orders rising at their fastest rate since December 2013. IHS Markit, which compiles the report, says services companies reported a jump in demand as pandemic restrictions were eased, and optimism about the economic outlook rose. Service providers noted that the roadmap for easing COVID-19 restrictions across the UK had been a key factor helping to boost activity. There was a direct boost to output from the reopening of some customer-facing parts of the economy in April, as well as a positive impact on the rest of the service sector due to improving business and consumer confidence. Firms also took on more staff to handle this surge in orders - with employment growth accelerating to its fastest since October 2015. Markit adds: Stronger demand encouraged a faster pace of job creation across the service sector in April. The latest survey pointed to the sharpest increase in employment for five-and-a-half years. Despite efforts to rebuild business capacity, backlogs of work rose at the steepest rate since March 2015. Survey respondents often noted that a combination of better-than-expected demand and subsequent staff shortages was the main reason for an accumulation of unfinished business. At 61.0, the services PMI was much stronger than March’s 56.3, and also above a ‘flash estimate’ of 60.1 during April, suggesting activity picked up towards the end of the month. Germany’s economy is also strengthening. German factories have reported a jump in orders for the third month in a row, as its manufacturing sector continues to shine despite the pandemic. Industrial orders jumped by 3% in March, ahead of target, driven by rising remand within Germany. Domestic orders increased by 4.9% month-on-month while foreign orders went up by 1.6%. Germany’s economy shrank by 1.7% in Q1, but this suggests its economy is recovering. Bloomberg says: Demand for machinery, data processing equipment, electrical and optical goods as well as car manufacturing was particularly strong, the Economy Ministry said. Helped by strong recoveries abroad, German manufacturing has held up well during the latest rounds of restrictions to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The high level of activity means companies are now battling with unprecedented supply-chain problems as shortages of parts and raw materials add to a spike in freight costs. Quite a lot of upbeat corporate news this morning... Luxury carmaker Aston Martin has reported a jump in sales that helped it cut its losses. Aston Martin sold 1,353 vehicles in the first quarter of 2021, with the launch of its first sport utility vehicle, the DBX, boosting sales. That’s a 134% increase on the 578 sold in January-March 2020, early in the pandemic. Pre-tax losses fell to £42.2m, from £110.1m, with revenues jumping to £224.4m from £88.8m. Aston Martin was rescued from collapse in January 2020 by billionaire fashion tycoon Lawrence Stroll, who says he’s “delighted with the great progress”. Aston Martin is sticking with its current guidance for 2021, adding: The uncertainty surrounding the duration and impact of the pandemic on the global economy continues, with the pace of emergence from lockdown and recovery in consumer demand varying significantly across geographies. UK engineering firm Melrose has become the latest company to flag that the global shortage of semiconductors will hamper its growth. Reuters has the details: Britain’s Melrose Industries warned on Thursday its growth would be hit by a shortage of chips in the automotive supply chain as it recorded a rise in sales so far in 2021 thanks to a recovery in demand for cars and powder metals. The owner of GKN, which supplies parts to carmakers such as Volkswagen, said it was performing modestly ahead of its expectations, with sales for the four months ended April 30 up 8%. Britain’s blue-chip FTSE 100 index has hit a new 14-month high in early trading. The Footsie has risen around 0.35% to 7066 points, its highest level since late February 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic sent markets crashing. Next is the top riser, up 2.3%, after lifting its profit forecast this morning. Engineering firms Melrose (+2.3%) and Rolls-Royce (+2%) are also in the risers, along with British Airways owner IAG (+1.7%) - suggesting optimism about the reopening of economies this summer. Barratt have jumped 1.4% after lifting its house completion forecast today. UK housebuilder Barratt Developments is also upbeat this morning, telling the City it expects to complete homes than previously estimated. Barratt says it has seen strong customer demand, with the underlying market also robust. It says: Reflecting both strong trading and our successful increase in construction activity, we now expect FY21 wholly owned completions to be between 16,000 and 16,250 homes and to deliver around 650 JV [joint venture] home completions. As a result, we now expect an outturn for the full year modestly above the Board’s previous expectations. Mortgage lending surged after the first lockdown lifted, with the stamp duty holiday boosting demand, and helping to drive prices to record levels. Speaking of Barratt....The Economist’s Duncan Weldon recently looked at the rise of housing estates around the country, and the impact of ‘Barratt Britain’. He wrote: As young professionals priced out of big cities are well aware, Britain does not build enough homes. But some parts of the country have done better than others. The north and the Midlands have accounted for a rising share of housing investment over the past two decades, with big builders such as Barratt, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey responsible for much of the work. And this is having an impact on the political landscape of the country (timely, as we head to the polls today), Weldon added: There is an egalitarianism to Barratt Britain. Accountants, teachers, sales reps, plasterers and driving instructors live on the same street, and the smaller choice of pubs and restaurants means they socialise together, too. As long as mortgages remain affordable and petrol is cheap, it is not a place that worries much about politics. That is a boon for the government, and a problem for Labour... UK builders are also seeing a surge in demand - and a struggle for raw materials. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors reports today that Britain’s construction sector is seeing the biggest increase in its workload in five years, due to strong demand for housing and the resumption of other projects. Materials shortages are the biggest challenge for construction sector growth this year as the industry continues its recovery from the covid-19 pandemic, RICS warns. UK retail chain Next has hiked its profit guidance, having seen stronger trading than expected in recent weeks as the lockdown lifted. Next has increased its central guidance for full year profit before tax by £20m to £720m, after making £75m more “full price sales” than expected. It had already raised its profit forecast once this year, at the start of April. Next says: Full price sales in the thirteen weeks to 1 May were down -1.5% on two years ago. Our previous central guidance assumed that Q1 would be down -10% and we have beaten this Q1 forecast by £75m. Almost all of Next’s high street shops were closed under the lockdown, with the majority reopening on 12 April when curbs on non-essential stores were lifted. It says: In the last three weeks sales have been exceptionally strong and, versus two years ago, total full price sales were up +19%. In that period, full price sales in like-for-like Retail stores were up +2% and Online sales were up +52%. But it warns that this boost probably won’t last: The strong sales growth we have experienced in the last three weeks is due to pent-up demand built up over the last three months and is very unlikely to be indicative of demand for the rest of the year. Economist David Owen of Jefferies also expects the Bank to raise its growth forecasts today: An upward revision to the BoE’s 2021 GDP forecast is almost a given. Of more interest is what, on a 3 year view, they say on inflation and whether they decide to taper. Net gilt purchases are running at just under £4.5bn a week. Reduce that to £2.5bn a week and they would still hit their £895bn target for the outstanding stock of QE (including £20bn of credit) by year end. This chart, from Jefferies, also shows how UK economic activity picked up in April as some lockdown rules were eased. The Bank of England will say today that Britain’s economy is heading for a much stronger recovery this year than it previously expected, predicts Reuters: The BoE forecast in February that the world’s fifth-biggest economy would grow by 5% in 2021, having slumped by 10% in 2020. That was a bigger hit than in most other European economies after Prime Minister Boris Johnson was slower to impose a coronavirus lockdown and had to keep it in place for longer in an economy heavily reliant on face-to-face consumer services. But many economists say Britain is now set to grow by more than 7% this year, boosted by its fast COVID-19 vaccinations. “There’s a growing sense that the UK is finally on the way out of the pandemic, and with that comes an increased focus on the Bank of England’s future tightening plans,” analysts at ING said in a note to clients. “Indeed, we think the Bank may announce some tapering of its quantitative easing programme.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Bank of England sets UK interest rates at noon today, against the backdrop of an economic recovery as the country slowly emerges from lockdown and more people are vaccinated. Private sector growth is the fastest in years, mortgage lending is at a record, and economists are predicting the biggest bounce in GDP since the 1940s. Investors are also upbeat. The FTSE 100 share index hit its highest level in over a year yesterday, with mining giants, oil companies and banks among the risers -- all companies who benefit from a global rebound. So with the economic picture brightening, the BoE is expected to raise its growth forecasts today, in its latest Monetary Policy Report (also released at noon). Elsa Lignos of RBC predicts that the Bank will predict a smaller spike in unemployment this year: Significantly, the extension of the government’s furlough scheme, which was announced at the budget, is likely to see the MPC lower its estimate of where it expects unemployment to peak once support is withdraw. This optimism certainly isn’t expected to trigger an interest rate rise from their current record low of 0.1%. But...the Monetary Policy Committee will be pondering when it should slow, or taper, its £895bn asset purchase stimulus programme, which is buying up around £4.4bn of government bonds each week. Any hawkish signals about that could also sent the pound higher (it’s currently trading at $1.39). Shamik Dhar, chief economist at BNY Mellon Investment Management, says the prospects for the UK economy “look bright”. Thanks to an impressive vaccine rollout, the economy looks set to bounce back strongly in the second half, probably at double digit annualized growth rates, returning overall activity to pre-crisis levels this year. Inflationary pressures might build, but will probably be contained by a strong supply response in those industries that have been locked down. The Bank of England (BoE) remains a long way off tightening monetary policy, but could be one of the first central banks to signal it’s thinking about it, possibly in early 2022. This said, the BoE is thinking about switching the traditional sequencing of the policy tightening, with hikes in the policy rate possibly coming before a shrinkage in the balance sheet, and is expected to provide guidance on this issue in the next policy meetings. We anticipate that much of the fiscal deficit will correct automatically as private sector economic activity picks up strongly, but the Chancellor may need to raise taxes modestly further from here. Longer term, the public debt burden will fall so long as the yield on gilts remains lower than the nominal growth rate of the economy. But the economy won’t return to its pre-Covid state, of course, Dhar adds: “The economy will return to pre-crisis levels of economic activity quickly, and possibly recover the pre-crisis trend level next year. But the composition of the UK economy has probably changed permanently thanks to the pandemic. While we will see a strong bounce back in ‘close contact’ industries, such as hospitality and travel, this year and next, they may never recover their pre-crisis share of the economy. ‘Remotely-consumed’ goods and services will remain a larger proportion of the economy than they were pre-pandemic.

We are closing this liveblog but you can catch all the latest developments on our new feed below. Here is a comprehensive re-cap of where things stand: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy voiced concerns that Russian forces could use chemical weapons in Ukraine but did not confirm whether they had been used in his daily video address late on Monday. “Today, the occupiers issued a new statement, which testifies to their preparation for a new stage of terror against Ukraine and our defenders,” he said. “One of the mouthpieces of the occupiers stated that they could use chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol. We take this as seriously as possible.” Earlier on Monday evening, Ukrainian authorities claimed Russia dropped a drone carrying a toxic substance on the south-eastern city of Mariupol. Ivanna Klympush, a Ukrainian MP and chair of the parliamentary committee on integration of Ukraine to the EU, said the unknown substance was “most likely” chemical weapons. The reports are so far unconfirmed. The Ukrainian Azov Regiment, a unit of the National Guard of Ukraine, accused Russia of using chemical weapons of an “unknown origin”, dropped via an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on civilians in Mariupol. Azov leader Andriy Biletsky told the Kyiv Independent that three people had signs of chemical poisoning but there appears to be no “disastrous consequences” for their health. UK foreign secretary Liz Truss said work was underway to verify details of the alleged attack, adding: “Any use of such weapons would be a callous escalation in this conflict and we will hold Putin and his regime to account.” Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby added that he was aware of the reports but “cannot confirm at this time”. More than 10,000 civilians have died in Mariupol, the city’s mayor has said. Vadym Boychenko said the death toll could surpass 20,000, as weeks of attacks and privation leave bodies “carpeted through the streets” in an interview with the Associated Press. Zelenskiy partly blamed the Ukrainian loss of life on western nations that had not sent weapons to bolster the war effort. “Unfortunately, we are not getting as much as we need to end this war sooner,” he said. “Time is being lost. The lives of Ukrainians are being lost … And this is also the responsibility of those who still keep the weapons Ukraine needs in their armoury.” Ukrainian authorities are warning people not to go near what they say are landmines being dropped on Kharkiv. Zelenskiy also spoke of “hundreds of thousands of dangerous objects” including mines and unexploded shells left by Russian forces in regions in Ukraine’s north. The gruesome task of exhuming the bodies of Ukrainian victims from mass graves in Bucha on the outskirts of Kyiv started on Monday. More than 5,800 cases of alleged war crimes against Russian forces are under investigation, Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor general, told CNN. Nearly two-thirds of all Ukrainian children have fled their homes in the six weeks since Russia’s invasion, and the UN has verified the deaths of 142 children, though the number is almost certainly much higher, the UN children’s agency said Monday. The United Nations has increasingly heard accounts of rape and sexual violence in Ukraine and called for an investigation into violence against women and increased protection for Ukrainian children. Sima Bahous, UN Women executive director, told the UN security council: “The combination of mass displacement with the large pressure results of conscripts and mercenaries and the brutality displayed against Ukrainian civilians has raised all red flags.” Ukraine’s ombudswoman for human rights said she had recorded horrific acts of sexual violence by Russian troops in Bucha and elsewhere, including a case in which women and girls were kept in a basement for 25 days, the New York Times reported. Nine of those victims are now pregnant, according to the ombudswoman, Lyudmyla Denisova. Three people were killed and eight civilians wounded by Russian strikes in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, the region’s governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine’s eastern city of Kharkiv came under heavy shelling on Monday, resulting in multiple casualties, mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Among the casualties in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, was the death of one child, the region’s mayor said. Prominent Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr has been detained in Moscow on charges of disobeying police orders, his lawyer told the independent news outlet Sota Vision on Monday evening. France’s foreign ministry has declared six more Russian agents “operating under diplomatic cover” as persona non grata. The six agents are being accused of working against France’s “national interest” after an investigation, Reuters reports. Russian forces are focusing on the Donbas region, the US Pentagon said, but have not launched an offensive yet. “They’re repositioning, they’re refocusing on the Donbas,” Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. Western officials said they expected Russia to try to “double or perhaps even treble” its forces in Donbas as it shifts forces from Kyiv and elsewhere in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces are readying themselves for a “last battle” to control the besieged southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, Ukraine’s armed forces said. The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, held “direct, open and tough” talks with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow on Monday. In a statement, Nehammer – the first EU leader to meet with Putin since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine – was quoted as saying that it was “not a friendly meeting”. Moscow said it will not pause its military operation in Ukraine before the next round of peace talks. In an interview with Russian state television, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said he saw no reason not to continue talks with Ukraine but insisted Moscow would not halt its military operation when the sides convene again. Russia is receiving munitions and military hardware sourced from Iraq for its war effort in Ukraine with the help of Iranian weapons smuggling networks, according to members of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and regional intelligence services with knowledge of the process. RPGs and anti-tank missiles, as well as Brazilian-designed rocket launcher systems, have been dispatched to Russia from Iraq as Moscow’s campaign has faltered in the last month, the Guardian has learned. An Iranian-made Bavar 373 missile system, similar to the Russian S-300, has also been donated to Moscow by the authorities in Tehran, who also returned an S-300, according to a source who helped organise the transport. Using the weapons-trafficking underworld would signal a dramatic shift in Russian strategy, as Moscow is forced to lean on Iran, its military ally in Syria, following new sanctions triggered by the invasion of Ukraine. Read the full story below. US state department spokesperson Ned Price said there has been “credible information” that Russia may have been “preparing to use [chemical] agents” as part of an effort to weaken and incapacitate the city of Mariupol. Earlier today, Ukrainian authorities alleged Russia dropped a drone carrying a toxic substance on the southeastern city. Speaking CNN’s Jake Tapper on Monday night, Price said: Before today, there was credible information available to us that the Russians may have been preparing to use agents, chemical agents, potentially tear gas mixed with other agents, as part of an effort to weaken, to incapacitate the Ukrainian military and civilian elements that are entrenched in Mariupol, using these agents as part of an effort to weaken those defences. We shared that information with our Ukrainian partners. We are going to be in direct conversations with them to try and determine what exactly has transpired here, and as soon as we gain additional fidelity, we’ll be in a better position to say what this was or what this may have been. Referring to Russia’s planned offensive on the Donbas, Price said the US was continuing to supply Ukraine with military aid. “Russia will be strategically defeated and we’ve already laid the groundwork for that,” he added. Russian forces have reportedly seized a cargo ship docked in the port of Mariupol along with those on board, Ukraine’s human rights ombudswoman said. Lyudmyla Denisova said 18 Ukrainians and one Egyptian were taken off the ship, named the Smarta, in an update on herTelegram channel late on Monday. All contact with the crew has reportedly been lost. The Liberian-flagged ship docked in Mariupol on 21 February, days before the Russian invasion, on its way to Turkey and had been unable to put to sea again, Denisova added. Here are some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine today as rescue workers continue to clear the debris and work to find civilians trapped by fallen buildings. Ukraine’s finance ministry has welcomed the creation of a special new account set up by the International Monetary Fund to give bilateral donors and international organisations a secure way to send financial resources to war-torn Ukraine. The IMF’s executive board approved creation of the new account on Friday after the Canadian government proposed disbursing up to $1 billion Canadian dollars through the vehicle, which is to be administered by the IMF. The account will allow donors to provide grants and loans to help the Ukrainian government meet its balance of payments and budgetary needs and help stabilise its economy as it continues to defend against Russia’s deadly invasion. “Donors will benefit from the IMF’s tested infrastructure to quickly deliver authenticated payments,” the IMF said. Going through the global lender will allow donations to Ukraine to be frozen in the event of a Russian takeover of power in Ukraine, experts say. Donors will deposit reserve currencies or Special Drawing Rights, the IMF’s own reserve currency, into the new account, which will then disburse these resources as grants or loans into Ukraine’s SDR account at the fund. One source familiar with the plans told Reuters additional donations were expected for both the IMF account and a separate World Bank account set up for Ukraine during next week’s spring meetings of the two global financial institutions. Nearly two-thirds of all Ukrainian children have fled their homes in the six weeks since Russia’s invasion, and the United Nations has verified the deaths of 142 youngsters, though the number is almost certainly much higher, the UN children’s agency said Monday. Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF’s emergency programs director, said having 4.8 million of Ukraine’s 7.5 million children displaced in such a short time is “quite incredible.” He said it is something he hadn’t before seen happen so quickly in 31 years of humanitarian work. “They have been forced to leave everything behind — their homes, their schools and, often, their family members,” he told the UN Security Council. “I have heard stories of the desperate steps parents are taking to get their children to safety, and children saddened that they are unable to get back to school.” Ukraine’s UN ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, claimed Russia has taken more than 121,000 children out of Ukraine and reportedly drafted a bill to simplify and accelerate adoption procedures for orphans and even those who have parents and other relatives. He said most of the children were removed from the besieged southern port city of Mariupol and taken to eastern Donetsk and then to the Russian city of Taganrog. Fontaine said UNICEF has heard the same reports, but added that “we don’t have yet the access that we need to have to be able to look and verify and see if we can assist.” He said that of Ukraine’s displaced children, 2.8 million are in Ukraine and 2 million more are in other countries. At the same time, he said, nearly half the estimated 3.2 million children still in their homes in Ukraine “may be at risk of not having enough food,” with those in besieged cities like Mariupol facing the most dire situation. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy voiced concerns that Russian forces could use chemical weapons in Ukraine but has not confirmed whether they have already been used. In a national address late on Monday, Zelenskiy said Russia claimed its forces could use chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol and he was taking the allegations seriously.

Among the casualties in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, was the death of one child, the region’s mayor said. 4,354 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities using humanitarian corridors on Monday, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. Prominent Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr has been detained in Moscow on charges of disobeying police orders, his lawyer told the independent news outlet Sota Vision on Monday evening. France’s foreign ministry has declared six more Russian agents as persona non grata and operating under diplomatic cover.

The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, held “direct, open and tough” talks with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow on Monday, warning that western sanctions would intensify as long as people kept dying in Ukraine. In a statement, Nehammer – the first EU leader to meet with Putin since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine – was quoted as saying that it was “not a friendly meeting”. However, Moscow said it will not pause its military operation in Ukraine before the next round of peace talks. In an interview with Russian state television, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said he saw no reason not to continue talks with Ukraine but insisted Moscow would not halt its military operation when the sides convene again. More than 10,000 civilians have died in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, the city’s mayor has said. Vadym Boychenko said the death toll could surpass 20,000, as weeks of attacks and privation leave the bodies of Mariupol’s people “carpeted through the streets” in an interview by phone on Monday with the Associated Press. Boychenko also accused Russian forces of having blocked weeks of thwarted humanitarian convoys into the city in an attempt to conceal the carnage there from the outside world. Mariupol has been cut off by Russian attacks that began soon after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine in late February, and has suffered some of the most brutal assaults of the war. Boychenko gave new details of recent allegations by Ukrainian officials that Russian forces have brought mobile cremation equipment to Mariupol to dispose of the corpses of victims of the siege. Russian forces have taken many bodies to a huge shopping centre where there are storage facilities and refrigerators, Boychenko said. “Mobile crematoriums have arrived in the form of trucks: You open it, and there is a pipe inside and these bodies are burned,” he said. The mayor said he had several sources for his description of the allegedly methodic burning of corpses by Russian forces in the city but gave few further details. Speaking to South Korean lawmakers via video link on Monday, Zelenskiy said “tens of thousands” of people had probably been killed in Mariupol. No independent verification of the death toll in the besieged south-eastern city is possible, but if a figure of this magnitude is confirmed it would be by far the highest death toll in any Ukrainian town or city since the war began. Forces defending the besieged port city said their ammunition was running out. “Today will probably be the last battle,” the 36th Marine Brigade of the Ukrainian armed forces wrote on social media. “It’s death for some of us and captivity for the rest.” Zelenskiy in-part placed the responsibility for the lives of Ukrainian lives being lost on western nations who have not sent weapons to bolster Ukraine’s war effort. “Yes, Ukrainians are incomparably braver ... But when it comes to the necessary weapons, we still depend on the supply, on our partners.” Unfortunately, we are not getting as much as we need to end this war sooner. To completely destroy the enemy on our land. And to fulfil those tasks that are obvious to each of our people. In particular, to unblock Mariupol. If we got jets and enough heavy armoured vehicles, the necessary artillery, we would be able to do it. But...” Zelenskiy said that although he is sure Ukraine “will get almost everything we need” he stressed that more military support needed to come soon. Not only time is being lost. The lives of Ukrainians are being lost. Lives that can no longer be returned. And this is also the responsibility of those who still keep the weapons Ukraine needs in their armoury. The responsibility that will forever remain in history.” Zelenskiy spoke of “hundreds of thousands of dangerous objects” including mines and unexploded shells left behind by Russian forces in regions of Ukraine’s north. Security work is underway in the northern regions of our country, from where the occupiers were expelled. First of all, it is mine clearance. Russian troops left behind tens if not hundreds of thousands of dangerous objects. These are shells that did not explode, mines, tripwire mines. At least several thousand such items are disposed of daily. The occupiers left mines everywhere. In the houses they seized. Just on the streets, in the fields. They mined people’s property, mined cars, doors. They consciously did everything to make the return to these areas after de-occupation as dangerous as possible.” Zelenskiy continued to claim that the territory of Ukraine is now “one of the most contaminated by mines in the world” and called for the situation to also be considered as a war crime of Russian troops. They deliberately did everything to kill or maim as many of our people as possible, even when they were forced to withdraw from our land. Without the appropriate orders, they would not have done it.” Ukrainian authorities are warning people not to go near what they say are landmines being dropped on Kharkiv. On Monday, security forces cordoned off an area in the east of the city as they cleared a number of small devices scattered across residential streets. Lieutenant Colonel Nikolay Ovcharuk, head of the de-mining unit of the state emergency service, said the devices were plastic PTM-1M mines, which detonate using timers and which were widely used by Soviet forces in Afghanistan, Reuters reports. “They have self-destructing timers,” he said as loudspeakers warned people not to approach the cordoned-off area where mine disposal teams were working. Earlier, authorities issued a warning that Russian forces had been dropping “parachute bombs” on the city. Residents said the devices had been dropped in the early hours of Monday morning. “Tonight at 1am we heard some strange sounds, something whistled and then it all dropped,” a local man who gave his name as Sergey said. The Guardian could not independently confirm the type of device. Kharkiv, a major city close to the northeastern border with Russia, has been under bombardment for weeks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy voiced concerns that Russia forces could use chemical weapons in Ukraine but did not confirm whether they had been used in his daily video address late on Monday. Zelenskiy said Russia claimed its forces could use chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol and he was taking the allegations seriously. Today, the occupiers issued a new statement, which testifies to their preparation for a new stage of terror against Ukraine and our defenders. One of the mouthpieces of the occupiers stated that they could use chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol. We take this as seriously as possible. “I want to remind the world leaders that the possible use of chemical weapons by the Russian military has already been discussed. And already at that time it meant that it was necessary to react to the Russian aggression much tougher and faster,” he added. The Ukrainian Azov Regiment, a unit of the National Guard of Ukraine, has also spoken of the unconfirmed reports that Russia used chemical weapons against Ukraine’s military and citizens late on Monday night. The Regiment said the chemicals were of an “unknown origin” and dropped via an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on civilians in the southeastern city of Mariupol. About an hour ago, Russian occupation forces used a poisonous substance of unknown origin against Ukrainian military and civilians in the city of Mariupol, which was dropped from an enemy UAV,” the Azoz Regiment posted on Telegram on Monday. The victims have respiratory failure, vestibulo-atactic syndrome. The consequences of using an unknown substance are being clarified.” Azov leader Andriy Biletsky told the Kyiv Independent that three people have signs of chemical poisoning but there appears to be no “disastrous consequences” for their health. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs, tweeted about the alleged use of chemical weapons. “ATTENTION! Chemical weapons are used against Ukrainian defenders in #Mariupol! russia openly crosses all boundaries of humanity and openly declares it, while Ukraine is still asking for heavy weapon,” he wrote. The Guardian could not independently verify the claims. The gruesome task of exhuming the bodies of Ukrainian victims from mass graves in Bucha on the outskirts of Kyiv started on Monday as trucks filled with body bags of the dead transported them to sites for forensic analysis. Among them was a Ukrainian soldier wearing camouflage, his shriveled hand raised; many others of the hundreds killed were civilians, including young children. Elsewhere on the edges of the capital, mounds of destroyed and burned vehicles were piled on top of each other. Local residents climbed atop an abandoned and damaged Russian tank. A boy walked by unexploded Russian shells in the village of Andriyivka, on the outskirts of Kyiv. All were evidence of the destruction and death left behind by the retreating Russian forces following a weekslong occupation. Pentagon spokesman, John Kirby, has also issued a statement on the unconfirmed reports of a chemical weapons attack in Mariupol. We are aware of social media reports which claim Russian forces deployed a potential chemical munition in Mariupol, Ukraine. We cannot confirm at this time and will continue to monitor the situation closely. These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia’s potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine.” Ukrainian authorities have said a Russian drone dropped a toxic substance on the southeastern city of Mariupol late on Monday night. Ivanna Klympush, a Ukrainian MP and chair of the parliamentary committee on integration of Ukraine to the EU, said the unknown substance was “most likely” chemical weapons. Klympush claimed the attack occurred around 10pm local time, writing on Twitter: “This morning Russians threatened to use “chemical troops” against Mariupol’s defenders.” “Victims experience respiratory failure, vestib.-atactic syndrome.Most likely chem [chemical] weapons!” she added. UK foreign secretary Liz Truss said Russian forces may have used chemical agents in an attack on the people of Mariupol. “We are working urgently with partners to verify details,” she said “Any use of such weapons would be a callous escalation in this conflict and we will hold Putin and his regime to account.” Three people were killed and eight civilians wounded by Russian strikes in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, the region’s governor said. Prominent Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr has been detained in Moscow on charges of disobeying police orders, his lawyer told an independent news outlet. Ukraine’s ombudswoman for human rights said she had recorded horrific acts of sexual violence by Russian troops in Bucha and elsewhere, including a case in which women and girls were kept in a basement for 25 days. Joe Biden and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, pledged collaboration over Ukraine. Ukraine’s eastern city of Kharkiv came under heavy shelling today, resulting in multiple casualties, mayor Ihor Terekhov said in a televised interview. SocGen, the French bank, has announced it is ending its Russian activities. The United Nations has increasingly heard accounts of sexual violence and rape in Ukraine, including new testimony today from La Strada-Ukraine, a human rights organization. Austria’s chancellor, Karl Nehammer, has said he told Vladimir Putin that “all those responsible” for war crimes must be brought to justice. Société Générale (SocGen), the French bank, has announced it is ending its Russian activities, making it the first big western bank to take such a step, the Associated Press reports: SocGen is also selling its entire stake in Rosbank to a company linked to a Russian oligarch, costing the French bank some 3bn euros ($3.3 billion). Rosbank is a heavyweight in the Russian banking sector, and Société Générale was the majority shareholder. “After several weeks of intensive work,” the bank said in a statement, it had signed an agreement with Russian investment fund Interros Capital to sell all of its stake in Rosbank as well as its insurance subsidiaries in Russia. Interros is one of the largest funds in the country, which holds assets in heavy industry and metallurgy. Today’s meeting between Austria’s chancellor, Karl Nehammer, and Vladimir Putin seems to have gone as badly as expected. It lasted 75 minutes and is being depicted by Vienna as “tough and direct”. In the meeting, Nehammer raised Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s readiness for in-person talks with the Russian president, but Putin gave “no reply whatsoever”, ignoring the issue, an Austrian official told the Guardian. Instead, Putin talked about the “Istanbul track” negotiations, which have failed to produce any progress so far. “Putin seems to be massively caught up in the ‘logic of war’ and acts accordingly,” the Austrian official said. More reading here: Iryna Venediktova, the prosecutor general of Ukraine, has shared more details about her war crimes investigations in a CNN interview, saying her office was building “more than 5,800 cases”. She told host Jake Tapper: We are still exhuming the dead bodies from the mass grave. Actually, what we see, now, we see a lot of war crimes, actually, it is not only war crimes. Now we can say ... a lot of crimes against humanity.” Earlier in the day, her office released this statement outlining child casualties, CNN noted: As of April 11, 2022, according to official data from juvenile prosecutors, more than 525 children were casualties in Ukraine as a result of the armed invasion of our country by the Russian Federation. 183 children died and more than 342 were injured. These figures are not final, as work is underway in places of active hostilities in the temporarily occupied and liberated territories.” In her follow-up interview, Venediktova suggested those numbers were an undercount, because they did not account for victims in places like Mariupol, which were under Russian occupation. Reuters has more details on testimony from the United Nations, which has increasingly heard accounts of rape and sexual violence in Ukraine. Sima Bahous, UN Women executive director, told the UN security council: We are increasingly hearing of rape and sexual violence. The combination of mass displacement with the large pressure results of conscripts and mercenaries and the brutality displayed against Ukrainian civilians has raised all red flags.” Kateryna Cherepakha, president of La Strada-Ukraine, a human rights organization, also said her group’s hotlines had received calls accusing Russian soldiers of nine cases of rape, involving 12 women and girls. She told the council, according to Reuters: This is just the tip of the iceberg. We know and see - and we want you to hear our voices - that violence and rape is used now as a weapon of war by Russian invaders in Ukraine.” The UN said last week that its human rights monitors were working to verify allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers, including claims of gang rape and rapes in front of children. The UN further said it was investigating claims that Ukrainian forces and civil defense militias had committed acts of sexual violence; Ukraine’s UN mission did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment on those allegations. Russia has repeatedly denied attacking civilians. Ukraine’s UN ambassador also told the security council that its prosecutor general’s office was launching a “special mechanism of documentation” for cases involving sexual violence. Ukraine’s ombudswoman for human rights said she had recorded horrific acts of sexual violence by Russian troops in Bucha and elsewhere, including a case in which women and girls were kept in a basement for 25 days, the New York Times has reported. Nine of those victims are now pregnant, according to the ombudswoman, Lyudmyla Denisova. Denisova has urged the UN human rights commission to “take into account these facts of Russian war crimes in Ukraine”, adding: The level of brutality of the army of terrorists and executioners of the Russian Federation knows no bounds.” In Bucha’s Month of Terror, the New York Times lays out horrifying details and images of the “campaign of terror and revenge against civilians” as Russia’s advance on Kyiv was stalled. For more on the casualties in Bucha, check out my colleague Luke Harding’s recent dispatch: Europol, the EU’s policy agency, said today it had launched an operation targeting the assets of Russian individuals and companies, the AFP reports: The agency, based in The Hague, launched the operation dubbed “Oscar” jointly with EU member states, as well as Eurojust and Frontex. The operation aims to “facilitate partners’ exchange of information and intelligence and provide operational support in a number of financial investigations targeting criminal assets and circumvention of the EU economic sanctions related to Russia’s military aggression,” Europol said in a statement. The EU’s border agency Frontex “will contribute to the operation by enhancing the scrutiny of the persons who are crossing EU’s external borders and fall under the scope of the sanctions”, the statement said. Operation Oscar will continue for at least a year and includes a number of separate investigations, Europol said. In its statement, Europol said it would also provide financial support to the relevant national authorities and would help provide forensic and technical expertise and support for investigations, the AFP said. Eurojust, the judicial counterpart to Europol, will also be offering legal assistance and other supports. Three people were killed and eight civilians wounded by Russian strikes in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, reports Reuters. Three people were killed and eight civilians were wounded on Monday by Russian strikes on Ukraine’s eastern region of Donetsk, the region’s governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Reuters was not able to independently verify the governor’s account of the attack. Prominent Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr. has been detained in Moscow on charges of disobeying police orders, his lawyer told the independent news outlet Sota Vision on Monday evening. Kara-Murza’s lawyer Vadim Prokhorov told Sota that he will spend the night at the Khamovniki police precinct in central Moscow where he was brought to shortly after his detainment. The opposition activist faces up to 15 days in jail or a fine.Kara-Murza is a veteran Kremlin critic who says he was deliberately poisoned in Moscow in 2015 and 2017 as retaliation for his lobbying efforts to impose U.S. and EU sanctions against Russian officials accused of human rights abuses. A close friend of Boris Nemtsov, who was shot and killed in 2015, Kara-Murza nearly died from kidney failure in the first incident.Kara-Murza has been a vocal opponent of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, launching an anti-war committee together with other Russian leading opposition figures. He has also been one of the few oppositionists who still travel to Russia, as many have fled the country out of safety concerns.Hours prior to his detainment, Kara-Murza went on CNN where he described the Kremlin as a “regime of murderers.” Top officials at the United Nations have said that women and children in Ukraine need more protection, reported AFP. UN officials also called for an investigation into violence against women during its invasion of Ukraine and increased protection for Ukrainian children. Sima Bahous, director of the UN women’s agency, spoke on her concerns during a meeting with the Security Council today: This war must stop. Now...We are increasingly hearing of rape and sexual violence. These allegations must be independently investigated to ensure justice and accountability. Bahous, who recently visited the region, also said “mass displacement with the large presence of conscripts and mercenaries, and the brutality displayed against Ukrainian civilians, has raised all red flags.” Russia has rejected accusations of abuse through the Ukraine invasion. Read an article from the Guardian’s Andrew Roth and Shaun Walker about Russian soldiers looting throughout Ukrainian territories they occupy: When Russian soldiers left the village of Novyi Bykiv after a month of occupation, Natalia Samson returned to her house to find they had stolen her perfumes, jewellery, some wine, a scooter, a novelty cushion and a collection of old coins. A few days later she ventured into the village school, where she works as the deputy headteacher, and discovered the Russians had taken most of the computers, the projectors and other electronic equipment. In the headteacher’s office, an opened pair of scissors had been inserted into a plasma screen that was left behind, apparently in an attempt to ensure that what could not be stolen was instead destroyed. “People saw them simply loading everything on to Ural trucks, everything they could get their hands on,” said Samson, shaking her head in disbelief. A dozen houses on the village’s main street had been looted, as well as all the shops. Other villagers reported losing washing machines, food, laptops and even a sofa...

Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk shared the number today online, with evacuations coming from cities across the country. About four million chickens were killed at a poultry farm in the Kherson region as Russian shelling cut off power supplies to the farm, reports NEXTA: About four million chickens were killed at Chornobayivska poultry farm in Kherson region, Ukrainian human rights commissioner Lyudmyla Denysova said. As a result of Russian shelling, the power supply was interrupted, leaving the farm without the ability to feed its poultry. Ukraine officials have accused Russia of holding civilians, including journalists, in Russian prisons, reports Reuters. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a televised statement that many civilians are being imprisoned: We have many priests, journalists, activists, mayors, and in general civilians who are in prisons, not, for example, even on the territory of Ukraine, but in (the) Kursk, Bryansk, Rostov (regions of Russia)... They are forcibly held... Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians. Russian forces are focusing on the Donbas region, says the US Pentagon, but have-- not launched an offensive yet, reports AFP. Russian forces are reinforcing around the Donbas, notably near the town of Izyum, but have not yet launched an offensive to seize control of the disputed region of eastern Ukraine, Pentagon officials said Monday. “They’re repositioning, they’re refocusing on the Donbas,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters. Kirby said a convoy of vehicles had been observed heading for Izyum but “it’s not clear to us how many vehicles are in this convoy and what exactly they’re bringing. “It does seem to be a mix of personnel-carrying vehicles as well as armored vehicles and maybe some artillery,” he said. The Pentagon spokesman underscored that the Ukrainian military has been fighting Moscow-backed separatists in the Donbas region since 2014. “The Ukrainians have been for eight years - and still are - fighting over that,” he said. “And they show no signs of being willing to give that territory up.” A senior US defense official said earlier Monday that the United States does not believe a “new offensive” in the Donbas region has begun yet. “We still assess that while there is fighting going on they (the Russians) are working to reinforce their capabilities and to add to it,” the official said... More on the expulsion of six Russian diplomats in France: France’s General Directorate of Internal Security discovered the operation by Russian diplomats happening in France, reports NEXTA: The General Directorate of Internal Security after a lengthy investigation revealed a covert operation conducted by the Russian secret services on the territory of France, according to a statement of the Foreign Ministry. As a result, six Russian agents were exposed. Here is a statement from France’s foreign ministry on the decision to expel six Russian diplomats today, reported by Reuters: Following a very long investigation, the General Directorate of Internal Security (DGSI) revealed on Sunday April 10 a clandestine operation carried out by the Russian intelligence services on our territory... Six Russian agents operating under diplomatic cover and whose activities proved contrary to our national interests have been declared persona non grata... The foreign ministry did not provide any more elaboration into what the “clandestine operation” entailed. France’s foreign ministry has declared six more Russian agents as persona non grata and operating under diplomatic cover, reports Reuters. The six agents are being accused of working against France’s “national interest” following an investigation, Reuters further reports. Last week, France expelled 35 Russian diplomats as apart of a joint response with other European countries. This story is developing-more details to come. 150,000 Mariupol residents are reportedly being allowed to flee the besieged city after Ukraine negotiators secured safe passage, according to a top Zelenskiy adviser. From Foreign Policy’s Jack Detsch: NEW: Ukrainian evacuation buses from Mariupol have allowed 150,000 residents to flee the besieged port city after [Ukraine] negotiators managed to secure safe passage: top Zelensky advisor Local officials estimate over 10,000 Mariupol residents have died during Russia’s 42-day siege Previously, civilians were only able to escape the port city via personal transport. It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: Ukraine’s eastern city of Kharkiv came under heavy shelling today, resulting in multiple casualties, mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Among the casualties in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, was the death of one child, the region’s mayor said. The bodies of seven people have been recovered from the rubble of two destroyed high-rise housing blocks in the town of Borodianka near Kyiv, Ukraine’s state emergencies service said. The recovered bodies pushed the total death toll there to 19 people found in the rubble, it said in a statement. Tens of thousands of people have most likely been killed in Russia’s assault on the south-eastern city of Mariupol, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said. Speaking in a video address to the South Korean parliament, Zelenskiy said “Ukraine needs support for its military, including planes and tanks”. Ukrainian forces are readying themselves for a “last battle” to control the besieged southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, a statement on the Facebook page of the 36th marine brigade of the Ukrainian armed forces said. Ukraine’s military commander-in-chief, Gen Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said Ukrainian forces were still holding out in the port of Mariupol. Moscow will not pause its military operation in Ukraine before the next round of peace talks, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Speaking in an interview with Russian state television, Lavrov said he saw no reason not to continue talks with Ukraine but insisted Moscow would not halt its military operation when the sides convene again. Western officials said they expected Russia to try and “double or perhaps even treble” its forces in Donbas as it shifts forces from Kyiv and elsewhere in the coming weeks. The first of those forces had begun to redeploy via Belarus, but the whole exercise would take “some considerable time” and it was unclear how many units could be effectively brought back into battle. The US president, Joe Biden, spoke with Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, stressing the countries’ shared values as the US pushed India to take a harder line against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Modi called the situation in Ukraine “very worrying” and said he has spoken with Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appealing to both of them for peace. The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, held “direct, open and tough” talks with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow today. In a statement, Nehammer – the first EU leader to meet with Putin since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine – was quoted as saying that it was “not a friendly meeting”. Russia’s defence ministry claimed it has destroyed a S-300 anti-aircraft missile system near Dnipro which had been supplied to Ukraine by an unspecified European country. The claim has been described as disinformation by Slovakia’s prime minister, Eduard Heger, whose country donated an S-300 system last week. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today as I hand over to my colleague, Gloria Oladipo, who will continue to bring you all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. The bodies of seven people have been recovered from the rubble of two destroyed high-rise housing blocks in the town of Borodianka near Kyiv, Ukraine’s state emergencies service said. More than 200 rescue workers have been scrambling to find missing residents since Ukraine retook Borodianka after Russian troops began pulling back from the region late last month, Reuters reports. The recovered bodies pushed the total death toll there to 19 people found in the rubble, the state emergencies service said in a statement. John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, has been giving the daily US update on the war in Ukraine. He confirmed that the US believes Russia has withdrawn all its units from around Kyiv and Chernihiv into Belarus and then east into Russia. He said the US believes those units could be refitted and resupplied and then sent into eastern Ukraine. “We have seen some early indications that the Russians are in fact trying to resupply and reinforce their efforts in the Donbas,” Kirby said. He referred to images of a column of Russian vehicles heading south towards the town of Izyum. “We believe that these are the early stages of a reinforcement effort by the Russians in the Donbas,” he said. It’s not clear to us how many vehicles are in this convoy and what exactly they’re bringing. It does seem to be a mix of personnel-carrying vehicles as well as armoured vehicles and maybe some artillery, maybe some enabling capabilities. Kirby had no confirmation on Russian claims to have struck Ukraine’s recently-acquired S-300 anti-aircraft system. “We have seen the Russians hit airfields in the last couple of weeks... just over the last day or so,” he said. What exactly they’re targeting at those fields is not perfectly clear to us, but I would just say this about Ukrainian air defence: they still have a lot of their air defence capability available to them. They have been asking for more, and so we are working with allies and partners to help get long-range air defence systems into Ukraine. As for the newly-appointed Russian commander, Alexander Dvornikov, who has a history of targeting civilians in Syria, Kirby said he could not speculate on what Dvornikov’s intentions in Ukraine were, but added: He and other senior Russian leaders have shown in the past .. their disregard for avoiding civilian harm, their utter disregard in many ways for the laws of war, law of armed conflict, and the brutality with which they conduct and prosecute their operations. We can certainly say by what we’ve seen in the past, that we’re probably turning another page in the same book of Russian brutality. Austria’s chancellor, Karl Nehammer, has said he told Vladimir Putin that “all those responsible” for war crimes must be brought to justice and warned that western sanctions would intensify as long as people kept dying in Ukraine. After becoming the first western leader to hold face-to-face talks with the Russian president since the invasion of Ukraine, Nehammer said his trip to Moscow was not “a visit of friendship” and that the two had had a “direct, open and hard” conversation. “I mentioned the serious war crimes in Bucha and other locations and stressed that all those responsible have to be brought to justice,” Nehammer said in a statement. Russian media reported that the meeting, which took place at Putin’s official Novo-Ogaryovo residence just outside Moscow, was behind closed doors at Austria’s request. Speaking before the meeting began, Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the two would discuss “the situation around Ukraine”, but declined to give further details. Peskov said he could not exclude that gas would be discussed as this was “very, very relevant for the Austrian side”, according to Russia’s Interfax news agency. The meeting came as EU foreign ministers discussed targeting Russian oil in the next round of sanctions, while Joe Biden held talks with Narendra Modi, in which the US president was expected to press India’s leader not to increase imports of Russian crude. Sima Bahous, director of the UN women’s agency, has called for an investigation into Russia’s violence against women during its invasion of Ukraine, AFP reports. Speaking at a meeting of the security council in New York, Bahous said: This war must stop. Now. We are increasingly hearing of rape and sexual violence. These allegations must be independently investigated to ensure justice and accountability. The combination of “mass displacement with the large presence of conscripts and mercenaries, and the brutality displayed against Ukrainian civilians, has raised all red flags”, she said. There was also an increased risk of human trafficking at border crossings, with young women and unaccompanied teenagers at particular risk, she added. Also at the security council meeting, the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said what is happening to women and children during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was “horrific beyond comprehension”. Thomas-Greenfield said: When men like President Putin start wars, women and children get displaced, women and children get hurt. Women and children get raped and abused and women and children die. Since the start of Russia’s “unprovoked” war against Ukraine, Russia has bombed orphanages and maternity hospitals, she continued. We’ve seen mass graves with dead children stacked on top of each other. Ukraine’s eastern city of Kharkiv came under heavy shelling today, resulting in multiple casualties, mayor Ihor Terekhov said in a televised interview, Reuters reports. Among the casualties in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, was the death of one child, the region’s mayor said. When asked about the risk of a new Russian assault on the city, Terekhov said that Ukrainian forces were focused and ready to defend the city. Russia has claimed it targeted Ukrainian air defence systems in airstrikes overnight which completely destroyed the airport in the eastern city of Dnipro. Another attack wounded five people in the town of Zvonetsky, according to Ukrainian officials. Emergency workers were also combing through an infrastructure facility in the town of Zvonetsky that was attacked on Monday. Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, said casualty figures would be given at a later point. Reznichenko earlier said that the Dnipro attack had wounded one person, while rockets had sparked a fire that was eventually put out. A missile had also hit a building in the Pavlograd district, he added. Separately, the head of the Dnipro region council, Mykola Lukashuk, said five staffers of the state emergency service had been wounded by the strike on the airport. Russia said that it had targeted an S-300 air defence missile system transported to Ukraine by Slovakia last week, a claim denied by Slovakia. Kyiv has repeatedly begged its western allies for long-range air defence systems to help it against the Russian invasion. Russian defence ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov said the military used cruise missiles to destroy four launchers on the southern outskirts of Dnipro, as well as hitting such systems in the Mykolaiv and Kharkiv regions. Dnipro, an industrial city home to 1 million people, has become a vital reception point for Ukrainians from further east who have been told to evacuate in the face of both Russian advances on the ground and intensifying airstrikes and artillery attacks. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk, also wrote on Telegram that a school and a high-rise apartment building had been hit on Monday in the city of Severodonetsk. • This segment was amended on 12 April 2022 because the S-300 air defence missile system transported to Ukraine last week was from Slovakia, not Slovenia as an earlier version said. Joe Biden and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, were talking over a video link about the conflict in Ukraine and what the US president said is: “Our close consultation on how to manage the destabilising effects of this Russian war.” The two leaders are in a private session, at which Biden is expected to raise US concerns over India’s perceived closeness to Moscow and its continuing investment in Russian oil and military systems. But the mood was lighter as Biden and Modi presented a collaborative front in the public portion of their meeting, aired live on the White House website. “At the root of our partnership is a deep connection between our people, a family of friendship and a shared value,” Biden said, as Modi appeared on a giant screen before him. The people in Ukraine are suffering a horrific assault, including the tragic shelling in a train station last week that killed dozens of innocent children and women and civilians attempting to flee the violence. The United States and India are going to continue our close consultation on how to manage the destabilising effects of this Russian war. Modi condemned Russian killings of Ukraine citizens and said India was “very worried” about the alleged atrocities in Bucha. “We condemn the killings and have called for an independent inquiry,” he said, adding that India had contributed to the global effort to send help to Ukraine. We have also emphasized the importance of the security of civilians in Ukraine and the unhindered supply of humanitarian assistance to them. The press were asked to leave without the opportunity to ask questions, and the live feed went dark. It remains to be seen if Biden or Modi will make themselves available to reporters at the event’s conclusion. For more live updates from the US, please follow our US politics blog. Western officials said they expected Russia to try and “double or perhaps even treble” its forces in Donbas as it shifts forces from Kyiv and elsewhere in the coming weeks. The first of those forces had begun to redeploy via Belarus, but the whole exercise would take “some considerable time” and it was unclear how many units could be effectively brought back into battle. It is estimated that around 37-38 Russian battalion tactical groups, which have a composition of 800 at full strength, are now “combat non effective” leaving the Russian military with around 90. Those numbers could eventually be augmented by some reservists, after Russia called up around 60,000, but these are likely to take some time to be ready for the frontline. One official added: The fact that Russia is looking at doing this gives an indication as to the impact of the massive casualties that they face. Russian forces are said to be still employing similar tactics as seen in early phases of the war, driving down “in columns on the road,” which have proved vulnerable to Ukrainian counter attacks. When ambushed the Russian force are frequently “unable to respond to the nature of that attack,” the official added, firing wildly and proving unable to pinpoint where the attackers are coming from. The officials say this was largely due to the limited or in some cases non-existent preparation Russian forces had for the invasion. “It is still incredible to watch,” one said. It is just past 7pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: Tens of thousands of people have most likely been killed in Russia’s assault on the south-eastern city of Mariupol, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said. Speaking in a video address to the South Korean parliament, Zelenskiy said “Ukraine needs support for its military, including planes and tanks”. Ukrainian forces are readying themselves for a “last battle” to control the besieged southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, a statement on the Facebook page of the 36th marine brigade of the Ukrainian armed forces said. Ukraine’s military commander-in-chief, Gen Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said Ukrainian forces were still holding out in the port of Mariupol. Moscow will not pause its military operation in Ukraine before the next round of peace talks, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Speaking in an interview with Russian state television, Lavrov said he saw no reason not to continue talks with Ukraine but insisted Moscow would not halt its military operation when the sides convene again. Russia is probably looking to “double or perhaps treble” the number of troops they have in Donbas in eastern Ukraine, a western official said. Meanwhile, a senior US defence official said the US believes Russia has started reinforcing its troops in Donbas. The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, held “direct, open and tough” talks with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow today. In a statement, Nehammer – the first EU leader to meet with Putin since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine – was quoted as saying that it was “not a friendly meeting”. Russia’s defence ministry claimed it has destroyed a S-300 anti-aircraft missile system near Dnipro which had been supplied to Ukraine by an unspecified European country. The claim has been described as disinformation by Slovakia’s prime minister, Eduard Heger, whose country donated an S-300 system last week. The UK’s Ministry of Defence warned that Russia’s past use of phosphorus munitions in Donetsk “raised the possibility of their future employment in Mariupol as fighting for the city intensifies”. Ukrainian forces were still holding out in the port of Mariupol, Ukraine’s military commander-in-chief, Gen Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said. In a statement on Facebook, Zaluzhnyi said: Communication with the units of the defence forces heroically holding the city is stable and maintained. We are doing the possible and impossible for the victory and the preservation of the lives of personnel and civilians in all directions. Believe in the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Ukraine is preparing for a new Russian mass assault on eastern territory, which Russia now says is its main objective, Reuters reports. If Mariupol falls after nearly seven weeks of siege, it would be the first major city captured by Russia since its troops invaded Ukraine. Russian forces advancing from Crimea would be able to link up with forces from the east and focus their attention on encircling Ukraine’s main force in the area. The US believes Russia has started reinforcing its troops in Donbas in eastern Ukraine, a senior US defence official said. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the US did not believe this was the start of a new offensive in the region. Meanwhile, a western official said Russia is probably looking to “double or perhaps treble” the number of troops they have in Donbas, but that it would take “some considerable time” for Russia to reach that force level. The official said: The Russians have shown themselves to be not very effective in this invasion as to being able to use their numerical advantage effectively to actually bring about a decisive engagement. From our Dan Sabbagh: Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, held “direct, open and tough” talks with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow today, Reuters reports. In a statement, Nehammer – the first EU leader to meet with Putin since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine – was quoted as saying: This is not a friendly meeting. Nehammer said his most important message to the Russian leader was that the war must end because “in a war there are only losers on both sides”. A spokesperson for Nehammer said the meeting went ahead at Putin’s official Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow. Austrian media said it had ended after about 90 minutes. Austrian foreign minister, Alexander Schallenberg, said earlier today that the chancellor would tell Putin that he “is isolating Russia, that he will lose this war morally, and that he is doing everything wrong that can be done wrong”. Schallenberg added that the trip was aimed at pleading for humanitarian corridors to be set up to alleviate the “hell” the campaign had caused in Ukraine. He said: The corridors would be to evacuate civilians trapped in places such as the city of Mariupol, and for “international humanitarian organisations to be able to conduct their work While Austria generally maintains closer ties to Moscow than many other EU countries, that has not been the case recently. Nehammer has expressed solidarity with Ukraine over the Russian invasion and denounced apparent Russian war crimes there. His government has also joined other EU countries in expelling Russian diplomats from Vienna. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, met with his Lithuanian counterpart, Ingrida Šimonytė, amid a backdrop of bombed-out apartment buildings and rubble in Borodianka, a town in the Kyiv region. The two prime ministers tweeted about the visit, while Šimonytė said “no words could possibly describe what I saw and felt here”. Last week, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the situation in Borodianka was “much worse” than 15 miles (24km) away in Bucha. In a video posted on Telegram, Zelenskiy said: The work to clear the rubble in Borodianka has begun … it’s significantly more dreadful there. Even more victims from the Russian occupiers. North Korea’s foreign affairs minister has denounced Russia’s suspension from the United Nations human rights council, calling it an “unreasonable act” led by the US and the west to maintain political hegemony, Reuters reports. At a meeting of the UN general assembly on Thursday, 93 members voted in favour of the diplomatic rebuke while 24 were against and 58 abstained. North Korea, Russia, China, Cuba, Iran, Syria and Vietnam were among those who voted against the resolution. The US’s UN ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, had launched the resolution to suspend Russia from the council as the world was still recoiling from images of mass graves and corpses strewn in the streets of Bucha following Russian soldiers’ retreat. In a statement reported by the North Korean state news agency, KCNA, the minister said: What the US is after ... is to isolate the independent countries, and forces challenging them at the international arena, so as to maintain its illegal and inhumane US-led hegemonic order. The minister, who was not named, added that international organisations should not be “abused” as a means for the United States to put political pressure on countries, the agency said. Russia claims to have destroyed several air defence systems in Ukraine over the weekend, the Associated Press reports, saying it appears to indicate a renewed push to gain air superiority and take out weapons Kyiv has described as crucial ahead of a broad new offensive in the east. Moscow claims to have hit four S-300 missile launchers provided by a European country it didn’t name on Monday. Slovakia gave Ukraine such a system last week, but denies it has been destroyed. Russia has previously reported two strikes on similar systems in other places. Moscow’s initial invasion has stalled on several fronts as it has met with stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces, who have prevented the Russians from taking the capital and other cities. The failure to win full control of Ukraine’s skies has hampered Moscow’s ability to provide air cover for troops on the ground, limiting their advances and likely exposing them to greater losses. With their offensive in many parts of the country thwarted, Russian forces have relied increasingly on bombarding cities. The war has flattened many urban areas, killed thousands of people and left Russia politically and economically isolated. Ukrainian authorities accuse Russian forces of committing atrocities, including a massacre in the town of Bucha, outside Kyiv, airstrikes on hospitals and a missile attack that killed at least 57 people at a train station. Italy has seized properties worth about €105m (£87.79m, $114.45m) owned by the Russian former Formula One driver Nikita Dmitrievich Mazepin and his oligarch father, Reuters reports, citing two police sources. The operation reportedly targeted a villa – known as Rocky Ram – in northern Sardinia. It is part of broader efforts aimed at penalising wealthy Russians linked to Vladimir Putin after the 24 February invasion of Ukraine by Moscow. Reuters says the driver’s PR manager has not yet commented. Mazepin – who was fired in March by the US-owned F1 team Haas – has been included in an EU sanctions list along with his father, Dmitry, who the European Union’s official journal described as a member of Putin’s closest circle. In recent weeks, Italian police have sequestered villas and yachts worth more than €900m from wealthy Russians who were placed on a European Union sanctions list following the Ukraine conflict. The most valuable asset seized so far is a superyacht owned by billionaire Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko, worth around €530m, which was impounded in the northern port of Trieste. Moscow will not pause its military operation in Ukraine before the next round of peace talks, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Speaking in an interview with Russian state television, Lavrov said Vladimir Putin had ordered military actions to be suspended during the first round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, Reuters reports. Moscow’s position had changed since then, he said. Lavrov said he saw no reason not to continue talks with Ukraine but insisted Moscow would not halt its military operation when the sides convene again. Lavrov said: After we became convinced that the Ukrainians were not planning to reciprocate, a decision was made that during the next rounds of talks, there would be no pause so long as a final agreement is not reached. The Russian FM last week accused Kyiv of presenting Moscow with an “unacceptable” draft peace deal that deviated from agreements the sides had previously reached. Kyiv dismissed Lavrov’s comments as a tactic to undermine Ukraine or divert attention from war crime accusations against Russian troops. Also in the interview aired today, Lavrov said that calls by the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, for the bloc to continue arming Kyiv marked a “very serious U-turn” in European policy. Croatia has expelled 24 Russian embassy staff over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and “brutal aggression”, the Croatian foreign ministry said. In a statement, the ministry said the Russian ambassador was summoned in a protest over the “brutal aggression on Ukraine and numerous crimes committed (there)“. It said: The Russian party was informed about the reduction of administrative-technical staff of the Russian Federation’s embassy in Zagreb. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, travelled by car, helicopter, military plane and train for his surprise visit to Kyiv on Saturday, Downing Street said. On his arrival in the Ukrainian capital, Johnson held talks with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for an hour, before they both went for a walk through the city including to Independence Square. The two leaders returned for a full bilateral meeting over a dinner with their small teams, No 10 said. From Times Radio’s Lucy Fisher: Here’s more from Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s address to the South Korean parliament earlier today, where he asked Seoul for any military aid it could provide just days after South Korea denied the request. Speaking in a video address, Zelenskiy told South Korean lawmakers that “Ukraine needs support for its military, including planes and tanks”, adding: South Korea can help Ukraine. South Korea has various defence systems that could defend against Russian tanks, ships, and missiles. We would be grateful if South Korea could help us to fight Russia. If Ukraine can have these weapons, they will not only save the lives of ordinary people, but they’ll save Ukraine. Tens of thousands of people have likely been killed in Russia’s assault on the south-eastern city of Mariupol, he also said. Earlier on Monday, South Korea’s defence ministry said it had rejected a request by the Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, for anti-aircraft weapons, Reuters reports. In a phone call on Friday, South Korea’s defence minister, Suh Wook, told Reznikov that any support of lethal weapons would be limited in light of South Korea’s security situation and its potential impact on military readiness, a ministry spokesperson said. South Korea has consistently said it would not provide lethal weapons or deploy its military to support Ukraine. It has provided humanitarian assistance worth $10m (£7.68m) to Ukraine and pledged last week to send another $30m (£23m). It has also provided non-lethal items including bulletproof helmets, medical kits and medicines. Ukrainian forces say they are readying themselves for a “last battle” to control the besieged southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, AFP reports. In a statement on Facebook, the 36th marine brigade of the Ukrainian armed forces said: Today will probably be the last battle, as the ammunition is running out. After defending the port for 47 days and doing “everything possible and impossible” to retain control of the city, the marines said it had been “pushed back” and “surrounded” by the Russian army, adding: It’s death for some of us, and captivity for the rest. Russian forces have said fighting has recently centred around Mariupol’s Azovstal iron and steel works and in the port. The marines said that is where “the enemy gradually pushed us back” and “surrounded us with fire, and is now trying to destroy us”. The mountain of wounded makes up almost half of the brigade. Those whose limbs are not torn off return to battle. The infantry was all killed and the shooting battles are now conducted by artillerymen, anti-aircraft gunners, radio operators, drivers and cooks. Even the orchestra. It complained that there was a lack of support from Ukraine’s military leadership “because we’ve been written off”. The south-eastern city of Mariupol has seen the most intense fighting since Russia launched its assault on Ukraine. Earlier today, the Ukraininan president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said tens of thousands of people had likely been killed in the city. Zelenskiy told the South Korean parliament via video link: Mariupol has been destroyed, there are tens of thousands of dead, but even despite this, the Russians are not stopping their offensive. German newspaper Die Welt has hired as a correspondent Marina Ovsyannikova, the Russian journalist who broke on to a live news broadcast on Russian state television in protest against the Ukraine war, its owner Axel Springer said. Ovsyannikova, 43, will report for the newspaper as well as for Die Welt’s TV news channel, including from Ukraine and Russia, Springer said. The former editor at Russia’s state Channel One “defended the most important journalistic ethics despite the threat of state repression” with her on-air protest, Welt Group editor-in-chief Ulf Poschardt said in a statement. Ovsyannikova was fined 30,000 roubles (£215) for violating protest laws after her extraordinary demonstration against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month. Ovsyannikova burst on to the set of the live broadcast of the nightly news, shouting: “Stop the war. No to war.” She also held a sign saying: “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” It was signed in English: “Russians against the war.” She also released a pre-recorded video in which she expressed her shame at working for Channel One and spreading “Kremlin propaganda”. More than 20% of Russian soldiers confirmed dead during the war in Ukraine are officers, including 10 colonels, 20 lieutenant colonels, 31 majors and 155 junior officers, the BBC reports. The BBC has been able to verify the identities of the 1,083 Russian servicemen killed in Ukraine, their deaths reported by local officials or Russian media. The BBC World correspondent Olga Ivshina said evidence showed: Russia has lost some of its best specialists, including elite spec. forces operators, highly skilled fighter pilots and some experienced commanders. In addition, about 15% of all confirmed Russian losses in Ukraine are paratroopers from units “which are considered elite of the Russian army”, she said. Preparation of a paratrooper in Russia demands more money and time compared to an infantryman. So these are sensitive losses. Hello from London, I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer is set to meet Vladimir Putin on Monday, the first European leader to meet the Russian president since Russia invaded Ukraine at the end of February. In a tweet, Nehammer said Austria was “militarily neutral” but that it had a “clear stance on Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine”. Russia’s defence ministry claims it has destroyed a S-300 anti-aircraft missile system near Dnipro which had been supplied to Ukraine by an unspecified European country. The claim has been described as disinformation by Slovakia’s prime minister Eduard Heger, whose country donated an S-300 system last week. In his nightly address to the nation on Sunday night, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of having “lost connection with reality to a degree that they accuse us of committing what Russian troops have obviously done”. Tens of thousands of people have likely been killed in Russia’s assault on the south-eastern city of Mariupol, and over 300 Ukrainian hospitals have been destroyed, Zelenskiy told the South Korean parliament. Russia is likely to continue strikes on transport infrastructure “in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of hostilities”, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces has said in its latest operational report. In its latest intelligence update on Ukraine, the UK’s Ministry of Defence warns that Russia’s past use of phosphorus munitions in Donetsk “raised the possibility of their future employment in Mariupol as fighting for the city intensifies”. Pro-Russian forces in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic have said they will intensify their fight in eastern Ukraine. Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Russia’s republic of Chechnya, has said there will be an offensive by Russian forces not only on Mariupol, but also on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock says Germany has seen massive indications of war crimes in Ukraine. Norway is to extend its deployment of 200 troops in Lithuania until August. Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, has said the European Commission was working on details of an oil embargo on Russia as part of a possible next sanctions package France’s ambassador to Ukraine, Etienne de Poncins, has posted a picture from Lviv showing teams of forensic gendarmes that have arrived from France to assist local authorities in investigating war crimes. New Zealand will send a C-130H Hercules and 50-person team to Europe to distribute military aid to Ukraine against Russia’s invasion. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for today. I am handing you over to Léonie Chao-Fong. Pro-Russian forces in Donetsk have said they will intensify their fight in eastern Ukraine. Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, is quoted by the RIA news agency as saying: Now the operation will be intensified. The more we delay, the more the civilian population simply suffers, being held hostage by the situation. We have identified areas where certain steps need to be accelerated. Tens of thousands of people have likely been killed in Russia’s assault on the south-eastern city of Mariupol, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the South Korean parliament this morning. “Mariupol has been destroyed, there are tens of thousands of dead, but even despite this, the Russians are not stopping their offensive,” Reuters quotes him saying in a video address this morning. Other key lines from his address include Zelenskiy saying: Russia threatens Europe, not just Ukraine, and will not stop unless it is forced to stop. Russia has destroyed hundreds of pieces of Ukraine’s key infrastructure including at least 300 hospitals. Tens of thousands of Russian soldiers are being amassed for the next offensive. Ukraine needs more help if it is to survive the war. German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock says Germany has seen massive indications of war crimes in Ukraine. “We have massive indications of war crimes,” Reuters report she told reporters before a meeting with fellow European ministers in Luxembourg. “In the end, the courts will have to decide, but for us, it is central to secure all evidence.” “As the German federal government, we have already made it clear that there will be a complete phase-out of fossil fuels, starting with coal, then oil and gas, and so that this can be implemented jointly in the European Union, we need a joint, coordinated plan to completely phase out fossil fuels to be able to withdraw as a European Union,” she added. Norway is to extend its deployment of 200 troops in Lithuania until August, according to a statement from the Norway defence ministry, Reuters reports. France’s ambassador to Ukraine, Etienne de Poncins, has posted a picture from Lviv showing teams that have arrived from France to assist local authorities in investigating war crimes. He tweeted: Proud to welcome to Lviv the detachment of technical and scientific gendarmes who came to assist their Ukrainian comrades in the investigations of war crimes committed around Kiev. France the first to provide such help. They will be at work tomorrow. Solidarity. Russia’s defence ministry claims it has destroyed S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems which had been supplied to Ukraine by a European country. Reuters reports the ministry said that Russian sea-launched Kalibr missiles on Sunday destroyed four S-300 launchers which were concealed in a hangar on the outskirts of the Ukrainian city of Dnipro to the east of the country Russia said 25 Ukrainian troops were hit in the attack. The claims have not been independently verified. Russia did not say which European country had supplied the S-300 systems, however we know that Slovakia announced it had donated the system on Friday. Russia’s claim has been dismissed overnight by Slovakia’s prime minister Eduard Heger. Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, has said the European Commission was working on details of an oil embargo on Russia as part of a possible next sanctions package, but that nothing has been decided. He said he hoped it could be agreed by the EU’s 27 states as soon as possible but Reuters reports he gave no further details. Sean Ingle writes for us this morning on the impact that the war is having on sport, and the conundrum facing sporting authorities over how to handle Russian and Ukrainian athletes: Last week it emerged that Wimbledon was ready to ban the world No 2 Daniil Medvedev over fears that his victory “could boost the Putin regime”. Previously the UK sports minister Nigel Huddleston had also suggested Medvedev and other Russians would have to give assurances they are not supporters of Putin to play. But if you are a classical liberal, this demand might also make you a little queasy. Why, after all, should the sins of a country’s dictator lead to a sports star being punished? It feels like a violation of the laws of natural justice, especially when that player deliberately stays out of politics. I was making this point to a chess insider when he interjected. Sport is torn down the middle on this, he said. But when you talk about natural justice, start by thinking about it from Ukraine’s side. Why, he asked, should any Ukrainian – who is very likely to have been personally affected by the war, with perhaps family or friends dying – be asked, potentially, to play someone from Russia when their country remains under attack? Even if you strip the personal and emotive arguments from the debate, there is also a practical question: how ready will Ukrainian athletes be for competition when so many have had to flee or fight? Read more of Sean Ingle’s piece here: Dilemma over Russian athletes threatens to tear sports down the middle More European Union sanctions on Russia are an option, the bloc’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said when asked if the EU was ready to consider a Russian oil embargo in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. “Sanctions are always on the table,” Reuters reports he told the media as he arrived for a meeting with EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg. “Ministers will discuss which are the further steps,” he said. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba is warning western politicians that they may be subject to disinformation campaigns from Russia over the imposition of sanctions and the supply of arms to Ukraine. He has tweeted: Russia knows arms supplies are essential for Ukraine and mobilizes all efforts to undermine them. Moscow prepared a massive info campaign targeting foreign media and politicians. Their troll factory may spam emails and flood comments with disinfo on Ukraine. Don’t fall for it. Michael C Ryan was director of European security at the US mission to Nato during the Obama administration. He has been interviewed on Sky News in the UK and had this to say about the prospects for the war in Ukraine: The Russians have clearly reassessed their objectives in the war and focused primarily on the east. Their major problem is that they have to reconstitute enough of what we refer to as combat power, the ability to fight effectively in the east, and then take on a very entrenched, very experienced Ukrainian force that has been preparing for them for a long time. So the next three weeks will be decisive. It will determine the outcome of the war. Asked about the appointment of Russian Gen Alexander Dvornikov to the war, he said: The Russians are medieval. They’re brutal. But they’re not stupid. And they’ve learned quite a lot about how the Ukrainians are fighting. So I believe the general will go back to classic Russian tactics. They’ll do massive air and artillery assaults on the Ukrainian positions, before they throw a lot of tanks and a lot of soldiers at them. Which is going to be a difficult proposition for them, because we just don’t assess that they have the energy to be able to carry off that sort of campaign. On where the situation leaves Russian president Vladimir Putin personally, he said: His personal endgame has to be stay in power … because he doesn’t have a lot of other options once he leaves government in Russia. He has to play to the domestic audience, which means he has to come out of this with a victory. Taking a land border, a land bridge, from the Donbas down towards the Black Sea, and enhancing the overall state of the Russians ability to claim that they’re supporting Russian speakers in Ukraine, I think will be enough of a victory for him. To consolidate his gains, achieve some level of sanctions relief through negotiation, and then wait out a few years and try again. Philip Oltermann is in Pabradė, Lithuania for us. Here he reports on Nato’s latest exercises there: About 30km west of the Belarusian border, the enemy’s tanks were rolling through the pine forests of Lithuania at speed until a makeshift obstacle made of barbed wire blocked their path. Soldiers carrying bolt cutters jumped out of the armoured vehicle at the front to clear the road. Then, a deafening bang. In its rush to victory, the advancing party had neglected to check the sandy terrain underneath the roadblock for mines. Luckily, for them, this was merely a dress rehearsal for a showdown between Russia and the North Atlantic alliance. No live explosives were used in Nato’s “Rising Griffin” manoeuvre at the Pabradė military base in eastern Lithuania. Instead, referees politely informed the tank commanders that their vehicles would have been ripped to shreds. The Russian enemy was being impersonated by American and Norwegian troops. The western defenders may have notched up a tactical victory against an eastern aggressor on this sunny April morning, yet Nato’s security architecture has never looked more fragile than in the spring of 2022, especially when viewed from Lithuania, a country long considered the alliance’s achilles heel. “Until last November, we had the Russian army quite far away from Nato’s borders,” said Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s foreign minister. “Now the military activity is very close. To add to that, Lithuania lies between the territory of Belarus and the territory of Kaliningrad. Which puts us in a strategic situation that is, let’s say, interesting.” Read more of Philip Oltermann’s report from Lithuania here: Nato’s ‘achilles heel’ – alliance conducts war games in nervous Lithuania In the UK, environment minister George Eustice has been interviewed on Sky News where he defended the UK’s record on accepting refugees from Ukraine. He said: Obviously, it’s different for countries that are bordering the Ukraine, because people fleeing a war like this obviously will cross the nearest land border. That’s why countries like Poland and Hungary obviously are getting more of those refugees coming in. But we have now issued visas under the two schemes. We’ve got, in particular, the sponsorship scheme to around 40,000 Ukrainians and around 12,000 of those are already here. We’ve made some changes, already making clear for instance, that those with a Ukrainian passport don’t need to attend an appointment in person. And I know that [interior minister] Priti Patel is looking very closely at whatever else can be done to remove any barriers. According to the latest figures from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the number of Ukrainians who have fled the country since Russia invaded again on 24 February is 4.5 million. This is Martin Belam here in London, taking over from Helen Livingstone. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com There have been no successful major prosecutions over the last 30 years in Ukraine, with the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general dogged by accusations of corruption and inefficiency since the country declared independence. Now Iryna Venediktova, appointed to the role in 2019, is attempting to gather evidence of Russian war crimes. More from Guardian correspondent Isobel Koshiw in Borodianka: Surrounded by a scrum of reporters with a backdrop of bombed-out apartment buildings and rubble in Borodianka, a town in the Kyiv region, stood Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor general. Venediktova is carrying the weight of bringing almost 2,000 cases of war crimes committed by Russia’s occupying forces to court at home and abroad. Her office is the only body in Ukraine with the power to investigate. It is through her office that information relating to war crimes is being collected, investigations will be conducted and domestic and international cases will be built. Reminiscent of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s trip to newly liberated territories outside Kyiv, Venediktova walked around Borodianka with her subordinates observing the damage, wearing an army flak jacket and baseball cap. “I watched while the bodies were exhumed in Bucha,” Venediktova, who was appointed in 2019, said, describing one of the mass graves in the neighbouring town of Bucha, which is being investigated as a war crime. Investigating war crimes is difficult. It involves teams of different experts who can collect and analyse physical, oral and open-source evidence that will stand up against the defence. International criminal law prosecutes individuals, not states, and so prosecutors must link the crime to the perpetrator. “Before the war, the majority of Ukrainians did not trust the state,” said Venediktova. “There were grounds for this: the other general prosecutors and the way they behaved.” The office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general has been dogged by accusations of corruption and inefficiency since the country declared independence. There have been almost no successful major prosecutions over the last 30 years, with the shooting of dozens of protesters in February 2014 in central Kyiv, the murder of two prominent Ukrainian journalists, the poisoning of Ukraine’s third president, and countless instances of state corruption and bribery all failing to result in convictions. Ukrainian NGOs, state workers and civilians involved in gathering evidence to build the cases hope that things will be different this time because of how the war has penetrated the entire society. But doubts remain over whether the war will change Ukraine’s infamously murky judicial system by itself or whether civil society will need to exert pressure. Read on below: Joe Biden is set to hold a virtual meeting with India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, on Monday, with the US president expected to press India not to increase its imports of Russian crude. “President Biden will continue our close consultations on the consequences of Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine and mitigating its destabilizing impact on global food supply and commodity markets,” the White House said in a statement. Lured by steep discounts following western sanctions on Russian entities, India has bought at least 13 million barrels of Russian crude oil since the country invaded Ukraine in late February. That compared with some 16 million barrels for the whole of last year, according to Reuters. Biden has previously accused India of being the only “somewhat shaky” country in the Quad group of nations – which also includes Japan and Australia – regarding Ukraine. It has not so far imposed any sanctions on Russia. In its latest intelligence update on Ukraine, the UK’s Ministry of Defence warns that Russia’ past use of phosphorus munitions in Donetsk “raised the possibility of their future employment in Mariupol as fighting for the city intensifies.” It also said Russian shelling had continued in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, “with Ukrainian forces repulsing several assaults resulting in the destruction of Russian tanks, vehicles and artillery equipment.” “Russia’s continued reliance on unguided bombs decreases their ability to discriminate when targeting and conducting strikes while greatly increasing the risk of further civilian casualties,” it said. Russian forces bombarded eastern Ukraine over the weekend ahead of an expected onslaught. In Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city, at least 10 civilians were killed including a child. New Zealand will send a C-130H Hercules and 50-person team to Europe to distribute military aid to Ukraine against Russia’s invasion. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced the deployment on Monday, along with $13 million in additional support, including $7.5m for weapons and ammunition procurement by the UK. “Our support is to assist the Ukraine Army to repel a brutal Russian invasion ... such a blatant attack on a country’s sovereignty is a threat to all of us,” Ardern said. “The global response has seen an unprecedented amount of military support pledged for Ukraine, and more help to transport and distribute it is urgently needed, and so we will do our bit to help.” The aircraft would “join a chain of military aircraft from partner nations, travelling throughout Europe carrying much-needed equipment and supplies to key distribution centres, but at no point will they enter Ukraine, nor have they been asked to,” the prime minister’s office said in a statement. Ramzan Kadyrov, the powerful head of Russia’s republic of Chechnya, has said there will be an offensive by Russian forces not only on the besieged port of Mariupol, but also on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, Reuters reported earlier. “There will be an offensive ... not only on Mariupol, but also on other places, cities and villages,” Kadyrov said in a video posted on his Telegram channel. “Luhansk and Donetsk – we will fully liberate in the first place ... and then take Kyiv and all other cities.” Kadyrov, who has often described himself as Russian president Vladimir Putin’s “foot soldier”, said there should be no doubt about Kyiv. “I assure you: not one step will be taken back,” Kadyrov said. Kadyrov has been repeatedly accused by the United States and European Union of rights abuses, which he denies. He announced he was in Ukraine alongside invading Russian forces in mid-March. Russia is likely to continue strikes on transport infrastructure “in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of hostilities”, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces has said in its latest operational report. It also said it was “possible” that Russian forces would carry out “provocative actions” in the Transnistrian region of Moldova “in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighbouring state”. In Mariupol, Russian forces were continuing attacks on the port in the southwest and the Azovstal steel plant in the east, where Ukrainian defenders have reportedly been left isolated after Russian forces bisected the besieged city. In his nightly address to the nation on Sunday night, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of having “lost connection with reality to a degree that they accuse us of committing what Russian troops have obviously done”. They say about the murders in Bucha that it is not them, but allegedly us. Although it is obvious to everyone that people were killed while the Russian army controlled the city. They say about the missile strike at Kramatorsk that it is not them, but allegedly us. Although it was their propagandists who announced this strike. Although missiles flew from the territory under their control. And about any of our destroyed cities, about any of our burned villages, they say the same thing, that it is not them either, but allegedly us ... Do you know why this is so? Because it’s cowardice.” He said Russian leaders were “afraid to admit that for decades they have been placing erroneous bets and spending enormous resources in support of absolute nobodies who they thought would be the future heroes of Ukrainian-Russian friendship. And these nobodies were skilful at only one thing – taking money out of Russia into their own pockets.” In the coming week, he said Russia was preparing to launch “even larger operations” in Ukraine’s east. They can use even more missiles against us, even more air bombs. But we are preparing for their actions. We will respond. We will be even more active in providing Ukraine with weapons. We will be more active in the international arena. We will be even more active in the information field. He also said he was grateful for the recent change in Germany’s position towards the conflict. I spoke today with Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz. About how to bring to justice all those guilty of war crimes. How to strengthen sanctions against Russia and how to force Russia to seek peace. I am glad to note that the German position has recently changed in favor of Ukraine. I consider it absolutely logical. Because this course is supported by the majority of the German people. And I am grateful to them. But I expect that everything we agreed on will be implemented. And this is very important,” Zelenskiy said. Germany has been under pressure to wean itself off Russian energy and had also been criticised earlier in the war for its failure to supply weapons to Ukraine, a policy which has since been reversed. At the end of last week, Scholz said his country would stop using Russian coal by the middle of this year and Russian oil by the end of the year. Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer is set to meet Vladimir Putin on Monday, the first European leader to meet the Russian president since Russia invaded Ukraine at the end of February. In a tweet, Nehammer said Austria was “militarily neutral” but that it had a “clear stance on Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine”. “It must stop! We need humanitarian corridors, a ceasefire and a complete investigation of war crimes.” According to the news agency AFP, Nehammer plans to address alleged war crimes that took place in Bucha, outside Kyiv, during the visit. The Austrian chancellor organised the meeting during a recent visit to Ukraine, a spokesperson said, adding that Nehammer wants “to do everything so that progress towards peace can be made” even if the chances are minimal. On a visit to Ukraine this weekend, Nehammer toured Bucha, where mass civilian graves and street killings by Russian forces were discovered last week. Hello, this is Helen Livingstone bringing you the latest updates from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Here’s a roundup of the latest developments: Karl Nehammer, the Austrian chancellor, plans to speak about alleged war crimes in Bucha during his visit to meet Putin on Monday. Nehammer will be the first European leader to meet the Russian president since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Vladimir Putin has appointed a new general to direct the war in Ukraine as his military shifts plans after a failure to take Kyiv. Alexander Dvornikov gained prominence while leading the Russian group of forces in Syria. The general is likely to usher in a fresh round of “crimes and brutality” against civilians, the US said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy hit back against Russian propaganda on war crimes, the invasion of Crimea and the downing of MH17, saying: “They say about the murders in Bucha that it is not them, but allegedly us, although it is obvious to everyone that people were killed while the Russian army controlled the city … The Russian militaries have already lied to the fact that even after more than six weeks of war, they claim that they did not hit any of the civilian objects. Do you know why this is so? Because it’s cowardice.” Zelenskiy welcomed talks with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, on war crimes and sanctions against Russia, adding: “I am glad to note that the German position has recently changed in favour of Ukraine.” Germany has been under pressure to wean itself off Russian energy and had also been criticised earlier in the war for its failure to supply weapons to Ukraine, a policy that has since been reversed. Russian forces pounded eastern Ukraine with heavy shelling over the weekend, killing 10 civilians, including a child and wounding 11 others around Kharkiv. The airport in the east-central Ukrainian city of Dnipro was also destroyed. Joe Biden is set to hold a virtual meeting with India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, on Monday, with the US president expected to press India not to increase its imports of Russian crude. Biden has previously accused India of being the only “somewhat shaky” country in the Quad group of nations – which also includes Japan and Australia – regarding Ukraine. It has not so far imposed any sanctions on Russia. Ukraine carried out the first staff rotation at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in three weeks, the country told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Sunday. Russian troops left the power station north of Kyiv earlier this month but the site’s analytical laboratories for radiation monitoring were “destroyed and the analytical instruments stolen, broken or otherwise disabled”, Ukraine told the IAEA. Ramzan Kadyrov, the powerful head of Russia’s republic of Chechnya, has said that there will be an offensive by Russian forces not only on the besieged port of Mariupol, but also on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. Kadyrov, who has descrived himself as Putin’s “foot soldier”, said there should be no doubt about Kyiv: “I assure you: not one step will be taken back.” Nearly 3,000 people were evacuated on Sunday through humanitarian corridors, including 213 from Mariupol, said Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk. Pope Francis has called for an Easter ceasefire to allow for a push for peace in Ukraine, calling the war a “folly” that was leading to “heinous massacres” and “atrocious cruelty” against defenceless people. A total of 1,222 bodies have been found in the region around the capital, Kyiv, so far, Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said. Ukrainian authorities are investigating 5,600 cases of alleged war crimes committed by Russian troops since the invasion began. Ukraine’s economy is expected to collapse by 45.1% this year, far worse than predicted, the World Bank reported in a dire forecast as the conflict drags on. The United Nations refugee agency calculates that more than 4.5 million Ukrainian refugees have fled Ukraine since the invasion began. Russian armed forces are seeking to strengthen troop numbers with personnel discharged from military service a decade ago, as losses mount. The White House has renewed its condemnation of the Russian targeting of Ukrainian civilians as war crimes, citing recent events including Friday’s missile strike on a railway station as “cruel and criminal and evil”. The death toll from Kramatorsk train station attack has risen to 57, Ukraine said. More than 3,500 pro-Ukrainian demonstrators took to the streets of Germany in response to a motorcade of about 600 pro-Russian protesters in 400 cars flying Russian flags."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/26/the-guardian-view-on-tidal-energy-cost-is-not-the-whole-story","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T17:43:16Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on tidal energy: cost is not the whole story | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/26/the-guardian-view-on-tidal-energy-cost-is-not-the-whole-story","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/26/the-guardian-view-on-tidal-energy-cost-is-not-the-whole-story","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on tidal energy: cost is not the whole story","bodyText":"The UK government’s decision to shelve plans to build the world’s first tidal lagoon off Swansea Bay is a hard blow for Wales. That it comes in the wake of Airbus’s warning that 6,000 jobs at its Broughton factory in Flintshire are being put at risk by continuing uncertainty over Brexit, and on the same day that the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders sounded the alarm over the future of car building in the UK, only serves to increase the pain. Ford employs 1,700 people at its Bridgend plant, while a new Aston Martin factory is due to open in south Wales next year. The tidal lagoon project, had it gone ahead, was expected to create 2,200 jobs, plus more in the supply chain. These are the kinds of jobs that Wales, so damaged by steel and coal closures, needs. But the business secretary, Greg Clark, has decided the country can’t have them because they would be too expensive. It’s true that tidal lagoon power is costly at the moment. The so-called strike price that the government would have to agree for Swansea’s electricity, to get the project off the ground, lay between £92.70 and £150 per megawatt hour (MWh), with the difference accounted for by a Welsh government subsidy, and the duration of the contract. While the UK government’s rejection of the scheme – on which the company says it has spent £35m – was based on the higher figure of £150 over 30 years, the company said that, given a longer contract of 60 years, it could supply electricity at £92.70, the same as Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, the government’s flagship energy project in Somerset (Hinkley Point’s strike price is fixed for 35 years). The Welsh government said that its offer of a £200m subsidy made the Swansea project – meant to be the first of six British tidal lagoons, four of them in Wales – competitive with Hinkley even on a similar time span. Welsh politicians have reacted with understandable fury to Mr Clark’s announcement, which comes almost exactly 12 months after the government abandoned plans to electrify the railway from Cardiff to Swansea, and just a day after MPs voted to press ahead with another expensive infrastructure project: a third runway at Heathrow. There are some rational reasons to approve of this week’s decision, while regretting its consequences. No one, including the Tidal Lagoon Power company, denied that the electricity produced off the Welsh coast would have cost more than the cheapest renewables. The most recent government auctions saw offshore wind schemes win contracts at record lows of £57.50 per megawatt hour, meaning they are within a few pounds of being subsidy-free. But cost is not the only consideration. Otherwise, the government would never have gone ahead with the hugely expensive, risky and uncertain Hinkley Point C. Nor would it have cut subsidies for solar power and onshore wind, as it did in 2015. Those decisions – particularly the promise to curb onshore wind, as the Conservatives did in their 2015 manifesto, despite poll after poll showing that a majority of the public prefers wind and solar to nuclear – were ideological. In a City speech this March, Mr Clark praised business for putting “evidence before ideology”. It is welcome that the secretary of state says this is his own approach. Too many of his Conservative colleagues remain too strongly attached to fossil fuels, including the prospect of a whole new shale gas industry. As the price of renewables continues to fall, they will surely lose the argument. With Mr Clark in charge, the hope is that onshore wind and solar subsidies may soon return – though too late for UK companies that could have developed and profited from the technology had we not given up on it long before the renewables boom. Yet the government is planning more nuclear power stations, including one in Wales. Different rules seem to apply for different technologies. It looks like a Tory government in Westminster snubbed Welsh Labour’s pet project. Backers of the tidal project felt shut out by ministers. Wave energy lobbyists perhaps don’t have the firepower in Whitehall that others can muster. Mr Clark might have relied on the evidence to make a tough call not to back a new, green technology. But it’s hard to shake off the impression that the decision was one rooted in the partisan politics of self-interest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/10/deterring-onshore-windfarms-means-higher-energy-bills-lord-deben","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-10T12:31:12Z","webTitle":"Deterring onshore windfarms means higher energy bills – Lord Deben","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/10/deterring-onshore-windfarms-means-higher-energy-bills-lord-deben","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/10/deterring-onshore-windfarms-means-higher-energy-bills-lord-deben","fields":{"headline":"Opposing onshore UK windfarms 'means higher energy bills'","bodyText":"Ministers must come clean to households about the higher energy bills they face if the UK continues to deter new onshore windfarms, the government’s top climate change adviser has said. Lord Deben, the chair of the committee on climate change (CCC), said there was no logical argument against onshore wind turbines in the parts of the UK that want them. The Conservative peer said the technology was the cheapest form of electricity generation and he hoped the government would rethink its opposition to subsidies to it. The government ended subsidies for the windfarms in 2015 but the energy minister Claire Perry has recently said she is “looking carefully” at a U-turn for windfarms built in Wales and Scotland. Last week, the government gave its backing to windfarms on remote islands, such as the Isle of Lewis. Deben told the Guardian: “There is no doubt, and I feel very strongly about it, that onshore wind is the cheapest form of electricity. If the Scots want to have it, on which basis should we say they shouldn’t have it?” Advocates believe onshore windfarms could be built for subsidies guaranteeing prices as low as £50 per megawatt hour – below the average £62.14 awarded to the latest offshore windfarms and far lower than the £92.50 for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. The payments are a top-up on the wholesale electricity price of around £45/MWh, with the difference paid by householders through their energy bills. Hinkley alone is expected to add £10-15 to annual bills by 2030. “If you don’t build onshore wind, the government has to say how much of an extra cost this is to the public,” said Deben. The CCC advises the government on how to meet its legally binding climate targets. Deben, who as the Conservative MP John Gummer was the environment secretary from 1993 and 1997, added that the government has to make “major changes” to meet its carbon targets for 2025 and 2030, implying that a shift on onshore wind could be one of those. Big British, German and Spanish energy companies have been lobbying the government for a shift on onshore wind. Keith Anderson, the chief executive of ScottishPower, said it was “completely bonkers” that the windfarms were ineligible for subsidies, given they were low cost and low carbon. “2018 has to be the year we secure the future of onshore wind,” he told a recent industry event. Millions of households have seen their energy bills rise in the past few weeks. All of the big six suppliers have increased their prices, blaming government policy costs such as the clean energy subsidies, along with rising wholesale costs. Deben also issued a challenge to housebuilders to make new homes more efficient, saying they had to face up to the “social inequity” of future generations facing unnecessarily high energy bills. “Energy efficiency is a social issue. No house should be built to condemn people in the future to having to pay a great deal for their energy,” he said. He backed better enforcement of building regulations, saying local authorities did not have the resources to check new homes properly. The peer also called on mortgage lenders to begin tying the energy efficiency of properties to the amount buyers can borrow, an idea being given a trial in Wales. His comments were echoed this week by the CCC’s chief executive, Chris Stark, who tweeted that it was “daft that we don’t give greater priority to household energy efficiency”. Deben still feels new nuclear power is needed as part of the UK’s efforts to cut carbon emissions. However, he said new technology and the falling costs of renewables meant the challenge of ensuring energy security was not as great as in the past. “The government has got to recognise that keeping the lights on, which is its first worry, is much easier than thought because you can get a huge amount of energy from offshore wind, smart grids and short-term battery storage.” A spokesperson at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: “The government does not believe that new large-scale onshore wind power is right for England but it could be right for other areas, where local public support exists.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2020/sep/30/shell-9000-job-losses-uk-house-prices-stock-markets-lagarde-haldane-covid-19-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-09-30T14:08:57Z","webTitle":"Bank of England's Haldane blasts 'Chicken Licken' pessimism; US payroll growth swells – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/sep/30/shell-9000-job-losses-uk-house-prices-stock-markets-lagarde-haldane-covid-19-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2020/sep/30/shell-9000-job-losses-uk-house-prices-stock-markets-lagarde-haldane-covid-19-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Bank of England's Haldane blasts 'Chicken Licken' pessimism; US payroll growth swells – as it happened","bodyText":"Time for a quick recap. The Bank of England’s top economist has warned that pessimism about the UK recovery could hurt growth. Andy Haldane hit out at ‘Chicken Licken’ pessimism, arguing that Covid-19 restrictions, rising unemployment and Brexit were all less serious threats than doomsters suggest. Haldane declared: If the economy were sat on a psychiatrist’s sofa, the diagnosis would not be especially difficult. A propensity to dismiss good news and dwell on bad? To catastrophize about the future? The sense of events being beyond our control? These are the psychological symptoms of anxiety. And collective anxiety is as contagious, and could be as damaging to our well-being, as this terrible disease. Averting an economic anxiety attack calls for a balanced and flexible approach to the words and actions of businesses and policymakers. Planning for the worst is important, but needs to be accompanied by hope for the best. Encouraging news about the present needs not to be drowned out by fears for the future. Now is not the time for the economics of Chicken Licken. Haldane also argued against cutting UK interest rate below zero, arguing that negative interest rates can’t currently be justified. But...a swathe of job cuts show that the economy is still bruised from the pandemic. Royal Dutch Shell is slashing up to 9,000 positions over the next couple of years, as it tries to cut costs and move towards low-carbon energy sources. UK bank TSB is cutting around 900 jobs, as part of a branch closure plan. It’s also been a busy day for takeover news, with American gambling firm swooping on William Hill....and Canadian security group GardaWorld launching a hostile bid for rival G4S. On the economic front, more jobs were created in America this month than expected. Private payrolls rose by almost 750,ooo in September, according to ADP. UK house prices have also hit a new high, rising by 5% in the last 12 months. Stocks have risen on Wall Street, as investors are cheered by the rise in US payrolls. London’s stock market has turned positive too, with the FTSE 100 now up 14 points or 0.2%. Growth in the Chicago region has also accelerated faster than expected, according to the latest survey of purchasing managers in the region: Wall Street has confounded expectations of a post-debate selloff. Stocks have risen as the start of trading in New York, following the stronger-than-expected ADP payroll report. There may also be some relief that the US economy contracted very slightly less than first feared in the April-June quarter (by an annual rate of -31.4%, not -31.7%) The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 213 points, or 0.8%, to 27,666 points, while the tech-focused Nasdaq is up a more muted 0.3%, or 34 points, to 11,119. Investors are also digesting last night’s clash between Donald Trump and Joe Biden (or possibly try to erase the horror from their memories). Chris Beauchamp of IG says the early polling suggests Joe Biden may have come out of the clash best: “With less than five-weeks left until the election, we are seeing a president that increasingly speaks of voter fraud which appears to show a candidate laying the groundwork for defeat. “From a market perspective, while Biden is likely to be more than willing to spend freely in a bid to reduce inequalities, there is also a worry that he will be significantly less business and investor friendly. Reuters is reporting that Marathon Petroleum Corp, the largest U.S. oil refiner, began cutting jobs on Tuesday across the company. This follows a slump in demand for motor fuels during the pandemic, and adds to today’s job loss tally (which undermine the positive news on the ADP payroll report). Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics is cautious about reading too much into today’s ADP jobs report: The 749,000 rise in the ADP measure of private employment in September supports our forecast that the official non-farm payrolls figures, due on Friday, will show an 800,000 gain. But, in truth, the ADP figures have been a particularly poor guide to the BLS data in recent months. The ADP data suggest that employment growth actually strengthened this month, with the reported gain in September much stronger than the 481,000 rise in August. But the latter was well short of the 1.4m rise in the official BLS figures, so we are wary of reading too much into that apparent improvement. Otherwise, the details of the ADP report were a mixed bag, with a further slowdown in the pace of recovery in the leisure &amp; hospitality and professional &amp; business services sectors offset by a much stronger gain in manufacturing and construction payrolls. Snap reaction to the ADP jobs report: Here’s where the US economy added jobs this month, according to ADP’s new payroll report: Trade, Transportation &amp; Utilities: 186,000 net new hires Information: 17,000 Financial Activities: 29,000 Professional &amp; Business: 78,000 Education &amp; Health: 90,000 Leisure &amp; Hospitality: 92,000 Other Services: 60,000 And in production: Natural Resources &amp; Mining: 7,000 Construction: 60,000 Manufacturing: 130,000 Newsflash: US companies created nearly three quarters of a million jobs this month, as the labor market recovery continued. That’s according to ADP, the payroll operator. It reports that private sector employment in America rose by 749,000 during September, up from an 481,000 in August. Employment gains were made across the US economy, ADP say. Small firms took on 192,000 more employees, while mid-sized firms (from 50 to 499 workers) hired 259,000. Large employers recruited 297,000 more staff. ADP also reports that service sector companies hired 552,000 more workers, while goods producers added 196,000 to their payrolls. That’s a stronger reading than expected - economists had forecast around 600,000 new jobs this month. August’s figure has been revised up too, from 428,000. This may be a sign that Friday’s non-farm payroll - the US government’s official jobs report - will be solid. Although, ADP and the NFP haven’t been closely correlated recently, so we’ll find out in 48 hours..... Economic anxiety has pushed the oil price down to a two-week low today. Brent crude has dropped by 1.6% to $40.40 per barrel, heading towards the three-month lows recorded in mid-September. Fears about weak demand are weighing on crude prices - a reminder of why Shell is making such deep job cuts. Adam Vettese, analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro, says: “Even before this crisis, conditions were incredibly tough for the big exploration firms, due to incessantly low oil prices. This pandemic has just magnified their problems. “The issue they have now – and it is a major one – is that the demand for their product is still desperately low. While there is more traffic on the roads now than there was a few months ago, the airline industry, a key market for oil producers, is still virtually grounded. “Most major airlines are now predicting that it will be at least two to three years before passenger numbers reach their pre-Covid-19 levels, which will have a negative knock-on effect for oil demand and therefore British oil producers such as Shell and BP.” In another takeover development... Italian confectionery giant Ferrero Group is plotting a £250m takeover of Fox’s Biscuits, according to Sky News. They say: Ferrero, the family-controlled dynasty behind Kinder chocolate and Nutella, is working with advisers on a bid for Fox’s. The biscuit-maker’s current owner, 2 Sisters Food Group (2SFG), has asked for offers to be submitted this week, according to insiders. Other bidders are expected to include Burton’s Biscuits, which owns Jammie Dodgers, and Biscuit International, a European manufacturer of private-label products. Canadian security firm GardaWorld has launched a hostile £3bn takeover bid for its UK rival, G4S. Having been rebuffed by G4S’s management, GardaWorld is taking its offer direct to G4S’s shareholders. In a punchy statement to the City, GardaWorld says G4S has failed its stakeholders over the last decade, and needs better management. GardaWorld CEO Stephan Crétier says: “G4S is a deeply troubled business which needs a committed owner-operator team that understands the sector and has a definitive and comprehensive plan. Stakeholders can take no confidence in the promises of a senior management team that has been in place for seven years and has not delivered for shareholders, customers, employees or the public. “The G4S Board has behaved in a cavalier way by rejecting our potential offer out of hand. We look forward to meeting with investors to explain the challenges ahead and why this is a full and fair price for an asset which faces turbulent times and difficult operating conditions.” GardaWorld’s offer is worth 190p per share - but today’s move has pushed G4S’s stock up to 197p, as traders anticipate a higher bid will be needed. G4S was trading at below 150p earlier this month, before GardaWorld’s interest emerged. G4S has experienced a litany of problems in recent years, as my colleague Simon Goodley wrote: G4S has 533,000 employees across 85 countries, with its biggest business in North America. It runs cash handling services and security operations, and is also managing 21 Covid-19 test centres in the UK. It runs four prisons in the UK – in Liverpool, near Rugby, Wolverhampton and Wales – but the majority of its contracts are corporate. It provides security at the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station and at Thames Tideway, London’s new super sewer that is still being built. However, it was stripped of its contract to run HMP Birmingham after rioting forced the government to call in Tornado squads, officers specialising in quelling disturbances. It also lost the contract to run Medway secure training centre, after allegations of mistreatment of children, and the contract to run the Rainsbrook young offender facility. It pulled out of the immigration and asylum sector a year ago, after undercover footage from BBC’s Panorama showed G4S officials mocking, abusing and assaulting detainees at the Brook House facility. Here’s our news story on the sweeping job cuts at Shell: In contrast to Andy Haldane’s upbeat outlook, high street bank TSB has just announced large job cuts -- adding to the 9,000 positions going at Shell. TSB will cut almost 1,000 jobs as it closes 164 branches around the UK, blaming the declining number of customers visiting their local bank. TSB will make 969 people redundant, while adding another 120 new jobs in operational role. The bank will seek to make the reductions through voluntary redundancies. TSB said 94% of its customers would still be within 20 minutes of a branch, and that the network would be the seventh largest in the UK. Debbie Crosbie, TSB’s chief executive, said: Closing any of our branches is never an easy decision, but our customers are banking differently – with a marked shift to digital banking. We remain committed to our branch network and will retain one of the largest in the UK.” Here’s some reaction to Andy Haldane’s speech on Avoiding Economic Anxiety (which you can read here) Andy Haldane justifies his attack on pessimism by arguing that the “unholy trinity of risks” facing the UK economy aren’t as serious as you might think. They are.... 1) The worrying rise in Covid cases across the UK recently, leading to new restrictions. Haldane argues that this won’t caused as much economic harm as the original lockdown: Measures announced so far are nothing like as severe as earlier in the year. Even during that earlier period, we saw significant substitution between spending categories, partially insulating aggregate spending. In this respect, it is notable how quickly spending in the worst Covid-affected US States bounced back recently following their second wave. 2) Rising unemployment. Haldane says there will “very likely” be further job losses in future. However, with output recovering and the government guaranteeing some pay for workers on reduced hours, it’s less of a threat than before. 3) Brexit. With Britain ‘clearly leaving leaving the customs union’ at the end of the year, much work needs to be done to avoid major disruption. Haldane reckons firms will cope: Existing surveys suggest many firms still have a distance to travel before they are fully prepared for leaving the customs union with the EU, understandably so given the disruption caused by Covid. But there is still time for this operational work to be done and it will be important businesses prioritise that in the weeks ahead to minimise disruption to their businesses and the economy. I am confident UK companies will rise to this challenge, as they have to the challenge of Covid. Let’s hope so. But still...many businesses are pleading for a free trade deal because they cannot cope with trade disruption on top of the pandemic. Haldane has also taken a swipe at the press for being too negative. According to the Bank of England’s chief economist, we blundered last month by reporting that Britain had fallen into its worst ever recession. Apparently, we shouldn’t have focused on the 20% plunge in activity in April-June, but should have instead hailed the 9% growth recorded in June alone. Giving Fleet Street a weary sigh, Haldane chides that: A particularly revealing episode is associated with the notable spike in the pessimism ratio on the 12 August. This was when the Office for National Statistics published second quarter GDP figures for the UK. These showed a huge fall of over 20% in GDP, the largest quarterly fall on record by far. This, understandably, was one of the top three new stories on the day. Here are some of the headlines that accompanied it: Yet the irony is that the only news in this release was GDP growth for the month of June, the final month of the quarter. This saw an almost 9% rise in activity, by far the largest rise in any month ever and above market expectations. Yet negative media headlines outnumbered positives by many multiples. Positive economic news was media-filtered into an extreme negative event We’re grateful for the feedback. But don’t forget, this was the moment that Britain suffered its worst ever downturn, and officially entered recession. That’s news, not “Chicken Licken” gloom. Andy Haldane also pours cold water on the suggestion that UK interest rates could be cut below zero. He insists that the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee is not close to introducing negative rates, even though the BoE has begun conducting operational work on the issue. Haldane tells the Cheshire and Warrington LEP Economic Summit Webinar that: Judgements on negative rates will depend on the economic outlook at the time and in particular on whether that necessitates further monetary stimulus. If that condition was satisfied, any decision on negative rates would then depend on whether the balance of costs and benefits from using this tool was positive and whether this cost/benefit balance favoured negative rates over other monetary tools. All three of these conditions would need to be satisfied before negative rates became a reality. At present, none of those conditions is in my view satisfied Andy Haldane points out that consumer spending has been stronger than expected since the lockdown began - a sign that the economy sky isn’t tumbling down. The simplest explanation for the upside surprises to UK activity over recent months would be that lockdown measures have been released sooner and faster than expected. But the pace of release from lockdown in the UK has in fact been broadly in line with what the Bank had expected in May. The biggest surprise has been the robustness of peoples’ spending behaviour in the face of lockdown constraints and other risks, not the evolution of these constraints and risks per se. The behaviour of UK consumers has been most surprising. Based on our suite of fast indicators, UK consumption has been rising by, on average, around 2% per week since May. As best we can tell, consumer spending now stands at around pre-Covid levels. In other words, consumption has fully recovered more than a year earlier than the Bank expected as recently as August. Large-ticket purchases, such as cars and houses, are also back to around pre-Covid levels. Against a backdrop of more than 40,000 Covid-related deaths, an extra 1 million people unemployed and perhaps a quarter of the workforce having faced a cut in their incomes, the speed and scale of this recovery in consumption is, I think, fairly remarkable. Haldane has also drawn up a ‘misery index’, which plots unemployment and inflation. It’s likely to worsen significantly as job losses increase, but is likely to remain below its levels after the financial crisis: The chief economist at the Bank of England has hit out at anxiety over the UK economy, saying that undue pessimism will intensify the damage caused by Covid-19. In a speech just released, Andy Haldane argues that good news on the economy is being crowded-out by fears about the future. These worries are creating excess caution, fear and fatalism, Haldane argues, just at the point where the economy desperately needs optimism - not a ‘Chicken Licken’ panic that the sky is falling down. Haldane points out that millions of jobs were saved earlier this year by the furlough scheme, adding that much of the output lost during the pandemic has been recovered. We now expect GDP to be around 3-4% below its pre-Covid level by the end of the third quarter. In other words, the economy has already recovered just under 90% of its earlier losses. Channelling one of America’s great presidents, Haldane says that he has “a Rooseveltian fear of fear itself”: If the economy were sat on a psychiatrist’s sofa, the diagnosis would not be especially difficult. A propensity to dismiss good news and dwell on bad? To catastrophize about the future? The sense of events being beyond our control? These are the psychological symptoms of anxiety. And collective anxiety is as contagious, and could be as damaging to our well-being, as this terrible disease. Averting an economic anxiety attack calls for a balanced and flexible approach to the words and actions of businesses and policymakers. Planning for the worst is important, but needs to be accompanied by hope for the best. Encouraging news about the present needs not to be drowned out by fears for the future. Now is not the time for the economics of Chicken Licken. This rather chimes with last week’s speech by chancellor Rishi Sunak, who called for people to “learn to live” with the crisis, and “live without fear” . UK house prices hit a record high last month, over £266,000 for the first time, as the market picked up momentum. As flagged earlier, prices have jumped by 5% over the last year, with most regions seeing an acceleration in prices over the last quarter. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s Chief Economist, says the stamp duty holiday and pent-up demand are both pushing prices up. Plus, some families are keen for more space, after months of unplanned home-working and home-schooling. Gardner says: “UK house prices increased by 0.9% month-on-month in September, after taking account of seasonal effects, following a 2.0% rise in August. As a result, there was a further pick up in annual house price growth from 3.7% in August to 5.0% in September - the highest level since September 2016. “Housing market activity has recovered strongly in recent months. Mortgage approvals for house purchase rose from c66,000 in July to almost 85,000 in August - the highest since 2007, well above the monthly average of 66,000 prevailing in 2019. “The rebound reflects a number of factors. Pent-up demand is coming through, with decisions taken to move before lockdown now progressing. The stamp duty holiday is adding to momentum by bringing purchases forward. Behavioural shifts may also be boosting activity as people reassess their housing needs and preferences as a result of life in lockdown. Over in Germany, the jobless rate has fallen as Europe’s largest economy continues to recovery from the pandemic. The German labour office reports that the number of people out of work fell by 8,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.907 million. That pulled the unemployment rate down to 6.3%, from 6.4%. The number of people on short-time work schemes also fell, but remained extremely high, at 4.24 million in July, down from nearly 6m in April. Under Germany’s Kurzarbeit scheme, the government pays employees’ wages for time when they’re not working (and is more generous than the UK’s new scheme, which only covers a third of unworked hours). The US casino operator Caesars Entertainment is claiming victory today in its pursuit of British bookmaker William Hill. William Hill has agreed to be taken over by Caesars in a £2.9bn deal, just days after a bidding war broke out - with private equity firm Apollo also in the running. My colleague Jasper Jolly explains: The deal, which must be agreed by 75% of William Hill shareholders, was unanimously recommended by the UK company’s directors. It came after two rival bids by the US private equity group Apollo were turned down. The takeover will give Caesars, the operator of the Caesars Palace casino in Las Vegas, access to the burgeoning US sports betting market. Caesars also owns various casinos in the UK. European stock markets have dipped into the red this morning as anxiety over the US presidential election builds. It’s not a major selloff - the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index is down around 0.5%, towards the three-month lows struck last week. But last night’s unpleasant presidential debate (peppered with interruptions and personal abuse) is not calming worries about the November election, and the possibility of a disputed result. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says anxiety over the slowing recovery is also hitting shares, distracting from a pick-up in Chinese company growth overnight. If last night’s Presidential debate was supposed to inform and educate, all it did was merely confirm the credibility deficit in US politics, as President Trump, and Democrat nominee Joe Biden engaged in what can only be described as a fact free name calling contest. Financial markets appear to have taken their cues from that, shrugging off some better than expected Chinese PMI data, which showed improvement in both manufacturing and services in September. The Chinese numbers are certainly encouraging, and bar another significant wave of infections, there is evidence that the Chinese economy is slowly getting up off the mat after a sluggish few months. European markets have opened lower this morning, and while attention is focussed on last night’s events in the US, the real concern continues to be around the increasing probability that second wave concerns will curtail economic activity into year end. Shell isn’t the only major company announcing major job losses due to the pandemic. Overnight, Walt Disney announced it was eliminating 28,000 jobs at its theme parks, which were forced to shut during the lockdown and have struggled since. My colleague Dominic Rushe explains: The entertainment company blamed limited attendance at the theme parks it has reopened and the continuing closure of others for the “difficult decision”. “For the last several months, our management team has worked tirelessly to avoid having to separate anyone from the company. We’ve cut expenses, suspended capital projects, furloughed our cast members while still paying benefits, and modified our operations to run as efficiently as possible, however, we simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while operating at such limited capacity.” “As you can imagine, a decision of this magnitude is not easy,” Josh D’Amaro, head of parks at Disney, wrote in the letter obtained by CNBC.... As well as slashing up to 9,000 jobs to reduce costs and ‘complexity’, Shell is also planning to restructure its oil and gas operations to help fund its move into renewables. CEO Ben van Beurden says Shell’s upstream arm (which finds oil and gas, and digs it out) will focus on generating ‘strong cash flow’ to fund spending on lower-carbon products. It’s also planning to shake up its refining business, making it ‘smaller but smarter’. Which means... We will keep only what is strategically essential to us and integrate those refineries with our chemicals business, which we plan to grow. We will keep sites in key locations which have the flexibility to adapt. It is also worth noting that, if we want to be a large player in biofuels, a lot of the biofuel capability will be built within our refining infrastructure. We will end up with fewer than 10 refineries, compared to 55 around 15 years ago, but they will be set up to serve the changing needs of society. The FT’s Anjli Raval says Shell is trying to streamline its business after the shock of Covid-19, writing: Shell has in recent months reviewed its operations as it seeks not only to become more financially resilient, but better set up for a shift towards lower-carbon energy businesses. Job reductions of between 7,000 and 9,000 are expected by the end of 2022, including 1,500 people that have chosen to take voluntary redundancy. Energy companies have seen earnings plunge as the coronavirus outbreak and measures to curb its spread by governments hit demand for oil and prices. Shell’s job cuts mean that tens of thousands of positions are being lost across the energy industry - due to Covid-19 and the push towards less polluting sources of power. Bloomberg has the details: Royal Dutch Shell Plc will cut as many as 9,000 jobs as Covid-19 precipitates a companywide restructuring into low-carbon energy. Job reductions of 7,000 to 9,000 are expected by the end of 2022, including around 1,500 people taking voluntary redundancy this year, Shell said Wednesday in a statement. The company sees sustainable annual cost savings of $2 billion to $2.5 billion by that time. “We have to be a simpler, more streamlined, more competitive organization,” Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said. “We feel that, in many places, we have too many layers in the company: too many levels between me, as the CEO, and the operators and technicians at our locations.” The move adds to the growing list of major announcements this year which has seen Big Oil slash dividends, take multibillion-dollar writedowns and ax jobs following oil’s coronavirus-induced plunge. BP said in June it planned to cut 10,000 jobs as it moved into cleaner energy, Chevron Corp. intends to trim 10% to 15% of its global workforce, while Exxon Mobil Corp is reviewing staffing country by country. Shell chief Ben van Beurden is also pledging to push governments and regulators towards a low-carbon future. In an article outlining his net-zero strategy, and the sweeping job cuts, van Beurden says: We simply have to be better at making decarbonisation a reality in society and that means having a loud, clear voice. If we want to make hydrogen happen, for example, it is not going to be by just building the infrastructure and seeing what happens next. It is going to be by working with decision makers and policy makers so we can find ways forward: what legislation and standards need to be put in place, what bottlenecks need to be cleared. We cannot just be quiet. If we stay quiet we risk ending up saying: “Well, I am sorry, it didn’t happen because we failed to speak up.” We have to be proactive and help things happen. Excellent. But in the meantime, Shell is still planning to produce an awful lot of oil - adding to the climate emergency. Today’s operations update states that Shell expects to produce between 2,150 and 2,250 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, including a loss of up to 70 thousand barrels per day from hurricanes in the US Gulf of Mexico. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We start with some breaking news -- oil giant Royal Dutch Shell is cutting up to 9,000 jobs as it overhauls its operations towards greener energy sources. The cuts equate to around one in ten staff across Shell, adding to the swathe of jobs lost this year since Covid-19 plunged the world into a deep recession. Ben van Beurden, Shell’s CEO, announced the cutbacks this morning. As well as cutting costs, he argues they will help Shell become a net-zero emissions energy business within 30 years. Van Beurden says that a major restructuring is now needed: It is very painful to know that you will end up saying goodbye to quite a few good people. I know I, and many others in Shell, will be saying goodbye to people we know well and really like and who have great loyalty to the company. But we are doing this because we have to, because it is the right thing to do for the future of the company. We have to be a simpler, more streamlined, more competitive organisation that is more nimble and able to respond to customers. And that means massive job cuts, Van Beurden warns: COVID-19 has shown we can work very effectively in ways we did not think we were ready for yet. But a large part of the cost saving for Shell will come from having fewer people. We do not have an exact figure because the details are still being worked out, and we have never had a target to reduce a particular number of jobs. But we can say that, because of the efficiencies we expect to gain, we will reduce between 7,000 and 9,000 jobs by the end of 2022. This includes around 1,500 people who have already agreed to take voluntary redundancy this year, but excludes any who may leave Shell because of divestments. The sweeping jobs cuts are part of a plan to save Shell between $2bn and $2.5bn per year -- as it also wrestles with the slump in the oil price since the Covid-19 pandemic, and the hit to energy demand. We’ve also just learned that UK house prices continued to rise sharply last month, increasing at the fastest rate in four years. Nationwide has reported that: Annual price growth picked up to 5.0% in September, the highest rate since Sep 2016 Prices rose 0.9% month-on-month, after taking account of seasonal factors Most regions saw a pickup in house price growth rates in Q3 Stock markets are expected to fall back today, as investors recoil from a bitter and chaotic presidential debate overnight in which Donald Trump repeatedly interrupted Joe Biden, attacked mail-in balloting, and failed to denounce white supremacist violence .

Look, British Gas customers are fleeing at a rate of only 93,000 a month this year, as opposed to the 100,000-plus that were deserting on average every month during 2017. As corporate boasts go, this is pretty desperate stuff. Indeed, if you cut the numbers a different way, the rush for the exit is intensifying: there have already been more escapees in the second half of 2018 than in the first. All big six energy suppliers are losing customers because switching to smaller independents is suddenly fashionable. But the really bad news for the old guard is that the process is happening even before the government-imposed price cap arrives to take a bite out of profits next year. On the plus side, Centrica can claim genuine success in signing up punters to its “connected home” services. But a shrinking pool of retail customers represents a serious long-term headache that cost-cutting can only partially fix. The consumer market looks unstable. That’s a problem if, like Centrica’s chief executive, Iain Conn, your strategy is to “reposition the portfolio towards the customer.” Still, at least the gas exploration and energy-generation divisions offer greater stability, right? Not on current form. The other revelation in Thursday’s trading update is weaker than expected production from the gas fields and “outages” at the Hunterston B and Dungeness C nuclear power stations, where Centrica has exposure via its 20% stake in British Energy. The combined cash flow impact will be small – just £50m or so. But, at an earnings level, Centrica’s numbers suddenly look horribly tight. The plan is to pay a 12p-per-share dividend this year from expected earnings of just 11.5p, so you can understand why investors fear for their income in the medium-term. A dividend yield on the shares of 9% underlines the point. At a push, one can see why management thinks the dividend arithmetic still works. Add up capital expenditure (£1.1bn), the dividend (£600m), interest costs (£300m) and pension fund repair (£100m) and you still have £100m of spare change if operating cash flow arrives, as still predicted, at £2.2bn-ish. Yet the plan leaves almost no room for error or bad luck. Conn, who cut the dividend by 30% soon after he arrived from BP in 2015, cannot afford any more bad news if he is to avoid a repeat. Unfortunately, bad news is mostly what Centrica shareholders have been hearing in the past year. As the shrunken share price shows, they’re losing faith. Berkeley bribery claims Nicolas Simpkin’s departure from the housebuilder Berkeley Group in September 2014 was surprising since finance directors don’t often get fired from FTSE 100 companies “with immediate effect” with no other details given. What followed was also interesting. As Berkeley’s annual report in August this year explained, an out-of-court settlement was eventually agreed in which the company paid Simpkin £9.5m and proceedings brought by the former finance chief in the high court and employment tribunal were withdrawn. As this newspaper then revealed on Wednesday, the withdrawn allegations, as shown in court papers, included claims that Berkeley engaged in years of bribery with a partner at a large estate agent. Simpkin claimed that the Berkeley chairman, Tony Pidgley, made “expensive gifts” to the partner. He also alleged that Pidgley had benefitted from about £660,000 of company money that had, he claimed, been “intended to be used on fitting out” one of the chairman’s luxury London flats “on the pretence the flat was to be used as a show home”. The company denied Simpkin’s allegations at the time and continues to do so. It then offered this helpful detail: “There was a thorough and extensive investigation by a QC and a senior lawyer from a major law firm which concluded these allegations were unfounded.” Are Berkeley’s shareholders allowed to see this thorough independent report that cleared the board? Since Simpkin’s allegations were not tested in court, it would surely be reassuring for them to hear more than just the unidentified QC’s headline conclusion. Berkeley declined to comment on whether there are plans to publish. For a company that announces in its annual report that the first of its five “values” is to “build trust by being open, clear and credible”, that is also surprising."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/feb/26/russia-ukraine-latest-news-fighting-kyiv-zelenskiy-assault-putin-capital","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-27T04:31:52Z","webTitle":"Liz Truss says ‘nowhere left to hide’ for Putin allies – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/feb/26/russia-ukraine-latest-news-fighting-kyiv-zelenskiy-assault-putin-capital","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/feb/26/russia-ukraine-latest-news-fighting-kyiv-zelenskiy-assault-putin-capital","fields":{"headline":"Liz Truss says ‘nowhere left to hide’ for Putin allies – as it happened","bodyText":"This liveblog is closing now but you can continue to follow our coverage on our new liveblog here. Thank you for reading. As dawn breaks in Kyiv and multiple towns and cities across Ukraine wake to find scenes of destruction, here is where the situation currently stands: Western allies have agreed to block Russia’s access to the Swift international banking payment system. The US, Canada and key European countries, including Germany, have agreed to remove “selected Russian banks” from the Swift payment system, the countries announced on Saturday. There are reports that a gas pipeline is on fire in Kharkiv after a Russian attack, while an oil terminal in Vasylkiv, south-west of the capital, Kyiv, has also been targeted. The government has warned that smoke from the explosion in Kharkiv could cause an “environmental catastrophe” and advised people to cover their windows. The 13 Ukrainian soldiers who were reportedly killed while defending an island in the Black Sea from an air and sea bombardment – reportedly telling a Russian navy warship to “go fuck yourself” when asked to surrender – may still be alive, according to Ukrainian officials. Britain is preparing a “hit list” of Russian oligarchs to be targeted by sanctions in the coming months, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said. Truss said there would be “nowhere left to hide” for the super-rich allies of Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin. She told the Sunday Times that new names would be added to the list every few weeks as ministers seek to ratchet up the pressure on Putin. Liquor stores and bars in the US and Canada are targeting Russia’s national drink in a show of unity with the people of Ukraine. Shelves in both countries are being stripped of Russian vodka, with the Republican governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu, announcing on Saturday the removal of “Russian-made and Russian-branded spirits from our liquor and wine outlets until further notice”. Japanese billionaire Hiroshi ‘Mickey’ Mikitani has said he will donate $8.7m to the government of Ukraine, calling Russia’s invasion “a challenge to democracy”. The founder of e-commerce giant Rakuten said in a letter addressed to Volodymyr Zelenskiy that the donation of 1bn yen ($8.7m) will go toward “humanitarian activities to help people in Ukraine who are victims of the violence”, Agence France-Presse reported. A Ukrainian company in charge of building and maintaining roads said it was removing all road signs that could be used by invading Russian forces to find their way around the country. The company, Ukravtodor, said in a Facebook post: “The enemy has poor communications, they cannot navigate the terrain. Let us help them get straight to hell.” Australia has said it will fund the supply of weapons to Ukraine to help it fight Russian forces, days after the government said it would only provide “non-lethal” military equipment. Prime minister Scott Morrison joined Ukrainian-Australians at a church service in Sydney on Sunday morning before announcing the decision. The Australian government will continue to stand up for what is right when it comes to Ukraine. We’ll be seeking to provide whatever support we can for lethal aid through our Nato partners, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom.” Morrison added that the rapid processing of visa applicants from Ukraine would be a “top priority” going forward. A powerful video posted to social media shows a Ukrainian citizen attempting to stop a Russian tank with his body weight. The man first climbs on to the tank before hopping down and attempting to push it back with his arms. When that fails, he kneels in front of the tank in a desperate bid to stop its advance. The moment, captured in Bakhmach in northern Ukraine, is one of a string of defiant acts caught on video showing unarmed Ukrainians confronting Russian soldiers. The decision to remove some Russian banks from the Swift international payments system is expected to have a significant impact in Russia, and further afield. Sergei Aleksashenko, a former deputy chairman of Russia’s central banks, said “there is going to be a catastrophe” on the Russian currency market on Monday. “I think they will stop trading and then the exchange rate will be fixed at an artificial level just like in Soviet times,” he added. Michael Farr, chief executive of financial consulting firm Farr, Miller &amp; Washington, said of the impact on global markets: “This could be a surprise that is not taken very well if it means a slowdown in international trade.” The SWIFT international payments system said on Saturday it was preparing to implement Western nations’ new measures targeting certain Russian banks in coming days, Reuters reports. In a statement, it said: We are engaging with European authorities to understand the details of the entities that will be subject to the new measures and we are preparing to comply upon legal instruction.” Prince Harry has acknowledged the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and called for global support for the country’s people during an appearance at the 53rd annual NAACP Image awards in Los Angeles, Press Association reports. “Before I begin, we would like to acknowledge the people of Ukraine who urgently need our support as a global community,” Harry said as he and Meghan appeared at the ceremony to accept the President’s Award, which recognises special achievement and distinguished public service. Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, is reeling after a natural gas pipeline was blown up early Sunday morning. The government has warned that smoke from the explosion could cause an “environmental catastrophe” and advised people to cover their windows with damp cloth or gauze. Meanwhile, a blaze at an oil terminal in the Ukrainian town of Vasylkiv, southwest of the capital, Kyiv, has prompted authorities to urge residents to close their windows to avoid breathing in smoke and harmful substances. We are receiving more confirmation of a blaze at an oil terminal in the Ukrainian town of Vasylkiv, southwest of the capital, Kyiv. The town’s mayor, Natalia Balasinovich, said Russian missiles hit the oil storage area southwest of the air base’s main runway in a video posted online. The National News Agency of Ukraine later confirmed the reports. Photographs and video posted online showed large flames rising under the night sky. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the the Ministry of Internal Affairs, said on Telegram. The missile attack was carried out on the Vasilkovskaya oil depot of the KLO company. Rescuers have already left for the scene of the tragedy. Most likely, there were no casualties. It will burn for a long time. The environmental damage will be colossal.” The mayor of Vasylkiv, Natalia Balasinovich, also confirmed that rockets hit the oil depot in Vasilkov, and a strong fire started. A natural gas pipeline was also blown up in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, after a Russian attack, the Ukrainian state service of special communications said. A mushroom-shaped explosion was shown in a video it posted on the Telegram messaging app. It was not immediately clear how important the pipeline was and whether the blast could disrupt gas shipments outside the city or the country. A Ukrainian company in charge of building and maintaining roads said it was removing all road signs that could be used by invading Russian forces to find their way around the country. The company, Ukravtodor, said in a Facebook update: The enemy has poor communications, they cannot navigate the terrain. Let us help them get straight to hell.” It posted an edited photo of a standard road sign in which directions to nearby cities have been replaced with profanities that could be translated as “Go f*** yourself”, “Go f*** yourself again” and “Go f*** yourself back in Russia”. Vodka, one of Russia’s most known exports, is being boycotted from liquor stores and bars across the US and Canada in protest of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In New Hampshire, Governor Chris Sununu, a Republican, announced on Saturday the removal of “Russian-made and Russian-branded spirits from our liquor and wine outlets until further notice.” In Ohio, where the state contracts with private businesses to sell liquor, Governor Mike DeWine, also a Republican, announced a halt to state purchases and sales of Russian Standard Vodka. L. Louise Lucas, a top Democrat in the Virginia State Senate, is alsocalling for “the removal of all Russian vodka and any other Russian products” from Virginia’s nearly 400 state-run Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority stores. Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, wrote on Twitter: “Dump all the Russian vodka and, alongside ammo and missiles, send the empty bottles to Ukraine to use for Molotov cocktails.” The Liquor Control Board of Ontario, Canada’s most populated province, announced on Friday that it would remove “all products produced in Russia” from its more than 600 stores. Similar removals were underway in the provinces of Manitoba and Newfoundland, Reuters reported. Japanese billionaire Hiroshi ‘Mickey’ Mikitani has said he will donate $8.7m to the government of Ukraine, calling Russia’s invasion “a challenge to democracy”. The founder of e-commerce giant Rakuten said in a letter addressed to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that the donation of 1 billion yen ($8.7m) will go toward “humanitarian activities to help people in Ukraine who are victims of the violence”, Agence France-Presse reports. Mikitani said he visited Kyiv in 2019 and met with Zelenskiy. My thoughts are with you and Ukraine people. I believe that the trampling of a peaceful and democratic Ukraine by unjustified force is a challenge to democracy. I sincerely hope that Russia and Ukraine can resolve this issue peacefully and that Ukraine people can have peace again as soon as possible.” Women across Ukraine have been lending their support by making homemade molotov cocktails, videos circulating across Ukrainian media suggest. The BBC’s Sarah Rainsford said crowds of women in Dnipro in central Ukraine spent Saturday making molotov cocktails. “Teachers, lawyers, housewives, all crouched on the grass, filling bottles. They told me they try not to think about what they’re doing. They didn’t choose this. But they have to be ready to defend their city,” Rainsford said. Amnesty International says Russia has made “indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas” with strikes on sites protected by international humanitarian law. A shipment of military aid from Lithuania has reached Ukraine, according to Lithuania’s ministry of defence. Former US President Donald Trump has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and said he was praying for Ukrainians, marking a sharp shift of tone from earlier this week when he praised Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump delivered his remarks at the CPAC conservative gathering in Florida, Reuters reports. Addressing a crowd at CPAC, Trump expressed empathy for Ukrainians and praised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, calling him “brave” as he stays in Kyiv, the capital. The Russian attack on Ukraine is appalling. We are praying for the proud people of Ukraine. God bless them all. As everyone understands, this horrific disaster would never have happened if our election was not rigged and if I was the president. I stand as the only president of the 21st century on whose watch Russia did not invade another country.” Earlier this week, Trump described Putin’s actions in Ukraine, where cities have been pounded by Russian artillery and cruise missiles, as “genius” and “pretty savvy.” The Ukrainian soldiers who defended an island in the Black Sea from an air and sea bombardment - reportedly telling an officer on board a Russian navy warship to “go f*** yourself” when asked to surrender, are believed to still be alive according to Ukrainian officials. There were 13 border guards stationed on Snake Island, a roughly 16-hectare (40-acre) rocky island owned by Ukraine that sits about 186 miles (300km) west of Crimea, when Russian troops bombed the island on Thursday. All 13 soldiers were believed to have died after refusing to surrender, Ukrainian officials announced. However, in a recent statement, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine said: We [have a] strong belief that all Ukrainian defenders of Zmiinyi (Snake) Island may be alive. After receiving information about their possible location, the DPSU together with the Armed Forces of Ukraine are conducting work on identifying our soldiers.” If you missed our earlier report, you can read it below. Reports are filtering in that a gas pipeline is on fire in Kharkiv after a Russian attack. In Vasylkiv, central Ukraine, an oil terminal has also reportedly been targeted, according to the National News Agency of Ukraine and later verified by CNN. Video of the fire at the oil storage area southwest of the air base’s main runway has circulated across social media this morning. Vasylkiv is about 30km, or 18 miles, south of Kyiv. It hosts a large military airfield and multiple fuel tanks. Illia Ponomarenko, a reporter for the Kyiv Independent, says the population in the area has been advised to keep their windows shut against hazardous chemical fumes. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the the Ministry of Internal Affairs, said on Telegram. The missile attack was carried out on the Vasilkovskaya oil depot of the KLO company. Rescuers have already left for the scene of the tragedy. Most likely, there were no casualties. It will burn for a long time. The environmental damage will be colossal.” The mayor of Vasylkiv, Natalia Balasinovich, also confirmed that rockets hit the oil depot in Vasilkov, and a strong fire started. A quick tweet from US president Joe Biden confirming western allies will cut some Russian banks out of the Swift payments system. As a result of Putin’s war on Ukraine, we join with leaders of EU, France, Germany, Italy, UK and Canada to ensure key sanctioned Russian banks are disconnected from SWIFT, impose restrictions on Russian Central Bank, and further identify and freeze assets of sanctioned Russians.” The United States and its allies are “disarming Fortress Russia” with new sanctions that cut off key banks from the SWIFT financial transactions network and target Russia’s central bank, a senior Biden administration offical said on Saturday. The actions are aimed at preventing Russian President Vladimir Putin from using $630 billion in central bank foreign currency reserves in the invasion of Ukraine and to defend a plunging rouble. “Putin’s government is getting kicked off the international financial system,” the official said. Meanwhile, protests are continuing across the world in support of Ukraine. Elon Musk has said SpaceX’s Starlink satellites are now active over Ukraine after a request from Ukraine’s Minister of Digital Transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov. Fedorov tweeted Musk: While you try to colonise Mars — Russia try to occupy Ukraine! While your rockets successfully land from space — Russian rockets attack Ukrainian civil people! We ask you to provide Ukraine with Starlink stations and to address sane Russians to stand.” Musk responded: Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route.” Musk said on Saturday that the company’s Starlink satellite broadband service is available in Ukraine and SpaceX is sending more terminals to the country, whose internet has been disrupted due to the Russian invasion. Internet connectivity in Ukraine has been affected by the Russian invasion, particularly in the southern and eastern parts of the country where fighting has been heaviest, internet monitors said on Saturday. While extremely costly to deploy, satellite technology can provide internet for people who live in rural or hard-to-serve places where fibre optic cables and cell towers do not reach. The technology can also be a critical backstop when hurricanes or other natural disasters disrupt communication. Musk said on 15 January that SpaceX had 1,469 Starlink satellites active and 272 moving to operational orbits soon. The international activist and hacktivist collective, Anonymous, has said Russian state TV channels have been hacked and are broadcasting “the reality of what is happening in Ukraine”. The group earlier said they launched a cyberattack against Russia in order to support Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraine Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov tweeted on Saturday that Kyiv was “creating an IT army” to “continue to fight on the cyber front” as Russian forces continue their assault on Ukraine. Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you on the live blog as my colleague Adam Gabbatt signs off. It is 2am in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv and credible reports from journalists on the ground suggest an air raid is expected imminently. Please feel free to contact me through Twitter for any tips or updates as we continue to cover the crisis unfolding in Ukraine. •Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities were being subjected to further attacks overnight, as the Russian assault continued. In Kyiv numerous journalists reported two large explosions, while unconfirmed reports said an airbase south-west of the city may have been targeted. •The US, Canada and key European countries, including Germany, agreed to remove “selected Russian banks” from the Swift payment system. A senior US administration official told the Guardian that Russia has become a “global economic and financial pariah”. •Germany said it would send 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 stinger missiles to Ukraine, in a departure from previous policy. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, said the Russian invasion marked a “turning point”. Germany also permitted the Netherlands to send 400 rocket-propelled grenades to Ukraine. •Nine countries have now banned Russian aircraft from their airspace, as the repercussions mount for Vladimir Putin. Czech Republic, Poland, Romania and the UK are among the countries to introduce bans, with Germany potentially ready to do the same. Journalists in Kyiv are reporting numerous explosions around the city, as Russia is believed to be launching a further offensive against the Ukrainian capital. CNN’s Tim Lister reported that two large explosions “lit up the night sky” southwest of Kyiv, with one of the detonations about 12 miles from the city center, the direction of one of Kyiv’s airports. Ukrainian officials had warned residents of Kyiv, and other cities, to prepare for airstrikes, which appeared to have begun in the early hours local time. CNN showed video of what seemed to be a large fire near the center of Kyiv, and the Kyiv Post reported that the Vasilkov oil depot, about 10 miles south of Kyiv, was ablaze. Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US, acknowledged in an interview with CNN the reports that Vasilkov had been targeted. Russia has become a “global economic and financial pariah”, a senior US administration official told the Guardian’s diplomatic editor Julian Borger. Speaking after western allies announced new financial measures against Russia, including the removal of some Russian banks from the Swift global payments network, the official said the measures were designed to target the Kremlin and individuals tied to the Russian government. “We’ll go after their yachts, their luxury apartments their money and their ability to send their kids to fancy colleges in the west. We will also engage other governments, so as to detect and disrupt the movement of ill-gotten gains, and deny these individuals their ability to hide their assets in jurisdictions across the world,” the official said. They said that all 10 of Russia’s largest financial institutions had now been subjected to sanctions – “holding nearly 80% of the Russian banking sector’s total assets”. As a result, the official said: “Russia’s government borrowing costs have more than doubled to almost 17%. The S&amp;P credit rating agency has downgraded Russia to junk status. Within 24 hours of our actions the demand for cash in Russia spiked 58 fold, according to reports, and the Russian government scrambled to deplete its own resources to try and shore up its banks and its currency. In short, Russia has become a global economic and financial pariah.” Russia has been reported to have $630bn in financial reserves stored abroad, in gold and cash, but the new sanctions would render that fund useless, the official said. “You heard about fortress Russia, the war chest of $630bn of foreign reserves,” they said. “It’s impressive, but it’s only impressive if Russia can use those reserves. And that means Russia has to be able to sell those reserves and buy rubles to support its currency. And so what we’re committing to do here is to disarm the central bank. And the way we can do that, for example, is by banning US, EU UK, persons from selling rubles to the Central Bank of Russia. That means very simply, the Russian Central Bank can’t support the ruble, full stop, and that means our sanctions will have much greater force.” The US official said the list of Russia banks to be removed from Swift will ultimately be decided by the EU, but said the US would “work very closely” with European countries “to finalize that list”. The news that western allies will ban Russian banks from the Swift global payments network is a break through for the countries that had initially pushed for the ban. The UK and Spain were early supporters of the move to lock Russia out of Swift, the main secure messaging system that banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, but Germany was a key holdout. On Saturday, however, Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s foreign minister, said the country was working on a “targeted and functional restriction” on Swift. Hours later, the joint statement by western allies, including Germany, was released, with EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announcing the measure. It is a victory for Ukraine, which had pleaded since Thursday for countries to ban Russia – foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba going so far as to say that European and US politicians would have “blood on their hands” if they did not. But it remains unclear how widespread the ban will be. The statement from the west referred to removing “selected Russian banks” from Swift, but gave no specifics. The US, like Germany, had initially been sceptical about the Swift ban. The Observer’s economics editor, Phillip Inman, wrote that “one reason is that the impact on Russian businesses might not be so serious”: The head of a large Russian bank, VTB, said recently he could use other channels for payments, such as phones, messaging apps or email. Russian banks could also route payments via countries that have not imposed sanctions, such as China, which has set up its own payments system to rival Swift. The US, Canada and key European countries, including Germany, have agreed to remove “selected Russian banks” from the Swift payment system, the countries announced on Saturday. “As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, we are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies. We will implement these measures within the coming days,” a statement from the leaders of the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, the UK, Canada, and the US said. Swift is the world’s main international payments network. Several countries have already expressed support for locking Russia out of the platform, and Germany, which had previously oppose the measure, leant its support earlier today. The joint statement on Saturday made the move official, although few details were given as to when the Swift removal will take place, and which Russian banks will be targeted. “We commit to ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system. This will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally,” the countries said. “Second, we commit to imposing restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions.” The countries also said they would take measures “to limit the sale of citizenship – so called golden passports – that let wealthy Russians connected to the Russian government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems”. They also announced plans to launch a “transatlantic task force” which will ensure sanctions on Russians remain effective. Denys Shmyhal, the prime minister of Ukraine, has accused Russia of war crimes and targeting civilian targets, and said Moscow will face a “military tribunal”, CNN reported: During a Saturday news conference, Shmyhal said Russia shelled kindergartens, residential blocks and “buses with children.” For these crimes, the Russian command will surely see military tribunal. The enemy will surely be punished for killing Ukrainian children. Ukraine will not forgive them for this,” Shmyhal said. Germany could block Russian flights from its airspace, the German transport ministry said in a tweet. “[Transport] minister [Volker Wissing] supports the blocking of German airspace for Russian aircraft and has ordered everything to be prepared for this,” the ministry said. Nine countries, including Czech Republic, Poland and the UK, have so far introduced full or partial bans on Russian flights. A terrible report from Kyiv, where it seems the Okhmadyt children’s cancer hospital has been struck by artillery fire. Last year the hospital won a grant which enabled it to receive “modern equipment and a powerful telemedicine centre for minimally invasive surgery”, Lviv Now reported. Credible reports from journalists in Kyiv suggest an air raid is expected imminently. It’s close to midnight in Ukraine, and citizens have endured night time attacks over the last two nights. CNN reporter Alexander Marquardt posted this video from the Ukrainian capital, showing sirens blaring. The United Nations Security Council is due to vote on Sunday to call for a rare emergency special session of the UN General Assembly on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports: The vote by the 15-member council is procedural so none of the five permanent council members - Russia, China, France, Britain and the United States - can wield their vetoes. The move needs nine votes in favor and is likely to pass, diplomats said. The special session would be held on Monday, diplomats said. Only 10 such emergency special sessions of the 193-member General Assembly have been convened since 1950. The request for a session on Ukraine comes after Russia vetoed on Friday a draft UN Security Council resolution that would have deplored Moscow’s invasion. China, India and UAE abstained, while the remaining 11 members voted in favor. The General Assembly is expected to vote on a similar resolution following several days of statements by countries in the emergency special session, diplomats said. General Assembly resolutions are non-binding but carry political weight. A tweet from Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, who says he spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskiy today: Swift is the world’s main international payments network. Several countries are in favor of locking Russia out of the platform, and Germany, which had previously oppose the measure, leant its support earlier today. Matt Bradley, a foreign correspondent for MSNBC and NBC News, posted this Ukraine defense ministry graphic, which the ministry says illustrates Russia’s military losses in the conflict as of 6am on Saturday: The Pentagon has strongly denied Russian claims that it assisted Ukraine in a navy operation near Zmiinyi Island. John Kirby, press secretary for the Pentagon, said the US did not provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance or other support. Russia had earlier claimed otherwise. “Chalk this up to just one more lie by the Russian ministry of defense,” Kirby said in a tweet. Zmiinyi Island, also known as Snake Island, was the site of a valiant last stand by Ukrainian soldiers on Thursday. The soldiers died defending the Black Sea island from an air and sea bombardment, and reportedly told an officer on board a Russian navy warship to “go fuck yourself” when asked to surrender. A heartwarming video from earlier today, as a Ukrainian mother embraces her child and then the person who brought him and his sister safely to her across the Hungarian border. Nataliya Ableyeva was entrusted with the two children by their father who was forced to stay behind to fight for their country. The children’s mother, Anna Semyuk, had travelled from Italy to meet them and take them to safety. Nine countries, including Czech Republic, Poland and the UK, have now introduced full or partial bans on Russian flights. Poland banned Russian airlines from its airspace on Friday, as did the the UK. Baltic countries Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have each announced partial bans, as has Slovenia. Russia retaliated by banning UK aircraft from its airspace. It has also restricted flights from Bulgaria, Poland and the Czech Republic. • This map was amended on 27 February 2022 to add Bulgaria as one of the countries that has banned Russian flights. YouTube has suspended multiple Russian channels, including the state-funded media outlet RT, from generating revenue on the video service, Reuters reported. YouTube said in a statement that it was “pausing a number of channels’ ability to monetize on YouTube, including several Russian channels affiliated with recent sanctions”. It said the move was prompted by “extraordinary circumstances”. Videos from the affected channels also will come up less often in recommendations, Farshad Shadloo, a spokesman for YouTube, said. He added that RT and several other channels would no longer be accessible in Ukraine due to “a government request.” One of the more surprising encounters I had in the outskirts of Kyiv today was with 50-year-old Alexander, who was manning a makeshift barricade at the entrance to one village with a group of other locals, brandishing whatever weapons they had. Alexander was born and grew up in Russia, then moved to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, but left when Russian-backed forces took over in 2014. Now, he was ready to fight his own former countrymen. If he were to capture any Russian soldiers, he said, he would have nothing to say to them, except to scream “Get out, occupier!” He said logic did not work on Russians because of the propaganda narrative dominant there. He has stopped talking to his relatives in Russia, he said, as they simply don’t understand why he has become a Ukrainian patriot. “I spoke to my own cousin two days ago and he doesn’t understand anything. That will be our last conversation. I asked him why are you so cowardly, your country is attacking us with ballistic missiles, your own father is from Ukraine, have you gone insane?” He was, however, realistic about his makeshift team’s chances. “Of course, if it’s a tank, in this terrain there’s nothing we can do and we need to run. But if it’s anything less than a tank, we will fight,” he said. Russian troops are approaching Ukraine’s nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia and have aimed their rockets at the site, Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, said on Saturday. The Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest in Europe, is located in south-east Ukraine. Russia has already captured the defunct Chernobyl plant, some 100 km north of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv. Germany’s announcement that it will deliver weapons to support Ukraine’s military ends months of resistance from Berlin, despite the repeated calls from the administration of President Zelensky that it needed Germany’s military support. “The Russian attack on the Ukraine marks a sea change,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a statement. “It threatens our entire post-war order. In this situation it is our duty to support Ukraine in its attempts to defend itself against the invasion army of Vladimir Putin. Germany stands closely at the side of Ukraine.” Germany is to deliver 1000 tank defence weapons as well as 500 surface to air stinger missiles, from stocks held by the German army, government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said. He said the weapons would be delivered to Ukraine as soon as possible. The decision comes as a relief to many Germans who have watched with despair as the events in Ukraine have unfolded in recent days. Many have felt torn between the attempts by Germany to resist involvement in military conflict due to the extent to which the country is still haunted by its own Nazi era, and having to watch the lives of innocent people in a European democracy being ruined by an autocratic kleptocrat who has increasingly been compared to Adolf Hitler. Roman Abramovich, the oligarch Russian owner of Chelsea football club, said he will hand over stewardship of the club. In a statement on the Chelsea FC website, Abramovich said: “During my nearly 20-year ownership of Chelsea FC, I have always viewed my role as a custodian of the club, whose job it is ensuring that we are as successful as we can be today, as well as build for the future, while also playing a positive role in our communities. “I have always taken decisions with the club’s best interest at heart. I remain committed to these values. That is why I am today giving trustees of Chelsea’s charitable foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea FC. “I believe that currently they are in the best position to look after the interests of the club, players, staff, and fans.” Abramovich’s ownership of Chelsea has come under scrutiny as sanctions have been applied to high profile Russian billionaires. Greece has summoned Russia’s ambassador to its foreign ministry, after it said six Greek nationals had been killed and six others wounded by Russian bombing near Mariupol in Ukraine. The Greek foreign ministry said the bombing took place on the outskirts of Sartana and Bugas villages, and one of those injured was a child, Reuters reported. “The death of our nationals creates grief and anger for this unacceptable Russian attack against civilians,” Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, said in a statement. Germany will send 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 stinger missiles to Ukraine, the German chancellor said on Saturday. Olaf Scholz said the Russian invasion marked a “turning point”, and added: “It is our duty to do our best to help Ukraine defend against the invading army of Putin.” Germany earlier permitted the Netherlands to send 400 rocket-propelled grenades to Ukraine. The Netherlands purchased the weapons from Germany, which has a long-standing policy of not exporting weapons to war zones. Reuters reported that countries “aiming to onpass German weapons” must apply for approval from Berlin first. A total of 2,692 people have been detained in anti-war protests in Russia in the last three days, according to the protest monitoring site OVD-Info. At least 1,370 of them were detained in protests in Moscow, CNN reported. More than 1,800 people were arrested at rallies across the country on Thursday night, after Russians protested on the streets of Moscow, St Petersburg and more than 50 other Russian cities. Germany has suggested it could support banning Russia’s access to Swift, the world’s main international payments network, after previously opposing the measure. Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s foreign minister, said on Saturday that it was working on a “targeted and functional restriction” on Swift. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, previously said cutting Russia off from the payments network should not be part of sanctions. Other countries, including the UK, have proposed locking Russia out of Swift, arguing that the ban would hurt the Russian economy by forcing run-of-the-mill financial transactions to be conducted directly between banks, or routed through fledgling rival systems. Here’s more on Swift: Here are Saturday’s top headlines on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine so far. Fighting continued across Ukraine but the capital, Kyiv, remained in Ukrainian hands when night fell. The death toll as of Saturday morning was at least 198, according to the Ukrainian health ministry. Poland said 115,000 refugees have crossed from Ukraine since the invasion began. More EU countries – including France, Italy and Greece – have said they would back a ban on Russia using the Swift global payments network in an attempt to pile further pressure on the country after its invasion of Ukraine. It comes after countries including Poland called for stronger sanctions on Russia, and expressed anger at Germany for not backing a Swift ban. But there are signs Germany may buckle to pressure and support a full ban. People across the world – including in Manchester, London and Edinburgh in the UK – took to the streets to condemn Russia’s invasion on Saturday. Ukraine is increasing pressure on Turkey to close the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to Russian warships, which would block some ships advancing towards Ukraine. Turkey has yet to decide. Germany approved the delivery of 400 RPGs to Ukraine by the Netherlands, marking a shift in policy from its previous position of not shipping weapons. Kyiv is under curfew until Monday. The mayor said: “All civilians on the street during the curfew will be considered members of the enemy’s sabotage and reconnaissance groups.” Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has said it will support all EU sanctions against Russia and will not block any. Twitter said it was aware users in Russia were experiencing restricted access, following Facebook’s similar announcement on Friday. Countries including Lithuania, Estonia and Romania blocked airspace for Russian aircraft, with Russia responding by banning Romanian airliners from Russian airspace. Russian troops have destroyed a concrete dam in Ukraine that stops water flowing into Crimea, Reuters reports. India’s prime minister Narendra Modi said he would help peace efforts. That’s all from me, Jem Bartholomew in London, for today. I’ll be back tomorrow at 8am GMT, do get in touch via email or Twitter with tips for then. Now over to my colleague Adam Gabbatt in New York. Bye for now. Russia will close its airspace to Romanian airliners “due to unfriendly decisions by Romanian aviation authorities”, Russian federal aviation agency Rosaviatsiya said on Saturday. Romania earlier banned Russian airlines from its airspace. Meanwhile, Lithuania will also close its airspace to Russian airlines at 10pm GMT on Saturday due to the invasion, the government said, blocking access from Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave to Ukraine. When Yuliia Petrenko, a 31-year-old lawyer originally from Donetsk, arrived outside Downing Street for the Stand With Ukraine demonstration on Saturday, she started crying. “The first thing I saw was somebody’s little boy with a sign that said ‘Putin is killing my gran’, and I just burst into tears,” Petrenko said. Like many Ukrainians living in the UK, Petrenko has experienced a wave of emotions in recent days – fear, anger, frustration, powerlessness, guilt – as she talks to relatives at home experiencing the arrival of war. “At the minute, my auntie, my cousin and their puppy are in a shelter,” she told the Guardian at the rally. They fled the Donetsk region for Kyiv after Russia’s 2014 invasion. Now, war has followed them. “It just feels like you’re waiting to wake up from a nightmare,” Petrenko said. “They can’t believe what’s happening, they feel like sitting ducks.” Petrenko joined hundreds of people in London on Saturday demonstrating their support for Ukraine and revulsion at Russia’s invasion, as diverse crowds expressed their solidarity with Ukrainians and called on western leaders to take stronger action. “Stop Putin, stop the war!” crowds shouted outside the prime minister’s residence. In a separate demonstration eggs were thrown at the Russian embassy in Kensington in outrage at the military incursion that has already killed hundreds and turned a sovereign nation into a battleground. Read The Guardian’s full dispatch from the London demonstration below. Germany has approved the delivery of 400 RPGs to Ukraine by the Netherlands, Reuters reports. Germany has faced criticism for refusing to send weapons to Ukraine unlike other western allies. The approval marks a shift in policy. Reuters has the details from Berlin: “The approval has been confirmed by the chancellery,” a spokesman for the defence ministry said on Saturday. The RPGs come from stocks of the German military. Germany has a long-standing policy of not exporting weapons to war zones, rooted partly in its bloody 20th-century history and resulting pacifism. Countries aiming to onpass German weapons exports need to apply for approval in Berlin first. Meanwhile, the German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock stressed China’s “special responsibility” over the Ukraine conflict in a phone call spoke with her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, the ministry said on Twitter on Saturday. An enormous column of tanks are seen moving toward the border near Kharkiv, Ukraine in this CNN report. Night has fallen in Russia and Ukraine as Ukrainian forces continue to hold the centre of capital Kyiv. Western officials are warning of a “long fight” ahead. Kyiv’s curfew has been extended until Monday. “We held firm ... we have withstood and successfully repelled enemy attacks,” president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday. Twitter said it is aware its platform is being restricted for some people in Russia and is working to retain safe access. It comes after Russia restricted access to Facebook on Friday after the company’s limiting of accounts tied to several Kremlin-backed media organisations. “Ordinary Russians are using our apps to express themselves and organise for actions,” vice-president of Facebook parent company Meta, Nick Clegg, said. “We want them to continue to make their voices heard.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky said on Twitter that the largest demonstration in Estonian history took place today, and thanked president Alar Karis and Estonians for “their solidarity in these difficult times”. It follows demonstrations from across the world – including the UK on Saturday – expressing support for Ukraine and revulsion at Russia’s invasion. Russian troops have destroyed a concrete dam in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Forces destroyed a dam built in Ukraine’s Kherson Region in 2014 to cut off water to Crimea, the RIA news agency quoted the governor of Russian-annexed Crimea Sergei Aksyonov as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports the details from Moscow: Ukraine cut off the fresh water supply to Crimea by damming a canal that had supplied 85% of the peninsula’s needs before Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014. The Soviet-era canal was built to channel water from the River Dnieper to arid areas of Ukraine’s Kherson region and Crimea. India’s prime minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday he would help peace efforts over the Ukraine invasion, Reuters reports, on a phone call with Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Modi said India was willing “to contribute in any way towards peace efforts” while Zelenskiy briefed him about the conflict, a government statement said. It comes after India – alongside China and the United Arab Emirates – abstained from voting on a UN Security Council resolution to deplore Russia’s invasion. Russia vetoed the resolution. Modi also expressed his “deep anguish about the loss of life and property due to the ongoing conflict”. He also raised the issue of the safety of Indian citizens asked for help to evacuate students. Here’s a video of an elderly civilian confronting Russian troops in Melitopol, Ukraine. “What are you doing here?” he demands. Russia has made claims to have taken the coastal city, where an airbase and a hospital were hit on Saturday morning. This is Jem Bartholomew in London taking over the blog for the next two hours. Do get in touch via email or Twitter with tips. Poland’s deputy interior minister, Paweł Szefernaker, has said 115,000 people have crossed into Poland from Ukraine since the invasion began. Just four hours earlier he had put the figure at 100,000, according to Agency Frence-Presse. On Friday alone 50,000 were thought to have sought refuge. “At this moment there are 115,000 people who have crossed the Ukrainian-Polish border since the war erupted” on Thursday, Szefernaker said in the border village of Dorohusk, eastern Poland. The UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi tweeted on Saturday: “More than 150,000 Ukrainian refugees have now crossed into neighbouring countries, half of them to Poland, and many to Hungary, Moldova, Romania and beyond.” Germany has dropped a block on lethal weapons connected to it being transferred, to allow 400 rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launchers to be sent from the Netherlands to Ukraine. According to Politico’s David Herszenhorn, it could represent a major shift in European military assistance. Until now, Germany had a longstanding practice of not allowing lethal weapons it controlled or originally sold to be sent to war zones. Estonia had wanted to send weapons to Ukraine, but because Germany had sold them to Finland, who Estonia had bought them from, Germany had a veto. Overnight clashes in Kyiv may have been started by “pre-positioned saboteurs”, according to the UK. An update from the Ministry of Defence, its second today, said it believed the initial skirmishes in the Ukrainian capital overnight “are likely to have involved limited numbers of pre-positioned sabotage groups”. It said the Russian advance had slowed, with problems probably caused by logistical issues. More EU countries – including France, Italy and Greece – have said they would back a ban on Russia using the Swift global payments network in an attempt to pile further pressure on the country after its invasion of Ukraine. Cyprus and Hungary also said they would support such a measure. The move, which it is hoped would hit Russian trade by making it harder for companies in the country to do business, is being considered to escalate sanctions on Vladimir Putin’s regime. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said on Thursday that European and US politicians would have “blood on their hands” if they did not support a ban. The following day, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said a ban did not get the “necessary unanimity” but that it would remain a possibility for future consideration. An update on Priti Patel’s cancellation of visas issued to Belarus’s men’s basketball team (see also 2.01pm). The match was in fact scheduled for Monday, not Sunday as she stated in her tweet. Russia has reportedly sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in the past 24 hours, according to a senior US defence official. Other developments from Pentagon reporters in Washington: Ukraine is increasing pressure on Turkey to close the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to Russian warships, after a tweet from President Volodymyr Zelensky was widely interpreted to mean that Turkey had agreed to the closure, reports Ruth Michaelson from Istanbul. Turkey has so far made no public statements confirming that it has decided to close the straits to Russian warships, although President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke with Zelenskiy by phone earlier today, stating that Ankara was attempting to push for an immediate ceasefire. The Russian news agency Interfax said Russia had received no official notification from the Turkish side about the closure of the straits to Russian warships. If Turkey chooses to close the Bosphorus and Dardanelles to Russian warships, preventing them from accessing the Black Sea, it would be a significant move in terms of both cutting off long-term Russian support to their troops in Ukraine as well as a significant show of support to Ukraine. A ban would prevent Russian warships normally permanently stationed around the world from sailing into the Black Sea to assist troops in Ukraine. However, Turkey is unable to prevent ships permanently stationed in the Black Sea from returning to their bases. The shipping industry experts Lloyds List pointed out yesterday that commercial traffic through the Bosphorus had already slowed significantly in the past two days. Turkey’s foreign ministry described the Russian invasion as “unacceptable” but described it as a “military operation” rather than a war, as doing so has implications for the Montreux convention, which lays out Turkish control of the straits. The convention defines Turkish control as well as sets limits on the size, tonnage and duration of warships that can cross the straits, although warships belonging to countries bordering the Black Sea are normally able to pass unrestricted. The foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, laid out Turkey’s position regarding the closure of the straits to Hürriyet yesterday, stating that officials were discussing whether the conflict met the definition of a war under the Montreux convention. If officials decide that the definition has been met, this allows them to block warships from Ukraine and Russia from transiting the straits, although the move is likely to be far more significant for the Russian side. “Turkey can stop the passage of warships through the straits,” he said, adding that the Montreux convention stipulates that “if there is a demand for ships from the warring countries to return to their bases, then it must be allowed.” “If we accept the state of war legally, this process will begin,” he added “Secondly, if we accept the state of war we will prohibit the passage of warships … but even if we ban them, the Russians have such a right.” Turkey maintains alliances with both Russia and Ukraine, and has so far emphasised its neutrality in the conflict, despite selling its Bayraktar TB2 drones to Ukraine and condemning Russia’s actions. Turkey’s own Nato membership was put under pressure by its decision to buy Russia’s S400 missile defence system in 2017, although Erdoğan has recently sought to show how much Turkey values membership of the organisation, telling journalists that “Nato should have taken a more decisive step”, earlier this week. The conflict in Ukraine and a rebuke from Russia should Turkey choose to close the straits will probably heavily affect Turkey’s economy, already hobbled from a year where the lira lost half of its value and as rising energy costs spark protests and discontent. Turkey imports roughly a third of its natural gas supply from Russia, and much of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, says he has spoken to the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, this afternoon. He said he thanked him for his “strong cooperation” on Ukraine and that they discussed the need for “urgent action” on excluding Russia from Swift. A curfew has come into force in Kyiv until Monday morning. It was initially thought the restrictions to clear the public from the streets would last from 5pm to 8am every day, before the change was announced that it would instead run until 8am on Monday morning without breaks. The mayor’s office said: “For more effective defence of the capital and security of its residents the curfew will run from 1700 today, February 26, 2022, until the morning February 28.” Earlier on Saturday, Kyiv’s mayor, the former boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, said: “All civilians on the street during the curfew will be considered members of the enemy’s sabotage and reconnaissance groups.” Sweden has become the latest country to refuse to play Russia in men’s football World Cup playoff games later this year. The Swedish FA said it should cancel the playoff games, which are scheduled for March. The Czech Republic are the other team due to be involved in the “path B” fixtures to decide which nation will be able to play in the Qatar World Cup later this year. Women in Dnipro have been making molotov cocktails from polystyrene and beer bottles, which they can use against Russian forces. Turkey has said it is yet to make a decision on closing its straits between the Mediterannean and the Black Sea to the Russian navy– despite an earlier claim by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. It is the first official clarification since Zelenskiy said on Saturday that Turkey had agreed to close the waterways to warships – which would have been a big defensive boon for Ukraine. According to Reuters, a Turkish official said it “has not made a decision to close the straits to Russian ships”. If it did happen, a closure would break a convention for Black Sea states that warships are allowed to return to port during wartime. The Russian navy has already been responsible for casualties on the coast of Ukraine and on islands in the Black Sea. The US has announced another $350m of “immediate support” for Ukraine, bringing the total amount of military aid in the last year to more than $1bn. The secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, said it would help fund defences for Ukraine, including against air and armoured units. He said: “Today, as Ukraine fights with courage and pride against Russia’s brutal and unprovoked assault, I have authorized, pursuant to a delegation by the president, an unprecedented third presidential drawdown of up to $350m for immediate support to Ukraine’s defense. This brings the total security assistance the United States has committed to Ukraine over the past year to more than $1bn. “This package will include further lethal defensive assistance to help Ukraine address the armored, airborne, and other threats it is now facing. It is another clear signal that the United States stands with the people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereign, courageous, and proud nation.” There’s some confusion about the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s claim earlier that Turkey had pledged to close the straits to access the Black Sea. Russia, via the Interfax news agency, has said it has had no official notification of the closure. There is speculation that Zelenskiy’s tweet may have been a request for Turkey to take action, rather than a confirmation that it would be in place. The Montreux convention, which governs the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits, says ships from Black Sea states will be allowed to return to port during wartime. If Turkey did go ahead and ban warships from the strait, it would break the convention. Ukraine has denied that it refused negotiations with Russia, as claimed by the Kremlin on Saturday. The head of the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, Mikhail Podolyak, said it was untrue and that Russia had set out “unacceptable conditions [and] ultimatum demands”. On Saturday Vladimir Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov said Putin had ordered a halt to the Russian advance for negotiations, but Ukraine refused them. “Ukraine, of course, did not refuse negotiations. But precisely from negotiations, which, by the way, have not happened yet. Ukraine and President Zelensky categorically renounces any unacceptable conditions or ultimatum demands from the Russian side,” Podolyak said. The UK home secretary, Priti Patel, has cancelled the visas of a Belarusian basketball team that was due to play in Newcastle on Sunday night. Belarus has been an ally of Vladimir Putin’s Russia and was used as a base to launch attacks from Ukraine’s north. The US and UK are among countries that have issued sanctions against the country. Protests have been taking place across Europe against the war, including outside Downing Street in London. Turkey will stop Russian warships from passing through the Black Sea, according to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In a tweet, Zelenskiy said the country had pledged military and humanitarian support for Ukraine. Turkey will stop warships passing through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits, which connects the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, Zelenskiy suggested. On Thursday 13 Ukrainian soldiers were killed on the small, rocky Snake Island in the Black Sea when it was bombarded by ship and by air. Update: Russia has disputed the claim and Turkey is yet to confirm it. The International Committee of the Red Cross has called for an end to hostilities and urged those in the conflict to follow international law. Florence Gillette, the head of the ICRC delegation in Kyiv, said: “We are calling urgently on parties to the conflict not to forget their obligations under international humanitarian law. They must ensure the protection of the civilian population and those no longer taking part in the fighting, such as detainees or the wounded and sick. “International humanitarian law is clear: all parties to the conflict have a legal obligation to ensure that military operations are planned and conducted in a way as to ensure the protection of civilians and civilian objects.They must take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian injuries and loss of life. “Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited, and ICRC therefore strongly urges the parties to avoid the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area in populated areas and to avoid locating military objectives within or near such areas.” A journalist in Kyiv has said Ukraine has blown up a bridge to the west of the city in an attempt to halt or slow any Russian advance. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has said it will support all EU sanctions against Russia and will not block any. Speaking on the Ukraine-Hungary border, he said he supported peace efforts. “Hungary made clear that we support all the sanctions, so we will block nothing, so what the prime ministers of the European Union are able to agree, we accept it and we support it,” he told reporters in English, according to Reuters. Earlier on Saturday he said he agreed with Russia being blocked from the cross-border Swift payments system. Orbán has previously been considered Vladimir Putin’s closest ally among EU member states’ leaders. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said all sanctions should be up for discussion, ahead of a meeting with the German chancellor, Olaf Sholz. “I came to Berlin to shake the conscience of Germany so that they would finally decide on truly harsh sanctions that will influence the Kremlin’s decisions,” Morawiecki said, as fighting took place on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. “We need to shut down Nord Stream 1 and 2, we need to cut reliance on raw materials, cut off Russian financial institutions from capital markets, confiscate assets of oligarchs, close off Swift for Russia … all options should be on the table.” Prince William and Kate have said they “stand with” the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. It’s a rare public comment on politics for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, after they met Zelenskiy and his wife, Olena, in 2020. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, has called on Russia to stop the military operation in Ukraine. The Turkish foreign ministry said on Saturday that Çavuşoğlu had repeated his offer for Ankara to be a location for peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. Relations have been warm between Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and Vladimir Putin, but the country occupies an awkward position. In recent years, Turkey signed a deal with Russia for an air defence system, but it has sold military drones to Ukraine and is a key part of Nato. The Kremlin has claimed that Vladimir Putin ordered a halt to Russia’s offensive in Ukraine on Friday, expecting negotiations with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, but told them to continue when that did not happen. A government spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the operation was resumed on Saturday afternoon after the Ukrainian leadership refused to negotiate, according to Reuters. British forces have arrived in eastern Europe to bolster Nato’s eastern flank. Royal Navy ships, British Army troops and Royal Air Force fighters have been deployed. HMS Trent is in the eastern Mediterranean, according to the Ministry of Defence, with helicopters and patrol aircraft. HMS Diamond, a destroyer, will join from Portsmouth. Tanks and armoured units from the Royal Welsh have arrived in Estonia from Germany, and 1,000 troops are arriving in the next few days. This means the British presence will double. Lithuania has joined its Baltic neighbours Estonia and Latvia in closing its airspace to Russian aircraft. Earlier on Saturday Estonia announced it would stop flights passing over or landing in the country, joining Latvia which already had restrictions in place. Russia responded in kind, introducing similar bans on flights from the countries. Poland, the UK, Czech Republic and Bulgaria also have closed their airspace. Hungary has said it supports Russia being shut off from the Swift cross-border financial payments system, according to Poland’s prime minister. Mateusz Morawiecki said that he had spoken to Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán on Saturday, where he had confirmed his support. Earlier on Saturday (see 9:28), Cyprus joined the list of countries who support the move. It was thought that getting Orbán’s support may have proved a roadblock to the proposal, which aims to affect Russian business and the economy, as he is often seen as Vladimir Putin’s closest EU ally – visiting him in early February. Russia has banned airlines from Bulgaria, Poland and the Czech Republic in retaliation for similar rules from those countries. The Russian civil aviation authority said the airlines would be stopped from flying to and over its territory, according to Reuters. Earlier this week Russia banned all British airlines from its airspace in retaliation for London’s ban on flights to Britain by the flag carrier Aeroflot. The UK’s main opposition party has urged the prime minister to expel the Russian ambassador. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said Andrei Kelin should be expelled. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, had a “fiery” meeting with Kelin on Thursday after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Lammy told the Independent: “The Russian ambassador is parroting the lies of Putin’s rogue regime, which is waging an illegal war against Ukraine.” It appears Russia’s clampdown on reporting on its invasion into Ukraine has continued, with access to Twitter being limited. Netblocks, an account that monitors the internet across the world – and has reported on connectivity issues in Ukraine since the war began – found that on some providers there was no access. Earlier the Russian media regulator warned local media about their reporting. Ten outlets were censured for referring to the conflict as an “attack, invasion or a declaration of war”. Estonia has closed its airspace to Russian planes, joining its Baltic neighbour Latvia. Its prime minister, Kaja Kallas, urged other EU countries to follow suit. Latvian carrier airBaltic has now cancelled all flights to Russia until 26 March. Poland, the UK, Czech Republic and Bulgaria also have restrictions in place. Here’s a map showing battles that have taken place or are under way outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. A curfew will be in place in Kyiv from 5pm tonight. The order to stay at home will last until 8am on Sunday, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. Anyone outside will be arrested, according to reports. In a highly ominous development, CNN has posted footage from inside Russia of a TOS-1 heavy flamethrower system being deployed towards the Ukrainian border on a flatbed truck. The TOS-1 is a missile system mounted on a T-72 tank chassis that fires thermobaric rockets and was first used during the Soviet war in Afghanistan and was also used more recently in Syria. The president of Lithuania, Gitanas Nausėda, is the latest European leader to ask Russian people to stop the war, saying: “Even though much evil has been committed, it’s not too late to stop all of this.” He said: “I appeal to you mothers of soldiers who are sent to die in Ukraine. I appeal to you soldiers who are fighting a war for who knows why. “What is the meaning of this war? Only because someone is sitting at a table, drew a piece of land on the map, that he wants to take away? A piece of land that never belonged to him. Does not belong to him. And will never belong to him. “It’s terrifying to see what is going on. It’s terrifying to see women and children die. Churches are being destroyed. What are you fighting for? You are destroying what is sacred to all the Slavs. The cradle of Orthodoxy. Kiev Rus. “Stop. Think about what you’re doing. About what your leaders are doing. It’s not too late, even though much evil has been committed, it’s not too late to stop all of this.” A Russian ship has been seized by French officials in the Channel. Reuters said French authorities believed it could be linked to a company suspected of violating trade sanctions linked to the war in Ukraine. The BBC has reported French officials as saying: “A 127-metre-long Russia cargo ship called the Baltic Leader transporting cars has been intercepted overnight by the French navy in the Channel and escorted to the Port of Boulogne-sur-Mer in northern France. “It has been taken to the French port after a request by the French government because it is suspected of belonging to a company targeted by EU sanctions against Moscow. French border forces are currently investigating the cargo ship. Crew aboard the Baltic Leader have been cooperating with French authorities.” The ship was taken early on Saturday. The Russian embassy is seeking a formal explanation. The UK has said the majority of Russian forces are about 18 miles (30km) from the centre of Kyiv. In an intelligence update by the Ministry of Defence posted on Saturday morning, it said Russia had yet to gain control of airspace over Ukraine, reducing the effectiveness of the Russian air force. It added: “Russian casualties are likely to be heavy and greater than anticipated or acknowledged by the Kremlin.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has been giving a press briefing this morning and said his country will triumph over Russian forces. He said government forces still controlled Kyiv and “key points around the city”. He said Ukrainian forces would win, and criticised disinformation. In the final section of his speech, he said: “Please stop those who are lying, or trying to lie to you, or lying to us. We need to stop this war. We can live in peace together, globally, as humans. “Our military, our national guard, our national police, our territory defence, special service, nationals of Ukraine, please carry on. We will win. Glory to Ukraine.” Zelenskiy said: “We are successfully holding back the enemies attacks. We know we are defending our land and the future of our children. Kyiv and the key areas are controlled by our army. “The occupiers wanted to set up their puppet in our capital. They didn’t succeed. On our streets, there was a proper fight going on. The enemy was using all its weapons, artillery, paratroops, all its weapons. They are hitting residential areas, they are trying to destroy energy infrastructure, and everyone should help us to stop this occupation.” He said that after discussions with EU leaders in recent days, including over shutting Russia out of the Swift payments system (see 9.28am), he believed Ukraine should become part of the EU and its citizens should have the same rights. “Ukrainian people deserve to become members of the EU. And this would be a signal of your support to Ukraine. This discussion should be closed. “We discussed this today with the European leaders. All the equipment and defence military help is coming to Ukraine and work is going on to disconnecting Russia from Swift. I hope that Hungary will be forced to support this decision.” He asked for people who could come back to Ukraine to fight to do so: “In every hour and place, city, and town and person … everywhere where the enemy is killing our people, our armed forces are doing everything they can to destroy the enemy. “Those cities and town that are being attacked from the air are holding up, well done. If you can destroy the occupiers, please do. Everyone who can come back to Ukraine, please do, please come back. “We will have a lot of work to do to rebuild our Ukraine. Everyone who can defend it abroad, do it directly in a united way. Every friend of Ukraine who wants to join Ukraine in defending the country please come over, we will give you weapons. It will be announced very shortly, how this can be done. Everyone who is defending Ukraine is a hero.” He issued another plea to Russian people to help stop the war by putting pressure on Vladimir Putin and his government. Anti-war protesters have been arrested in recent days in Moscow and St Petersburg. “I want everyone in Russia to hear me. Everybody. Hundreds of captured soldiers who are here in Ukraine don’t know why they were sent here to kill people or be killed. People need to tell the government why the war has to be stopped, more people from your country will stay alive. “Your nationals are voicing their opposition to this war. We know many people in Russia are shocked now by the brutality of the Russian government, this is the right reaction, I am grateful to this reaction.” Russia’s former president Dmitry Medvedev has said Russia could cut diplomatic ties with the west. In posts on social media, he said it was time to “padlock the embassies” and that Moscow would continue its campaign in Ukraine. He said the suspension of Russia’s Council of Europe membership could mean Russia may bring back the death penalty. Five Ukrainians from across the country have spoken about life since the Russian invasion. The compelling accounts include one from Evgenija, from Bucha in Kyiv Oblast, who said: “The first shock has gone. We’ve already got used to the sounds of shelling and explosions so we are not scared any more to go outside to message people. “Though we have already had the war for eight years, it is still impossible to believe that there are bombs and missiles in the centre of Europe. And we don’t understand what the world is waiting for with sanctions.” Internet coverage in Ukraine has been affected by the Russian invasion, with connectivity problems reported in the south and east of the country. Reuters reports there are fears that outages could hamper civilian defence groups set up to defend their cities. Problems with signal have been reported in Kyiv. An alleged Belarusian cyberespionage attack targeted personal email accounts belonging to Kyiv forces. Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team said hackers were targeting not just Ukrainians but also Poles, Russians and Belarusians, as well as several Belarusian media organisations. More from Peter Beaumont in Lviv on a reported attack by Russian paratroopers in Brody, near the city. There is a lot of confusion around claims that three Russian helicopters tried to land troops near Brody, about 100km from Lviv in Ukraine’s west. The major of Lviv, Andrey Sadovy, had this to say on his official page. “At 9 o’clock this morning Russian assault troops landed from three helicopters in vicinity of Brody 60 troops and enemy is withdrawing to the forest. Armed forces are defeating the occupants and the situation is under control.” However, the security services of Ukraine for the Lviv region are disputing this, saying the information about Russian assault troops near Brody “is fake”, adding: “They were Ukrainian helicopters.” Purported video footage of what occurred this morning shows a helicopter firing two missiles. If it was a Ukrainian aircraft, it still leaves open the question of what they were firing at. Poland will not play a men’s World Cup qualifier against Russia next month because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, said the president of the Polish Football Association, Cezary Kulesza. The move was backed by players including the star striker Robert Lewandowski. The midfielder Mateusz Klich posted a statement from players on Saturday: Kulesza said the association was in talks with the Swedish and Czech football authorities regarding playoff matches scheduled for March to fill a slot for the World Cup. “In light of the escalation of the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine, the Polish national team is not going to play a match against Russian Republic,” Kulesza tweeted. The UK held a virtual donor conference last night to coordinate support for Ukraine, according to the Ministry of Defence. Donations include ammunition and anti-tank weapons. The UK has offered to oversee logistics operations to support the delivery of donations. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said: “We stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine and are pursuing every option to support them in their defence against President Putin’s unprovoked and illegal invasion.” Ukrainian forces have reportedly repelled an attack by 60 Russian paratroopers near Lviv, Reuters reports. Lviv’s mayor, Andriy Sadovyi, said the Russian soldiers were reported to have retreated after clashing with the army in Brody, western Ukraine, about 65 miles from the city. Update: There is a lot of confusion around these claims. See updated post. Russia being locked out of the Swift financial payments network has become more likely after Cyprus agreed with the proposal. There have been calls for Russia to be shut out of the system, which facilitates cross-border payments. It is thought that doing so will increase pressure on Russia’s businesses and its economy. The move was announced on Twitter by the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who has also spoken to Italy, Germany and Belgium – where Swift is based. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had a call on Saturday morning from the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, to say the move had his backing. While a smaller European nation, Cyprus’s backing is significant because it is a major destination for Russian investment. Local media in Russia have been warned over their coverage of the invasion, with threats to block access to their websites. The communications regulator Roskomnadzor accused 10 outlets on Saturday of falsely depicting what Russia calls a special military operation in Ukraine, and publishing false information. It censured them for referring to it as an “attack, invasion, or a declaration of war”, and said the government would stop access if this continues. Fines of up to 5m roubles are also possible. The Guardian’s Peter Beaumont in Lviv has this on a confrontation between an elderly resident in Melitopol and Russian soldiers. The Russians claimed to have taken the coastal city today and – while still unconfirmed – this incident would suggest that even some Russian residents are not very pleased to see them. Here is what he is saying to the soldiers: “Russians invading Ukraine is so fucked up! What are you doing here? We have our life and you have yours. I’m Russian too, but I live in this country. “You have your own country and we have ours. Don’t you have any problems in your own country? Are you all rich there? Shame on you!” The death toll so far in the Russian invasion of Ukraine is at least 198, according to the Ukrainian health ministry. Three children are among those dead. Its head was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that 1,115 people had been injured, including 33 children. Reuters said it was unclear whether he was referring only to civilian casualties Fighting resumed in Sumy, in north-east Ukraine, and Kyiv on Saturday morning, Territorial defence forces in Sumy are engaged with Russian military, according to Reuters. Loud explosions have been reported in the Ukrainian capital. More donations have been pledged by other countries, with the Czech Republic approving the sending of $8.6m of weapons. The Netherlands has said it will supply 200 more air defence rockets. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has had a call with the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. In a tweet, he said they discussed EU assistance to Ukraine and he hoped it would get their backing. “Ukraine is fighting the invader with weapons in hands, defending its freedom and European future. Discussed with @vonderleyen effective assistance to our country from [the EU] in this heroic struggle. I believe that the #EU also chooses Ukraine,” he said. The UK’s armed forces minister said Russia had failed to achieve its initial objectives – and fighting outside Kyiv was limited to Russian special forces units. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, James Heappey said Russian aims to take key Ukrainian cities had not been successful. He said the UK did not believe Russian claims that it had taken the southeastern city of Melitopol. “The Ukrainian resistance to the Russian advance appears extraordinary. All of Russia’s day one objectives of Kharkiv, Kherson , Mariupol, Sumy and even Melitopol, which the Russians are claiming to taken but we can’t see anything on that, are still all in Ukrainian hands. “The fighting on the outskirts of Kyiv overnight, we understand to just be Russian spetsnaz special forces and pockets of paratroopers. The reality is the armoured columns coming down from Belarus and the north to encircle Kyiv are still way off, because they have been held off by this incredible Ukrainian resistance.” The Ukrainian embassy in Moscow is evacuating to Latvia, according to Reuters. The news was announced by a Latvian foreign ministry spokesperson this morning. “It was their plea, we readily agreed. We are assisting them in the process and help with settling down,” Jānis Beķeris said. The building had seen low-key anti-war protests in the last few days, with some Russians laying flowers outside. There was heavy fighting in Kyiv overnight, as Russian troops attacked from multiple fronts in an apparent attempt to seize the city. Ukrainian armed forces said they repelled Russian advances on an army base and a key road. Kyiv’s mayor says 35 people including two children were injured in the fighting. A residential high-rise in Kyiv was hit by a missile, according to Ukraine’s emergency services. Cruise missiles were reportedly launched at Ukraine from the Black Sea and, separately, areas near Sumy, Poltava and Mariupol were hit by airstrikes Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has remained defiant, posting a video from outside his city office on Saturday morning rejecting fake reports he had ordered a surrender. “We are not putting our weapons down, we are going to protect our country,” he said. Russia claims it has taken the southeastern city of Melitopol, according to Russia’s Interfax news agency. This was denied by the UK armed forces minister, James Heappey, who said he did not recognise the reports and said the Russian invasion plan was running “nowhere near” to schedule. The leaders of Poland, Lithuania and Germany will meet in Berlin on Saturday to discuss sanctions on Russia, Reuters reports. Zelenskiy said he spoke to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, about weapons and equipment “on the way to Ukraine” from their partners. Joe Biden has instructed the US state department to release $350m in military aid to Ukraine. Russian state media has been banned from running ads or monetising on any platform anywhere in the world owned by Meta, Facebook’s parent company. A report from the Reuters news agency has suggested it is looking more likely that Russia could be excluded from the Swift global bank payments system – a step that some countries had been reluctant to take. Vladimir Putin urged the Ukrainian army to overthrow its leadership, whom he labelled as a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who have has lodged itself in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has called for the full isolation of Russia, including embargoes on Russian crude oil purchases. “I demand the world: fully isolate Russia, expel ambassadors, oil embargo, ruin its economy,” Kuleba wrote on Twitter. Separately, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for a decision on Ukraine’s membership to the European Union. “It is a crucial moment to close the longstanding discussion once and for all and decide on Ukraine’s membership in the #EU,” he said on Twitter a short time ago. “Discussed with @eucopresident further effective assistance and the heroic struggle of Ukrainians for their free future.” 35 people including two children have been injured in the heavy fighting overnight in Kyiv, according to the city’s mayor. No further details were available, but in a separate report from Reuters citing an interior ministry adviser, there were no deaths in the apartment block reportedly hit by a Russian missile. This post was amended, to correct that the 35 people were injured, not killed We have some more details on the Russian claim it has seized the city of Melitopol, from the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont, in Lviv. Russian forces reportedly captured the southeastern Ukrainian city of Melitopol on Saturday, Russia’s Interfax news agency reported. Footage posted on social media on Saturday morning appeared to show Russian armoured vehicles in the streets of the city, although the city’s mayor issued a statement saying it remained under Ukrainian control. The claimed capture of Melitopol follows claims by a senior US defence official that Russia had made an amphibious landing of naval infantry between the Melitopol and the key coastal city of Mariaupol. It was also denied by the UK armed forces minister, James Heappey, who said he did not recognise reports that Ukrainian southern coastal city of Melitopol had fallen to Russian forces, adding that the Russian invasion plan was running “nowhere near” to schedule. Ukrainian officials were not immediately available for comment on the fate of Melitopol, a city of about 150,000 people. If confirmed, it would be the first significant population centre the Russians have seized since their invasion began on Thursday. Earlier, Ukrainian officials said Russian forces fired cruise missiles from the Black Sea at Mariupol, as well as Sumy in the north-east and Poltava in the east. The leaders of Poland, Lithuania and Germany will meet in Berlin on Saturday to discuss sanctions on Russia, the Polish government spokesperson Piotr Muller said on Twitter. “At the initiative of Prime Minister [Mateusz] Morawiecki a meeting will be held in Berlin today. Morawiecki together with the president of Lithuania [Gitanas Nausėda] will hold talks with the German chancellor [Olaf Scholz],” Muller said early on Saturday. “The European Union must immediately adopt a package of ruthlessly harsh sanctions against Russia.” Muller did not give the time of the meeting. In this diary of the week in Ukraine, Larisa Kalik documents the Russian invasion and being forced to leave the city she loves. Here’s an excerpt. There seemed to be noise, speed, chaos and fuss everywhere, but inside the apartment it was very quiet. Then I heard a sound outside the window, moving at great speed. I thought it was a rocket. The sound seemed to cut through the air; it flew like a whistle and I lay down on the floor in horror. Trembling, I burst into tears. For a few seconds I waited for an explosion, but nothing happened. I still don’t know what it was. I gathered myself and looked out of the window. People were wheeling suitcases along the street; a siren sounded; birds flew in flocks. I found a piece of paper and wrote my name, my best friend’s phone number and my blood type. It is still in the pocket of my jeans as I write. Ukraine’s state emergency service says a Russian shell has hit a residential building in Lobanovsky Avenue 6, in the centre of Kyiv, reports Luke Harding from Lviv. Video shared by Volodymyr Zelensky’s press service shows the missile exploding in a private flat, sending smoke and debris into the living room. It also released images of the aftermath, with the building still burning on Saturday morning and vast damage visible. A large chunk had been torn out of the right-hand corner of the property, with multiple homes destroyed. The number of casualties was unknown. Firefighters helped injured survivors, carrying one woman out on to the street over a sea of debris. In apparent response to the strike on the building, Ukraine’s foreign minister said: Kyiv, our splendid, peaceful city, survived another night under attacks by Russian ground forces, missiles. One of them has hit a residential apartment in Kyiv. I demand the world: fully isolate Russia, expel ambassadors, oil embargo, ruin its economy. Stop Russian war criminals! Russian troops have captured the city of Melitopol in Ukraine’s southeastern Zaporizhzhya region, Russia’s Interfax news agency cited the Russian defence ministry as saying on Saturday. The ministry also said Russia had used air- and ship-based cruise missiles to carry out overnight strikes on military targets in Ukraine. Zelenskiy is still posting to Twitter, with a follow-up message saying he spoke this morning with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, about weapons and equipment “on the way to Ukraine” from their partners. “The anti-war coalition is working!” he said. Here also is a more expansive translation of Zelenskiy’s video statement from about 30 minutes ago. There’s a lot of fake info telling that I ordered the Ukrainian army to surrender. So, listen here: I’m here. We are not putting our weapons down, we are going to protect our country. Our weapons are our truth, it’s our country, our children and we will protect them. There have been outpourings of solidarity for Ukraine around the world, with protests taking place in cities from Tokyo to New York. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted another video from central Kyiv this morning. The 40-second clip appears to be addressing false rumours. According to a partial translation by the Kyiv Independent, the leader says: “There’s a lot of fake information online that I call on our army to lay down arms, and that there’s evacuation. I’m here. We won’t lay down our arms. We will defend our state.” The Agence France-Presse news service has been interviewing ordinary Ukrainians who have been handed a rifle so they can help defend their country. Yuriy Korchemniy, a historian, has never fired an assault rifle in his life. But he joined scores of others and picked up a Kalashnikov when boxes of them were dumped from trucks and handed out to Ukraine’s new volunteer defence units on day two of Russia’s invasion. “They gave out the rifles, loaded them for us and here we are,” the 35-year-old said with a slightly sheepish grin. “I only know how to shoot single rounds, so my plan is to click this here and switch off the automatic mode.” The Kyiv bridge underpass he was guarding with a handful of other men - some in their 50s – leads to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s administrative complex. The reverse side of the road runs through a working-class district of Soviet-style tower blocks that witnessed a deadly shootout with a small group of Russian forces only a few hours earlier. An AFP team saw a middle-aged civilian who was killed in the clash carried away by ambulance workers. One witness said the civilian was cut down by bullets fired by the Russians from a speeding armoured vehicle. There are more reports coming in of attacks by the Russian forces across the country. Ukrainian officials say cruise missiles have been launched at Ukraine from the Black Sea and, separately, that areas near Sumy, Poltava and Mariupol have been hit by airstrikes, Reuters reports. Reuters reports that President Joe Biden has instructed the US state department to release $350m in military aid to Ukraine as it struggles to repulse a Russian invasion. In a memorandum to the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, Biden directed that $350m allocated through the Foreign Assistance Act be designated for Ukraine’s defence. Here’s the latest wrap on the alarming events in the captial overnight: Fierce fighting has broken out in Kyiv as Russian forces tried to push their way towards the city centre and were met with resistance from the Ukrainian military. Throughout Friday night, explosions rocked the capital. Artillery fire could be heard in the streets and as dawn broke, a post on the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ Facebook page said “active combat” was taking place in the city. The Ukrainian military claimed to have repelled one attack by Russian forces on an army base located on a main avenue in the Ukrainian capital. The Russians “attacked one of the military units on Victory Avenue in Kyiv. The attack was repulsed,” Ukraine’s army said on its verified Facebook page, without specifying where exactly the incident took place. There was no comment from the Russian military. Read more here: It’s dawn now in the capital but some images are dropping of a deserted Kyiv overnight: Ukraine’s UN ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, called for a moment of silent prayer at an emergency meeting of the security council on Friday, in New York. During his address, Kyslytsya called for a moment of silence to pray for peace, and for the souls of those already killed after Russia invaded his country on Thursday. Associated Press reports that Kyiv officials are warning residents that street fighting is under way against Russian forces, and they are urging people to seek shelter. The warning issued on Saturday morning advised residents to remain in shelters, to avoid going near windows or on balconies, and to take precautions against being hit by debris or bullets. Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, is barring Russian state media from running ads or monetising on its platform anywhere in the world. “We also continue to apply labels to additional Russian state media,” its security policy head, Nathaniel Gleicher, said on Friday. “These changes have already begun rolling out and will continue into the weekend.” The day is dawning on Kyiv, after a dramatic and violent night as Russian troops stormed towards the capital. Widespread reports of artillery fire and explosions have come from the east, west and south of the city, and the Ukrainian Armed Forces have claimed to have repelled attacks by Russian troops at an Army base near Vasylkiv and a key city road - Victory Avenue. There are reports of casualties but the Guardian has not received confirmed figures. Residents have been told to stay inside shelters, including underground metro stations and hotel basements. The Kyiv Independent reports air raid sirens in multiple Ukrainian cities this morning, including Lviv, Lutsk, Uman, Vinnytsia, and Rivne. Ukraine’s former ambassador to Austria, Olexander Scherba, has shared this video purportedly from Odessa. The Guardian has not independently verified this footage, which was also shared by a Ukrainian news outlet. The US has been offering to help evacuate Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, from Kyiv to escape threats to his life, but he has so far refused to leave, the Washington Post reports. Zelenskiy has pledged to remain, despite awareness that he is Russia’s “Enemy No. 1” and his family number 2. Citing US and Ukrainian officials, the Post reported US intelligence agencies, including the CIA director during a visit to Ukraine in January, had warned Zelenskiy of the threat to his safety for several weeks. It cited officials saying intelligence at the time suggested Russian hit teams may have already been in Kyiv. “We have been making him aware not only of the threat of Russian invasion, now a reality, but also the threat to him personally,” Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said. “We stand ready to assist him in any way.” “All of this is now happening within the city limits,” reports CNN’s Clarissa Ward, but it doesn’t appear to have reached the centre. There are no signs of residential areas being targeted yet, she says, “but we’re hearing a lot of explosions from many different directions.” Interfax Ukraine news agency reports Russian forces have tried to attack an electricity-generating station, while the Ukrainian military says it has repelled an attack on a Kyiv army base, according to Reuters. The Ukrainian government also says it stopped a Russian advancement down Peremohy Avenue - which runs past the Beresteiska metro station, where heavy fighting has also been reported. The Guardian has not independently verified the reports. The assault appears to line up with Zelenskiy’s warning that tonight could see Russia’s attempt to storm the city. Three million people call Kyiv home. In an address to the nation on Friday Zelenskiy said: “Tonight, they will launch an assault. All of us must understand what awaits us. We must withstand this night,” he said. “The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.” Hello, this is Helen Davidson with our continuing coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Here are some of the most recent developments: Explosions and fighting have rocked the east, west and south of Kyiv, where the Russian assault has continued overnight in a siege apparently aimed at seizing the city. Residents have been taking cover in shelters and underground stations. A woman has reportedly given birth in one station where she had been sheltering with other residents. “This night will be the hardest,” the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an address. “This night the enemy will be using all available means to break our resistance. This night they will launch an assault.” “More than 50,000 Ukrainian refugees have fled their country in less than 48 hours – a majority to Poland and Moldova,” said the UN refugee agency head Filippo Grandi, adding that “many more are moving towards its borders”. The Russian defence ministry claimed its forces had taken control of the strategic Hostomel airfield to the north-west, while Russian tanks were filmed by locals in the Obolonskyi district about six miles north of the city centre in the morning. Ukrainian armed forces say they have repelled Russian attacks on an army base and on a major thoroughfare in Kyiv. Vladimir Putin urged the Ukrainian army to overthrow its leadership, whom he labelled as a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who have has lodged itself in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.” Prominent Russians have joined protests in Russia or spoken out against the invasion, amid at least 1,800 arrests at anti-war rallies. They include pop stars, chat show hosts and newspaper correspondents who have gone public despite the professional and personal risks that come with dissenting from Vladimir Putin. The US department of defense said a Russian “amphibious assault” was launched on Mariupol, a coastal city in south-east Ukraine. A report from the Reuters news agency has suggested it is looking more likely that Russia could be excluded from the Swift global bank payments system – a step that some countries had been reluctant to take. Among other sanctions, The EU and the UK have moved to freeze foreign-held assets of Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov – largely symbolic, but it follows appeals for action from Volodymyr Zelenskiy who said: “When bombs fall on Kyiv, it happens in Europe, not just in Ukraine. When missiles kill our people, they kill all Europeans.” Nato will deploy significant extra troops to countries in eastern Europe who are part of the alliance, its secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said. UK ministers warned there would be no forces going to Ukraine itself to avoid an “existential” war between Russia and the west. The UN security council has voted on a resolution deploring Russian invasion of Ukraine. Eleven member states voted for the resolution, three abstained (China, India, and UAE) and one voted against (Russia). As Russia holds a veto the resolution was not upheld. The Council of Europe suspended Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The 47-nation council announced that Russia was suspended with “immediate effect” from the organisation’s committee of ministers and parliamentary assembly on Friday “as a result of the Russian Federation’s armed attack on Ukraine”. Russia will no longer be allowed to compete in this year’s Eurovision song contest, with organisers saying its inclusion could “bring the competition into disrepute”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/jul/28/anthony-albanese-inflation-rba-interest-rates-peter-dutton-climate-adam-bandt-economy-petrol-prices-covid-omicron-power-bills","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T08:46:10Z","webTitle":"Bill Shorten says robodebt royal commission set to start this year – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/jul/28/anthony-albanese-inflation-rba-interest-rates-peter-dutton-climate-adam-bandt-economy-petrol-prices-covid-omicron-power-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/jul/28/anthony-albanese-inflation-rba-interest-rates-peter-dutton-climate-adam-bandt-economy-petrol-prices-covid-omicron-power-bills","fields":{"headline":"Bill Shorten says robodebt royal commission set to start this year – as it happened","bodyText":"Here are the main stories on Thursday, 28 July: Australia’s inflation rate to peak at 7.75% in December quarter, economic update predicts; The Australian National Audit Office releases a blistering report on the Coalition’s handling of the Building Better Regions Fund; The Albanese government drops a controversial high court case that sought to restore the commonwealth’s power to deport Aboriginal non-citizens; The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, requests a review of the laws that led to the prosecutions of Bernard Collaery and Witness J after a scathing report; Monkeypox is declared disease of ‘national significance’ in Australia The minister for the NDIS, Bill Shorten, says a royal commission into robodebt is set to start this year; Australia records at least 125 Covid deaths; and The government introduces paid family and domestic violence leave legislation. Enjoy the rest of your evening, we’ll see you back here tomorrow morning. The shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser, has responded to the government’s decision to drop an appeal seeking to restore power to deport Aboriginal non-citizens. Leeser said: Attorney general Mark Dreyfus has withdrawn the federal government’s high court appeal in minister for immigration v Montgomery. Mr Dreyfus must explain to the Australian people why he felt the need to intervene when the case had been heard and the high court had reserved its judgement in Montgomery. Does he not trust the high court to interpret the constitution? After his unprecedented intervention to discontinue the prosecution of Bernard Collaery who was charged with serious national security offences, Mr Dreyfus must explain why he is intervening in yet another case before the courts which could have helped to clarify the operation of Australia’s migration law. Mr Dreyfus has not even been attorney general for 100 days and yet he has interfered in two cases before the courts. How can the first law officer have so little faith in our justice system? New infrastructure minister condemns Coalition running of Building Better Regions Fund Further to the audit office’s blistering report on the Coalition’s handling of the Building Better Regions Fund, new infrastructure minister Catherine King has promised change in how Labor would manage such grants programs. In a statement, King called the auditor general’s assessment “scathing”, adding: It confirms what we already suspected: that the former government actively ignored grant guidelines and, in the process, dudded hard working regional Australians. Over five rounds of the program, 65% of infrastructure grants went to projects that were not assessed as having the most merit. Former Coalition ministers made decisions on the basis of ‘choose-your-own-adventure’ criteria that weren’t fully explained to those applying for grants. They did not keep proper records of decisions. King claimed the former government had made “decisions to ignore the merit list” of the infrastructure department, which gave major benefits to Nationals-held seats. She said: Those seats got $104m more – 29% – than if the proper processes had been followed. King said she was already working on a new strategic regional investment framework, promising decisions which are “evidence-based, coordinated, and transparent” and saying that the government would have “more to say on this in the months ahead”. In which Angus Taylor repeatedly calls the new deputy speaker Sharon Claydon “Mr Speaker”: Claydon interjected to say Taylor has called her Mr Speaker on about a dozen occasions. She said: I was loathe to interrupt you, but you have called me Mr Speaker on at least a dozen occasions. My title is deputy speaker. I don’t need a Mr, a Mrs, a Madam, it’s just deputy speaker. Taylor agrees that he “will go with deputy speaker”, thanks Claydon, makes a joke about how she would have made a great speaker, and then promptly continues speaking with: “But, Mr Speaker”. He then calls her Mr Speaker three more times. Once Taylor took his seat, Claydon remarked: You’re just going to have to dump the Mr Speaker when I’m in the chair, OK? Man accused of planning foreign interference to stand trial This report on the committal hearing of a Chinese community leader is just in from AAP: A Chinese community leader accused of planning foreign interference has been committed to stand trial in Victoria’s County Court. Prosecutors allege Di Sanh Duong, 67, made a $37,000 donation to the Royal Melbourne hospital in 2020 as a way to interfere with former federal minister Alan Tudge on behalf of the Chinese Communist party. His defence argued the donation was merely a way for the Chinese Australian community to show they cared during the COVID-19 pandemic in light of anti-Chinese sentiment. But Melbourne magistrate Susan Wakeling on Thursday found there was sufficient evidence for the case to go to trial in the County Court. Duong formally pleaded not guilty to a charge of intentionally engaging in conduct with the intention of preparing for, or planning, foreign interference. Duong was charged in November 2020 following a joint investigation between the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. The 67-year-old, who was the Liberal candidate for the seat of Richmond in the 1996 Victorian election, is the first person charged under Australia’s foreign interference laws. Duong resigned from the Liberal Party following the charges. The 67-year-old’s bail was extended to August 25 when he will appear at the County Court for a directions hearing. As part of his bail conditions, Duong is not allowed to leave Australia or contact a consulate, embassy, foreign intelligence agency or an elected official. Pocock criticises Manly jersey decision Independent senator David Pocock has criticised the “devastating” decision of seven Manly players to boycott wearing their club’s pride-themed jersey, AAP reports. The former Wallabies captain acknowledged the Sea Eagles were taking a step forward by wearing the jersey in their NRL match against Sydney Roosters on Thursday night, but said the boycott highlighted how far society still has to move on inclusivity. “Sport is at its best when it’s challenging society to be more inclusive,” Pocock told the Conversation. “We’ve seen that through history when sport has been courageous ... we can actually create a space that is more inclusive, that people can come and be who they are regardless of the colour of their skin or their sexuality. “This is not doing that. [It’s] really disappointing and it’s going to be devastating for a number of probably mostly young people and some older people who are gay, and love their rugby league, to see players take this sort of stand. “We’re dealing with real people here.” Pocock, who played for the Wallabies 78 times between 2008 and 2019, said the fact that LGBTQI+ sportsmen remained uncomfortable about addressing their sexuality across Australia’s major football codes showed society had failed those people. “Statistically you look at all of the contact sport codes in Australia, I don’t know of any openly gay players, but statistically they are there,” he said. “Clearly we’ve got a long way to go in breaking down those prejudices and the homophobia that is in society. “It shouldn’t be up to gay players to put themselves out there and try and push for a more inclusive society, it’s on all of us. “It’s on the sports, it’s on the teams to create environments where people can be themselves.” Earlier today, the workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, introduced a bill to create 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave, including for 2.6m casuals. Employer groups have warned the bill goes further than the proposal of the Fair Work Commission to add paid leave to modern awards. Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry CEO, Andrew McKellar, told Guardian Australia the inclusion of casuals is “the one aspect I would express caution on”. McKellar said the legislation should “codify what the commission granted”, warning that giving leave rights to casuals was “breaking new ground” and “sets a precedent”. The Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox, warned it was a “significant departure” from what FWC had proposed. He noted the commission proposed workers be paid at their base rate of pay – but Labor’s bill pays them according to their normal working pattern (including overtime, shifts penalties etc). Willox said: This bill will be much more costly for employers than the approach proposed by the Commission and there are significant questions about how the rate of pay that must be provided to an employee could even be calculated in practice. The reason this is significant is that shadow workplace relations minister, Michaelia Cash, said she supports the FWC model. The Coalition hasn’t determined its final position, but the fact Labor has departed from the FWC model, and employer opposition gives them a pathway to oppose it. Still, Labor can pass the bill with the Greens and David Pocock or Jacqui Lambie. The national audit office has published a scathing report on the Coalition’s handling of the $1.15bn Building Better Regions Fund, saying Nationals electorates were awarded far more money than they would have been under a merit-based process while Liberal seats got twice as many grants as Labor seats. The Australian National Audit Office’s latest report, released Thursday afternoon, said that compared with Labor, Liberal seats “received twice as many grants per electorate” under the regional grants program – between $1.6m and $3.1m more. Nearly two-thirds of projects funded were not those assessed by the department as the most meritorious, with the audit office saying there were a “number of deficiencies” in the program including not enough transparency over the members of the decision-making panel and the amount of discretion members had to fund programs that didn’t meet funding criteria. The audit office said: Funding decisions were not appropriately informed by departmental advice, and the basis for the funding decisions has not been appropriately documented. As the program has progressed through the first five rounds, there has been an increasing disconnect between the assessment results against the published merit criteria and the applications approved for funding under the infrastructure projects stream. Infrastructure minister Catherine King has been scathing of the program’s handling by the Coalition for some time, last year referring to it as a “taxpayer fund shamelessly hijacked by [then-infrastructure minister] Barnaby Joyce.” We’re expecting a statement from King shortly. We just mentioned that attorney general Mark Dreyfus has announced a review of the laws governing the way sensitive national security information is dealt with in Australia. He did that following a report by the independent watchdog of national security information laws, tabled on Thursday. The report examined the use of the laws in a case that shocked lawyers and human rights experts in 2019, the prosecution of a former intelligence officer known as Witness J, or Alan Johns. His prosecution and imprisonment were conducted in near total secrecy. The fact that he was imprisoned was only revealed publicly almost by accident, through civil proceedings he brought against the Australian Capital Territory jail where he had been detained. The secrecy was enforced through the National Security Information Act, which has also been used in the cases of Bernard Collaery, Witness K and David McBride. The Independent National Security Legislation Monitor’s final report made a series of recommendations to overhaul the NSI Act. It found: Alan Johns shows how s 22 [of the NSI Act] can be used to conduct a federal criminal prosecution in ‘secret’ from start to finish and to maintain this secrecy, seemingly, indefinitely. This should not have happened in Alan Johns and it should never happen again. The report identified four aspects of the case that were unusual and one which was “unprecedented”. The unprecedented aspect of the case, the report found, was that no sentencing remarks were ever released publicly. Remarkably, the report found there was nothing stopping the “vast majority” of the sentencing remarks from being published. In 2019, the then watchdog of national security laws, James Renwick, said the secrecy around the Alan Johns prosecution was unprecedented and ought never be repeated. He said: As far as we know there has never been another case, at least in peacetime in Australia, where all of it has been conducted in secret. That is something significant and different, and for my part, I would not like to see it repeated. Renwick initiated the inquiry in 2020. Hope you’re all hungry, looks like the audit office may have just cracked open a few more barrels of pork. There’s been a lot of inflation chatter about today, and this piece sums it all up nicely: Just a reminder that we have answered plenty of questions about parliament (including some you may have been too embarrassed to ask) right over here: The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has asked the National Security Legislation Monitor to review the National Security Information Act, which has been used in the recent prosecutions of Bernard Collaery and Witness J. The monitor, Grant Donaldson SC, recently completed a report on the application of the act in the case of Witness J, who also goes by the pseudonym Alan Johns. The report was tabled in parliament on Thursday. The government is considering its response to the recommendations of that report. But Dreyfus said in a statement that he would be requesting the entire act be reviewed by Donaldson. He said: Today I asked the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM), Grant Donaldson SC, to conduct a review into the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 (NSI Act). This reference responds to the INSLM’s report of the NSI’s application in the ‘Alan Johns’ matter, tabled today in Parliament. The whole of the NSI Act will now be referred to the INSLM for review. This is supported by Mr Donaldson who agrees that a review of the Act is beneficial. The review will consider how the Commonwealth can better balance the vital importance of open justice with the essential need to protect national security. I appreciate Mr Donaldson’s valuable work providing independent oversight of Australia’s national security legislation. The Government is committed to ensuring that the appropriate laws are in place to ensure the proper administration of justice and protect national security information. The Albanese government is dropping a controversial high court case that sought to restore the commonwealth’s power to deport Aboriginal non-citizens. The decision by the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, will guarantee that a dozen Aboriginal non-citizens at risk of deportation will be able to stay in Australia. Dreyfus’s decision also quashes the former Coalition government’s attempt to overturn the landmark precedent of Love and Thoms. In February 2020, the high court ruled that Aboriginal people cannot be aliens, putting them beyond the reach of the immigration minister’s powers to detain and deport non-citizens. The full story is here: There she goes, Amy Remeikis everyone! How does she do it?! The first week of the first sitting is almost over – but there will be plenty more coming next week. Nino Bucci is going to guide you through the rest of the afternoon while I work on a quick review of the week (you can catch that tomorrow) so stay tuned – Nino will make sure you don’t miss anything. Mike Bowers is still out and about and the Guardian team led by Katharine Murphy – Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Tory Shepherd are still all madly beavering away. I’ll be back on the blog early Monday morning – until then, take care of you. Here is a bit more from Mike Bowers: Dan Tehan is booted from question time. Linda Burney makes (even more) history. Peter Dutton confers with the manager of opposition business, Paul Fletcher. Amanda Rishworth, the minister for social services, takes the despatch box. Legislated paid leave welcome but doesn’t solve ‘poverty trap’, advocates say Anti-Poverty Week’s executive director, Toni Wren, has welcomed the legislation to provide 10 days’ paid leave to domestic violence survivors. However, she says it doesn’t solve the “poverty trap”. Poverty is a barrier to women leaving abusive situations, and not all women will be working and therefore able to take advantage of paid leave. Most of them will rely on the “inadequate income support system”, she said. Wren called on the federal government to include solutions for women’s poverty and homelessness when it finalises its national plan to prevent violence against women and children 2022-32. Moreton Labor MP Graham Perrett was the first person booted from question time under 94A by Labor speaker and fellow Queenslander (and electorate neighbour) Milton Dick. Mike Bowers was there to catch the auspicious moment. For those asking, when Marion Scrymgour asked Linda Burney a question, it was the first time an Indigenous woman had asked a question of another Indigenous woman in the House of Representatives. Labor’s Julian Hill calls for Assange extradition to be blocked and charges dropped Labor MP Julian Hill has reiterated his calls for Julian Assange’s extradition to the United States to be blocked by the United Kingdom, and for his espionage charges to be dropped. In a video released alongside an Assange rally outside Parliament House on Thursday, Hill, the member for Bruce, noted that the case was tricky, and said the Australian government was constrained from doing more because the Wikileaks founder had not accepted consular assistance. The independent MPs Andrew Wilkie and Monique Ryan, the Liberal MP Bridget Archer, and Greens senators Jordon Steele-John, David Shoebridge and Peter Whish-Wilson addressed the rally, asking the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to take action. Hill did not attend the rally in-person, but excerpts of an interview he conducted with online outlet Consortium News were played at the event. Hill said reports of the conditions of Assange’s incarceration and physical health were “horribly concerning”. He said it was “entirely appropriate” that Australians keep protesting for Assange’s freedom, but also backed Albanese’s stance of “quiet diplomacy” to resolve the matter. Hill said the PM had made clear “internally and externally” his position that the Assange process should come to an end. Resolving it is not fully in our power. And on that note of mostly unity, question time ends. There is an acknowledgement and a wish of good luck for Australia’s athletes at the Commonwealth Games and the chamber then moves on. Which leads to Peter Dutton saying this: I wanted to join in support of the comments – the opening comments of the minister for defence. Not the flourish at the end, obviously, but this is an issue that’s incredibly important for our country, for our region, it’s important for us to have the strongest possible relationship with our allies, not just the United States and the United Kingdom, but with India, Japan, and others in the region, and we’ll support whatever action the government takes to take the decisions to keep our country safe in a very uncertain world. Marles: Albanese government commited to standing up for Australia’s national interests The defence minister, Richard Marles takes a dixer on national security challenges and says: Australia is facing the most complex set of strategic circumstances we have since the end of the second world war. The global rules-based order that Australia helped build from Bretton Woods onwards and the United States has helped to protect is under more pressure and strain now than at any point since the end of the second world war. The appalling invasion of Ukraine by Russia, a large country seeking to impose itself on a smaller neighbour, through might and power is an example. The UN convention on the law of the sea, freedom of navigation is also under strain. As China seeks to shape the world around it, this raises issues for Australia, not least because China is our largest trading partner. And we value a productive relationship with China and we want to see that relationship in the better place. But while the Australian government has changed our national interests have now and the Albanese government is committed to standing up for Australia’s national interest, particularly when that differs from the actions of other countries, includes China. It’s a time to be working with like minded countries, with our friends. Which is why it was so important the prime minister attend the meeting of the Quad, even though this occurred immediately after the last election, and indeed the prime minister’s presence there was very profound. Since then I have visited every member of the Quad, Japan, India and the United States. What is apparent in each of our bilateral relationships with these countries [is] there’s never been a greater degree of strategic purpose. There’s never been more closeness in our relationship including defence co-operation. So that combined with repairing our relationships with Asean, rebuilding our relationships with the Pacific island countries, makes it clear under this government Australia is back at the table of the international community of nations. And this stands for stark contrast to the government that was led by those opposite over nine years who did nothing other than shout at the world. Strategic policy, foreign policy, it’s not a fundamentalist space. We will engage with sense and with intelligence and precisely because of that Australians will be safer. King: best way to handle foot-and-mouth disease is to help Indonesia get outbreak under control Independent Helen Haines to Catherine King (in her capacity as minister for transport and regional development, presumably): Indi is sheep and cattle country. If foot-and-mouth disease hits Australia the cost to our community will be devastating and the people of Indi are worried. Having grown up on a dairy farm and as someone who still runs beef cattle, I feel this fear too. What are the next steps to strengthen Australia’s biosecurity response and when would the government take those steps? King: Thanks very much. And I thank the member for Indi for her question. I know like all of us who represent regional communities in this place we’re extremely concerned about the risk of foot and mouth disease entering this country. It is ... a concern the Australian government is taking very seriously. It’s why we have put the toughest biosecurity measures the country has ever seen in place. I do thank the member for Indi who attended the backbench briefing provided by senator Watt, the minister yesterday, and for the chief vet. And her staff coming along as well. It’s an important part ensuring we all do our part in making sure messages are getting out, whether you’re in a regional seat like my own, or you’re in another seat, you have people travelling to Indonesia and Bali, you’re all getting consistent messages out. The Australian government has put in place these tough biosecurity measures and they include measures in Indonesia which I outlined to the house yesterday, and measures here in country. But of course we are monitoring the situation closely every single hour, every single day. We continue to take advice from the biosecurity experts in relation to any further measures that are needed. We do know that we need to continue working very closely with our Indonesian counterparts. It is in our national interest that Indonesia gets on top of that. Our embassy in Jakarta is working and engaging with Indonesia at the highest levels and of course we’ve continuing to offer both financial and technical assistance in that. But of course, the very best way – the very best way to ensure that FMD does not come to Australia is to assist Indonesia to get that outbreak under control. And we’re committed to doing everything we can to protect this important Australian industry. Bill Shorten takes a dixer on the proposed royal commission into robodebt and it includes this on what potential questions could be asked – which gives a hint as to who could be called. I work with my colleagues, the attorney general and the minister for social services. The terms of reference will likely go to who was responsible for the design, development, and establishment of the scheme. What questions were ever asked about its legality? What risks were identified? Why were the volume of complaints and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal decisions ignored for four and a half years? This royal commission will start most likely in the last quarter of this year. Hopefully it will be concluded in the first six months of next year. We’re finalising the personnel. But let us be very clear to the people of Australia – if we don’t learn from the mistakes which the previous government has never owned up to, then we can make them again. It’s the very least that we owe to the nearly half a million of our fellow Australians who were illegally attacked by their own government. Wells: 869 more nurses required to fulfil government commitment to 24/7 nursing in aged care Sussan Ley to Anika Wells: My question is to the minister for aged care and sport. I refer the minister to her previous answer and I ask what is the number of additional nurses needed to fulfil the government’s commitment to have 24/7 nursing in aged care? Wells: 869. Points to the staffer who tracked down that number in those intervening three minutes. Anika Wells did not actually provide a number there though. Wells: by 1 July next year 24/7 nurses in aged care will be available The new member for Hughes, Liberal Jenny Ware to Anika Wells: My question is to the minister for aged care and sport: How many additional nurses are needed to fulfil the government’s commitment to have 24/7 nursing in aged care by 2023? Wells: I thank the member for Hughes for her question and I congratulate her on her first speech in the house yesterday and I welcome her to this place. With respect to the question of 24/7 nurses I was so pleased to get to be the minister to introduce that in the House yesterday morning. There were many people from this side of the house yesterday morning witnessing the very first bill through the house in this 47th parliament, to be one to get to the work of reforming aged care, something neglected for nine very long years. Like the minister for the environment, in just nine weeks in the first 100 days, we’re going to deliver 17 and two, 19 recommendations of the royal commission, compared to only nine in 17 months of the previous government. Nine in 17 months, compared to 19 in the first 100 days. One of those goes to 24/7 nurses. If that’s the member for Page, are you coming for me on that? The member for Page, Kevin Hogan: Relevance. I ask the minister, maybe Google it, it’s a number. The answer to that question is a number. There is no point of order. Wells: We estimate that 80% of the facilities around Australia fulfil or nearly fulfil that requirement. We are focused on the 20% of facilities not fulfilling the 24/7 nursing requirement. We need to lift up a standard of care across the country that was neglected for nine years during the previous government and I note this newfound interest in 24/7 nurses they could not find within themselves to support in the Senate in the previous government, in the 46th parliament. This bill that we put through the House yesterday morning would have gone through, but for their inability to support 24/7 nurses. So now you look to me to ask how I’m going to deliver something that you could not do yourselves. Despite the fact that in the Senate, they had the ability in budget week ... in the dying days of the Morrison government, one of the very last things they could have done was legislate 24/7 nurses for older Australians across the country, but you didn’t. You didn’t. So now we will. In the first 100 days we have commenced that legislative process. We’re working with providers to make sure that everyone will have those nurses that come 1 July next year, every single older Australian knows they have access to a nurse when they need it, in their facility, across the country. We’ll do that in tandem with our friends in the industrial movement helping us move forward, in the providers’ association, working with us to make sure that people in regional and rural areas, people in remote areas, can access nurses, have the support they need to do that. I’m pleased and proud this side of the House understands the importance of that. I’m heartened by the question. It suggests there may have been a turnaround in your approach, but I note we wouldn’t be in this position if you had done anything in the past nine years to take aged care seriously. Mark Butler gets a dixer and Luke Howarth (another Queenslander) gets onto his feet again to make a point of order. Speaker Milton Dick: The member for Petrie, you’re continually raising wrong points of order. Howarth is sat down. Albanese: Labor’s powering Australia plan will provide ‘investment certainty’ We go from that historic moment and a call for unity to ... whatever this is. Ted O’Brien: My question goes to the prime minister: You promised a $275 decrease in household power bills. Will you guarantee to the House that Australian families will see that $275 cut? Anthony Albanese: Which goes to the commitment that Labor has through our powering Australia plan. It is indeed ... it is indeed a comprehensive plan that was fully modelled by Reputex. They looked at the full suite of policies we have, including fixing transmission in this country, bringing it through to the 21st century, through our plan to rewire the nation. That was in my first budget reply and that will be the most significant element in terms of – in terms of the changes that will occur. It wasn’t just of course something we came up with. It’s based upon the integrated systems plan of the Australian Energy Market Operator. It’s been out there for such a long period of time, we need to with the rise of renewable energy to make sure we can connect up to the grid so that Australians can benefit from it. ... What we’ve got from those opposite when it comes to energy prices of course, as – it’s about energy prices. Milton Dick: Manager of Opposition Business. Remember, I told you, wait till you get the call and then you can start speaking. Order. The member for McEwen. Rob Mitchell: It is a very simple question, will you guarantee to the House that Australian families will see the $275 cut. Milton Dick: Member for Page, I don’t need any assistance from the cheap seats next to me. The prime minister was asked about a question about his commitment regarding a $275 decrease in household power. He was referring to the policy announcement. I call the prime minister. Albanese: Thanks very much, Mr Speaker. I was referring to our powering Australia plan. I can understand how those opposite are confused by this. Because we actually had a plan. Those opposite ... had a pamphlet ... It was their 22nd pamphlet they had. We have a comprehensive plan... Milton Dick: The Shadow treasurer will cease interjecting. Albanese: ... we’ve a comprehensive plan which is backed by the business council of Australia, backed by the Australian Industry Group, backed by the Australian Chamber of Commerce, backed by the Clean Energy Council, backed by the Australian Conservation Foundation, backed by Greenpeace, backed by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. What every single one of those organisations is saying - is that business needs the investment certainty that they haven’t had for a decade. For a decade. Milton Dick: The prime minister will just resume his seat. The leader of the opposition, we’ve had one question, one standing order moved about relevance. What’s your point of order. Dutton: This is the most tortured answer. Dick: The answer is no. Resume your seat. ...The leader of the opposition will resume his seat. The leader of the opposition will cease interjecting. I want to be clear on this point. There’s one point of order made on relevance. I will not tolerate the standing orders being abused. Albanese: It’s only day two of question time and it’s the second best day they’ll have. (Dutton interjects, warning of “hubris”, but Albanese continues) ...Because ... it doesn’t get better. The truth is those opposite sat on the information knowing that energy prices would go up in July, not only did they sit on it, they refused to tell the Australian people. They knew that was baked in to the wholesale prices and they refused to tell them. Linda Burney on the Uluru Statement from the Heart: ‘history is calling’ The member for Lingiari, Marion Scrymgour – an Aboriginal woman, whose mother was stolen from the Tiwi Islands and who has connections to Central Australia through her father, a member of the Stolen Generation – has asked the minister for Indigenous Australians, Wiradjuri nation member Linda Burney – who did not meet her father and his side of the family until she was 28 years old – a question in the House of Representatives. It’s an historic moment. Scrymgour: My question is to the minister for indigenous Australians: How is the Australian government delivering the Uluru Statement from the Heart, and in particular, progressing an Indigenous voice to parliament in the constitution? Burney: I thank the member for Lingiari for her question and congratulate her on her very powerful speech last night. And I want people in this chamber to note the history is made ... right now with the member for Lingiari asking me this question. Mr Speaker, history is calling us all. The Australian government is committed – as the prime minister just said – to implementing the Uluru statement in full. We will hold a referendum to enshrine a First Nations voice in the constitution this term of parliament. The oldest continuous cultures in the world, something that is a gift to all of us. Despite inhabiting this land for more than 60,000 years we have no place in the founding legal document. It is a glaring omission. This is not a radical proposal. It is fair and it is practical. It is about growing our nation up together. It’s about unity. It’s about hope. It’s about consulting, as the prime minister has just said, Aboriginal and Torres Strait People about laws and policies that affect us. And it is about delivering practical outcomes. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create lasting change. It is one shot in the locker. Every Australian will have the chance to answer the Uluru Statement’s patient call, and I invite them to do so. Uluru was five years ago. Since then there’s been consideration by constitutional experts, First Nations leaders, and parliamentary committees. I believe Australians are ready to take the next step. I want to acknowledge the shadow minister and ... goodwill and involvement in the discussions we’ve had. I’m encouraged by the in-principle support of all state and territory leaders, including premier Perrottet from New South Wales and premier Rockliff from Tasmania. I invite all the members of this place to join us on this journey. This is an issue that does not belong to either side of politics. It is about building a better future. Mr Speaker, history is calling us. Australians believe in decency. And I say to those on the other side, get onto the station, we want you to be on the train with us. One of the blog’s readers in the chamber has just told me there has been at least one instance of a Coalition MP heckling Labor hecklers with “take off your mask, we can’t hear you”. So things are going great. Steggall: Will Labor invest in conservation of heritage sites around Sydney Harbour? Zali Steggall to Tanya Plibersek: Congratulations, and thank you for visiting me with me the Sydney Harbour federation sites in Warringah, iconic places from the North Head sanctuary to Mosman Park, ancestral Indigenous sites and the military map rooms and tunnels where the defence of Sydney was planned. But these sites need to be valued and they’re falling into disrepair. Will you invest in the conservation of these sites? Plibersek: I want to thank the member for Warringah for her question and I want to thank her for going with me and also with the member for North Sydney to see some of these beautiful special places on Sydney Harbour. We are honoured and as is the prime minister, as is the member for Wentworth, honoured ... to represent these areas surrounding our beautiful Sydney harbour here in the national parliament. Sydney Harbour has deep history. 65,000 years of history. Stories told so well by Aboriginal tour groups like Tribal Warrior that sail around the harbour showing tourists the history of the place. (Tribal Warrior is the name of a local Redfern tour group, by the way). As the member for Warringah said, we’ve got military history, convict history, maritime and industrial history and of course the beautiful natural environment, the incredible diversity, biodiversity under the waters of Sydney Harbour, protected and restored so well by the Sydney Institute of Marine Science. I’m excited, as the member for Warringah is and as I know the member for North Sydney is, about two really exciting masterplans that are being developed at the moment by the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust, managing the land of Cockatoo Island and the North Head sanctuary. The member for Warringah is quite right, these areas have been run down in it recent years and neglected by those opposite. I know the prime minister has a special interest in his, because Cockatoo Island is part of his area. He was profoundly influenced by his mentor and my friend Tom Uren. He was a man who took up the lesson of Neils Nielsen, who thought that every Australian, every Sydneysider, should have access to the properties around our harbour, to the beaches and the foreshore and the built environment and the natural environment. That’s the principle that we will always use when they’re considering how we best protect, restore, and maintain these precious sites. On the the missing 448GL of water promised for South Australia Earlier, the Mayo MP Rebekha Sharkie - whose electorate covers the mouth of the river Murray, and other areas that depend on environmental flows - asked the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, about the 450 gigalitres of environmental water promised under the Murray Darling Basin Plan (MDBP). It’s a hot topic at the moment, because those interested in the MDBP are eagerly awaiting the water for the environment special account report. It’s overdue and expected to be tabled next week, and will outline just how tricky it will be to deliver the 450GL. That water is often referred to as water for South Australia, because it’s critical to the health of that end of the river system. But it’s important to point out that the system works as a whole, and if there isn’t enough environmental water, the whole system suffers – and that includes habitats and species. Plibersek was emphatic about the federal government’s intention to deliver the 450GL, but she’s also pretty upfront that it’s going to be hard to meet the 2024 deadline. Earlier today she said all options (including potentially stretching that deadline) were on the table. She told Sky News: It’s an option that I’m looking at, but I’d prefer to get there in the time and that’s why we’re being very ambitious with the options we’re looking at. Every option is on the table to get to that target. But can I say in almost a decade, the previous government returned two of those 450GL for environmental uses, for South Australia in particular. So in almost ten years the previous government got two gigalitres out of 450 that they promised. We’ve got a 2024 deadline to get the other 448GL. It’s challenging. I’m not going to pretend it’s not. The Greens water spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, said it was a “colossal task” but that rather than delaying the water, it should be bought. She said: Anything that pushes back SA and the river Murray getting the water that was promised of course is a breach of what was committed to. Before we jump the shark and start delaying the water for the river and for SA, we need to use the tools that are already in the toolkit, and that’s voluntary buybacks. Plibersek did say she’d already contracted 2GL, pointing out that she’d done that in two months, and it was as much as the former government had secured in almost a decade. A question from Angus Taylor about cost of living Angus Taylor to Jim Chalmers: My question is to the treasurer: Today the treasurer told us he painted a picture. How much will painting that picture reduce the prices of the essential goods and services Australians are buying every day? Chalmers: Yes, thanks very much, Mr Speaker. Look, I want to begin this answer ... with a bit of advice for the member for Hume. That’s to the member of Hume, when these geniuses write you a question when has something to do with energy prices, you should say no thanks, thanks but no thanks. Mate, I would be happy if you asked me 11 questions a day about the energy market. Because every single member of this House knows, and the people of Australia know, that you as the energy minister, the member for Hume as the energy minister is more responsible than anyone for the last decade of policy failures that have driven up the price of energy. If the member wants to ask about the cost of inflation, he should fess up to the fact he knew before the election that energy prices would go up 20 per cent. This is the equivalent of the arsonist whinging about the firefighters taking too long. Those asking us about inflation when their record is almost a decade now of making all of the problems in our economy worse rather than better. It takes a lot of nerve to ask a question about the cost of living. The member for Hume, he wants to talk about his record earlier on today. The member for Hume wrecked the energy market, he rorted the budget, and now he wants to get his hands on the Australian economy. There is of course a point of order attempt (understandably as this does not address the question) but Chalmers has concluded his answer. (As a quick reminder, did you know the Coalition delayed news about power price rises until after the election?) For those asking about masks, some in the Coalition are wearing them (sort of) Albanese: government is taking foot-and-mouth disease response ‘very seriously’ Looks like the “more respectful” parliament is already a thing of the past. David Littleproud to Anthony Albanese: Given that foot and mouth disease will cost the Australian economy $80 billion and hit everyday family budgets for milk and meat, does the Prime Minister agree with Labor agriculture minister Alannah MacTiernan’s statement that FMD won’t be catastrophic and milk and meat will be cheaper? (MacTiernan is the WA agriculture minister and her comments, according to the West Australian newspaper were:“it would not be catastrophic” and that “some people might argue it might actually make (animal products) cheaper because there’ll be more of it available domestically”) Albanese: I thank the Leader of The Nationals for his question. I congratulate him on his election to high office. It must difficult to follow the member for New England in your position but I wish you well. I wish you well. I was aware of FMD and I’m accountable to what happens in this place of course. I was made aware by a tweet on 9 May, 2022 ... And that tweet said that this morning chief veterinary officer briefed me about foot and mouth disease and its presence in Indonesia. There it was, May 9, 2022. You would have expected the person who got that information to have acted, to not be ... in a position to then subsequently [do something] ... to what happens down the track. To look back and say ... People didn’t act early. I heard that yesterday. I heard him say people didn’t act earlier. But the tweet was in fact from David Littleproud, MP ... so, on 9 May ... he was alert to the issue. There is a point of order from a very angry Nationals MP: The question went - the point of order is relevance. This question went quite specifically to Alannah MacTiernan’s very irresponsible statements. And the prime minister needs to address the comments she made... . There is no point of order. Albanese: I am indeed taking the issue seriously. And the government is taking the issue seriously. What we won’t take seriously is someone who says, oh, why didn’t you act earlier, when he was the minister who rang the bell and said this is happening on 9 May and then said, oh ... why didn’t you act earlier? ... They talk about foot and mouth disease... people coming in, where their shoes have been checked off enough, this is the same mob that let the Ruby Princess come in, a bit more noticeable than a pair of shoes was docked at Sydney Harbour, everyone got off and brought Covid here. That was on your watch after you said you stopped the Ruby Princess coming in. After you said we would stop cruise ships entering Australia, they allowed the Ruby Princess to dock. The truth is we’re acting with the strongest biosecurity response in Australia’s history and that is why our response is backed by the National Farmers’ Federation, backed by the cattle industry, you don’t have a simple peak agricultural organisation backing ... your rhetoric. Not one ... Unlike the NFF, they recall that he regards himself as a greater representative of the National Farmers’ Federation. Dutton attacks Labor over $10m construction union donation Peter Dutton: My question is to the prime minister: Since the construction watchdog was last abolished by the prime minister, the militant CFMEU has handed well over $10 million to the prime minister’s party. The watchdog had a 91% success rate in court, prosecuted over 2,500 contraventions, secured over $16m in penalties and recovered wages for 8,000 workers. We understand there’s 10 million workers while your government has taken the side of the corrupt... (Graham Perrett is booted out under 94A by Milton Dick here and Tony Burke raises a point of order) Burke: The issue was raised yesterday about imputations of motive. The section this question is at right now is a direct imputation of motive. It can’t be seen in any other way. I will ask the question to be rephrased or ruled out of order. Paul Fletcher: It goes to the factual circumstances. It’s the factual circumstances around the donations that have been made. Dutton is asked to ask the question again without the imputation. Dutton: Since the construction watchdog was abolished by the prime minister, the militant CFMEU has handed over well over $10 million to the prime minister’s party. The watchdog has had a 91% success rate in court, prosecuted over 2,500 contraventions, secured over $16m in penalties and recovered $5m in wages for over 8,000 workers. Prime minister, we understand that the $10 million paid to the Labor party by the CFMEU has resulted in policy change. What else do they get for their $10m– Dick allows it and says there was a question in there, even though Dutton did not finish. Anthony Albanese: ... I thank the member for his question. And for his showing the workers of Australia that this remains an anti-union party that is obsessed by attacking the rights of trade unions ... to exist. I say this to the honourable member opposite – if unions did not exist in the construction industry... Dutton: The $10m figure is never mentioned by the prime minister. That’s what the CFMEU gave to the Labor party .... Dick dismisses the point of order. Albanese: I’m quite happy to engage in these questions about whether unions should exist in the construction industry. About whether – about whether it is – it is everything to do with it. The truth is those opposite ... do not believe that there should be unions in the construction industry. And if there weren’t unions in the construction industry, the number of deaths on work sites would increase. The number of injuries on work sites would increase. I have been in this place for 26 years and not once have I heard any coalition member speak about safety on construction sites. Not once. Not once. Not once I have seen a criticism of employers who, when left undefended, without the protection of unions, often result in activities that leads to tragedies in those workplaces. Not once. Not once. All workers should be subject to the same laws and regulations as others. That is the simple principle that we on this side hold. The ABCC has not done anything to improve workplace safety. It doesn’t do anything to guard against wage theft, that we will make a crime by the way, that those opposite had the numbers for to create wage theft a crime, and the member’s question went to ... the issue of the retention of wages and paying them back. Well, those opposite actually had legislation before this house that was passed and when it got to the Senate, they redrew the provisions about wage theft being made a crime. The truth is that good unions and employers work together to share a common interest, which is why we’ll be bringing them together at the jobs and skills summit. The next question from Peter Dutton is also on the CFMEU. This is the second day in a row the opposition has focussed on the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the CFMEU. This is despite the warning inflation is headed to 7.75% by the end of the year. Labor MP Graham Perrett first to be thrown out under new speaker And Labor MP and fellow Queenslander Graham Perrett becomes the first MP to be thrown out under Milton Dick’s speakership. As the speaker says: He may be my neighbour, but he is having a holiday. Plibersek: We have contracted as much water in a month to deliver to South Australia as opposition has in a decade Rebekha Sharkie has the first crossbench question today and it is to environment and water minister Tanya Plibersek: My question is to the minister for the Environment and water. I thank the minister for today reaffirming the government’s commitment to deliver the promised 450GL of water to South Australia. Will the minister please detail how the 450GL will be delivered to South Australia by 2024. Plibersek: It’s a very important question and this government shares her concerns to ensure the 450GL of additional environmental water that was promised to South Australia in order for South Australia to sign onto the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is in fact delivered. I support that objective. I know the prime minister supports that objective. I know the members for expense and Boothby, and Makin, and Adelaide, and the minister for health and the minister for social services support that objective. I know the South Australian government is very committed and I spoke again this week to their deputy premier and minister for water about how we deliver on this plan. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan is a good plan. Labor made it, Labor delivered on it, it’s those opposite for almost a decade who have sabotaged the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. And I would be interested to know whether the members for Grey, and Barker, and Sturt also support the delivery of the 450GL of environmental water for the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. I tell you something that makes this a little bit challenging, member for Mayo. What makes it challenging is that in almost a decade those opposite have delivered two out of 450GL of water. Luke Howarth (the Liberal member for Petrie): Relevance: the environment minister is not being relevant to the question. The question said nothing about alternative policies and what happened in the past. Ruling: there is no point of order. Plibersek: Well, Mr Speaker ... I will tell you how we’re delivering on it. In fact, in the two months that I have been the environment minister I have already contracted almost two gigalitres of water towards this 450GL target. I have contracted as much in two months as those opposite have delivered in almost a decade. I will be meeting ... with state environment and water ministers in coming months. I’ll be meeting with the state and ACT water ministers in coming months to make sure we can deliver on this 450GL target. I’ll be making sure that every state, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, the ACT, and South Australia, do what they have promised to do which is return this flow to the system. We’ll increase First Nations water ownership and we’ll take climate change into account in future modelling and planning for the system. We’ll make sure that we release the water for the environment special account report. Guess what, another report they had before the election, and didn’t release. So I can reassure the member for Mayo we’re committed to meeting this target. We’ll work with you to do that. Paul Fletcher goes 0-2 for relevance points of order Anthony Albanese gets a dixer on supply chains and manufacturing and of course points to the previous government’s record (unfavourably) and this upsets Paul Fletcher. Fletcher has resting displeased face at the best of times, but he seems particularly displeased at the moment. Fletcher: The question was about what work is the government doing to bring about that future. It wasn’t an open-ended invitation to criticise the record of the former government. Again, this is said without a shred of irony. There is no point of order. Liberals: why is the prime minister prioritising what the CFEMU wants over what women on worksites need? Sussan Ley (shadow business minister and shadow minister for women, among other roles) to Anthony Albanese: I refer to reports that the construction watchdog investigated Mr Luke Gibson, who allegedly told a female work safety officer to go call the police, off you go, you effing dog. Followed by the C word. By dissolving the construction watchdog, why is the prime minister prioritising what the CFMEU wants over what women on work sites need? Albanese: I thank the member for her question. And at a time when we had an inflation figure yesterday of 6.1%, we have serious economic challenges before us, we have an economic statement given by the Treasurer before this parliament today, we’re back here again. Let me repeat - people, whether they’re employees, or employers, should behave appropriately on every work site and every - every worker - every worker should behave properly. I note yesterday... Ley: On relevance. The issue is not whether the behaviour is unacceptable. Of course it is, we all know that. The issue is the priority is getting rid of the construction watchdog, a tough cop on the beat to address the behaviour. The speaker, Milton Dick rules there is no point of order. Albanese: It’s wrong in any workplace. I have heard people sworn at in this place too. I have heard people behave badly in this workplace too. And it shouldn’t happen. People should behave well in every workplace. But I’m ... asked about the issue of women in workplaces and ... I’ll tell you what the government is doing. We’re adopting all 55 recommendations of the Jenkins report. All 55. Including the obligation ... on employers - including those in the construction industry - to provide safe workplaces for women. That is what we’re doing. And by providing those provisions that we will put into law, employers will have an obligation to provide safe workplaces for women and that will affect the behaviour of everyone in those workplaces. That is what we’re doing. The other thing we’re doing is making gender pay equity an objective of the Fair Work Act, something those opposite would never have done. And we’ll wait to see whether they support it or not. And today of all days I would have thought, if you’re going to ask a question about domestic violence, which is what the first question was about today, or about the position of women and workplaces, you might have asked a question or indeed endorsed the legislation that was introduced just this morning for 10 days’ paid domestic and family violence leave ... It took the election of a Labor government to do that. We think all workplaces should be safe workplaces. We are legislating to do just that. And the approach of those opposite today says more about them than anything else. The treasurer Jim Chalmers gets a dixer on the “growing challenges facing Australia’s economy” and begins pointing the finger at the Coalition. The Liberals’ Paul Fletcher has a point of order, (and this is said without irony) We’ve now got the treasurer launching into an attack on this side. The point of order is relevance. It didn’t contain any reference to alternative approaches. Even when questions relate to alternative approaches, speaker Smith has said there’s a restriction on what the minister at the box can cover. He needs to stick to the question. Ruling: there is no point of order. More on the cashless debit card Amanda Rishworth (the minister for social services) takes over: Of course, the leader of the opposition hasn’t quite got his correlation and his causation right. He just said the University of Adelaide report led to a change. I’m going to quote from the University of Adelaide report. Peter Dutton: On relevance, Mr Speaker. I’m not interested in causation. I’m interested in... Milton Dick: There’s no point of order. Resume your seat. The minister was referring to the report when you took the point of order. I call the minister. Rishworth: ... those opposite have insisted the University of Adelaide report in January supported the cashless debit card. What they have failed to point out is that the evidence was inconclusive. The study found any reduction in alcohol and drug use could not be directly attributed to the effect of the card. They failed to acknowledge that the report found that the cashless debit card introduced widely-felt and costly hurdles in relation to financial planning and money managed. And a large proportion of CDC participants said their quality of life was affected in a negative way. We have this ANAO (Australia National Audit Office) report that the minister has failed to listen to either. I will go to the conclusion that the most recent ANAO report has said, and that said that it did not demonstrate that the CDC program is meeting its intended objective, need I say more. Peter Dutton manages to get “woke” into his first question, if you want to know how the day is going. (He is also continuing to disparage the very communities which punished the Liberal party the hardest during the election, so I guess he isn’t interested in winning those seats back as yet) Dutton: Research from the university of Adelaide showed the Cashless Debit Card led to a 23% decrease in gambling and 45% of people believed it had improved their lives. To please a inner city woke audience, you have abolished the card, it will result in high incidences of domestic violence and assault in Indigenous communities. Why make a bad situation worse? Anthony Albanese: I thank the leader of the opposition for his question ... We went to the election with a very clear position of abolishing the cashless debit card and we did so. We did so because of the impact it had on a part of privatising the welfare system ... we had a welfare system that was paid for, paying a private company to engage in activity with for-profit motive, and which was resulting in ... issues being imposed on communities and on individuals, without them having ... any say in that. One of the things we have done is to make sure we’re about empowering communities, not taking power away from them. That’s an important distinction between our attitude and the attitude of those opposite. Not a patronising position that says we know best, not one that ... extended the cashless debit card into ... communities, not just ... in Indigenous communities, it was imposed on other communities as well, and that is why we went to an election with a very clear position and we stand by that and that’s why we’ll be legislating [to] achieve our objective. Petition on improving Workforce Australia and helping welfare recipients attracts 31,000 signatures The Greens senator Janet Rice has accepted a petition with 31,000 signatures calling for improvements to Workforce Australia and the punitive employment services model put in place by the Morrison government and continued by the Albanese government. Australian Unemployed Workers’ Union spokesperson, Jeremy Poxon, said: While there are still so many parts of Workforce Australia currently on fire – and so many welfare recipients in a state of panic – it’s disturbing that the new government is continuing to enforce mutual obligations. Every time a welfare system fails, we know the people in the system are always the ones who suffer. During this period of mass system failure, it’s obscene that this government is still forcing people to attend face-to-face activities during this new Covid wave. We continue to hear stories of people being forced to travel hundreds of kilometres to attend appointments. We continue to hear stories from immunocompromised people – terrified of contracting Covid – being forced by providers to attend meetings. It would cost the government nothing to suspend all activity requirements and punishments to keep low-income people safe from Workforce Australia’s many failures. It’s nothing but sheer malice and cruelty that they’re still refusing to do this. Poxon was backed by Antipoverty Centre spokesperson and welfare recipient Kristin O’Connell: Unemployed advocates are still being flooded with messages from people in distress, people being bullied, people who feel this system is intended to kill them, people who tell me they are being pushed towards suicide. Even though “mutual” obligations don’t work and poverty stops people getting a job, they continue to ignore the overwhelming evidence of this. The government needs to stop seeing unemployed people as a product and serving them up as fodder for their political donors who run these cruel job agencies. GetUp hosted the petition. The organisation’s director of economic fairness, Rafi Alam, said: The Morrison government pushed this legislation through with little consultation and rushed its implementation – now we’re seeing the disastrous consequences play out for people in poverty. GetUp’s petition signed by more than 31,000 people shows the community wants to see the end of decades of senseless punishment of unemployed people. We’ve laid out immediate action that needs to be taken and urge the Labor government to get it done. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732. A little more from Mike Bowers: The opposition began filling the chamber after Jim Chalmers started his speech. Coalition MPs were all there in support by the time Angus Taylor started his reply: Hi folks, there’s nothing massively new about this exchange between a Sky News host and the environment minister Tanya Plibersek this morning, but it’s just worth noting. If you’ve been following the discussions about Labor’s climate bill – the one that enshrines the 2030 and 2050 targets – you’ll know there’s some discussion about a “climate trigger”. This is the short version of that back-and-forth: the Greens want one. Will Labor consider implementing one? (If you don’t know what a climate trigger is, it’s simple. A climate trigger would force an assessment of the climate impacts of new developments to be required to go through environmental approvals.) Anyway, Plibersek was asked this morning would she consider inserting a climate trigger in a revamp of environmental law. Would that convince the Greens to vote for the targets bill? Plibersek: Well what they’re talking about is changing our environmental laws so that a project can be stopped because it might add to greenhouse gas emissions. And it is important that we update our environmental legislation. The previous government got a review from Prof Graeme Samuel a couple of years ago that made very clear that our environmental laws are just not fit for purpose. They’re not fit for the needs of business, they are slow, they are cumbersome, they often duplicate what’s happening at a state level, but they’re also not protecting our environment. The state of the environment report last week showed us that our environment is bad, it’s been getting worse and it’s on track to get even worse still. So we need to upgrade our laws and we’ve got a mapped-out plan to do that. Sky host: Sure. Plibersek: We’ll respond first to Prof Graeme Samuel’s review and then we’ll draft legislation then. The Greens are welcome ... to make submissions on what those laws should look like, but I have to say Prof Samuel didn’t recommend an environmental trigger. He said that the laws that relate to carbon pollution and emissions reductions and climate change, that’s the proper place for making those decisions. Sky host: Okay, so you’d be inclined to follow him? Plibersek: Well, you know, I’m going to take my time and do it properly. The amazing thing about what Prof Samuel came up with is, he got environmental groups on one hand, and business groups on the other hand to agree to the vast bulk of the changes that he was suggesting to our environmental laws. I think that’s a really good starting point. Liberals: Labor more intent on making sure ‘union masters’ are paid than dealing with inflation Bridget McKenzie, who is now the shadow minister for infrastructure, is speaking to the ABC about how the government needs to do all it can to bring down inflation (Labor has been in power a little under 10 weeks). McKenzie: The government needs to throw the kitchen sink at this. Australians are struggling each and every day, whether they are at the supermarket, whether [they’re] at the petrol station, or indeed getting quotes on house construction. With the inflation that is actually going through our economy right now, we know that one of the ways to put downward pressure on inflation is to actually decrease and dampen government spending. We need to see this government take a serious approach to budget repair, [but] will need to make sure that when they are making those decisions about budget repairs, that they are not also slashing aspects of the budget which lead to increased productivity measures such as ... a lot of measures for rural and regional Australia, telecommunications and the like that are going to increase productivity and therefore benefit the overall economy so those decisions are going to be very tough. The Labor party, if we can look at their first eight to 10 weeks as a government, it seems [are] more intent [on] mak[ing] sure they paid ... [their] union masters on any given policy agenda item rather than actually doing what they promised [during] the election which was ... dealing with the cost of living pressure on Australians ... so there’s a lot of work to do for Labor between now and the October [budget]. Politicians across the political spectrum have called on the new Albanese government to do more in pressing for the freedom of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. More than 100 people rallied on the front lawn of federal Parliament House this afternoon, asking the federal government to work against the extradition of Assange to the United States to face espionage charges. Independent MPs Andrew Wilkie and Monique Ryan, Liberal MP Bridget Archer and Greens Jordon Steele-John, senator David Shoebridge and Peter Whish-Wilson addressed the rally, asking the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to take action. Wilkie, a long-time supporter of Assange, said there was “absolute urgency” required from the government. I have a lot of respect for Anthony Albanese, and I’m mindful that he said recently that some things should not be handled with a megaphone. But frankly, we have given this government a fair bit of time now. Please maintain the rage. Keep the pressure on the new guy. Archer said it was the “duty” of the government to intervene to help an Australian in trouble overseas. This is a question of compassion for an Australian citizen who has endured inhumane conditions and suffered significant mental and physical challenges as a result of his ongoing incarceration. The Labor MP Julian Hill sent a video message to the rally. We’re working to track down that video for you now. In a statement, Wilkie called for Assange’s extradition to be dropped and for him to return to Australia, with his office saying he will “call again for common sense and media freedom to prevail”. It has always been a political matter and the Australian Government can’t keep kowtowing to the whims of Washington. I have no doubt Mr Albanese has enough influence and good relationships to pick up the phone and end this madness. It’s beyond time for the government to say enough is enough and to bring Julian home. Question time looms It is the downhill slide into question time. The dixers are still terrible, so that hasn’t changed, but Milton Dick looks like he is having the time of his life as Speaker. No one has been booted out as yet, but you know it is coming. If you haven’t seen it, here is how Murph saw the first outing. What influence do minor parties actually have? Sometimes, whether a law is made or changed depends on the vote of a minor party or single independent. Minor parties, like the Greens, have a smaller team of members elected to parliament than major parties like Labor, or a coalition of parties like the Liberal Nationals. If minor parties don’t form a coalition with another party, they sit with the independents on the crossbench (that’s the curved corner of the Senate and House of Representatives horseshoe). Even though their numbers are smaller, minor parties can make things a bit complicated for the major ones when they hold the balance of power. The balance of power When a major party or coalition has more than half of the seats in the House of Representatives, it holds the absolute majority. But when it doesn’t, minor parties and independents have the power to sway the outcome of an issue when the government and opposition disagree. This usually unfolds in the Senate – where the final votes on a bill happen before it can be passed as legislation. Here is what the makeup of our current parliament looks like This is what we mean when we talk about the pain going on for some time, courtesy of Grogs: Here are the latest coronavirus numbers from around Australia today, as the country records at least 125 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 1 Cases: 1,000 In hospital: 149 (with 2 people in ICU) NSW Deaths: 34 Cases: 15,704 In hospital: 2,282 (with 65 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 0 Cases: 454 In hospital: 61 (with no people in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 27 Cases: 7,364 In hospital: 955 (with 32 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 17 Cases: 3,957 In hospital: 339 (with 11 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 4 Cases: 1,175 In hospital: 176 (with 4 people in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 37 Cases: 12,154 In hospital: 852 (with 33 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 5 Cases: 4,961 In hospital: 418 (with 16 people in ICU) What goes on in the party rooms? While parliament is sitting (like it is right now), every party holds a weekly party meeting in their party room. And no, plus ones are not allowed (the meetings are highly confidential). At these meetings, parties sort out and plan their teamwork in parliament. They elect party leaders, ministers and whips (team managers). They also agree on party policy and organise steps forward on particular bills. BUT – and there is always a but – there is a Canberra tradition of a post party room briefing, where a nominated MP reads out the minutes of the meeting, giving a very brief run down of what was discussed, and journalists can ask questions. No names are ever given, and it is usually “a MP asked about XX” with not too much detail, but it’s enough for journalists to then run them down, with their own sources. Not all party room discussions are released this way, but most are. Just another Canberra tradition quirk. Australia not expected to go into recession: Chalmers Earlier this morning Jim Chalmers was asked about whether a recession was a potential outcome of these economic circumstances, and said: It’s not Treasury’s expectation that we will go into recession in Australia. We have grave fears for the global economy of course, as others do too, but here in Australia our economy is expected to continue to grow but so are our economic challenges in the near term. We’ve got a lot of things going for us in Australia and I am optimistic about the future of our economy and the future of our country. But first we’ve got to brace for some particularly heavy weather in our economy. I’m confident that Australia will weather this storm as they have others in recent times. But we need to be upfront about the nature and scale of these challenges so that we can get through it together. Peter Hannam’s initial analysis of treasurer’s economic outlook Lots to digest from Jim Chalmers economic statement. One word absent from the Treasurer’s speech was “recession”. The textbook definition is two consecutive quarters of contraction, and there’s no sign of that in the revised forecasts. Phew. In general, though, the statement was an attempt at setting a baseline – one that will be reinforced with the October budget – for the new government. The budget we inherited is bursting with waste and rorts, booby-trapped by expiring measures, and burdened by long-term demographic challenges that come with critical and necessary spending,” he said, repeating lines that we’ve heard before. The updated numbers are interesting but if the success of forecasts in the past couple of years is any guide, we can probably take them with a hefty dosage of salt. By October, there will be new numbers - and higher interest rates - to feed into the models. The famous $1 trillion debt load will start to cost a lot more to service, an expenditure that will grow faster than the NDIS and other costs. Interestingly, defence was not mentioned but that growth rate will be significant in the future. One almost guaranteed upside - which will probably show up in the October budget - will come from commodities. The Treasury has to be conservative but the $US55 a tonne for iron ore is about half the current price. Coking coal used in steelmaking is pencilled in at $US130 a tonne or less than half the current going rate. Thermal coal is estimated at $US60 a tonne compared with the $US300-plus rate globally as Europe in particular scrambles to gear up for less Russian gas (and coal) because of their evil war on Ukraine. Of course, we need to be weaning ourselves off fossil fuels because of climate chaos even if that’s not an obvious objective of the Albanese government. Ministerial statements should look forwards, not backwards: Speaker Murph has an update for those who are following along with the standing orders: The treasurer’s key message? Things will get worse before they get better Our economics correspondent Peter Hannam will be bringing you more on this, but the big message out of the treasurer’s economic statement was that things are going to get even tougher. And there doesn’t look like there will be any cost of living relief coming. There is an inflationary aspect to that, but on a human level, there is also a lot of pain. Because wages haven’t kept pace with inflation for much of the past 10 years. So it is not a case of wanting to buy more and being unable to do so for many people – it’s about wanting to buy the same and being unable to do so. The money just does not stretch as far any longer. And over the few months, it is going to stretch even less. Even with inflation coming down, Treasury still expects inflation to sit above 5 % by the middle of next year, which is still high. But the key takeaway in these numbers is the inflation forecasts, which are nasty. This is what Jim Chalmers had to say on that: Forecasts are never perfect, but these better reflect the economic circumstances our new government is now dealing with – compared with what was set out before the election. In the pre-election forecasts – released a little more than three months ago – inflation was expected to peak at 4 1⁄4 per cent. It’s already 6.1 per cent through the year to June, and now forecast to peak at 7 3⁄4 per cent in the December quarter this year. The current expectation is that it will get worse this year, moderate next year, and normalise the year after. We haven’t reached the peak yet – but we can see it from here. Treasury expects headline inflation at 5 1⁄2 per cent by the middle of next year, 3 1⁄2 per cent by the end of 2023, and 2 3⁄4 per cent by the middle of 2024 – back inside the RBA’s target range. Chalmers: ‘We have it within us to stare down these threats’ And he finishes on a positive note: We have it within us to stare down these threats, steer our way through this difficult period, and seize the opportunities of this new age. With an economy and a budget as resilient as the Australian people themselves. And with optimism and confidence that our best days lie beyond. Treasurer hits out at previous government ‘for a wasted decade’ Jim Chalmers upsets the Coalition MPs in the chamber with these lines: Australians are paying a hefty price for a wasted decade. They know their new government didn’t make this mess, but we take responsibility for cleaning it up. In our first few months in government –the scope and scale of the challenges left for us to tackle – some parts known, other parts hidden – have been made clear. These challenges are confronting for all Australians, but we are not daunted. Because in these first few months, we have also been comforted, encouraged and energised by the sense of cooperation and common purpose Australians share. ‘Hard decisions necessary’ to repair budget: Chalmers On the budget: A full set of fiscal forecasts will be ready for the October Budget. But we already know that additional Covid-related expenditure so far costs the Budget an extra $1.6bn this year. We expect that government payments will be around $30bn higher over the forward estimates than was forecast pre-election, because of inflation and wage expectations and how they flow through. We know that the debt burden left to us – the highest level as a share of the economy since the aftermath of the second world war, with deficits stretching beyond the decade – is growing heavier because the impact of higher interest rates on repayments. This is not just Covid debt we are repaying – our predecessors had more than doubled gross debt before the pandemic hit. And we know that the interest payments on government debt will be the fastest growing area of government spending – faster than the NDIS, aged care and hospital funding. For these reasons – our government must make the hard decisions necessary for responsible budget repair. Unemployment to remain low through 2023 but inflation will hurt real wages: Chalmers Jim Chalmers moves to wages and employment: This complex picture is reflected in the updated outlook for unemployment and wages. The unemployment rate is expected to remain low through the latter half of this year before returning to 3 3⁄4 per cent by June 2023 and 4 per cent by June 2024. At the same time, the forecast for nominal wages growth is being upgraded – from 3 1⁄4 per cent to 3 3⁄4 per cent – both for this financial year and next financial year. If this eventuates – and I’m careful, cautious and conscious of the history here – it would be the fastest pace of nominal wages growth in about a decade. The harsh truth is – households won’t feel the benefits of higher wages while inflation eats up wage increases, and then some. Real wages growth relies on moderating inflation and getting wages moving again. Based on current forecasts, real wages are expected to start growing again in 2023-24. And there is a key difference now. Australian workers now have a government with an economic plan to boost wages, not deliberately undermine them. Having a look at the chamber, and it does not seem like many Coalition MPs are in the house to hear this statement. Labor’s benches are filled (as you would expect) but the opposition seems to have more than a few empty seats. Jim Chalmers turns to GDP: It’s expected that real GDP grew by 3 and 3⁄4 per cent in 2021-22, instead of 4 and 1⁄4 per cent as was estimated pre-election. The pre-election forecast for GDP growth in 2022-23 was 3 1⁄2 per cent. This has now been revised down to 3 per cent growth. And growth is expected to slow further in 2023-24, at 2 per cent – down from the 2 1⁄2 per cent previously predicted. A key part of this weaker growth outlook is due to weaker consumption, reflecting higher inflation and higher interest rates. While some households have built up savings buffers, others are under much more pressure. Net exports will also be a bigger-than-expected drag on growth in the near term – as flooding hits commodity exports, and as imports increase with businesses restocking. Weaker dwelling investment is also part of the story – because of higher interest rates, but also the capacity constraints in construction. That’s what I mean by a growing economy, but with growing challenges as well. Inflation to keep rising to 7.75% before falling next year: Chalmers Jim Chalmers says he expects inflation to keep rising and peak at 7.75%, but he expects it will improve next year and fall to 3.5% by the end of 2023: We haven’t reached the peak yet – but we can see it from here. Treasury expects headline inflation at 5 1⁄2 per cent by the middle of next year, 3 1⁄2 per cent by the end of 2023, and 2 3⁄4 per cent by the middle of 2024 – back inside the RBA’s target range. Inflation will unwind again, but not in an instant. Just as the domestic forces contributing to some of the supply side pressures have been building for the best part of a decade, it will take some time for them to dissipate – but they will. In the meantime, higher interest rates, combined with the global slowdown I’ve described, will impact on Australia’s economic growth. The national accounts in the March quarter showed that the economy had not been performing as strongly as had been predicted pre-election – we saw 0.8 per cent growth instead of 1.8 per cent growth. And the headwinds our economy is facing – higher inflation at the top of that list, along with slowing global growth – are now reflected in the revised economic outcomes and forecasts. This has cut half a percentage point from growth for the last financial year, for this financial year, and for next financial year. The treasurer is on his feet in the House of Representatives, delivering his long-awaited economic update. This is the precursor to the budget – which is going to be rough. He says “the outlook is confronting”. Jim Chalmers: The Australian economy is growing – but so are the challenges. Some are home-grown, others come from around the world. As [RBA] governor [Philip] Lowe and I were reminded at the G20 meeting a fortnight ago – the global picture is complex, and the outlook is confronting. The world economy is treading a precarious and perilous path. Higher global inflation. Slower global growth. Ongoing conflict. The impacts of Covid. Clogged supply chains. All of this affects us, in some form. At the G20 meeting, the IMF flagged they would again be revising down their global growth forecasts. And this week, they have – significantly downgrading the outlook for global growth in both 2022 and 2023. These downgrades are broadly in line with Treasury’s updated outlook for the global economy. The Treasury is forecasting global growth of 3 1⁄4 per cent in each of the next three years, which is half a percentage point weaker in 2022 and 2023 than expected in the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook. Col Boyce praises coal in first speech to parliament The new Liberal-National MP for Flynn, Col Boyce, has delivered his COAL IS GREAT LONG LIVE COAL first speech in the parliament. He is the one standing up (it can be a little confusing at times telling some of this part of the backbench apart). Boyce comes from the Queensland parliament, where he also sat in opposition, so he is maybe a little more used to the pace than some of his new colleagues. What are caretaker conventions? At every federal election, the House of Representatives and half the Senate are dissolved (because new members of parliament are about to be elected to fill their seats again). This means there is technically no chamber that the government is responsible for between when the election is called and when there is an election result. In the interim, the government enters caretaker mode, and makes decisions under caretaker conventions. It is basically a support mechanism that makes sure the normal administrative work of government departments can continue. Conventions are rules that work with (but are much more flexible than) the constitution and other legislation, to underpin how Australia’s government runs. The caretaker conventions are followed by all levels of governments when there is an election. They include avoiding making major policy decisions, entering major agreements or making major appointments that could drag a new government into a commitment. But there is room to make major decisions under caretaker mode if urgent. For example, to grant urgent drought relief. The government consults the opposition and, if they agree, the government is good to go. Independent MP Kate Chaney gives first speech to parliament There are a lot of first speeches to get through. The new, independent, MP for Curtin, Kate Chaney is no stranger to politics. Her uncle, Fred, was a minister in the Fraser government, and her grandfather, Fred Snr was a minister in the Menzies government. Chaney ran as an independent because she did not think the Liberal party represented her beliefs any longer. And she was one of the many who wanted to see change. She recounted coming to the federal parliament as a child and seeing a man eating a banana with a knife and fork and how strange a place it seemed. That’s something we can all relate to, I think. Katter calls press conference to discuss ‘persecution of Christianity’ in Australia Bob Katter is joining the troll train (did he ever leave?), calling a media conference to discuss the “continued persecution of Christianity in Australia”, something which is not happening. He is late to his press conference. One can only assume he stumbled into another confected culture war on the way to the Mural Hall. For those looking at the detail of the CPI increase: Anthony Albanese parrots a pro-coal talking point Graham Readfearn has looked at Anthony Albanese’s claim Australia’s coal is high quality and therefore better for the environment compared to coal from other countries. It’s an old line, used by leaders of all persuasions in Australia. But is it true? The Albanese government this week put a bill before parliament to legislate its 2030 emissions reductions target of 43% based on 2005 levels. Enshrining the target into law will help “end the climate wars”, Albanese has promised. But choosing to repeat a pro-coal talking point that’s been fired like a missile during those wars seems at odds with that promise. “It’s a meme and it’s disappointing and disturbing that the Albanese government has picked this up,” says Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics. “It’s an argument that’s been pushed by the coal industry for as long as I can remember. When it comes down to CO2 emissions it has never had much credibility.” But is there any truth to the claim? “No. It’s an old myth,” Hare says. “The savings would be very small and if there was data it would be difficult to measure.” The chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, has declared that monkeypox is a “communicable disease incident of national significance”. He says this follows the World Health Organization declaring the global situation regarding monkeypox to be a public health emergency of international concern. Kelly said: The latest data from 1 January to 28 July 2022 as reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) indicates there have been 20,311 MPX cases in 71 countries (including Australia) that have not historically reported MPX. In Australia, there have been 44 cases – the majority of which have been within returned international travellers. The good news – it’s not as bad as Covid. Kelly said: It is far less harmful than COVID-19 and there have been no deaths reported during the current outbreak outside of countries where the virus is endemic. MPX is also not transmitted in the same way as COVID-19 – and is far less transmissible. Kelly gave more details on the response, symptoms and who is affected: The National Incident Centre has been activated to provide enhanced national coordination to assist states and territories to effectively manage the outbreaks within their jurisdictions. MPX’s rash and flu-like symptoms are relatively mild, and in most cases, resolve themselves within two to four weeks without the need for specific treatments. Most cases of MPX in Australia have been among people aged 21 to 40 years. The experience internationally and in Australia to date is most cases have been among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Although MPX is not usually considered a sexually transmissible infection, physical contact with an infected person during sexual intercourse carries a significant risk of transmission and intimate physical contact such as hugging, kissing and sexual activities represent a risk of infection, with infectious skin sores being the likely mode of transmission. The rash usually occurs on the face before spreading to other parts of the body, including the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. However, in this outbreak it is being seen especially on the genital and perianal regions of affected people. The rash can vary from person to person and take on the appearance of pimples, blisters or sores. The flu-like symptoms often include fever, chills, body aches, headaches, swollen lymph nodes and tiredness. The National Medical Stockpile has available stock of MPX treatments, such as antivirals, for states and territories to access on request. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) has updated clinical guidance on vaccination against monkeypox using the ACAM2000 vaccine to include the use of MVA-BN vaccine to prepare for supplies of the third-generation vaccine being made available in Australia. Albanese to appear on the ABC’s Insiders Capping off a big first week of parliament, the prime minister will appear on Insiders on Sunday. What are the pretty boxes on the tables in the parliament? Two ornamental chests of rosewood, decorated with silver swirls and locks, sit on the central table in the House of Representatives – one beside the prime minister, the other by the leader of the opposition. They are called despatch boxes, and are used to rest speeches and documents when a minister is addressing the House (AKA when they “speak from the despatch box”). The box on the PM’s side of the table also holds documents and religious books for swearing in new members. They come from British tradition, and are a parliamentary symbol of Australia’s House of Representatives’ link to the British House of Commons (do you see a pattern here?). Back in the 1600s, despatch boxes were used to transport documents to the House of Commons in the UK. Two boxes in the House of Commons were destroyed by a bomb during the second world war – the boxes we use in Australia’s parliament are a replica of those. They were gifted by King George V when Australia’s Old Parliament House opened in 1927, with inscriptions from the king inside each lid. Further to the point that any wage growth has been wiped out: The Liberal MP for Hughes, Jenny Ware, has given her first speech to parliament, promising to help “rebuild the Liberal party” in Hughes, New South Wales and beyond. Ware said this would include “embracing our females”, saying she did not accept that the Labor party is “the only natural home of Australian women”. She noted the Liberal party’s founder, Robert Menzies, often spoke about the “need for women in our party and in our parliament”. Ware noted family and domestic violence was a “leading concern” in her electorate, and suggested the federal government could do more like funding women’s refugees. Ware also promised to help develop policy “within the Liberal brand of a strong economy and fair society”. She noted that in Hughes the average house price is $1.5m, calling for an environment that supports “broader housing choices” including for the 30% of people who will always rent, such as more secure tenure and longer term leases. Ware argued there is a “need to address climate change” and backed nuclear power: Embracing the transition to clean energy will create 100,000s of new jobs. How do we transition … while still providing affordable and reliable energy to households and businesses? As coal was essential to the industrial revolution in Britain and Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries to propel us into modernity. We now need to move into the next economy without total reliance on coal. This can only be done with hybrid models of renewable energy and must include nuclear. Hughes has the only nuclear reactor in Australia … I am committed to approaching how we can utilised the technology and innovation developed in ANSTO … to answer our energy questions. While my 15-year-old self with a bedroom full of Midnight Oil posters and records would be shuddering, the nuclear of 2022 is a very different thing to the nuclear of the past. Going into the future, as we develop an energy policy to provide sufficient baseload power, the research already undertaken … at ANSTO should then become part of our national solution to our current energy crisis.” Cute baby in the Senate alert Stevie is not the first baby in the Senate, or even the first infant – but it will never stop being cute. Labor’s Nita Green brought in the special guest with her as she carried out her Senate duties this morning: Anytime the separation of powers is mentioned, I flashback to this press conference with the shadow attorney general of Queensland in 2016 Why does our government have three arms? In Australia, the power of our government is split into three parts – the parliament, executive and judiciary. This is called the separation of powers, and is outlined in our constitution. It basically stops one big governing body from getting too powerful. The separation of powers works like this: The parliament is where laws can be made and changed. It is made up of the governor general, the Senate and the House of Representatives. This arm is also known as the legislature (because of its power over creation of legislature). The executive is where the governor general, prime minister and ministers put law into action and enforce them. And the judiciary is where judgements on law are made, by federal courts like the high court. The idea is that Australia maintains a responsible government where the party or coalition in charge is held accountable by the parliament and judiciary to not abuse their power. This principle is pretty ancient. (Literally, it can be dated back to ancient Greece, and was written about in 1748 by French philosopher Montesquieu, whose work is still foundational to the development of democratic countries today.) At 12.30pm today, Jim Chalmers will deliver his economic statement. For those asking, it does not materially change anything. But it is a giant flashing neon sign as to what direction the October budget will be heading in. Independents Monique Ryan and Allegra Spender embrace Our photographer Mike Bowers was in the chamber for Dr Monique Ryan’s first speech and caught this moment between her and Allegra Spender: Ministers meet First Nations women Linda Burney and Amanda Rishworth are meeting with First Nations women today to discuss plans to end violence. From their statement: Federal Ministers will today meet with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advisory Council on family, domestic and sexual violence to discuss the Albanese Labor Government’s commitment to ending violence against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and children. The meeting will discuss the work of the Advisory Council in leading the development of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Action Plan as part of the National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children 2022-32. Thirty-four people died of Covid in NSW yesterday and 37 people died in Victoria. This is a very rough winter for a lot of people – and there are still weeks to go. Health authorities have said they don’t know when the peak of this latest Covid wave will hit. Your questions about Australian parliament answered You have been asking some really great questions, and Rafqa Touma has done an outstanding job in answering them, so we have collated the main ones and put them in one file for your convenience. There are a couple more questions Rafqa and I will be answering today – but we will do this again as the parliamentary year goes on. I hope you have learned some new things (it keeps you young) – until someone asked, I didn’t know that “picfac” was an Australian thing. Thanks to everyone for being so curious. ‘We can Close the Gap by putting First Nations people in charge of our own communities’ Greens senator Lidia Thorpe has released a statement in response to the report that Australia is still failing to meet three-quarters of its Close the Gap targets: If the Albanese Government has any backbone, they will implement all of the recommendations from the Bringing them Home report and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. First Nations people are sick of hearing about the continued failures of Closing the Gap, we demand action from this so-called progressive Government who says that Blak Lives Matter. We have the solutions. We’ve known how to Close the Gap for over 30 years. First Nations people are taking their lives because they can’t see a future for themselves in this system. Survivors of the stolen generation are seeing a new generation of our children being stolen. Over 500 people have died in custody since the Royal Commission and no one has been held accountable. It’s devastating. The Joint Council on Closing the Gap shows us that advisory bodies don’t work. Every year, they tell us how bad we’re doing. The Albanese Government needs to listen to the voices that have already spoken and go back to the incredible work that our old people have done. Everyone does better when we’re free to make our own choices. We can Close the Gap by putting First Nations people in charge of our own communities through Treaty. The area’s where we’re seeing progress shows us that putting First Nations people in the driver’s seat works. The area’s where we’re going backwards are areas that successive Governments have chosen to ignore, for over 30 years. They have the solutions and they choose to ignore them. This is your chance to do the right thing, Labor. Mike Bowers was in the chamber as Tony Burke introduced the paid domestic and family violence leave legislation: Kooyong MP Monique Ryan delivers maiden speech The independent MP for Kooyong, Monique Ryan, is delivering her first speech. In it, Ryan is gracious to her predecessor, the former treasurer Josh Frydenberg, describing him as a “well-respected member of this place”. But she also delivers a sensational backhander about the choice the electors of Kooyong made: Kooyong has always been a seat held by conservative politicians – since it was formed in 1944, the Liberal party has always held Kooyong. The last time an incumbent lost his seat in Kooyong was 1922. Proof positive, Mr Speaker, that not all once-in-a-century events are bad. Ryan credits Kooyong’s previous members, including Sir Robert Menzies, Andrew Peacock and Petro Georgiou who she describes as “true liberals; they recognised that open markets are the best way to boost prosperity” and “committed to protecting individuals’ rights”: I hope to honour that legacy by representing the electorate with dedication, integrity and effect. I am the first woman, and the first independent, to represent this electorate. I will not be the last. Ryan describes climate change as “the greatest challenge for our generation”: We have lived through a wasted decade of ineffective action on climate change. As a doctor, researcher and scientist, my job has always been to care for children and to protect their futures. I stood for election for the seat of Kooyong because I felt – and the people of Kooyong felt – that our previous government was not doing that. In recent years, the effects of the climate emergency have become apparent to us all. Science has shown us that we need increased ambition and urgent action in our rapid transition to a net zero emissions world. We stand on the precipice of a great opportunity: a transformation to a new clean energy economy - an economy which will not need to rely on volatile markets and international security for a secure energy supply. An economy away from polluting fuels and combustion vehicles to quiet electric vehicles and clean air for our children. Our renewable energy resources are the envy of the world. We can use these natural advantages to bring down the cost of electricity for households: to protect our elderly neighbours from heatwaves; to ensure Australian families don’t have to decide between heating or food; to support our small and large businesses; and, to help position our country as the natural home of energy-intensive industries in the Asia- Pacific. She also describes Kooyong’s choice at this election in terms that suggested it was an act of solidarity with communities harmed by global heating: To the rural communities of western NSW and Queensland with farms and towns hit by drought – the people of Kooyong voted for you. To the people of Cobargo and Mallacoota and Kangaroo Island, whose homes burned during that black summer – Kooyong voted for you. To the people of Lismore and Woodburn whose houses have this year been inundated again and again by flood, Kooyong voted for you. Jacinta Nampijinpa Price admonishes Albanese over Indigenous voice plans Country Liberal party senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price delivered her first speech last night. You can find the whole text here (from page 81). Price had a lot to say but it is her view on the government’s vow to enshrine an Indigenous voice to parliament that has captured the most attention: This government has yet to demonstrate how this proposed voice will deliver practical outcomes and unite, rather than drive a wedge further between, Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia. And, no, prime minister, we don’t need another handout, as you have described the Uluru statement to be. No, we Indigenous Australians have not come to agreement on this statement, as you have also claimed. It would be far more dignifying if we were recognised and respected as individuals in our own right who are not simply defined by our racial heritage but by the content of our character. I am an empowered Warlpiri Celtic Australian woman who did not need and has never needed a paternalistic government to bestow my own empowerment upon me. We’ve proven for decades now that we do not need a chief protector of Aborigines. I got here, along with 10 other Indigenous voices, including my colleague the senator for South Australia Kerrynne Liddle, to this 47th parliament of Australia like every other parliamentarian: through hard work and sheer determination. That’s how we got here. However, you now want to ask the Australian people to disregard our elected voices and vote yes to apply a constitutionally enshrined advisory body without any detail of what that might in fact entail. Perhaps a word of advice, since that is what you are seeking: listen to everyone, not just those who support your virtue-signalling agenda but also those you contradict. The workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, has introduced the paid family and domestic violence leave bill. Burke said leaving a family and domestic violence leave situation is difficult – and the bill aimed to remove one more obstacle to getting help and getting out. The bill will add the entitlement to the national employment standards, meaning it will cover all 11 million employees including 2.6 million casuals. Burke: Getting out shouldn’t mean losing pay ... Workers will no longer have to ask, ‘Do I have leave to help me getting out?’ The answer for every employee will be yes. He said employees would be paid leave not at the base rate of pay, but at the rate they would have earned if they’d gone to work. For casuals this will mean where shifts have been offered and accepted, they will be paid for those. If they weren’t rostered on, it will be unpaid leave: Family and domestic violence doesn’t pick and choose whether you’re a casual or permanent worker. The minister also explained that employees claiming the entitlement do not need to live with their alleged abuser to access the leave. He said the Fair Work Commission’s review of paid family and domestic violence leave had found “no instances” of employees falsely claiming the leave, it’s simply “not an entitlement that employees rort”. In case you missed it this morning, here’s Murph’s view on what has happened and what is coming: As part of the change in standing orders, the sittings on Wednesday and Thursday start at 9am instead of 9.30am. The day’s schedule is out for the House: Brisbane MP Stephen Bates fights back tears in first speech to parliament You may have seen this on Guardian Australia’s Instagram but, in case you missed it, here is part of Brisbane Greens MP Stephen Bates’ first speech to parliament. One of the sometimes-forgotten parts of coming out is that it doesn’t just happen once. You come out again and again and again. And as the new MP shows in this speech, representation matters. (Side note: I very much appreciated the representation of Brisbane on Stephen’s lapel – it looks as though he is wearing an ibis bird badge with rainbow wings. The ibis is the unofficial national bird of the Greatest Nation on Earth’s capital.) Liberal senator pushes for climate policy certainty On the “debate” on climate within the Liberal party at the moment, Andrew Bragg says: I mean, the point is I’m a Liberal party senator, I’m wanting to support my party, but I’m also wanting to get the best possible economic outcome for the country. Now, this has been a wretched issue for more than a decade. I would like to see us get to a much clearer centre point on the issue of emissions and the transition. And I think whatever happens with this bill, the real game is how do we get more stable medium- to long-term settings for our country, so that we can attract this capital because this is a race and unless we have policy certainty, over the long term, we will lose the race. Andrew Bragg won’t rule out crossing floor on emissions target Moderate Liberal senator Andrew Bragg has a different view. He tells Patricia Karvelas that he wants to see what the economic impacts are. But he’s not a hardline no and he’s not ruling out crossing the floor: I’m certainly not intending to cross the floor. I want to keep my options open. As we undertake this inquiry, which we now have a month or so to do, there are discussions to be had with colleagues. But the key point is this is an economic judgment, not a political judgment for the country. This bill, whatever it happens, won’t be the silver bullet. I mean, the the real game here is the medium- to long-term policy settings for the country, and making sure we can get the capital to fund this transition. On ABC radio RN Angus Taylor has joined Peter Dutton and Michaelia Cash in outright refusing to even come to the table in legislating a climate emissions reduction target. No discussion will be entered into. An Australian and a Canadian climber have been found dead on K2, the world’s second highest mountain in Pakistan. Mt Everest Today, a blog site that publishes expedition updates, reports that the Australian mountaineer was Matthew Eakin and the Canadian was Richard Cartier. A Dfat spokesperson has confirmed the deaths, saying: The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is providing consular assistance to the family of an Australian man who died during a climbing expedition in northern Pakistan. ‘I have laid out a number of elements of what a good plan would look like’ What is Angus Taylor’s and the Coalition’s plan to deal with the economic issues? What would the Coalition have done if it won? Taylor: I have laid out a number of elements of what a good plan would look like. Dealing with the short-term supply pressures. Taking pressure off the budget. Releasing some of the longer-term productivity pressures in the economy as well, adding to that. The Labor party, just in the last day, have [legislation to end] the ABCC. That will raise the cost to construction and one of the things we saw in the figures yesterday was a big escalation in the price of renovating and building a house*. These are real costs for Australians. Labor is focused on all sorts of other things but not this. This really counts for Australians. They feel it at the checkout, they feel it at the bowser and when they are renovating or building a house. *Just on that – the ABCC does not have jurisdiction over domestic builds (unless there are more than five on a site – so a housing estate, for instance). Abolishing the ABCC will not impact your renovations. Just four of 17 Closing the Gap targets are on track Sarah Collard has an update on how Australia is meeting the Closing the Gap targets: The nation is failing to address the systemic disadvantages experienced by First Nations communities, according to the latest Closing the Gap data released by the Productivity Commission on Thursday. Four of the 17 targets are on track: the birth weights of Indigenous babies, preschool kids attending early childhood education, and youth detention rates are trending in the right direction, while gains are being seen in land and sea rights. As of 30 June 2021, 89.5% of Indigenous babies were born at a healthy weight compared with 88.8% in 2017 (its baseline year) while 97.6% of preschool-aged children are enrolled in early education compared with 76.7% in 2016, the baseline data year. So as we reported yesterday, yes, the cashless debit card is being scrapped. But the BasicsCard, which does much the same thing to communities in the Northern Territory, who are primarily Indigenous, will continue. There is a plan for consultations but no timeline for when that will occur. Minister pushed on BasicsCard Patricia Karvelas pushes Amanda Rishworth on her answers about the BasicsCard, given that it is no different, in principle, to the Indue card, and Rishworth says: Well, our commitment in the election was to abolish the cashless debit card which we’re doing ... We never said there would be the end of income management. We said there would always be a voluntary income management option for individuals that chose it or communities that chose it and I would point to the Cape York [community] who has a structure in place called the family responsibilities commission, who have said that they want still the option to refer people to income management. So we’re keeping that in the legislation. When it comes to the BasicsCard … we want to consult about how we move forward with that Income management continues Social services minister Amanda Rishworth is speaking to Patricia Karvelas about the BasicsCard – which is income management, that limits spending, which is continuing. The cashless debit card is ending. But the BasicsCard, which impacts communities in the Northern Territory, is not being scrapped. Rishworth says there will be consultation about that form of income management and says the Indue card was the first step. But it is not right to say Labor is ending income management, because the BasicsCard does the same thing and, so far, there is no timeline for when a decision will be made on that. Rishworth: We’ve said that we want to work with communities in the Northern Territory, about what the future of that type of income management looks like. So I would like to have a lot of consultation about that, but our first step is the cashless debit card and we need to meet with people individually – if they don’t contact Services Australia to make sure that transition is smooth so I’m not underestimating the job of transitioning over 17,000 people off that card. So that is the first order of business and then we will consult around what the future of income management – commonly known as the BasicsCard – is. Taylor won’t commit to backing extension of fuel excise cut Q: Do you support the extension of the temporary fuel excise cut when it expires in September? Angus Taylor: We support the government coming up with a plan. They are ultimately in government. I have suggested some of the things that they can do to put together a coherent plan to respond ... Q: I will ask you the question specifically again: Does the Coalition support the extension of that temporary cut? Taylor: We are not the ones in government. Government needs to put together the plan. I have made suggestions about some of the things they can do. We have announced policies that would make a real difference, getting more people into work when we have real supply constraints for our small businesses. That is what we need. That is what will make the real difference. Angus Taylor calls for ‘rapid concerted response’ to inflation Angus Taylor, the shadow treasurer, is also doing the media rounds. He appeared on ABC News Breakfast, explaining how the inflation is not the fault of the previous government: What you are missing in that was a $103bn turn-around in the last budget we handed down and, in the May financial statement that came out, the budget deficit came in at almost half of what was expected. We were tightening the belt and we recognised that you need today avoid fuelling inflation. This is what we need to see from the government. You can’t choose the context you work with in government. We were dealt with many economic and health curveballs over the last couple of years. What you can do is respond to those circumstances. What we are not seeing from this government is a rapid concerted response to the circumstances. Are we approaching peak inflation? Treasurer Jim Chalmers is doing the media rounds this morning before his economic statement to parliament scheduled for about 12.30pm AEST. We know much of the outline already, such as the slicing of GDP growth forecasts for the economy compared with the pre-election estimates provided by the Treasury, as we report here: Economics is featuring prominently this week in part because the first sitting week of the new government is coinciding with the release of the June quarter inflation rate, which yesterday came in at 6.1%. While the highest since the introduction of the GST at the start of the century, that CPI numbers actually surprised slightly on the soft side, prompting investors to pull back on their more bullish estimates for RBA rate rises to quell the inflation beast. In fact, a few economists think we might be near peak inflation. We wonder here if that might be overly optimistic, given what’s still in the price increase pipeline: While many will be listening carefully to what Chalmers has to say about the state of the economy – and what if anything the government plans to do in terms of extra support to ease the cost-of-living crunch – the RBA is really the one calling the shots. Its board meets next Tuesday and it’s just a question of how much the bank will lift its cash rate. And three days later the RBA releases its quarterly statement on monetary policy with its expectations of inflation arguably more telling that what Chalmers might charm us with today. ‘We can’t flick a switch and make all this inflation disappear’ Jim Chalmers says there are still a couple of shocks coming: There’s a couple of things that are yet to happen beyond the inflation numbers that we got yesterday. First of all, there’s the big spike in electricity prices, which was hidden during the election, which came in in July. We expect that to have a fairly substantial impact on the next inflation numbers that we get but obviously, as well, when the support at the petrol bowser comes off in September, as it’s legislated to do that will have an impact as well. And so we’ve factored that into our expectations. But there are other big drivers of inflation, obviously – the global scene energy and food security is a big part of that. But domestically there are factors that we have an influence over not immediately. We can’t flick a switch and make all this inflation disappear. But we can deal with some of the issues in our supply chains that people understand are pushing up prices. Inflation forecast above 7% ‘confronting’ Jim Chalmers spoke to ABC radio RN host Patricia Karvelas this morning in the lead-up to his economic statement, where he said he’ll be talking of inflation in Australia going higher than 7 %. It is at 6.1% now, so we are not too far off already. Chalmers: What I’ll be talking about today is an inflation forecast north of 7% which is confronting and when we got that new number yesterday for the June quarter, it wasn’t especially surprising that number yesterday, but it was still confronting because what it means is, as the street every dollar that Australians earn is not able to be stretched as far as it was before and people understand that. I mean, people don’t really need you know, people don’t need to be told about you know, they don’t need that, they don’t struggle to understand that we’ve got an inflation problem. In our economy because they feel it in every aisle of every supermarket. They feel it when the bills arrive. But what I hope to do today and painting that more accurate picture is to give people a sense that, yes, inflation will peak in our expectation and Treasury’s expectation later this year, and then start to moderate. But it will moderate inflation will come down again, it is primarily but not exclusively global. It is temporary, but it won’t disappear overnight. And so I want to talk people through our expectations for that as well. Sydney commuters warned to expect delays after four-hour train strike If you are travelling on Sydney public transport this morning, AAP has an update for you: NSW train services are getting back to normal after a four-hour strike that started at midnight. The stoppage affected Sydney’s rail network as well as intercity and regional services. Some services were replaced by buses and some delays could affect services this morning. Sydney Trains chief executive Matt Longland said commuters should not expect a fully operational timetable until 8am. The strike is the latest chapter in the long-running dispute between the Rail, Tram and Bus Union and the government over a new enterprise agreement, as well as safety modifications to the mothballed Korean-built new intercity fleet. The union and management are scheduled to meet again today. US military chief says China’s behaviour in Pacific ‘much more confrontational’ China’s behaviour in the Pacific is “much more confrontational” now than it was, and “seems to imply that they want to bully or dominate”, says General Mark Milley, chair of the US joint chiefs of staff. Earlier this week Milley said China had become “significantly more and noticeably more aggressive”. He added to those comments in Sydney yesterday, according to the Associated Press, at a conference to discuss the rise of China and the stability of the region: It’s a big conference to discuss our mutual security interests and discuss national security issues that apply to all of us. Australia’s defence department did not respond to questions about the conference and its program. Happy last day of the first week of sittings! (Kamala to Joe voice: “We did it.”) Given that we are only half way through the sitting through, there is still a hell of a lot to get through. Including the treasurer, Jim Chalmers handing down his economic statement. Chalmers has been previewing this for some time, so no one should be surprised. Here is the main message: Australia is outperforming much of the world, but that doesn’t make it easier to pay the bills at home. Our high inflation is primarily but not exclusively global. It will subside but not overnight. It’s been turbocharged by a decade of domestic failures on skills, on energy and on supply chains which just aren’t resilient enough. And the numbers? This has cut half a percentage point from growth for the last financial year, for this financial year, and for next financial year. It’s expected that real GDP grew by 3¾ per cent in 2021-22, instead of 4 ¼ per cent as was estimated pre-election. The pre-election forecast for GDP growth in 2022-23 was 3½ per cent. This has now been revised down to 3 per cent growth. And growth is expected to slow further in 2023-24, at 2 per cent – down from the 2½ per cent previously predicted. But you don’t need Treasury boffins to tell you that. You can feel it. You can feel it looking at your bank account, in the decisions you make at the supermarket and whether or not you take the car. Inflation is going to go up. We know that. Chalmers and the RBA both expect it to start levelling off before too long, which is good news, but the US Federal Reserve has again lifted its rates – in a way not seen since the mid-1990s. So it is a complicated global economy but the last decade has not left us in a great place to deal with it. With yesterday’s inflation data, the small gains made over the last 10 years in wage growth, have been wiped out. People on fixed incomes, especially those on unemployment payments, are in even more dire straits. And the energy price bill shock won’t filter through until the next quarter – those bills are coming in now, and it’s only going to drive people further into financial distress. We’ll cover all the news as it happens. Mike Bowers and Katharine Murphy are leading the way, as always, with Paul Karp, Tory Shepherd and Josh Butler finding out what exactly is happening in the building. You have me, Amy Remeikis, with you for most of the day. I have had freckles for breakfast, so I am already eating my feelings.

In 2015, he returned to the global oil business as executive chairman of L1 Energy. Since leaving BP, he has written five books; in the latest, he argues that engineers will save humanity from the threats such as disease, artificial intelligence and global warming. You say that civilisation is founded on engineering innovation and technology. Do you equate human progress with machines? Absolutely not. It is the combination of the machines, the engineering and humans that makes progress. Without engineering, there will not be progress, but machines without humans will go nowhere. Do you understand the widespread public fear of unfettered technologies? Yes. Some engineering advances are not good for humans until they are confined in the right way.Some have really bad, unintended consequences. There are plenty I fear. The uncontrolled use of fissile material to make bombs is terrifying, so too [the release of] pathogens. There are problems with poisonous gases used by dictators, materials getting into the hands of rogue states. Modern technology has given immense wealth and power to the very few and has allowed global surveillance and the erosion of privacy. Is that acceptable? These are worrying. But they lead back to the control of the technology and the question of the expression of values. So, surveillance and face recognition are something heavily controlled in the west. In China, they are not. Stanford University has developed a technology that can recognise, to a probability of 80%, gay people from straight. This is not a good thing to have. I say that as a gay man. I find it objectionable, too, that in China facial recognition technology is used to identify certain ethnic peoples and keep them under control. That is wrong. There will be aberrations, but [facial recognition] has been very beneficial across the world, whether it is for law enforcement, the convenience of people to pay, or to get in and out of buildings. But there are other things which have gone wrong unintenionally, or are in hands of wrong people. Will engineering get us out of the problems we face? I am optimistic. Engineering is the application of discovery into life. It has done extraordinary things for the world. It has made it more peaceful, less violent, safer, cleaner. People live longer, they are better educated, there’s less poverty. All these things have been brought about by engineering. Engineers have saved more lives than physicians; they have created clean water. In my lifetime, the world population has tripled and people are healthier and better off than they used to be when the world was one third its size. But has technology not also made the world less secure? You are chair of the UK board of Chinese company Huawei, the world leader in 5G technology. Will 5G technology undermine British or American security? It depends on your level of risk. The UK government has, apparently, said you can divide the system into high- and low-risk areas. If you keep certain technologies low risk they are happy with that, whereas others will say take no risk. The problem started with the break-up of the Bell Labs, which did the early research on telecoms. The pieces were sold off and we have ended up with the US not having a commercial approach to 5G. It’s in the hands of only Nokia, Ericsson and Huawei. It’s not an easy position for the world to be in and [it remains] to be seen if there’s a way out of it. President Trump wound Huawei into a trade war, so is it part of a trade war or a security war? It’s very difficult to resolve. The big thing with technologies is to overcome the legacy of the past. Many people have vested interests in keeping the past going because they make money with it. Is not oil a legacy of the past? Not as old as coal, which is still a big part of the energy mix. But you have spent a lifetime working with fossil fuels that have led to the climate crisis. … and trying to change. Have you succeeded? I’ve been a little bit successful. I wish I had been much more successful. Because 22 years ago I made a very clear statement, to say the oil and gas industry was part of the problem, so it had better start working out how to solve it. What would you say to Greta Thunberg? I would say that I have been at this for longer than you’ve been on the planet and that [decarbonisation] will take time. And so my proposal is this: remember that energy is a very big system and there is not one solution. We can’t have one magic bullet that will make the solution work for us. We need to take all the things people are doing [to reduce emissions] because it will be very difficult to persuade them to change. China is opening up brand new coal mines to feed India. What happens in the UK is actually not very important. It’s what happens in places like China, Indonesia and India that will really count. Because we will need coal, oil and gas, we need to do everything we can to decarbonise the emissions. This is critical for the future. You know the problems of climate change but you are now chair of the oil and gas investment company L1 Energy and still in the oil business. Gas and oil. I created a company that is 70% natural gas and 30% oil. Gas has less carbon, it is much more environmentally friendly and has lots of different uses. That is much more modern than the other way round. How are you working to reduce emissions? When I was with BP, I laid out a plan. But BP is producing more oil now than it was… And I have been away a little while. Then I set up the world’s largest renewable energy fund, $10bn of investment to prove to people you could make money from doing this. It’s going to take us a long time to take oil and coal out of the energy system and even longer for natural gas. We have the tools to take a lot of the carbon out of hydrocarbons; what we don’t have is the right cost. The more you do of something, normally, the cheaper it gets, with the exception of nuclear power [where] the more you make, the more expensive it becomes. That can be overcome with standardisation. Governments have to take the first risk [to reduce emissions] which is very high and industry will take the second risk, which is getting lower and lower. That’s what happened with solar energy, which is an important but small part of the energy system. But you are arguing in the book for fracking. You were chair of fracking company Cuadrilla. Does that make sense? No, fracking in the UK doesn’t make much sense. I think it was a test to see if it worked. We probably don’t need to do it. Can we reduce emissions fast enough to avoid the frightening scenarios that are forecast? If we get on with it now, we stand a chance. If we don’t start now, the chances get lower and lower. I said 22 years ago that we should start then. We have done something but not enough. Is the quest of humanity that we move to another planet? Who knows? James Lovelock changed my views. He reminds me that we’re not trying to save this planet, but simply the humans on this planet. The planet will look after itself. It will have its course of life. What we are doing is adjusting its path. We will go. It will come back. Does that justify wrecking it? Absolutely not. It just puts it in perspective that we have to do something to keep it ready for human beings. Because if we don’t do things, we are simply consigning a portion, if not all, of humanity, to its death. That is wrong. Are you saying that the planet is for humanity? Surely we have a responsibility for the rest of life? That is what I am saying. We are stewards because humanity must live on this planet. Humans are designed to live in an atmosphere with a certain amount of oxygen. If we go elsewhere, we are not well tuned to that. We’ve got to figure out how to create a built-in environment to protect us. That will be difficult. • Make, Think, Imagine: Engineering the Future of Civilisation by John Browne is published by Bloomsbury (£25). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

Here’s the latest on the first major storm of America’s 2018 hurricane season: How bad is it? On Friday, Florence was driving maximum sustained winds of 80mph, according to an updated forecast from the National Hurricane Center (NHC). That’s down from a high of 140mph, but still expected to cause “life-threatening storm surges” and “catastrophic freshwater flooding” over parts of North and South Carolina. The hurricane was downgraded late on Thursday night to a category 1 hurricane. Where is it? The hurricane made landfall around 7.15am on Friday near Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. As of 11am, it was centered about 20 miles south-west of Wilmington, North Carolina, and 55 miles north-east of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. It was crawling along at just 3mph, meaning it could linger for another whole day over coastal North and South Carolina. Storm tracker: follow where Hurricane Florence is heading When and where will it hit? Powerful winds and rain have already arrived, causing collapsed roofs and other damage in spots including Morehead City and New Bern, North Carolina. In New Bern, rescuers saved more than 200 people from rising waters but at least 150 more were believed to be stranded in homes or cars, awaiting help as storm surges reached 10ft. What damage will it cause? Heavy flooding is expected, with a storm surge up to 11ft (4 metres) in the area from Cape Fear to Cape Lookout, North Carolina. Massive rainfall is predicted, with an additional 20-25in expected to fall in coastal areas of the Carolinas and up to 40in in isolated areas. “This rainfall will produce catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river flooding,” the NHC said. Areas further from the coast could see 5-15in of rain. Rainfall totals exceeding 14in have already been reported at several locations across south-eastern North Carolina. How many people will it affect? About 5.25 million people live in areas under hurricane warnings or watches, and 4.9 million more live in places covered by tropical storm warnings or watches, according to the National Weather Service. More than 1.7 million people in the Carolinas and Virginia were warned to evacuate, though it was unclear how many actually left. Duke Energy, the leading power supplier in the area, said Florence could knock out electricity to 3 million of its 4 million customers in the Carolinas, and power outages could last for weeks. What else is in its path? Florence has sparked fears of an environmental disaster, because its path is lined with hog manure pits, coal ash dumps and other industrial sites, as well as six nuclear power plants. Also in the path is the town of Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, near the site of the world’s first airplane flight and home to the Wright Brothers national memorial."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/oct/06/michael-morpurgo-bradwell-sea-essex-village-home","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-06T10:59:20Z","webTitle":"Michael Morpurgo on Bradwell-on-Sea: ‘The exhilaration of infinite beauty’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/06/michael-morpurgo-bradwell-sea-essex-village-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/oct/06/michael-morpurgo-bradwell-sea-essex-village-home","fields":{"headline":"Michael Morpurgo on Bradwell-on-Sea: ‘The exhilaration of infinite beauty’","bodyText":"The house where I grew up, New Hall in the village of Bradwell-on-Sea, is still home to me. Yet I lived there for only a few weeks every year, during school holidays, and I have visited it only twice since we moved away – over 60 years ago. It was the place I longed to be when I was sent each term to boarding school, the home of my dreams. In many ways it still is. I had spent my early years in London, which was a place of fog and bomb sites, and sadness and rationing. There I first learned of the war I never witnessed, the war that killed an uncle everyone loved and broke my family apart, so that I grew up not knowing my father. It was our stepfather and my mother who took us out of London in the early 1950s to go to live by the sea in Essex. It was the best thing they ever did. Here I lived the most intense years of my young life. The ramshackle Georgian house stood in an overgrown garden, with a lawn mowed for cricket at the front. To one side there was a tumble-down barn, ideal for table tennis, full of spiders and rats and bats. We had bikes – mine was a shiny green Raleigh. My brother Pieter and I rode out often past the church and the pub and the village school towards the seawall, a couple of miles. We would ride by the American airbase, and out towards the Saxon chapel of St Peter’s- ad-Murum. There we would sit with our backs against the sun-warm stone spotting the skylarks and hares, and then wheel our bikes home along the seawall shouting into the wind, with the soupy brown North Sea rolling in.The house was cold in winter, and full of creaking ghosts. Up in our attic bedrooms we froze. But in summer we could climb out of the window and sit in the gulley and hear the song of the sea and the whisper of the trees. A huge inglenook fireplace downstairs in the sitting room consumed the logs we cut and carried in, and the house reeked of woodsmoke. There was Mozart often playing on the gramophone, the horn concertos, or Kathleen Ferrier singing I Know That My Redeemer Liveth. There were tensions, an exhausted mother trying to hold a difficult husband, fraught children and huge house together. In the village there would be local children who did not go away to school lying in wait for us. We went in fear of them. New to me then this deep class resentment. New to me everything about the place, the sheer exhilaration of living with this infinite beauty all around me, of feeling for the first time that I belonged somewhere, that I never wanted to leave. But once the trunks were packed I did leave, so did Pieter. In the end we all left, left for good, when they decided to build a nuclear power station just outside our village. They built it with the promise of cheap electricity, and jobs, the old story that was new to me then. It’s still there, wrapped in concrete, redundant, an ugly wart on the land, and just across the fields from St Peter’s-ad-Murum. Mustn’t moan.

The construction company owner voted for Barack Obama twice. “He wasn’t perfect but I liked his healthcare policy at the time. That was very important to me and I thought it would be good,” she said. But Kendall was deeply disappointed by Obama’s healthcare reforms, blaming them for a surge in her insurance premiums. Even so, she voted for him again when he ran for reelection. “I liked his foreign policies. The way that he was dealing with Al-Qaeda. I thought he was doing a really good job of dealing with terrorism, keeping the country safe,” she said. Then came 2016. Kendall said her vote for Donald Trump was more a rejection of Hillary Clinton, who she regards as dishonest. Now she is a fan of the president and deeply defensive of her vote for him. “People say Trump is horrible. He probably is a horrible person. “But right now I am about the economy. It’s helping me and my family. I’ll be voting for Trump again,” she told incredulous Democratic activists at the county fair. Her company employs 12 people renovating buildings in Detroit, about 25 miles north of Monroe county, which is a 90% white and mostly working-class county of about 150,000 people. Its main city, also called Monroe, has a population of around 20,000 and much of the county’s industry. Kendall’s vote contributed to one of the largest swings across the US from Obama to Trump. America’s first black president won Monroe county, twice, albeit by a slim margin in 2012. Four years later, Trump trounced Clinton in the county, winning 58% of the vote, the largest proportion there since Ronald Reagan in 1984. That delivered Trump’s slim victory in Michigan, which was crucial to putting him in the White House. Trump won the state by just 10,704 votes, the narrowest margin of victory in the history of presidential elections in Michigan. The flipping of counties from Obama to Trump in the Midwest – and the apparent paradox of Americans shifting from Obama to a man denounced as a misogynist, racist and bully – was instrumental in the president’s victory. On the other side of Lake Michigan, the shift was decisive in squeezing out a victory for Trump in Wisconsin by less than 23,000 votes or 0.77% of the ballot – overturning a 213,000 vote victory for Obama in the state four years earlier. Winning a clutch of swing counties turned Iowa and Ohio too. This week, and at various stages in the run up to the 2020 presidential election, the Guardian is reporting from three midwest counties that swung from Obama to Trump in crucial states. On the face of it, Trump’s slim margins of victory in 2016 key states are good reason for the Democrats to believe they can snatch them back from a president perpetually mired in controversy from his incessant tweeting and lashing out at even the mildest criticism to the launch of impeachment hearings. And yet the Democrats would be wise not to count on Monroe county – which almost always votes for the ultimate presidential winner – to deliver victory for them, and local party activists know it. The Trump tide “The Trump tide came in and still hasn’t receded yet,” said Bill LaVoy, who lost his seat as a Democratic state representative for the county in the Trump surge of 2016. “We don’t know if these are permanent Republican voters now or it’s just temporary,” said LaVoy, also speaking at the Monroe county fair, which dates back to the 19th century. Democrats in Monroe county face the same dilemma as their party nationally. Do they try and win back voters who swung from Obama to Trump by opting for a “safe” candidate in Joe Biden? Or do they look for another path to victory by mobilising those who stayed away in 2016, by giving them something to vote for with a candidate pushing more radical policies? “Some think that the party needs to move more to the left. I’m not so sure that works around here,” said LeVoy. “I’m a moderate and I’m actually the last Democrat to win around here for the state house. I lean more towards Joe Biden.” A party activist, Christopher Slat, interrupted. “We’ve been trying to not run to the left and that hasn’t worked, so why don’t we try something different?” said Slat, a 30-year-old who makes videos for the local school district. Slat suspects Trump voters aren’t coming back no matter who the Democratic candidate is. “We ran Anybody But Trump last time and she didn’t win. We might run Biden and he’s the same thing,” said Slat. Nothing stays still with Trump for long, and impeachment has now swung into view. It’s a seismic political drama in Washington and dominates the analysis and argument of cable news. But it has yet to have the same impact in America’s heartland. Perhaps it will in time if the revelations are shocking enough or Trump’s political allies begin to turn on him. For now, Trump’s core voters mostly seem to chalking the investigation up to another Russia-style “witch-hunt”. Slat, who backs Sanders over Biden, said the real impact may not be on Trump at all. “I don’t think it’s going to change people’s minds that much, especially if they’re already loyal to Trump. People are going to be more concerned with ‘what are the candidates going to do for me?’ instead of worrying about this drama stuff. I think there’s a sentiment even among some progressives that all presidents do this kind of stuff. This is a hit job, just another Russia investigation,” he said at the weekend. “I do think it’s bad news for Joe Biden. I think it’s going to be a really hard sell if the impeachment is going on through the election cycle for Joe Biden to make the case if his son was taking $50,000 a month from a Ukrainian gas company while he was vice-president, and he’s saying there’s nothing illegal about that. Even if that’s true, it’s going to put him in the same bucket as Hillary where people say they’re all crooks so I’m going to stay home.” Job market shifts Monroe county, like Detroit, was once strong union territory. In 2008, the Ford car plant closed with the loss of 3,200 jobs just as the recession hit. “Think about 3,200 people,” said Michael Keck, who worked at the Ford factory for 33 years and is a United Auto Workers (UAW) official. “Probably 2,000 or more of them living in this community, spending money in this community. Gone. Some of them may still live here but they work in Dearborn or Flat Rock. So that’s where they spend their money. The impact was huge.” Industries have come and gone from Monroe before. More than a dozen paper mills that once employed thousands making corrugated cardboard boxes were mostly closed by the 1970s. Some of the workers found jobs at the new Ford plant, which became Monroe’s largest employer. When that went too, just as the national recession hit, home foreclosures surged. Some people walked away from their houses. Others were locked out by the banks. Monroe struggled as shops went to the wall. The local mall is a shell of its once bustling self after major stores such as Sears and Target abandoned it. Some industrial jobs remain in steel and at a nuclear power plant. But those forced to find work elsewhere in the county frequently took cuts in pay as they shifted to non-unionised jobs in healthcare, which, like many other struggling parts of the midwest, provides an increasing proportion of employment. With the national economic shock of the recession and the local impact of the Ford closure, the majority white county began its shift away from longstanding support for the Democrats by electing Republicans to local and state offices even if voters also backed Obama. In those circumstances, the move from Obama to Trump does not look quite so jarring. Keck, who worked in the Ford factory, thinks it was at least in part an act of desperation by those disappointed that Obama did not make the dramatic changes his historic election promised. To some, Obama seemed more interested in looking after the banks more than unemployed workers struggling to pay their mortgages. Clinton represented more of the same in 2016. The UAW ordered Keck to campaign for her even though he was at heart a Bernie Sanders supporter. Three years later he remains bitter at what he regards as Clinton’s out-of-touch campaign. Against that, Trump appeared to be listening to people in Monroe county. The anger that burst out at the ballot box in 2016 has only escalated. Some of it comes from Trump supporters horrified at what he has become. Then there are those such as construction boss Misty Kendall, who voted for Trump less as a statement of support than in opposition to Clinton and who now regard criticism of the president as a personal attack on them. That has helped solidify support for the president among those prepared to set aside his sins, personal and political. A few will defend his tweets and diminishing the dignity of his office as evidence that he is standing up to the elites and telling it like it is. Kendall is prepared to acknowledge criticism of Trump’s language, calling him “kind of crass”. But she regards much of what exercises the president’s critics, from migrant detentions to his climate policies, as faux concerns fabricated as a means to attack him. “Everybody gets so offended if you’re a Trump supporter,” said Kendall. “I just wish that everybody had a more open mind about the situation. We don’t all have to agree. I think he’s a great president. He’s my president. If a Democrat gets elected, guess what? It’s still my president. I might not like it but I have to abide by it because I’m an American.” Healthcare: a huge issue On the other side, anger at Clinton on the Democratic party’s left in 2016, which led some voters to stay away, has turned on Trump and fuelled a surge in activism and engagement with the primaries. The challenge for the party in places such as Monroe county is to find the crossover issues to lure at least some Trump voters back and get wavering voters to the polls. For some, the best issue may be the one which proved most damaging to Obama among many voters – healthcare reform. “People were not happy with Obamacare around here when it raised the cost. This isn’t a wealthy area,” said LaVoy, the former Democratic state representative. “But health care needs to be fixed. That’s something Trump ran on and he didn’t do it. It’s an opportunity.” Jeff Morris, the president of the local UAW branch, who has worked for 29 years at the Gerdau steel mill in Monroe, said it is the primary political issue for most of his members. “Healthcare for my 500 members is huge. They ask if a candidate is gonna fix healthcare. That’s the whole nine yards,” he said. The challenge for the Democratic party in counties such as Monroe is to present a policy such as healthcare reform that can win back some working class voters and mobilise the young without scaring off other voters with charges of socialism or government overreach. ‘Now we’re scared’ Part of the challenge is to keep the political debate focused on policies such as healthcare as the president works to get Americans to look elsewhere. “In the 80s, when I was growing up, it was always abortion and guns,” said Morris. “There’s a version of that going on right now with immigration. It’s a huge distraction and it’s intentional.” And it works. Ask what the president is getting right and Kendall vigorously defends his immigration policies as preventing a flood of people across the border to live on her taxes. She disparages reports of separation of families on the border as political propaganda. Against that, LaVoy looked on in alarm at the Democratic primary debates as candidates batted around proposals to weaken border controls or ease restrictions on asylum applications – “open borders”, as Trump characterises it. LaVoy regards the debate as a quagmire that will suck the party down. “The immigration stuff, this county is 90% white. That doesn’t play well around here,” he said. “The Democratic party should be careful because if Trump wins Michigan, he wins the presidency because that means not much has changed in the midwest.” At the fair, a Democratic activist, Yvonne Morrison, is certain that Trump’s framing of immigration is working for him. “This terrible resentment has bubbled up like a cesspool,” she said. “Last time we laughed at Trump. Now we’re scared. I think he’ll win again. His support hasn’t moved an inch.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/jul/13/electric-car-boom-power-demand-national-grid-hinkley-point-c","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-13T09:50:11Z","webTitle":"Electric cars will fuel huge demand for power, says National Grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/13/electric-car-boom-power-demand-national-grid-hinkley-point-c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/jul/13/electric-car-boom-power-demand-national-grid-hinkley-point-c","fields":{"headline":"Electric cars will fuel huge demand for power, says National Grid","bodyText":"A dramatic growth in electric vehicles on Britain’s roads could see peak electricity demand jump by more than the capacity of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station by 2030, according to National Grid. The number of plug-in cars and vans could reach 9m by 2030, up from around 90,000 today, said the company, which runs the UK’s national transmission networks for electricity and gas. The impact of charging so many cars’ batteries would be to reverse the trend in recent years of falling electricity demand, driven by energy efficiency measures such as better refrigerators and LED lighting. If electric vehicles were not charged smartly to avoid peaks and troughs in power demand, such as when people return home between 5pm and 6pm, peak demand could be as much as 8GW higher in 2030, National Grid said. Shifting the charging of cars to times when demand is lower would reduce the extra peak demand to 3.5GW, a smaller amount but still a similar capacity to the new reactors being built at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The forecasts are contained in the grid’s Future Energy Scenarios report, published just days after Volvo said all its new cars would be electric or hybrid from 2019 and France pledged to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2040. “Electric vehicles are coming – how quickly is the question,” said Roisin Quinn, head of strategy at National Grid, adding that she expected battery-powered car sales to take off in the mid-2020s. While there was uncertainty over when falling electricity demand would be reversed, she said: “It’s a big moment when demand starts to go up again.” National Grid acknowledged the cars’ batteries could also provide services and return power for the grid at a time when managing the network is becoming increasingly complex as variable sources of wind and solar power grow. But it cautioned that there was “still debate over whether it will become commercially viable to flow electricity from a vehicle back onto the network to provide network services”. Quinn said a large share of power from renewables had “already become a reality”, and three of the report’s four scenarios predict that solar power will have the biggest share of generation capacity by 2050. In all of the scenarios, new nuclear power stations are assumed to be built and the capacity of interconnectors that provide backup power from Europe rises from 4GW now to between 10GW and 19GW in 2030. Fracking for shale gas is expected to produce zero gas in two of the greener scenarios. However, in one scenario of high fracking, shale gas is projected to provide 32bn cubic metres by 2031, a similar amount to the 36bn cubic metres the North Sea provided last year. Regardless of how much of the UK’s gas comes from fracking, National Grid sees gas as playing a key role in power and heating for decades. It is not until 2050 in some of the group’s scenarios that alternative, electric heating technologies such as heat pumps begin to overtake gas for keeping homes warm. “The story around gas is that it’s critical to our supply now and will continue to be in future,” said Quinn. “We see it as having a long-term role as a reliable, cost effective and flexible energy source, and it will be favoured by many consumers.” But with North Sea gas production declining, National Grid expects the UK’s dependence on gas imports to continue for decades, to some degree. More liquefied natural gas is also expected to be shipped to the UK in the future. Climate change could also pose new challenges, with the UK forecast to get hotter. As temperatures warm, the use of air conditioning in summer could cause peak electricity demand to reach the levels normally seen in winter. National Grid did not take a view on the costs of the scenarios in the report, which was published just a day after a consumer group accused energy networks, including National Grid, of earning £7.5bn in unjustified profits over an eight-year period."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2020/feb/06/morrison-albanese-coronavirus-economy-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2020-02-06T06:25:50Z","webTitle":"AFP drops Angus Taylor investigation as Morrison reshuffles cabinet – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/feb/06/morrison-albanese-coronavirus-economy-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2020/feb/06/morrison-albanese-coronavirus-economy-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"AFP drops Angus Taylor investigation as Morrison reshuffles cabinet – as it happened","bodyText":"With both chambers adjourning, I too am going to adjourn the blog. We have another week of sittings to get through though, before we can rest our weary heads. Plus estimates is coming up. So prepare yourself. It is committee day tomorrow, so make sure you check in with the Guardian to see what is happening across the day, as well as all the other news which happens outside this place. A very, very big thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp for their never-ending help today, which is also extended to the rest of the Guardian brains trust. You might not get to know all their names, but it is a small but mighty team who keep this blog ticking over and from the moderators to the subs, to the editors, we could not do it without them. I hope you manage to have some switch-off time between now and Monday morning. I’ll be back on the news beat in the meantime, but will be back with you in blog capacity just before 8am when parliament resumes. Have a wonderful weekend. And take care of you. And now the House is adjourned. From Mike Bowers’ lens to your eyeballs: When you start with the man in the mirror and ask him to change his ways. The Senate is on to its adjournment debate. Everywhere you look, everywhere you go There’s a heart (there’s a heart), a hand to hold onto. Everywhere you look, everywhere you go There’s a place, of Somebody who needs you Everywhere you look. Further to my earlier post on Jacqui Lambie: A spokesman for the attorney general, Christian Porter, said: “There are no constitutional issues with the points system and the government is continuing direct discussions with the crossbench including Senator Lambie.” Here is the whole exchange between Tim Watts and Tony Smith on the Christopher Pyne ‘joke’. Watts: I have a question for you, Mr Speaker. I refer to recent comments made by the former minister for defence, Christopher Pyne, in conversation with the former secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Martin Parkinson, on the 20 January 2020 episode of the Pyne Time podcast. In the conversation, Mr Pyne commented on the malicious intrusion into the Australian Parliament House computer network, discovered in early 2019, stating that he and Mr Parkinson knew ‘how much worse it all was’ and that they ‘could never talk about it’. Putting aside the extraordinary indiscretion of a former minister for defence making comments of this kind, I refer to your statement to the House on 12 February 2019 about the extent of this attack. I know that you appreciate the seriousness of public confidence in this institution and I acknowledge and thank you for your written response to my correspondence with you on this matter. I ask whether for the benefit of the House you could share your response to Mr Pyne’s comments. Smith: I first thank the member for Gellibrand for bringing the matter to my attention in writing. I have replied, as he said, outlining – in fact, I’ve replied jointly with the president of the Senate. I think it is important that I do, given these comments have been made, make a statement to the House, which I’ll do now. I’m only aware of the comments thanks to the member for Gellibrand, but I’ll just say this: following discovery of the cybersecurity incident in January of last year, as members would be aware, the president and I, as we have said, received detailed briefings from the Australian Signals Directorate and the Department of Parliamentary Services. Communication and management of the incidents was guided by the information available to us as presiding officers in the context of the parliamentary computing network. Of course, as we pointed out, our statements balanced the need for transparency with discretion on matters of national security. But any inference that our statements to the parliament on this issue were inaccurate or misleading as to the seriousness of the situation is false. I stand by the statements made by the president of the Senate and myself. I finally say the podcast also refers to a cyberintrusion at the Australian National University, which is in the transcript that you kindly forwarded to me. So perhaps it shouldn’t be inferred that the comments necessarily relate to the parliamentary network. The important point is that the president and I have no further information or knowledge as to what Mr Pyne meant with his comments, and I thank the member for Gellibrand again. Senator Jacqui Lambie has been asked on ABC Afternoon Briefing about her proposed amendments to the union penalty bill. As Guardian Australia reported on Tuesday, Lambie is trying to strike a deal with the government “as soon as possible” on the bill, which lowers the threshold for deregistering unions or disqualifying their officials. Lambie replied: “We are still talking through those amendments ... The hold-up is when it comes to, there’s a points system, on whether or not it’s constitutional, so that’s what we’re doing at the moment. I do believe that the other amendments are sitting there, there’s just a couple of other issues and one of them is the points system. That could be a little bit constitutional. So do we work it around so we still get the same result and the same outcome and we’re just trying to tie that in now”. That’s a very interesting answer. The points system was introduced by Centre Alliance amendments as a sort-of three strikes policy to prevent disqualification of union officials for minor offences. The government accepted the amendments in a bid to pass the bill. It’s possible Lambie has blown the whistle on a problem not just with her proposed amendments but the scheme of the bill put to the Senate and defeated in November. I’ve asked the attorney general, Christian Porter, to clarify. OK, it took some transcription time, but we got there. At the end of question time, Tim Watts raised an issue with Tony Smith, asking about comments the former minister Christopher Pyne made in his podcast with the former Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet secretary Martin Parkinson. Pyne and Parkinson were talking about the breach of the parliamentary network last year on the podcast, which led to this exchange: Parkinson: I’m amazed, actually, at how little concern is expressed by the public when these breaches occur. Pyne: Everyone almost factors it in, don’t they? Parkinson: Yeah. Pyne: They think “oh well”. Parkinson: Look at ANU, at what’s happened. I’m not blaming ANU but just saying we should be appalled by this. Look at what happened at Parliament House. We should be appalled. Pyne: You and I know how much worse it all was, which we could never talk about (laughs). Parkinson: No (laughs). Watts asked Smith whether this is something Pyne should be joking about, and whether he had gone past his boundaries by hinting there was more to what the public was told about the breach. Smith said he was unaware of what Pyne was talking about: Communication and management of the incident was guided by the information available to us as presiding officers in the context of the parliamentary computing network,” Smith said. Of course, as we pointed out, our statements balanced the need for transparency with discretion on matters of national security. But any inference that our statements to the parliament to this issue were inaccurate or misleading as to the seriousness of the situation is false. I stand by the statements made by the president of the Senate and myself. I would just finally say the podcast also refers to a cyber intrusion at the Australian National University. ... So perhaps it shouldn’t be inferred that the comments necessarily relate to the parliamentary network. The important point is the president and I have no further information or knowledge as to what Mr Pyne meant.” Asked about the AFP decision not to investigate Angus Taylor, Anthony Albanese says: Well, Scott Morrison could ask Angus Taylor tomorrow what happened. How did this occur? That’s what he should do. You shouldn’t need outside organisations. A PM who actually cared about integrity would have dealt with this. The PM quite clearly doesn’t care about integrity. And I make this point as well – and I’ll conclude with this – Australia needs a national integrity commission. We need one with real power to make independent investigations. The fact is that faith in our politics is at an all-time low. It’s at an all-time low because of the sports rorts saga that we can see. ... Angus Taylor of course has been involved in a Watergate scandal, he’s been involved in the issue around Jam Land and his declarations to the parliament. He’s been involved in this document where we still don’t know where it came from. We know it was given from his office to the Daily Telegraph. Where did it come from? They can’t just say we don’t know because quite clearly someone does know. We know it didn’t come from the City of Sydney because the police in their investigation went to the City of Sydney and went through their data. Now why the data of minister Taylor’s office wasn’t gone through is a question for others to answer. Anthony Albanese: ... If you look at Stuart Robert’s answer today to my question in parliament, it is clear he knows they will have to pay money back. It was clearly implied. And I will make two points in addition to the point that Bill has been making, and I praise Bill for what he has done in pursuing this issue. The fact is, every single person who came to my electoral office seeking assistance either got their debt reduced to zero or got it reduced substantially. Without exception. The truth is the most vulnerable people in our society don’t go to their local MP’s office. People from non-English-speaking backgrounds, in some cultures if you get a demand letter from the government, you rush and you pay that money even if you don’t have it – you borrow it from a relative. That is what has gone on here. Bill Shorten: [Scott Morrison] was the treasurer when they invented robodebt. No doubt his fingerprints will be all over it. The point about it is they want to pretend they are making a surplus. They will string out vulnerable people. This is a government who basically had no authority to send vulnerable people on safety net payments, they just assume that people would pay up. ... This is a mass act of unjust enrichment by the government. It is theft of people’s money – the government has abused its power. ... How may times of this government after getting caught breaking the rules before it simply says they got it wrong. Bill Shorten: The federal government has been illegally and unjustly enriching itself with the government adding money back. They don’t have the power to do it. The fact they are still running a legal action when their own public servants have already privately said it is not legal. This is a waste of money. The interest bill is ticking over because if you owe someone money that you have taken, you owe them the interest on that lost income. They are paying lawyers to fight it, they shouldn’t have taken the taxpayers’ money and they are spending more taxpayer money ... ... the commonwealth has been pretending that it is allowed to take money by issuing these notices. It is not! If I sent you an email demanding money, and you pay me, that is illegal. Anthony Albanese throws to Bill Shorten: Due to the persistent efforts of Labor, a document was put up on the Senate website, which goes to the heart of the robodebt scandal: 700,000 Australians received robodebt notices over the last four years. The government has taken $1.5bn off Australians back to the coffers for themselves. Labor has campaigned against the robodebt, it’s been unfair. Mothers report their children have taken their lives, adult children, because of the pressure of these robodebt notices. But today a document has been released which the government did not want people to see, they resisted that. What it reveals is that the chief legal officer of the tax commission has told the tax commissioner that he’s been told by the government, the department of social security, that there is no valid legal basis for the commonwealth to issue these debt notices. Or to put it in plain English, the government has been illegally, unjustly enriching itself, ripping off hundreds of thousands of the most vulnerable Australians. Today in response to Anthony’s question, minister Stuart Robert said, we have justified it. No minister, you have been illegally taking money from Australians for four years. Now the government needs to answer the following questions. When did they find out the scheme was illegal? Why didn’t they find out the scheme was illegal? Furthermore, how many people will be repaid? How much money will be repaid? Why are they wasting taxpayer money fighting legal class actions, when their own ... documents reveal the government has been running a legal ponzi scheme, ripping off hundreds of thousands of its own people with no legal authority. Anthony Albanese and Bill Shorten are holding their second press conference together since the election, on robodebt – asking when the government knew it was illegal. Albanese: Today in question time we started by asking about the correspondence that came from the Australian Taxation Office that we know, as a result of Senate questions on notice that were delivered today, that months ago the government was advised that the robodebt scheme was in fact illegal. Even after being presented with that, what the government did today was consistent with what it does on everything. They couldn’t confess, they said it was just an adjustment. They couldn’t say they got it wrong. The fact is, given the ATO advice, the government will have a very significant liability indeed. Because people were put under enormous pressure getting bills we now know were not only unfair and just wrong but also illegal at the time. Christian Porter: ... Now it has been previously noted that meritless political referrals to key law enforcement agencies waste resources that could be allocated to the investigation of serious matters such as homicides, terrorism offences, drug offences, offences against children, and the NSW police commissioner said they are a great diverter of my time. It has also been previously noted that the shadow attorney general has either made or oversighted from Labor eight meritless political referrals, with zero charges laid, referred, pursued. Zero. And so now, the information before House is that the strike rate is now zero from 10. Not zero from nine, because the shadow attorney general first referred it ... to NSW police under NSW law, they said nothing, then it went to the AFP, two more strikes. Zero from 10. I noted previously, to try and find some context to put to this, the most Test cricket ducks in Test cricket history was from a poor person, Ajit Agarkar, who had five in a row (shared by Australia’s Bob Holland). I can now inform the House that the record in all first-class cricket innings without scoring a run was set in 1930 by an English cricketer, Seymour Clark, nine innings, zero runs, he has now been beat. Zero from 10. If the shadow AG was a cricket player, he would be the worst first-class batsman in cricket history. In fact, I have been into deep ministerial discussions with the minister of health, to see if we can provide the shadow AG with a referral pad, so he can just save time with his referrals, just by writing the name, and the offence, and sending it off to the police. Perhaps now you might ask yourself, do you regret, do you apologise? Brendan O’Connor is making a personal explanation on being “misrepresented” after his photo was used in multiple News Corp outlets in place of Michael McCormack. Which it was. Because after two years, apparently even newsrooms can’t identify who the deputy prime minister is. It’s hard being sourdough. The attorney general calls on Labor to apologise to Angus Taylor. Cue the prime minister: “And on that note, I ask for all other questions to be tabled.” Christian Porter says Labor now has a strike rate of “zero from 10” in “meritless” referrals to police We get one more dixer – on Angus Taylor not being investigated by the AFP. The motion to suspend standing orders fails, and the MPs return to their normal seats. “Arrogance and cowardice is what characterises this man,” says Richard Marles, pointing to an indifferent prime minister, before he too is shut down. Tony Burke gets in “we saw the prime minister’s true character on display – stubborn, all about marketing” before he is shut down by Christian Porter. The bells ring again. Joel Fitzgibbon has welcomed David Littleproud’s return to the agriculture portfolio: I congratulate both David Littleproud and Keith Pitt on their ministerial appointments. It was a mistake to remove David Littleproud from the agriculture portfolio and Labor welcomes his re-appointment. David Littleproud was denied the portfolio following the 2019 election because he diverged too far from the National party playbook and its failed populism and pork-barrelling guidance. His challenge this time will be to take the prime minister and his colleagues with him on a reform journey to turn around the flat-lining productivity and poor profitability in the food and fibre sector. The Morrison government has no national plan for the agriculture sector and no coherent national plan for the ongoing drought. Despite some welcome rain, the drought is very much still with us. David Littleproud’s first act should be to stop cutting farming families off Farm Household Allowance. Labor will work with David Littleproud on any reform agenda in pursuit of sustainable profitability in the agriculture sector. The government can’t keep claiming the National Farmers Federation’s plan as its own. In the face of challenges from drought, bushfires, biosecurity threats, trade wars and the coronavirus, the sector deserves better. There are some rumblings from government backbenchers to just let Labor have one of these debates and get it over and done with, because Labor has been responding to the shut down of the motions by calling a quorum every chance it gets. Because of that, government MPs are having their speeches interrupted – they also can’t do their work, because they keep getting called back into the chamber. These aren’t things that impact Scott Morrison, because he doesn’t make those speeches, and he doesn’t have to form the quorum. But it is annoying the backbench, who have been doing this for a while now and are a bit sick of it. Still, rules are rules and Labor can call for a quorum if there aren’t enough government MPs in the chamber. And Labor’s tactics are honed through decades of factional wars within its own conferences and branches – it is better at this sort of political warfare, because it is a natural part of its own brand of politcs. And there is more chance that a Hemsworth will suddenly take notice of me than Morrison allows one of these debates to go forward. Christian Porter moves that Anthony Albanese no longer be heard. The division bells ring for four minutes. You know where this is going. The motion: That the House, one, notes: a) The prime minister is incapable of expressing regret and admitting when he is wrong. b) The prime minister blames others and attempts to cover up his failings with false or misleading claims including but in no way limited to: 1. The prime minister’s claim the response to the national bushfire crisis was a matter for the states and territories. 2. The prime minister’s claim volunteer firefighters didn’t need economic compensation because they wanted to be there. 3. The prime minister’s statement that he didn’t hold a hose when Australians were looking to him for national leadership in an unprecedented bushfire crisis. 4. The prime minister’s claim he had a conversation with a bushfire survivor who had lost everything, when he instead forced her to shake his hand only to turn his back when she asked for help, and c) The prime minister can’t learn from his mistakes if he never admits them, and Two, therefore calls on the prime minister to put the national interest ahead of his political interest, Labor is now moving to suspend standing orders with its latest “the prime minister is terrible” motion. Scott Morrison, who actually appears under pressure with these questions, but still hasn’t actually expressed regret, continued that answer: Mr Speaker, I do not – I do not regret establishing the national bushfire recovery agency within days. And putting $2bn into the national bushfire recovery agency. Mr Speaker, I don’t regret pulling together the peak groups of all the organisations from Indigenous organisations to charitable groups to tourism industry bodies to small business bodies, to those looking after wildlife and getting them together and putting the plan in place, that is now in full operation, that is out there supporting local communities. And I don’t regret that I did not take the actions that those opposite now seek to be doing in seeking to politicise a bushfire crisis, as they sought to do all summer. As they sought to do all summer, Mr Speaker, as we sought to communicate how we were helping Australians. As we reached out to Australians, as we coordinated our response, as we got that response out ... boots on the ground. All the leader of the opposition could do was seek political opportunities for himself and his colleagues. Mr Speaker, our government is responding to the crisis of the bushfires. Our government responded to the crisis of the north Queensland floods. Our government is responding and delivering on the response to the devastating drought that is being faced by the Australian people. Our government is responding to the virus that threatens the world today, and we are ensuring that to date our measures have been effective at protecting Australian people not just here in this country but overseas. The leader of the opposition is consumed by his political ambition. He is consumed by his political vanity and he has displayed a lack of character in this House today which only confirms what I expect: the each-way attitude he has to everything will be confirmed more and more in the eyes of the Australian people. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Why does the prime minister refuse to express any regret for saying the national bushfire crisis was a matter for the states, forcing a handshake on a bushfire survivor only to turn his back when she asked for help, claiming volunteer firefighters didn’t need compensation because they wanted ... and launching a political ad on a catastrophic fire day? Why can’t the prime minister admit that he ever got anything wrong? Morrison: No member of this House is perfect, Mr Speaker. Not me, not the leader of the opposition. And where there are things that need to be improved, and over the summer where I could have responded to events in different ways, I have already made those comments public because I will always seek to do my best each and every day for the people of Australia. But I tell you what I don’t regret ... I don’t regret when I returned to Australia – with my family ultimately, who followed me – I don’t regret the fact that we put in place the single biggest call-out of our reservists to go to the aid of Australians who are fighting this bushfire crisis. Josh Frydneberg continues to use old auditor general reports to attack Labor, in some sort of tactic to explain why the sports grants auditor general’s report into its scheme isn’t so bad. Or something. I am not sure how highlighting all the times the auditor general has said “this is dodgy” makes what is still happening any less smelly. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret telling communities devastated by the bushfires that the economic impact “could well prove to be positive”? Morrison: Mr Speaker, I’d be happy for the member to relay to me outside of this place or to send to my office what he’s actually referring to. But what I can say to the House is this: that, Mr Speaker, once we work through the recovery arrangements across all the bushfire-affected areas, once we get past the devastation that has impacted all of these bushfire-affected areas, there will be a recovery. There will be a rebuilding. There will be significant economic activity going into these areas to rebuild these communities, and that will support their economies when that occurs. This is a similar observation, Mr Speaker, that has been relayed to us by the treasury. That once you go through the process of rebuilding and recovery, that is what can support those economies getting back on to their feet. Those are the remarks I have made. Once again I suspect that the Labor party is seeking to be grubby on bushfires. I don’t remember those comments Labor is referring to, and I can’t find them, so can’t help you with that one, sorry. And here is the relevant part of the transcript at the time: Journalist: Do you think volunteer firefighters – should we be looking at starting to pay them? Prime minister: Well, we have a volunteer firefighting force across the country which numbers in the, you know, the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands. And that also includes those who come in from other jurisdictions. It is a standing volunteer force. And these are matters that are considered from time to time, but this is why I am so appreciative of the commitment made by employers to support that volunteer effort. The volunteer effort is a big part of our natural disaster response and it is a big part of how Australia has always dealt with these issues. We are constantly looking at ways to better facilitate the volunteer effort, but to professionalise that at that scale is not a matter that has previously been accepted and it’s not a matter that is currently under consideration by the government. But as is the case with all fire events, or as is the case with all flood events and other natural disasters, this actual nationally coordinated effort is designed to constantly look at those issues, post these events. And the recommendations come forward from the chiefs, those directly responsible for fighting these fires and coordinating resources. And you’re right, these fires have been going on for some months now and when I was speaking with the commissioner on the weekend out at Wilberforce, where we have the megafire in the north-west at the moment, we were talking through the crew rotations. And the fact is these crews, yes, they’re tired, but they also want to be out there defending their communities. And so we do all we can to rotate their shifts to give them those breaks, but equally, they – and in many cases – you’ve got to hold them back to make sure they get that rest. And I thank them all for what they’re doing, particularly all those who support them. Mark Butler and Mark Dreyfus have responded to the news that the Australian federal police will not be investigating Angus Taylor: Serious questions remain unanswered over Angus Taylor and his doctored documents scandal. Two police investigations have now failed to clarify where Angus Taylor got his dodgy figures from. Angus Taylor assured parliament that this fabricated report was ‘directly downloaded’ from the City of Sydney council website. We know this is not true, as a law enforcement official confirmed: “The document had to have been doctored from Canberra.” The public internet archives, the Trove database maintained by the National Library, confirmed that the correct version of the report was on the internet all through 2019. We know the Department of Energy’s draft letter provided to the minister’s office contained no reference to the City of Sydney’s travel expenditure. If Angus Taylor continues to refuse to come clean, then the prime minister must order a proper, independent and transparent investigation into his minister and commit to making the findings public. But it is done. And a reminder that NSW Liberal minister Andrew Constance – who fought, alongside his neighbours, to save his house in that electorate, and was out there every single day (and was so involved that for a brief period was put on a list for unaccounted people) – had a different take to Scott Morrison of that visit: “Well, I didn’t even know he was coming and I haven’t had a call from him,” Constance told the Seven network. So to be honest with you, the locals probably gave him the welcome that he probably deserved. I’d say this to the prime minister today: the nation wants you to open up the cheque books, help people rebuild their lives. I know this is tough and I know I’m on his side of politics, but you know, Gladys [Berejiklian, the NSW premier] and [the RFS commissioner] Shane Fitzsimmons came here two days ago and they obviously visited the fire-affected part of my electorate in the north. Glad’s he going to come back, but this is the feeling that people are going through.” Terri Butler to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret saying he had a conversation with a bushfire survivor who lost her home in Cobargo, when video clearly shows there wasn’t a conversation? He forced her to shake his hand and then turned his back on her as she asked for help. Morrison: I thank the member for her question about my visit to Cobargo with my wife Jenny on that occasion. I’d just been through fire response centre and been elsewhere. Fire had raged through Cobargo days before. I was the first member of parliament to visit Cobargo after those fires. I went there because I knew the community needed to know that the government would be there and, Mr Speaker, that I was prepared to hear from them. And to be there, as I had spoken to many people, including Mark, who was the captain of the Rural Fire Service brigade there, and the many others I met at the Rural Fire Service brigade, and I went up to the showgrounds and there were some people who were very pleased that I was there, and I discussed the impact of the fires on them. And there were others who were very distraught. They were very upset. I was there and they were able to vent their frustration and their anger directly at me. When you’re prime minister, you turn up and you listen and whatever comes at you ... you’re prepared to do. That the lady you referred to raised with me funding levels for the NSW fire service, that’s the issue that they raised with me. The leader of the oppposition will remember back when he was on the mid-coast, I think it was further north, people heckled him at a press conference and yelled out at him. Now, you will not find me criticising him for being in a fire zone and being subject to those sorts of things. I don’t think that helps. For the opposition to be engaging in this sort of low-rank behaviour, it doesn’t help anybody recovering from the fires. All I know is I was in Cobargo ... I was there for the people of Cobargo, and I’ll be there for the people of Cobargo into the future as well, and they know it. And here is when he said he didn’t hold a hose, on December 20: I mean, I took leave in June as well and we did follow exactly the same practice. So I mean, we don’t always say where we’re going. My privacy with my family when we’re having leave, I’m sure people understand, that’s something that I know Australians would respect. But I think on this occasion, John, because there have been such horrendous events that have understandably caused a lot of anxiety, I deeply regret that and so does Jenny, and to all those who were affected by the fires especially, we deeply regret it. And I’ll be getting back there as soon as I can. The girls and Jen will stay on and stay out the rest of the time we had booked here. But I know Australians understand this and they’ll be pleased I’m coming back, I’m sure. They know that, you know, I don’t hold a hose, mate, and I don’t sit in a control room. That’s the brave people who do that are doing that job. But I know that Australians would want me back at this time out of these fatalities, so I’ll happily come back and do that. Richard Marles to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret saying, and I quote, “I don’t hold a hose, mate” when Australians were looking to him for national leadership? Morrison: I was simply making the point that the operational response that was going on at that time was being handled excellently by the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. And I stand by those comments, Mr Speaker, that I support the amazing efforts of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, which only a few days ago were in here, and I commend them here again today. Each and every day we’ve been working closely with that service, as we have with the firefighting service, CFA in Queensland and South Australia. I note today, as they did yesterday, those opposite sought to politicise the bushfires over summer and they continue to do it now. Here is the story on that at the time: Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret saying that volunteer firefighters don’t need economic compensation for lost income because they “want to be out there”? Morrison: And once again the leader of the opposition is misrepresenting what occurred for political purposes. For political purposes, as he always does, Mr Speaker. There is no issue that the leader of the opposition will not seek to exploit for personal, political gain. And this is just another example. Another example of his lack of character. Now, Mr Speaker, what he suggested, Mr Speaker, was not what I outlined when those remarks were made. Mr Speaker, what was raised in the press conference I was at was in relation to – for the first time when the suggestion was made that there may be some ... that there may be raised by the journalists about whether, Mr Speaker, we would be considering ... It was being raised with me as to whether the commonwealth would be providing compensation for the rural and regional affairs and transport references committee – Rural Fire Service volunteers. That is not a matter that is normally dealt with by the federal government. It is a matter that is traditionally dealt with by the Rural Fire Services, Mr Speaker. On that occasion, I was reflecting comments made back to me when I had advised with Rural Fire Service’s members, and they had put it to me when they were out there they wanted to be out there protecting their communities. That’s what I was talking about. They know that they would prefer not to have fires. They know that they would prefer to be at home with their families and their communities. What I was saying is that duty called, they wanted to answer that call to duty, because that’s what our volunteers do. Michael McCormack just gave an update on the coronavirus and I have never wished to be on a cruise ship more. The UK’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has met with Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, with the pair holding a brief media conference ahead of question time. It is the first overseas visit for the UK foreign secretary since Brexit was finalised six days ago. Raab faced questions about the Australian government’s record on climate change and the UK’s ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 – a position it will be advocating in the lead up to the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow later this year. Raab said he had a “good, constructive” conversation with Payne about the UK’s goal and Australia’s position. “We want to lead in producing a step change in the international response, the global response to this challenge of our times,” he said. When he was asked about Australia’s policy record on climate change, which was “politically contentious” in the wake of the summer bushfire crisis, Raab said the UK’s approach was to “try to make a success” of COP26. “We are also going to talk to all the countries about their contributions in getting their emissions down.” Payne said that in the lead up to COP26, the Australian government would be looking at what “practical climate action we can take together”. On the British government’s decision to allow the Chinese tech giant Huawei a substantial role in supplying the country’s 5G network – at odds with Australia’s decision – Raab suggested there had been a “market failure” that had contributed to the decision. However, he said there was nothing in the agreement that would inhibit intelligence sharing among Five Eyes partners. On 20 December 2019 the AFP received a referral from NSW police regarding allegations of falsifying documents from the office of the lord mayor of Sydney by the office of the minister for energy and emissions reduction. Following inquiries undertaken and information provided by NSW police, the AFP has determined it is unlikely further investigation will result in obtaining sufficient evidence to substantiate a commonwealth offence. The AFP assessment of this matter identified there is no evidence to indicate the minister for energy and emissions reduction was involved in falsifying information. The low level of harm and the apology made by the minister for energy and emissions reduction to the lord mayor of Sydney, along with the significant level of resources required to investigate, were also factored into the decision not to pursue this matter. The AFP now considers this matter finalised. Vincent Connelly, who continues to treat question time dixers like it’s an audition for the unauthorised Perth society of over-actors, asks Josh Frydenberg to turn the auditor general’s report into the sports grants affair into Labor’s fault, and the treasurer joins in on the chewing the scenery theme: As those opposite will be aware, this is not the only report of the auditor general that’s made some interesting observations. I’m reminded that there was an ANAO report number 3, 10-11, into a $550m infrastructure program, which said on page 38, and I quote: ‘Ministers made an explicit decision to approve an application that was known to be otherwise ineligible under the guidelines.’ And also went on to say: ‘The equitable situation of all applicants was not evidence in the processes employed.’ So, Mr Speaker, who are the beneficiaries of this process? Well, the auditor general went on to say on page 48, and I quote: ‘The awarding of funding to projects disproportionately favoured ALP seats.’ In fact, the auditor general found, when it came to funding, ALP electorates had a success rate almost three times the coalition, Mr Speaker. Who was the responsible minister overshowing this $550m grant program? None other than the member for Grayndler, Mr Speaker! Hypocrisy, thy name is Labor. Dude – that was a decade ago. Scott Morrison jumps up to add to his answer to Mike Kelly: I‘m sure the member for Eden-Monaro would like to know that the NSW government opened their program, which is funded by the federal government in relation to small business recovery, on 2 February 2020; 109 expressions of interest have been received before the program opened, 68 applications have been received, with an average amount requested of $30,981 per grant. And for the information of other members, the Victorian program has not yet opened. It’s expected to open this week. These programs are run by the state governments, funded by the federal government; 114 expressions of interest have been received by 5 February. For South Australia, that opened on 30 January 2020, with 14 grants totalling $329,435 paid so far. And they have approved a further five grants. In Queensland there have been nil small business impact, with no grants program in place from at this point. The NSW loans opened on 3 February 2020, just a few days ago. That is also run by the NSW government. Queensland concessional loans opened on 3 February also, and guidelines are now being considered by South Australia and Victoria. I hope that information is helpful. Cool beans. The AFP still hasn’t got back to anyone, but Anne Davies has confirmed the Sky News story with Taylor’s office. No investigation. David Littleproud likes Rebekha Sharkie’s mum’s mulberry jam: “Best I have ever tasted.” Mike Kelly to Scott Morrison: The Long Stock Brewery in my community this time of year would be paying 24 to 30 casual shifts a week. Because of the bushfires they’re currently paying four. Loss of wages for casual and permanent staff is hurting my community. They’re losing jobs, they’re leaving the region, and the government, they tell me, is not providing any help. Why is it that after they were promised bushfire-affected businesses immediate relief that they are still unable to access that help? Morrison says he’ll get Stuart Robert to add to the answer, but then takes up all the time and just answers it himself: Now, when it comes to small businesses, as the member would be aware, there are qualifying criteria for businesses that have been directly impacted by those fires which is the same criteria that applies to small businesses that are affected by the floods up in north Queensland that occurred at this time last year. They apply the same criteria to those affected businesses in the bushfire-affected zones today. That is important because we will provide the same support that was provided to those in devastating disasters as to this disaster as well. ... But if the member is suggesting that the disaster recovery arrangements should change that, the taxpayer should be the insurer of last resort on all matters, then that is not a policy that your government pursued and it is not a policy that this government is pursuing. Those grants ... [are] for small businesses that need those grants, those businesses we have put the support through with the NSW government access to the support they need. These individual cases, I’m sure the minister who is responsible for emergency management would be pleased to pass on through the recovery agency to provide whatever assistance we can. But this government is providing the most significant package of relief we have seen in relation to a disaster of this nature. It’s initial, it’s additional and it will keep rolling every single day and it will be there for years and years and years to come. The next dixer is just on how amazing the economy is. Pretty amazing, says Josh Frydenberg. The most amazing economy you’ve ever seen. It’s a beautiful economy. Everyone says it. It is so much more amazing than Labor’s economy, don’t cha know. Oh, also the drought and the fires and coronavirus is an issue, but don’t you worry about that. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Is the prime minister aware that the deputy prime minister foreshadowed yet another reshuffle when he told Kieran Gilbert on Sky News yesterday that Senator McKenzie would be coming back? Does the prime minister intend to return Senator McKenzie to his cabinet? Morrison launches into a congratulations spree of the new ministers. You get a congratulations. And you get a congratulations. YOU ALL GET A CONGRATULATIONS. Coalition governments in this country have given Australians stronger economies, safer borders, Mr Speaker, stronger national security and a focus on the needs of rural and regional Australians. Morrison accuses Labor of voting against the drought fund (it voted for it) so Albanese asks him to withdraw. Tony Smith doesn’t require Morrison to withdraw (procedure is you do this stuff after QT) but Morrison withdraws anyway. Just so he can get to this bit: But this each-way leader of the opposition, Mr Speaker, each way, he’s for a drought fund, he’s against a drought fund. He’s for tax cuts, he’s against tax cuts. ... So this each-way leader of the opposition, he’s for things, he’s against things. What is the leader of the opposition... Smith sits him down because the time is up. The end of Stuart Robert’s answer is here: These changes are designed to make the program more robust by requiring additional evidence ... when using income information to identify potential overpayments. As stated in November this year, this means we’ll no longer raise a debt where the only information we’re relying on is the averaging of ATO. For those debts raised to date, the statement was made that Services Australia will be carefully and methodically working to identify those customers whose debts may have been calculated using a portioned ATO PAYG income data. It’s complex to do that, it’s a highly manual process. It’s not appropriate to pre-empt the outcome of this process and we’ll advise the House in the future when that process comes to its conclusion.” So, not sorry for it being illegal, just making robodebt “more robust”. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret administering an illegal robodebt scheme, a fact that was revealed in answer to a question on notice in the Senate today by the Australian Taxation Office. Stuart Robert takes it: As the House would know, on the morning of 19 November last year the government announced a further refinement of the income compliance program. This is part of my ... to strengthen and improve the scheme. The program has already undergone a number of iterations and refinements since its inception under Labor in 2011. In response to community feedback, these changes will make the program more robust by requiring additional evidence when the... Albanese interrupts with “you’re breaking the law”, which Tony Smith takes as a point of order on relevance. Robert continues reading his prepared answer (the release of the documents meant they knew this was coming) but does not address the question of regret. Luke Henrique-Gomes has a story on when the government received legal advice about robodebt: The government received legal advice that debts issued under the botched robodebt scheme were unlawful, confidential documents provided to a Senate committee have revealed. Emails between top tax office officials published on Thursday show that the agency was told by the Department of Social Services that debts based solely on the controversial ‘income averaging’ method were ‘not lawful debts’. The same year we were told the weekend was under attack because of electric cars, electric vehicle sales increased. I’ve just been alerted that Katie Allen and Tim Wilson have just made speeches on the fires in the federation chamber (the Michael McCormack of parliamentary chambers because no one pays attention to it). Both have pushed for more action on climate. That’s of note because, as Sarah Martin reported this morning, Allen has called for a minister for climate change – and there have been suggestions Wilson should be it. Earlier this week (I think it was Tuesday), Sky News political editor Andrew Clennell reported on air that he had heard there may be some “good news” for Angus Taylor later this week. Sky News is reporting the Australian federal police has determined not to pick up the Angus Taylor investigation. We checked in with the AFP this morning and have not heard back – a call to the media unit made in the last few minutes also hasn’t confirmed it, as yet. Adani has another statement: Adani will not have a conviction recorded after self-reporting to the Queensland government that we made an administrative error in our 2017/18 annual return for the Carmichael mine. We today pleaded guilty in the Brisbane magistrates court for providing the administering authority an erroneous document and will pay a $20,000 fine. This is in relation to an administrative error. There was no environmental harm, all relevant works were legal, and fully complied with our project conditions. We took responsibility for the administrative error at the time and introduced improvements to internal processes when it was discovered in 2018 and reported by us, to ensure paperwork errors of this nature are avoided in the future. We are pleased this matter is now resolved. Bob Katter, who stepped down as party leader to concentrate on being a gladiator against his enemies or some such thing (presumably crocodiles), has had a very Bob Katter response to David Littleproud’s return to agriculture. From his statement: Our farmers are in deep trouble with drought, so what’s his solution? Get rid of the farmers. Now the only people out there buying the farms are the Chinese and others with foreign interests. I’m looking forward to him being Ag Minister like the Pope watching Attila the Hun coming for the Peninsula. He’s a free marketeer. His party’s free market policies have been the death knell of the dairy industry, the national cattle herd is down 20%, sheep are down 60% and we are a net importer of fruit and vegetables, pork and seafood. I will continue to fight for a rural reconstruction bank, dams in north Queensland and across Australia, as well as vital freight links for our rural areas. The Greens have held a press conference pressuring the government over the failure to release its anti-corruption commission bill. Greens Senate leader Larissa Waters and senators Sarah Hanson-Young and Janet Rice were also asked if they’ll be keeping their portfolios after Adam Bandt became leader. Waters replied: We’ve just had some new leadership arrangements and we’ll be having, naturally, those discussions about what important issues we’ll continue to work on. That’s a matter for the leader, and always has been in our party. Hanson-Young replied: I love the environment portfolio, I love fighting for Australia’s environment, and I have every intention I’m going to keep doing it. That was stated with a degree of confidence. Hanson-Young didn’t directly answer the question about whether she had confirmed this with Bandt but, if not, she has rowed the boat out very far. Waters also commented on the mysterious $165,000 donation the Liberal party declared from a company run by Scott Briggs – a key Scott Morrison ally – and then revoked, claiming the declaration was a mistake. Waters: It just goes to show how much we need donations reform and a federal corruption watchdog. First, there was a donation made by a mate that was wanting a favour, to get a contract. Then a couple of days later, ‘Oh no, there was no donation.’ What’s the story here? And why are people able to make donations when they are applying for government approval or government contracts? Clean up the system! The Brisbane magistrates court fined Adani $20,000 after it pleaded guilty for wrongly declaring land clearing to the Queensland environment department. The court did not record a conviction. The UK’s foreign minister, Dominic Raab, is in Australia to talk trade for the newly single nation, after its split from the EU. This is pretty important for Australia, which is also negotiating an EU free trade agreement. That one is a little more tricky, because as the French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told the AFR in November last year, France expects Australia to do more on climate before it agrees to any trade deal: The other priority challenge is indeed for the future agreement to be highly ambitious in terms of sustainable development. Our two countries are nearly 15,000 kilometres apart and we must show that a trade agreement between the EU and Australia plays a positive role in the face of climate change: that’s a very important point for our parliament and our civil society,” he said at the time. The UK is also strong on the need for more climate action. Here was Boris Johnson at the Glasgow climate conference yesterday: We’ve put so much CO2 in the atmosphere collectively that the entire planet is swaddled in a tea cosy of the stuff. It’s now predicted, unless we take urgent action, to get 3C hotter, and in the hurricanes and the bushfires and melting of the ice caps and the acidification of the oceans, the evidence is now overwhelming. We know as a country, as a society, as a planet, as a species, we must now act. Scott Morrison insists Australia is doing just fine. The UK may not be pushing quite as hard for Australia to do more on climate, as some in the EU, but in an interview with Sabra Lane on the ABC earlier this week, Vicky Treadall, the British high commissioner, said it was part of the talks: Well, Britain has made it very clear that they want everyone to have a greater level of ambition. We are taking a global leadership role on climate change. We are hosting COP26 (2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference) and at COP26 we will be asking all nations to look again at where they stand. Obviously we are working closely with the Australian government to see what the art of the possible is. Now I won’t go into details. These are ongoing conversations that we will have in the coming months but where we know we can work very closely with Australia is in the whole area of renewables, the new technology, the new jobs that will come. The transition of our own economy, the lessons we have learnt and how we can share that with others. AAP has an update on the latest trade figures: Australia’s trade surplus shrank to $5.223 billion in December, a drop of $295 million on the surplus in November 2019. In seasonally adjusted terms, exports rose 1.0% to $41.29 billion for the month and imports were up 2% to $36.07 billion, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. Westpac economist Andrew Hanlan said the result broadly met market expectations for a surplus of $5.5 billion. He said a narrowing trade surplus was to be expected with commodity prices moderating in the quarter, notably iron ore, which had spiked in the June quarter due to the supply shock from Brazil. “The key surprise for the month of December was around exports. Metal ores, gold and fuels all moved in the right direction ... However, we were looking for stronger gains – based on partial information and mindful of a potential pre Lunar New Year bounce,” he said. The Senate is dealing with the government’s latest round of banking royal commission bills. Labor is in support, so there’s no problem there. But the banking royal commission was handed down a year ago. So there is a lot of chat about how long this is all taking. Labor has supported a motion by Liberals Eric Abetz and Concetta Fierravanti-Wells asking schools to consider having children recite the same pledge that naturalised Australian citizens must make. The motion states that the Senate: notes the Australian citizenship pledge, which in part reads as follows: I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I will uphold and obey; and (b) calls on all schools to consider having the citizenship pledge recited by students on appropriate occasions. This is a slight troll of Labor education spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek – who supports the idea, has done since 2011, and reiterated the value of the pledge as recently as Australia Day. It got up 51 to 9, with only the Greens voting against. Among the Labor members who voted on it: Tony Sheldon, Louise Pratt, Jenny McAllister, Tim Ayres, Murray Watt, Kimberley Kitching, Deb O’Neill, Helen Polley, Don Farrell and Kim Carr. Eric Abetz and Connie Fierravanti-Wells look like they are trolling Labor in the Senate, calling a Senate motion over Tanya Plibersek’s repeated call for a citizenship pledge. Labor is voting with the government on the (non-binding) motion that there should be one. Mark Butler has some thoughts about Keith Pitt’s elevation to the cabinet: The new minister for resources and water, Keith Pitt, is the government’s biggest advocate for nuclear power and a dedicated opponent to global action on climate change through the Paris agreement. Minister Pitt’s history as a nuclear power advocate is well documented, most recently through pushing the energy minister into commissioning an inquiry into nuclear power. Having appointed such a strong nuclear advocate to the resources portfolio, Scott Morrison must now come clean about his government’s nuclear power plan and let Australians know which regions are in his nuclear firing line. Over 100 Australian communities have previously been identified as possible locations for nuclear reactors and nuclear dumps, including; Jervis Bay, Townsville, Gladstone, Perth, Western Port in Victoria and the New South Wales north coast. Keith Pitt’s appointment to the crucial resources portfolio is also another signal that Scott Morrison is walking even further away from action on climate change. Keith Pitt’s opposition to the Paris climate agreement is so deep that in 2018 he resigned from the assistant ministry in protest against Australia’s participation in global action on climate change. The National Farmers’ Federation has welcomed David Littleproud’s return to the agriculture portfolio: National Farmers’ Federation President Fiona Simson has congratulated David Littleproud on his appointment as Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management. ‘Having held the agriculture portfolio before and most recently the responsibilities of water, drought, rural finance, natural disaster and emergency management, Minister Littleproud knows the farm sector’s issues better than most,’ Ms Simson said. ‘Importantly, Minister Littleproud’s appointment will provide our industry continuity during a period of unprecedented challenges.’ The NFF also welcomed Keith Pitt to the all-important water portfolio. Sometimes the world looks perfect Nothing to rearrange. Sometimes you get a feeling Like you need some kind of change. No matter what the odds are this time, Nothing’s going to stand in my way. This flame in my heart, And a long lost friend Gives every dark street a light at the end. Standing tall, on the wings of my dream. Rise and fall, on the wings of my dream. The department of community affairs has released a series of question on notice answers, after questions were raised over the legality of robodebt. Greens senator Rachel Siewert said the government needs to answer how long it knew there were issues over robodebt – ahead of the court case. This is a fundamental question and with the government making a claim of Public Interest Immunity over the release of legal advice it is clear that they don’t want Australia to know. People in our community have been traumatised and harassed for years and years, many have large debts they don’t owe and are being forced to pay with interest and they want and deserve answers. There is so much uncertainty around the review process and which debts have been paused and when. The government has a responsibility to be open and upfront about this process. It should not be up to the slow court process for us to uncover what on earth has been going on and it’s clear that the government must come clean. It’s a failure of both economic management and basic duty to not have provided a costing for the robodebt clean-up process in MYEFO. Marise Payne will hold a press conference with her UK counterpart, Dominic Raab, at 1.30. George Christensen spoke about Julian Assange’s case in the parliament yesterday. Andrew Wilkie and Christensen will travel to visit Assange on February 16 in UK (they are paying for the trip themselves). In less than two weeks time the member for Clark and I will travel at our own expense to meet with Australian citizen and journalist-publisher Julian Assange, who is being detained in Belmarsh prison in London. The social visit with Mr Assange will take place on Sunday 16 February. We want to see firsthand how Mr Assange is fairing, because of a number of concerning reports about his health and the severity of his treatment within the UK prison system. We appreciate the cooperation of the British authorities at Belmarsh in confirming our social visit. My concern is that a foreign country, the US, is seeking to extradite an Australian citizen from another foreign country for breaching laws of a foreign country that they were not subject to as they were not in that country, the US, to breach those laws. What is the alleged breach? It is the receipt of information that was in the public interest that he then published. That should not be a crime. It is my view and the view of the Parliamentary Friends of the Bring Julian Assange Home Group that extradition proceedings should cease and Mr Assange should be brought back to Australia. Mr Assange has been pursued for 10 years, and he spent more than six years holed up in an Ecuadorian embassy ahead of his arrest and imprisonment at Belmarsh. Mr Assange must now be allowed to return home. This is also ticking away on the backbench. Andrew Wilkie and George Christensen are leading a bipartisan (backbench) push to have Julian Assange returned to Australia. They will be visiting him next week, ahead of his extradition hearing in the UK. Swimmingly well The Greens will now move a motion in the Senate calling for Adani’s approval to be cancelled, using the guilty plea in the Brisbane magistrates court as a trigger. It will also wedge Labor on the issue. From Larissa Waters’ statement: The federal government must now cancel Adani’s approval and I’ll be lodging a motion in the Senate today calling for just that. A criminal conviction is a legal trigger for the federal government to review and revoke Adani’s approval. If the government keeps ignoring Adani’s breaches, it’s just one rule for coal donors and another for ordinary Australians. Adani will be criminally convicted today, yet it is still in line for public subsidies. But if you miss one Centrelink appointment and you’re screwed. It shows where the government’s priorities lie - with the coal donors, not the community. People will also be watching on Monday how Labor votes on my motion - they will have to finally pick a side on Adani and show whether they stand with the big polluters or a safe climate. The Sydney Morning Herald has reported on some comments by Malcolm Turnbull to the Coalition for Conservation, that Liberal MPs who are sceptical about climate change are “reinforced and amplified ... by the rightwing media”, including News Corp, and “basically operates like terrorists”. “Basically they say, unless you give us what we want we will blow the joint up,” he reportedly said. Turnbull blamed entrenched internal opposition to his climate policy for his downfall in August 2018, and he’s used the “terrorist” line before – in comments to Guardian Australia and the BBC among others. Still, if it’s any sign of the content of his upcoming autobiography, he’s not holding back. Turnbull also said: If ever Australians were under any illusion that the consequences of a hotter and drier climate were real, harsh and dangerous, those illusions have been shattered this summer. These bushfires are utterly without precedent in our history ... This has branded us in a way that we would never ever imagine could happen. We are seen as very behind ... as a leader in a negative sense. That should really embarrass so many Australians. Adani has pleaded guilty to providing misleading information to Queensland environmental authorities in the Brisbane magistrates court this morning. It failed to report land clearing in its 2017/18 return. Adani has responded by calling it “an administrative error”. After self-reporting to the Queensland Government that we made an administrative error in our 2017/18 Annual Return for the Carmichael mine, Adani will today plead guilty in the Brisbane Magistrate’s Court for providing the administering authority an erroneous document. Importantly, there was no environmental harm, all relevant works were legal, and fully complied with our project conditions. We have taken responsibility for the administrative error and improvements to internal processes were introduced at the time the administrative error was discovered in 2018 and reported by us to ensure paperwork errors of this nature are avoided in the future. We look forward to this matter being resolved. The court is yet to deliver a sentence on the matter. The maximum penalty is $3m. The press conference finishes on the bushfire royal commission. Scott Morrison: I’ve also said that that royal commission needs to look at the preparedness and resilience in relation to these bushfire events. And that means an understanding that that needs to be done in a hotter, longer and drier summer. And the impacts of climate change on that are acknowledged and understood. And so that means that we need to have a discussion not just about emissions reduction, which happens in the broad, but if you’re talking about climate resilience, then hazard reduction is as important, if not more, for the direct safety of people affected by these fires than emissions reduction. The longer-term adaptation measures are also important. I’m not going to allow a confined, narrow debate when it comes to understanding what it means to live in the climate we’re going to live in. It’s not just about emissions reduction. That’s important. But it’s also about resilience and it’s also about adaptation. Asked about the push within the Coalition to build new coal fired power stations/invest in coal, Scott Morrison sticks to the same old lines about “balance”. He is then asked by Sarah Martin about whether or not he is talking about retro-fitting some of the existing coal fired power stations, and his response is included below: Our policy is a common sense one. It gets the balance right. It understands the need for the maintenance and sweating of those assets which are providing reliability to the system, and where those types of assets in the future can be developed in the way that would be required under the environmental standards, then that’s not ruled out either. And so it’s common sense. It’s a common-sense, well-balanced policy and I think that embraces everybody, not just in the Liberal party room, but right across the Coalition. Martin: Are you talking about retro-fitting existing coal-fired power stations to reduce emissions? Morrison: Well, we work with all the energy companies, because we know that we don’t want to force people’s power prices up. And we don’t want to see a loss of capacity out of the system that is unnecessary. And so we take all of these decisions in the national interest. Martin: So government funds could be used to do that? Morrison: Look, that’s your speculation. That’s not what I’ve said. Martin: But I’m asking you ... Morrison: That’s not what I’ve said. Asked about the hit to the economy by the coronavirus, Scott Morrison says: So, yes, there will be an economic hit because of the coronavirus, just as there will be as a result of the bushfires. But there will also be a recovery and there will be a recovery to the bushfires with the extensive works that will be undertaken with rebuilding and equally you can expect down the track. [When?] Hard to know, because there are so many unknowns about the duration of this virus. You would have heard from [chief health office] Dr Murphy that they’ve been preparing a lot of work for the government on what the various scenarios are at a global level and how that might impact domestically. So a lot of work [is] to be done but we’re being very transparent about that with states and territories and we intend to be, also, with the Australian people. But we expect a hit, particularly in this quarter, on the coronavirus, and how much more it extends beyond that really does depend on how this virus continues to play out at a global level. David Littleproud’s return to the agriculture portfolio was so readily expected that lobby groups already have their congratulation emails ready to go: CropLife Australia’s chief executive officer, Matthew Cossey, said, “CropLife Australia and our members congratulate Minister Littleproud on his appointment to the important role of minister for Agriculture. Minister Littleproud has shown he is a passionate advocate for agriculture and regional Australia more broadly. There is still work to do to further improve the performance of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority to ensure Australian farmers have timely access to the crucial innovations of the plant science industry. Michael McCormack explains the need for a two-thirds majority in any future Nationals leadership spill (which, in a divided room of 21 people, would all but certainly shore up his leadership) with all the charisma of a bowl of overcooked pasta. It’s a matter for the party and the party’s management as to whether this goes forward. Both of the other major parties have a similar sort of rule in place. The fact is we want to make sure that for the member who brought this up and raised it, wants to end the speculation about the leadership. And I think that’s probably an important thing. This is the same man who yesterday told the Seven network after being asked how many votes he held on by: Just how close I am not sure. It is National party convention not to reveal the votes and at the end of the day, the votes do not count. What counts, for me, is regional Australians. Keith Pitt has been a massive, massive, massive advocate for nuclear power. Scott Morrison is asked about whether that will be a problem. He says the government is looking at all energy options, but the nuclear policy remains (that would be a no to nuclear). “Onwards and upwards from here,” says Michael McCormack. The new ministry will be sworn in at 5.30pm. That’s after question time, meaning the new ministers will get some time to scrub up on their portfolios before Monday when, no doubt, Labor will attempt to trip a few of them up. Scott Morrison: On Mark Coulton: Mark Coulton will continue to serve as minister for regional health, regional communications and local government. Andrew Gee: Andrew Gee will come into the ministry as minister for regional education, decentralisation and minister assisting the minister for trade and investment. Michelle Landry: Michelle Landry will continue to serve as an assistant minister for children and families, and will also serve as assistant minister for northern Australia. And you won’t find a stronger champion than Michelle Landry. ... other than Keith Pitt [the guy who actually holds the portfolio] for northern Australia, when it comes to ensuring that the needs of northern Australia are addressed. Kevin Hogan: And Kevin Hogan will come into the assistant ministry, where he will be the assistant minister to the deputy prime minister. Scott Morrison: On Michael McCormack: Obviously the leader of the Nationals will continue on in his current portfolios and that will also include a very big focus on the water grid and ensuring that Australia has the water infrastructure it needs for a resilient future. On David Littleproud: David Littleproud will continue to serve in cabinet. He will take on the portfolios of minister for agriculture and that will combine with his other portfolios of drought and emergency management. The issue of natural disasters is one that encompasses all portfolios of government and obviously, as minister for emergency management, that will have particular responsibilities for him, but when it comes to dealing with natural disasters and our broader resilience to the environment and the climate we are living in – as I outlined at the Press Club last week – I believe this goes across every single portfolio of government. On Darren Chester: Darren Chester will be entering cabinet, but he will continue to do the wonderful and outstanding job he’s been doing as minister for veterans’ affairs and minister for defence personnel. I’m advised that this is the first time veterans’ affairs has been back in cabinet since the late Ben Humphreys in 1993 and I think that sends a strong message about our commitment to veterans in this government. On Keith Pitt: Keith Pitt will take on the role and enter cabinet as minister for resources, water and northern Australia, highlighting again the importance of all of those portfolio matters and their presence around the cabinet table. We are getting a short continuity with change message ahead of the cabinet reshuffle announcement. Everything is hunky dory with the Liberals and the Nationals, Scott Morrison says. Never been stronger. The heart of the relationship between the Liberals and the Nationals is our deep passion and conviction for supporting the needs of rural and regional Australians, and our belief in the future of rural and regional Australia. And at its heart, that’s what the Coalition is about. That’s why we have come together so willingly over such a long period of time. Andrew Giles had some things to say about Chris Knaus’s story this morning on the “mistaken” $165,000 donation made to the Liberal party by a Scott Morrison ally, who is also vying for the visa privatisation contract: Peter Dutton and Scott Morrison won’t walk away from visa privatisation. And today this issue has descended into a complete farce. Mr Scott Briggs, the principal behind one of the bids, a close Liberal party associate of the prime minister and Minister Coleman, has declared donations of $300,000 to the Liberal party, $165,000 through an entity known as Southern Strategy. This morning it’s reported that he says this donation was an accident. The Liberal party won’t comment or explain it. This is a complete farce. Mike Bowers was in the chamber for the Angus Taylor motion Scott Morrison will hold a press conference at 10.45 to announce the new cabinet. Keith Pitt gets Matt Canavan’s former portfolio of mining, resources and northern Australia. Lucy Barbour of the ABC reports that David Littleproud won’t hold onto the water portfolio but will get agriculture back – which was also expected. Darren Chester’s portfolio of veteran affairs will move into the cabinet. The frontbench reshuffle we were supposed to get yesterday, is coming today. As expected, Darren Chester and Keith Pitt get the cabinet promotions. Scott Morrison also told Alan Jones that he had concerns over where the bushfire donation money was being sent: Jones: Forget what you are giving, the government are giving, I’m talking about the public. People listening to you now have given a half a billion dollars. And can I just leave it with you? They’re down there. They’re seeing none of this money. And so something’s got to be mobilised to get the money to the people. If I could leave that thought with you. Morrison: Look, absolutely Alan, I have a similar concern about this. I mean, I can tell you that over $111 million dollars has been paid out. I think it’s very important that charities, and state governments for that matter, are reporting on how much money is going out the door and to where. Jones: Well … there are very few people who can tell the prime minister to stop talking but I’ve got to go to the news. But we’ll talk again soon about that and other issues. Alan Jones had a chat to Scott Morrison this morning. From the transcript: Jones: I was just thinking last night, when we’re going to talk to you today, you must feel as though you’ve gone 10 rounds with Muhammad Ali. It’s been pile on the prime minister for a couple of months, hasn’t it? Morrison: Well, there’s been a lot of that. But, you know, that’s what this job’s about. You stand up to that and you stand up for what you believe in. You just put your head down and you just keep going. That’s what my dad always taught me. Jones: Ah your dad, well I’m sorry about all that too, you’ve had a … Morrison: Yeah, thanks for your lovely message. Annastacia Palaszczuk doubled down on her attack on the federal government when speaking to the ABC this morning, calling for disaster payments to be given to Queensland tourism operators over the coronavirus impact: But we also know that this coronavirus is going to have an impact. It’s going to have an impact on the Queensland economy and a very large impact on the Australian economy. So yesterday I convened large members of the stakeholder groups across Queensland, from the Gold Coast, from far north Queensland, from a whole different range of sectors, from resources to tourism, to seafood, to international education. And what they told me very clearly is that they need assistance and support, and they need it now. And they want the state and the commonwealth to work together. So, that’s why I wrote to the prime minister, in the spirit of cooperation, to say, ‘Let’s treat this huge impact on our economy just as we would a natural disaster, like a cyclone or a bushfire.’ We need that help and we need to work together, and we need to contribute, I believe, equal share, like we do with natural disasters. Queensland is moving forward, putting together its economic recovery group which is activated after natural disasters. The motion will fail. Tony Smith also warns Labor that the motions are “becoming far too long” given that Mark Butler’s motion is two pages and took three minutes to read. Butler takes it on board. Leave is not granted. Butler moves forward again, with pretty much the same motion which will also fail – but Labor takes these as a win, because it puts its allegations on the Hansard record. Here is the motion: That the House: (1) Notes: (a) New South Wales Police detectives formed Strike Force Garrad in November 2019 to investigate the creation of a fraudulent document that was disseminated by the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction as part of a political attack on the Lord Mayor of Sydney; (b) New South Wales Police concluded “the document had to have been doctored from Canberra”; (c) the criminal investigation by New South Wales Police, encompassing the use of the fraudulent document by the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, was referred to the Australian Federal Police in December 2019; (d) the Australian Federal Police has not concluded its assessment of the state referral; (e) the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction has not provided a full statement to the House about the role the Minister and his office played in the creation and dissemination of a fraudulent document which gave rise to long-running, and not-yet-concluded, criminal investigations in two jurisdictions; (f) the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction has not advised if he and/or his office has assisted the criminal investigations related to his conduct by providing statements, documents and access to data; (g) the Prime Minister has failed to uphold his ministerial standards by failing to sack the Minister for Emissions Reduction for repeated breaches of those standards, including bringing the government and this House into disrepute by creating and/or disseminating a fraudulent document; (h) the Prime Minister has failed to explain why the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction holds a place in his Cabinet when the former Minister for Agriculture, Senator McKenzie, was forced to resign her place; and (2) Requires: (a) the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction to attend the House at any time before 1pm today and, for a time not exceeding 10 minutes, (i) provide a full statement to the House about his role in the creation and dissemination of a fraudulent document that targeted the Lord Mayor of Sydney (ii) advise how he has assisted New South Wales and Federal police in the conduct of their inquiries and (iii) apologise to the House for his conduct; and (b) the Prime Minister to attend the House at any time before 1.30pm today and, for a time not exceeding 10 minutes, explain to the House why the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction is fit to serve as a Minister in his government but Senator McKenzie is not. Labor has started the day’s proceedings with an attempt to suspend standing orders over Angus Taylor. Mark Butler is leading this charge. The parliament bells are ringing. Sigh. Back on the economy for the moment, because this story in the Australian about cabinet ministers getting upset that the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, isn’t doing their job for them is amazing. From the report: The Morrison government is increasingly frustrated with Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe’s calls for it to spend more to lift the nation’s flagging productivity, after a confidential cabinet briefing from the RBA boss on Monday left ministers exasperated by an absence of detailed policy ideas. Dr Lowe in a speech on Wednesday again exhorted the Coalition to do more to foster business spending as he highlighted a “troubling decline in productivity growth”, despite “fantastic” economic fundamentals. “While the reasons for this are complex, it is hard to escape the conclusion that higher levels of investment spending would promote productivity growth and our collective living standards,” he said. The Australian understands Dr Lowe relayed those calls in a rare confidential cabinet briefing on Monday, leaving senior cabinet members frustrated by a lack of detail from the governor on specific measures and projects he wanted the government to pursue. Pro tip – coming up with government policy is YOUR job, guys. It is literally in the job description. Come up with policies and measures to keep the place ticking over is pretty much the only reason we have a government, because, as we have seen, the bureaucrats and departments are pretty good at keeping the machinery of government ticking over without you. But if only there were reports, and predictions, and information to help you … oh wait THERE IS. Binders and binders and binders of it. Going back years. It’s your job to take that information and do something with it. While we’re on Peter Dutton, hopefully he will be pressed in question time over his deliberate muddling of information on the ABC yesterday when he was asked about climate change: Obviously, as we’ve all pointed out, we’re experiencing hotter weather, longer summers, but did the bushfires start in some of these regions because of climate change? No. It started because somebody lit a match. There are 250 people as I understand it or more that have been charged with arson. That’s not climate change. Pulled up by Patricia Karvelas that the most common start to the fires was lightning strikes, not arson, Dutton says: Nobody’s disputing that. There’s been lightning strikes for as long as there have been bushfires in this country. I’m happy to accept the involvement of climate change but your point was about the views in our party room. No one is saying that climate change *started* the fires. Just that it is making the seasons worse. And in case it has to be debunked AGAIN, here is what police said in January about the numbers of arson charges. Not sure where the 250 figure came from, but the 183 legal actions police had issued from the start of the fire season, were mostly for things like ignoring the total fire ban, or throwing out lit cigarette butts. And you would hope a former police officer, and the man in charge of our border security, would be across the detail. From the police last month: Victoria police say there is no evidence any of the devastating bushfires in the state were caused by arson, contrary to the spread of global disinformation exaggerating arsonist arrestsduring the current crisis. A misleading figure suggesting 183 arsonists have been arrested “since the start of the bushfire season” spread across the globe on Wednesday, after initial reports in News Corp were picked up by Donald Trump Jr, US far-right websites and popular alt-right personalities. The figure included statistics from some states covering the entirety of 2019, rather than just the current bushfire season, which began in September. Late on Wednesday Peter Dutton accused the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, of using the coronavirus for political point scoring (that’s a common theme from the government, which also accused the federal opposition of using the bushfires for political point scoring). Dutton accused Palaszczuk of taking information from a confidential health briefing and using it for political gain: It’s important to point out that premier Palaszczuk, having heard the recommendation from the expert medical committee, where her chief medical officer in Queensland was part of the discussion, knew that recommendation was coming to the PM and went out there gratuitously, calling for us to stop incoming flights from China, knowing frankly that was probably the decision we were going to make. So we need to move quickly, particularly when there’s been that sort of breach, pretty egregious breach of the committee’s work and premier Palaszczuk still hasn’t apologised for that. Palaszczuk was asked about Dutton’s comments on ABC Breakfast this morning: That’s absolutely rubbish. That is absolutely rubbish. I stand up for what I believe is right. I won’t be silenced by the federal government. And what I say to you and your listeners is this is a public health emergency. And my focus has been on the containment and to make sure the virus is contained and does not spread. These are big issues. And I just believed at the time that the federal government was acting too slow. So, we’ve taken measures. Other states have taken measures. But it’s a national issue, it’s a national health emergency, and my clear message is we all need to work together. The Queensland election is in October, in case anyone was wondering. It seems Bridget McKenzie made another statement to the Senate late last night about some other memberships she had neglected to declare. Here is her statement in full (minus the sound of her phone making cricket noises): As it’s been widely reported I resigned from my ministry on Sunday February the 2nd due to breaches of the prime minister’s statement of ministerial standards. I’ve publicly apologised for this and today I wish to further apologise to the Senate, so it’s lovely we actually had a vote so that we could all be here. I do not believe the gifted membership of the Australian Clay Target Association or my paid membership to Field and Game Australia contributed any real or apparent conflict of interest. However, I acknowledge my mistake in failing to declare these as required in the statement of ministerial standards in a timely way. I’ve also updated my Senate statement of interests, which states that senators much declare being an office holder or where they’ve contributed more than $300 to an organisation. I am a member, a proud member, of Field and Game Australia, Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, Australian Deer Association, and the Country Women’s Association. I’m not an office holder of any of these organisations, nor have I provided them with any donations, which is a declarable requirement under the Senate’s statement of interests. I’m no longer a member of the Australian Clay Target Association and therefore Wangaratta Clay Target Club, which commenced on the 29th of January 2019 and ceased on December 30 2019. Having reviewed all my memberships in the recent weeks, I’ve become aware that I was a member of the Victorian Farmers Federation Ag-Force Country Connection, the Melbourne Cricket Club and Yarrawonga-Mulwala, a fabulous golf club, during 2019. All of these memberships have since ceased. None of my memberships have caused real or apparent conflicts of interest to my role, either as minister or as senator for Victoria. However, I’ve chosen to fully disclose all my memberships to the Senate on this day to ensure complete transparency both to the Senate and the broader Australian community. I’ve been a senator for nine years and have the deepest respect for this chamber of parliament, which is so important to our democracy. I regret any confusion caused concerning my declaration of interests, and I apologise to each and every one of my fellow senators, for my transgression with regard to the register of interest. Thank you. In case you missed it, Sarah Martin had this story late yesterday: The new Liberal MP Katie Allen has canvassed the need for the government to appoint a dedicated climate change minister as the Coalition splits on how best to “evolve” its policy response. Allen, who was elected for the seat of Higgins in May, is one of a number of Liberal MPs who have been arguing internally for the government to increase its ambition on climate change against resistance from conservatives in the Coalition. Allen’s suggestion for a climate change portfolio was made in a group chat of MPs in a discussion about how the government’s policies could be better communicated, sources have confirmed. She did not advocate in the group that the government needed to do more, but suggested there was frustration that voters were not hearing the government’s message. She argued that the “significant investment” being made by the government did not appear to be acknowledged in the community. Allen proposed that her fellow Victorian MP Tim Wilson would be a good advocate to communicate the government’s policies. That comes on top of John Alexander publicly pushing for the government to do more on climate policy. But there are still some very loud voices who are pushing for more coal-fired power stations. And climate action now! apparently means more dams and hazard reduction burns, and no actual climate action, so don’t hold your breath. This is also something which will come up today: I’ve often mistakenly donated $165,000. It’s a real problem and my 2020 new year’s resolution was to stop doing it. Chris Knaus has a story on someone else who apparently had that problem: The Liberal party is refusing to say why it scrubbed records of a $165,000 donation from a company run by Scott Briggs, a key Scott Morrison ally who is currently vying to win the government’s $1bn visa privatisation contract. On Monday, the Liberal party declared it had received $165,000 from a company named Southern Strategy, a largely inactive political consultancy business Briggs started four years ago. Briggs is a close friend and confidant of Morrison, a former New South Wales Liberal party deputy state director, a former colleague of immigration minister David Coleman, and a director of the Cronulla Sharks, where the prime minister is the number one ticket holder. He is also leading a bid to win a highly lucrative but controversial contract to privatise Australia’s visa processing system on behalf of a consortium named Australian Visa Processing Pty Ltd … When the Guardian queried the $165,000 donation, Briggs said Southern Strategy had never made it and that the Liberal party had made a mistake. The Liberal party also said the disclosure was a mistake. You’ll find the whole story, here. The Australian has an interesting story on a NSW Liberal branch president acting in –well, read it for yourself. A NSW Liberal Party branch president is under investigation and faces sanctions after launching a controversial website that ridicules his own side of politics, accuses senior figures of heresy, and mocks the sexual orientations of former cabinet ministers. The website, launched by Sean Burke, the NSW Liberal Party’s Freshwater branch president, bills itself as “unapologetically biased” in its coverage of centre-left politics and nerve-point issues that have occupied the NSW and federal parliaments. Party officials told The Australian on Wednesday that while some of Mr Burke’s content appeared benign, some content appeared to cross the lines of basic decency, and in other cases seemed deliberately malicious. You can read the whole story, here. Josh Frydenberg has started the day on a somewhat sombre note, admitting that the impact of the coronavirus on the economy will be “significant”, with the Treasury saying it’s too early to say what the outcome will be. The treasurer told Sky News: It will have a significant impact because China is our No 1 trading partner. While the epidemic of Sars back in 2003 had an impact on our economy and provides us with a bit of a guide, we’re more integrated economically with China today than we were back then. In fact, the Chinese economy is four times bigger today than it was in 2003, so that means that what happens in China has a larger effect on the global economy too. With the drought, the bushfires and shifting trading economies, things aren’t looking quite as rosy as the budget predictions, and Scott Morrison and Frydenberg have already started talking down the promised surplus. Morrison was on the Sydney radio 2GB early this morning also talking about coronavirus: The nature of its virus and how it spreads across the global economy is a bit of an unknown at the moment. At this stage, it hasn’t demonstrated the same sort of severe outcomes that the previous viruses – Sars and Mers – did but the rates of transmission are much higher. The Reserve Bank governor, Phil Lowe, warned of much the same thing in his address to the National Press Club in Sydney yesterday. As Ben Butler reported: Sectors including tourism and education are likely to suffer billions of dollars worth of damage if the Morrison government keeps travel bans in place for more than six months, while the price of another key export to China, iron ore, has fallen by more than 10% in a month. The RBA expects the ongoing drought to cut 0.25 percentage points from growth this year. So keep an eye on that. We’ll also have the parliament shenanigans, as well as everything else that happens in the hallways and beyond.

Good morning, I’m Tim Walker with today’s essential stories. Committee seeks to shed light on Trump business dealings House Democrats have formally demanded to see Donald Trump’s tax returns, seeking information on the president’s financial and business history that – unlike his White House predecessors – he has long declined to reveal. Richard Neal, the chairman of the House ways and means committee, issued the request to the IRS for six years of tax returns from 2013 to 2018, saying he was “certain” the demand was “within our legitimate legislative, legal, and oversight rights”. Under audit? Trump on Wednesday repeated his longstanding claim that he could not release his returns because he is under audit. The IRS says audits do not prevent people making their tax returns public. Mueller subpoenas. The House judiciary committee has voted to approve subpoenas for Robert Mueller’s full report on Russian election meddling. Christchurch suspect to face 50 murder charges The man accused of killing 50 people in shooting attacks on two mosques in Christchurch last month will face 50 murder charges and 39 charges of attempted murder, police in New Zealand have said. Brenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old Australian, is a suspected white supremacist and targeted Muslim worshippers in the attack, the worst mass shooting by a lone gunman in New Zealand’s history. Gun control. New Zealand MPs have heard submissions on the government’s gun law reform bill, which was introduced in response to the killings and includes a ban on assault rifles. United front. Muslims and Jews face a common threat from white supremacists and must fight it together, say Jonathan Freedland and Mehdi Hasan. Nuclear concerns as Saudi reactor nears completion Officials at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have expressed concern after satellite images emerged showing that Saudi Arabia is just months from completing its first nuclear reactor, without having agreed to IAEA rules, including inspections, which are designed to make sure no fissile materials are diverted to be used for weapons. Robert Kelley, the American former director for IAEA nuclear inspections who identified the site, said it could be operational “within a year”. US permits. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and Trump’s energy secretary, Rick Perry, have resisted calls from Congress to explain why the energy department recently granted seven permits for the transfer of sensitive nuclear information by US businesses to the Saudi government. MPs pass bill to prevent no-deal Brexit – by one vote A bipartisan group of British MPs has passed a bill instructing the prime minister, Theresa May, to seek a Brexit extension from the EU rather than risk the UK crashing out of the bloc without a deal. The bill finally passed the House of Commons by just one vote – 313 to 312 – late on Wednesday night. Meanwhile, May and the opposition leader, Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn, are set to resume talks on Thursday in an attempt to break the Brexit deadlock and agree a proposition that could pass through parliament. Police preparations. Despite the vote against no deal, police forces in the UK are still preparing for the possibility of unrest in the event of a no-deal Brexit, amassing their biggest ever peacetime reserve of 10,000 officers.

Must-reads The long fight against racism in romance novels Writers of colour are finally winning wide recognition in the romance genre, which was segregated on racial lines for decades by publishers and booksellers. But as Lois Beckett discovers, the romance novel industry is still a long way from happily-ever-after. Minorities made to live on ‘asthma alley’ Mott Haven in the South Bronx has some of the worst air pollution levels in the US, thanks in part to a local Fresh Direct warehouse. Its residents, 97% Hispanic or black, use Fresh Direct and the four nearby highways less than most New Yorkers. They’re suffering the effects of “pollution inequity”, as Hazar Kilani reports. Democratic candidates ride the populist wave Populism has been primarily associated with the US right in recent years. But Paul Lewis says populist rhetoric is now commonplace for Democratic presidential candidates, and reflects a wider populist turn for Democratic politics in response to Trump.

She was Jungk’s aunt: an Austrian-born documentary photographer and socialist, domiciled in Britain during and after the second world war, whose work brilliantly recorded the lives of the urban working classes in Vienna, London and the Rhondda valley. Edith also had a tempestuous emotional life that involved an affair with Donald Winnicott, the distinguished paediatrician – who was treating her son for autism. But most importantly, she was a spy for the Soviet Union and introduced Kim Philby to her communist handler, Arnold Deutsch, who recruited him. So she has a real claim to having changed the course of history. She betrayed the country that took her in, though her rationale was always to promote the balance of nuclear power. Jungk talks to a fascinating range of people about Tudor-Hart’s importance both as a photographer and a spy, including her brother, the famous photographer and cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky, and Wolf’s son Peter Suschitzky, also a cinematographer. Her brilliance as a photographer perhaps involved a spy-like skill in ingratiating herself into a certain situation and unobtrusively recording it. The photographer as double-agent? Perhaps photographers like Tudor-Hart have to cultivate a spy-like tradecraft. Critic Duncan Forbes notes that this was partly about using a Rolleiflex camera that had to be held at waist height, away from the face. He says this meant the photographer could converse easily with the subject. Yes, perhaps. But a camera that didn’t have to be held up to the photographer’s face meant the subject was not immediately aware of being photographed. There’s a comparable debate in the film Finding Vivian Maier, about the American social-realist photographer. Historian Nigel West is interviewed about Tudor-Hart’s importance to the Cambridge Apostles generation, and this may be the only context in which a man such as Guy Burgess can be described with that robustly quaint phrase: “predatory homosexual”. Tudor-Hart herself remains an enigma at the end of this absorbing film."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/13/mps-to-pressure-government-on-backing-for-swansea-tidal-lagoon-project","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T12:35:06Z","webTitle":"MPs to pressure government on backing for Swansea tidal lagoon project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/13/mps-to-pressure-government-on-backing-for-swansea-tidal-lagoon-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/13/mps-to-pressure-government-on-backing-for-swansea-tidal-lagoon-project","fields":{"headline":"MPs to pressure government on backing for Swansea tidal lagoon project","bodyText":"MPs are to press ministers on why they have left investors hanging in limbo over taxpayer support for a pioneering £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea. The business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee and Welsh affairs committee will call on government to explain why no decision has been forthcoming on the flagship scheme. The government has still not indicated whether it is minded to support the lagoon, 15 months since an independent review told ministers to back the clean energy project. Tidal Lagoon Power, a Gloucester-based company, has been pushing for years to build the first of five lagoons at Swansea, to harness power from the ebb and flow of the tides. But the company needs an indication the government is prepared to negotiate a guaranteed price of power for the renewable energy it produces, akin to the ones awarded to windfarm and nuclear power station developers. The BEIS and Welsh affairs committees will now hold an evidence session on the government’s decision-making process, most likely in May, the Guardian understands. The energy minister, Claire Perry, would be the obvious government representative to be quizzed by the MPs on the indecision, which Tidal Lagoon Power recently warned could lead it to significantly reduce its workforce. Rachel Reeves, Labour MP and chair of the BEIS committee, has previously urged minister to give investors clarity on the lagoon. “If they don’t think it can make a contribution, then they should be honest about that and explain what other measures they will take to reduce our carbon emissions,” she has said. Greg Clark, business secretary, told parliament in March that he did not “want to close the door” on the project yet. But he also said that the proposal had initially required a subsidy price twice as expensive as the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. Privately, in letters to the Welsh government, which has offered to help on financing the lagoon, Clark said the technology was untried, with high capital costs and significant uncertainties. The Welsh government said talks with Whitehall had been constructive but “need to get into far more detail” to reach a swift conclusion. A spokesperson for BEIS said: “Any decision on the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon project will have to represent value for money for the UK taxpayer as well as the consumer.” Tidal Lagoon Power declined to comment. While the Swansea lagoon is currently stalled, another UK tidal power project took an important step forward this week. Scotland-based Atlantis announced the first of its tidal power array in the Pentland Firth, a strait in northern Scotland, had entered the start of its 25-year operations phase. The MeyGen scheme is the world’s largest tidal stream array but at 6MW of capacity is much smaller than the planned 320MW Swansea lagoon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/05/stop-blaming-both-sides-for-americas-climate-failures","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-05T11:00:13Z","webTitle":"Stop blaming ‘both sides’ for America’s climate failures | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/05/stop-blaming-both-sides-for-americas-climate-failures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/05/stop-blaming-both-sides-for-americas-climate-failures","fields":{"headline":"Stop blaming ‘both sides’ for America’s climate failures","bodyText":"Steven Pinker is a cognitive psychologist, linguist, and author of Bill Gates’ two favorite books. However, his latest – Enlightenment Now – has some serious shortcomings centering on Pinker’s misperceptions about climate change polarization. Pinker falls into the trap of ‘Both Siderism,’ acknowledging the Republican Party’s science denial, but also wrongly blaming liberals for the policy stalemate, telling Ezra Klein: there is implacable opposition to nuclear energy in much of the environmental movement ... There are organizations like Greenpeace and NRDC who are just dead set opposed to nuclear. There are also people on the left like Naomi Klein who are dead set against carbon pricing because it doesn’t punish the polluters enough ... the people that you identify who believe in a) carbon pricing and b) expansion of nuclear power, I suspect they’re a tiny minority of the people concerned with climate … What we need are polling data on how many people really would support carbon pricing and an expansion of nuclear and other low carbon energy sources. Here Pinker has created a strange straw man that bears no resemblance to the real population of American liberals and environmentalists. In fact, the polling data he wonders about already exists. For example, a 2016 survey by Yale and George Mason universities found that 73% of Democrats support a carbon tax or a combination of tax and regulations (a further 17% favored carbon pollution regulations only). In fact, most consider putting a price on carbon pollution the single most crucial step in tackling global warming. Even Naomi Klein has said, “I don’t think a carbon tax is a silver bullet, but I think a progressively designed carbon tax is part of a slate of policies that we need.” While it’s true that a majority of liberals oppose building more nuclear power plants, 38% support the idea. Some environmental groups like Greenpeace do oppose nuclear power, but Pinker’s other example, NRDC merely points out that new nuclear plants are currently uneconomical, and even suggests, “The federal government should continue to fund research into nuclear energy.” There are strong economic reasons to oppose building new nuclear power as an inefficient use of resources when renewables today are cheaper and can be deployed more quickly. That being said, were nuclear power funding included in comprehensive legislation to tackle climate change, most liberals and environmentalists would accept that deal in a heartbeat. Science rejection is predominantly a conservative phenomenon There’s cultural pressure to place the blame on ‘both sides,’ for example by claiming that while conservatives reject science on climate change and evolution, liberals reject it on the safety of GMOs and vaccines. However, research has shown this is simply not the case – Democrats and Republicans are equally likely to distrust GMOs, and conservatives are the group that most opposes vaccines. It’s also important to remember that the Republican Party is the only major political party in the world whose leaders reject the need to tackle climate change. And their president made America the only country to reject the Paris climate agreement. There simply is no equivalent on the political left. In The New York Times, Nicholas Kristof pointed to research led by Yale’s Dan Kahan showing that when presented with data about a politically charged issue like gun control, the mathematical and cognitive abilities of “Democrats and Republicans alike went to pieces,” as Kristof interpreted it. But Kahan’s data showed the problem was much more pronounced among conservatives. In the experiment, numerically-adept Democrats were about 33% more likely to misinterpret (made-up) data when it suggested that gun control increases crime, but numerically-adept Republicans were 70% more likely to misinterpret the same data when it suggested that gun control decreases crime. Democrats who are weak at math weren’t biased at all, whereas Republicans who are bad at math were 50% more likely to get the answer right when it confirmed their ideological biases. The difference between conservatives and liberals in both cases was stark. Surveys have shown that increased general science knowledge makes Democrats more likely to accept human-caused global warming – the same is not true for Republicans. Thus, it’s certainly true that ideology is preventing conservatives from accepting certain scientific realities. The problem is in the temptation to assume ‘both sides’ are equally guilty of letting ideological bias cloud their judgment. As Kahan’s research showed, some liberals are certainly guilty of this sort of bias, but it’s a far bigger problem among conservatives. Blame the Fox Newsification of America So how did America get here? Political polarization has been on the rise in America on both sides of the political spectrum for the past four decades. But a rating of ideology-based voting in Congress created by Kenneth Poole and Howard Rosenthal found that while Democrats are gradually becoming more liberal, Republicans in Congress have become radically more conservative since 1980. In 1987, the FCC under Reagan repealed the Fairness Doctrine, which required television and radio stations to be equitable and balanced. The Rush Limbaugh Show then launched in 1988, and so came the rise of right-wing radio. Fox News launched in 1996, providing conservatives a source of politically-biased news coverage. Combined with conservative news websites like Breitbart, Drudge, and Infowars, the right-wing echo chamber can envelop anyone who seeks only news spun to confirm their ideological biases. In a 2012 survey, participants who only watched Fox News were less likely to correctly answer questions about domestic or international events than viewers of any other news source (NPR, Sunday political shows, The Daily Show, talk radio, MSNBC, or CNN), or even people with no news exposure. And on the subject of climate change, the vast majority of Fox News coverage has been factually inaccurate. Unsurprisingly, public trust in science over the past 40 years has only fallen among one group – conservatives. That aligns with research showing that watching Fox News or listening to Rush Limbaugh decreases viewer trust in scientists. Focus on fixing the broken GOP America’s climate inaction simply cannot be blamed on ‘both sides.’ Democrats have proposed cap and trade legislation – a concept invented by Republicans – to address the issue. House Democrats even passed the legislation before a lack of Republican support doomed it in the Senate. More recently, Democrats have proposed revenue-neutral climate legislation in order to appeal to small-government, free market conservatives. President Obama took America’s first comprehensive steps to tackle climate change by joining the Paris climate accords and implementing the Clean Power Plan – his Republican successor revoked both. Quite simply, the Republican Party is the problem. Some within the party are slowly making progress in fixing it, for example in the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus. But breaking through America’s climate policy gridlock may require bursting the right-wing media bubble."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jul/30/hinkley-point-c-if-not-nuclear-then-what-renewables-ccs","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-30T18:47:40Z","webTitle":"Britain’s energy dilemma: if not nuclear power, then what?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/hinkley-point-c-if-not-nuclear-then-what-renewables-ccs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/hinkley-point-c-if-not-nuclear-then-what-renewables-ccs","fields":{"headline":"Britain’s energy dilemma: if not nuclear power, then what?","bodyText":"Britain faces a problem in coping with its complex energy demands. It needs to provide extra energy to meet rising demands for power in coming decades but at a reasonable cost – while also reducing carbon emissions by considerable levels in order to meet its climate change commitments. This is not an easy combination to achieve. However, Hinkley Point was considered by many experts to be a crucial aid in reaching these goals. With its massive 3.2bn watt capacity, Hinkley Point C would provide 7% of the nation’s electricity when completed. Night and day, it would help to generate the power that would keep the nation working while renewable energy sources, mainly wind plants, would provide the rest of the electricity needed by homes and offices. “You have to have some baseload source to provide power when it is utterly calm and renewables are not providing energy,” explains Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute. “Gas and coal plants – which can also supply that baseload – will no longer be viable in future because of their carbon emissions, which cause global warming. You are then left with nuclear.” This dilemma reveals a major drawback that affects renewable energy. Wind and solar plants are intermittent power suppliers. They often provide power when it is not needed but fail to supply it when it is required. And until a method of storing energy on an industrial scale is developed, this drawback will continue to bedevil its deployment across the country. Research into ways to store energy on a large scale is now being pursued across the globe but may take decades. Similarly, other game-changing energy projects are being worked on. One of the most important of these is fusion power. This aims to recreate the process that provides the Sun with its energy. Nuclei of hydrogen atoms are fused together at colossal temperatures inside huge reactors to create helium nuclei – and a great deal of excess energy, but little pollution or radioactive contamination. However, current devices – in particular the international Iter fusion reactor being built in France with British involvement – are currently years behind schedule and vastly over budget. Few experts believe fusion will get us out of our current energy problem. Alternatively, we could continue to use fossil fuel plants but take their carbon dioxide emissions, liquefy them and then pump into the ground, a procedure known as carbon capture and storage. Britain has huge, empty North Sea oil fields which many geologists and energy experts believe would be ideal for storing liquefied carbon dioxide. Several test projects were set up in recent years, with the government pledging to provide funding of up to £1bn until, in November last year, it abruptly cancelled the programme, halting work on all major British CCS projects. As Luke Warren, chief executive of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, said at the time: “This is devastating. This technology is critical for the UK’s economic, industrial and climate policies.” These may prove to be prophetic words."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/dec/21/hinkley-point-c-dreadful-deal-behind-worlds-most-expensive-power-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-21T06:00:53Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point: the ‘dreadful deal’ behind the world’s most expensive power plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/21/hinkley-point-c-dreadful-deal-behind-worlds-most-expensive-power-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/dec/21/hinkley-point-c-dreadful-deal-behind-worlds-most-expensive-power-plant","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point: the ‘dreadful deal’ behind the world’s most expensive power plant","bodyText":"Hinkley Point, on the Somerset coast, is the biggest building site in Europe. Here, on 430 acres of muddy fields scattered with towering cranes and bright yellow diggers, the first new nuclear power station in the UK since 1995 is slowly taking shape. When it is finally completed, Hinkley Point C will be the most expensive power station in the world. But to reach that stage, it will need to overcome an extraordinary tangle of financial, political and technical difficulties. The project was first proposed almost four decades ago, and its progress has been glacial, having faced relentless opposition from politicians, academics and economists every step of the way. Some critics of the project have questioned whether Hinkley Point C’s nuclear reactor will even work. It is a new and controversial design, which has been dogged by construction problems and has yet to start functioning anywhere in the world. Some experts believe it could actually prove impossible to build. “It’s three times over cost and three times over time where it’s been built in Finland and France,” says Paul Dorfman, from the UCL Energy Institute. “This is a failed and failing reactor.” Others have pointed to the cost. At present, the estimated total bill for Hinkley Point C is £20.3bn, more than twice the London Olympics. To pay for it, the British government has entered into a complex financial agreement with Électricité de France (EDF), the energy giant that is 83% owned by the French government, and China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN), a state-run Chinese energy company. Under this contract, British electricity consumers will pay billions over a 35-year period. According to Gérard Magnin, a former EDF director, the French company sees Hinkley as “a way to make the British fund the renaissance of nuclear in France”. He added: “We cannot be sure that in 2060 or 2065, British pensioners, who are currently at school, will not still be paying for the advancement of the nuclear industry in France.” Many British observers agree that the deal is ludicrously favourable to EDF – “a dreadful deal, laughable” says Prof Steve Thomas, who works on energy policy at the University of Greenwich. But even insiders at EDF aren’t entirely happy with it. In the months before the EDF board finally signed off the deal in autumn 2016, the finance director resigned, along with Magnin. “The Hinkley Point project remains very risky,” Magnin told me. He is particularly concerned about EDF’s ability to complete the project before the current deadline of 2025. “Why have we reached this point?” asked Magnin. “It is the construction of a house of cards.” Not everyone has lost faith in the project. When John Hutton was business secretary in 2008, he announced that the government would encourage the “safe and affordable” development of nuclear reactors. Back then, he insisted the plants would be completed “well before 2020”, and wouldn’t receive a penny in subsidies from the British government. Today, despite those earlier promises having been broken, Hutton still lobbies for nuclear: “We’re not just creating power stations,” he told me. “We are making history.” But the irony of Hinkley Point C is that by the time it eventually starts working, it may have become obsolete. Nuclear power is facing existential problems around the world, as the cost of renewable energies fall and their popularity grows. “The maths doesn’t work,” says Tom Burke, former environmental policy adviser to BP and visiting professor at both Imperial and University Colleges. “Nuclear simply doesn’t make sense any more.” The story of Hinkley Point C is that of a chain of decisions, taken by dozens of people over almost four decades, which might have made sense in isolation, but today result in an almost unfathomable scramble of policies and ambitions. Promises have been made and broken, policies have been adopted then dropped then adopted again. The one thing that has been consistent is the projected cost, which has rocketed ever upwards. But if so many people have come to believe that Hinkley Point C is fundamentally flawed, the question remains: how did we get to this point, where billions of pounds have been sunk into a project that seems less and less appealing with every year that passes? * * * After winning the 1987 election, Margaret Thatcher’s government launched plans to privatise the entire electricity market. But in the months following this announcement, it became clear that selling off Britain’s three dozen nuclear units was going to pose a problem. A former civil servant closely involved with the privatisation remembered the shock of discovering the sheer scale of the risks and costs associated with the creaking first generation of nuclear plants. Whereas government policy papers could massage figures and make optimistic projections, the prospectus, which provided financial information for potential investors, could not bend the truth. “A government paper was one thing,” said the former civil servant, “but if the figures were misleading in the prospectus, it was a criminal offence. That was not at all like a government paper, to be honest. It was quite a moment for us all.” By 1989, it was clear that Britain’s nuclear sector would not be privatised – companies had little desire to take on the immense financial and practical risks. “The decommissioning costs are unbelievable,” the former energy secretary Chris Huhne told me. “In the 50s and 60s, they built them as if they were the pharaohs building the pyramids. It was: ‘We’re never going to have to take them apart.’” In 1990, as the privatisation of the electricity market went ahead, Britain’s nuclear power stations moved into a state-owned company. By then, the government was already deep into the construction of Sizewell B nuclear power station, on the Suffolk coastline. Hinkley Point C was next on the list. Six years later, the older generation of nuclear power stations were transferred into another state-owned company, while a new private company called British Energy stepped forward to take over the eight most modern nuclear power plants in the UK. As British Energy took over its ready-built assets, it announced it would let the planning consent for Hinkley Point C lapse. Taking over existing nuclear power stations made financial sense; taking on the eyewatering costs of building new ones did not. The current nuclear power stations would run until the end of their projected lifespans, and then something else would have to close the gap. But soon after its privatisation in 1996, British Energy began to run into financial problems. By 2002, the new private company was in chaos, ultimately needing a £3bn bailout from the government. If the notion of “too big to fail” was to become a feature of Britain’s banking industry, it was already baked into its nuclear business. * * * During Tony Blair’s second term as prime minister, the Cabinet Office was tasked with reviewing the UK energy industry. When it delivered its report in February 2002, the message was clear: the cost and risk of building new nuclear power plants should be left to the private sector. “It said that although nuclear shouldn’t be ignored, it was at present economically out of the question,” says Gordon MacKerron, professor of science and technology policy at the University of Sussex, who was an adviser on the review. By the end of 2003, all government policy indicated that Hinkley Point C would never be built, and there was no prospect of any other new nuclear power plants. It seemed certain that nuclear had no future in Britain – which is why, when the government performed a volte-face three years later, so many onlookers were astonished. “Without any obvious change in the world, by 2006, the position in government had been completely reversed,” MacKerron told me. “Nuclear power had become extremely beneficial, important and not uneconomic.” One thing that had happened in the intervening years was a PR blitz by the nuclear industry, which had deployed scores of lobbyists, including former politicians such as the former energy minister Brian Wilson, to push the idea of a “nuclear renaissance” in the UK. Between 2003 and 2006, says Andrew Stirling, professor of science and technology policy at Sussex University, “Britain saw the beginnings of a massive pro-nuclear lobbying and PR campaign that continues to this day.” Through the media and advertising campaigns, key messages were hammered home. Renewables were intermittent and unreliable. Overseas gas imports were politically vulnerable. “Green” nuclear was the only plausible way to hit carbon dioxide reduction targets. Keith Parker, who was then chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), told the New Statesman that the 2005 election became a particular focus for swaying opinions. “It gave us a good chance to raise the profile of nuclear power,” he said. In the months leading up to the election, a series of talks was organised at exclusive venues such as the Army &amp; Navy Club on Pall Mall and St Stephen’s Club in Queen Anne’s Gate. Industry leaders and experts came together to explain the benefits of nuclear to politicians and energy journalists. The NIA (which is now chaired by John Hutton) took on the role of managing the influential all-party parliamentary group – an informal grouping of politicians – on nuclear energy. In July 2006, the government U-turn arrived in the form of a new policy paper, The Energy Challenge, which declared that new nuclear power stations would be necessary to help Britain reduce its carbon emissions and to ensure an uninterrupted, affordable supply of energy well into the future. Greenpeace launched a legal challenge, claiming that the consultation process behind the government’s recommendation had been totally inadequate. The judge presiding over the case agreed, and in February 2007 ruled that the process had been “misleading”, “very seriously flawed” and “procedurally unfair”. Blair accepted the ruling, but stated that “this won’t affect the policy at all”. Andrew Stirling believes that there was a crucial, largely unspoken, reason for the government’s rediscovered passion for nuclear: without a civil nuclear industry, a nation cannot sustain military nuclear capabilities. In other words, no new nuclear power plants would spell the end of Trident. “The only countries in the world that are currently looking at large-scale civil power newbuild programmes are countries that have nuclear submarines, or have an expressed aim of acquiring them,” Stirling told me. Building nuclear submarines is a ferociously complicated business. It requires the kind of institutional memory and technical expertise that can easily disappear without practice. This, in theory, is where the civil nuclear industry comes in. If new nuclear power plants are being built, then the skills and capacity required by the military will be maintained. “It looks to be the case that the government is knowingly engineering an environment in which electricity consumers cross-subsidise this branch of military security,” Stirling told me. In May 2007, the government published a paper titled “Meeting the energy challenge: a White Paper on energy”, which reaffirmed its enthusiasm for nuclear and declared that there had been “significant changes in the economics of nuclear power”. In contrast to the late 1980s, the government claimed it was now being approached by “some energy companies expressing a strong interest in investing in new nuclear power stations”. When Gordon Brown took over from Blair in June 2007, the shift to nuclear proceeded apace. As it happened, the new prime minister’s brother, Andrew, was then the communications director for EDF, though a spokesman for Gordon Brown told me that at no point while he was prime minister “did he ever discuss energy policy with Andrew Brown”. In January 2008, the announcement came. A new generation of nuclear power stations in the UK was given formal backing by the government. “It was one of the most exciting days in my ministerial life,” says Hutton. “Ministers do lots of important things all the time, but there are probably those moments in your ministerial career when you sit back and think: ‘Actually, this is going to have an intergenerational effect. This is going to affect the country 50, 60, 70 years after I’ve gone.’” The development at the top of the list was Hinkley Point C. * * * Just as it looked like Hinkley Point C would go ahead, the banking crisis erupted. “The crash pretty well changed everything,” Hutton told me. The private companies, such as E.ON and Centrica, which had previously expressed interest in funding the new nuclear power plants, pulled out. If the UK government wanted to go ahead, it would have to pay for the power plants itself. This was a complete departure from its previous insistence that the private sector would shoulder both the development costs and risk. “It was agreed on one basis, and then they moved to another,” says Molly Scott Cato, the Green MEP for the south-west of England. Despite the financial chaos, the government was still determined to make Hinkley work. “There had to be a different route found,” Hutton said. The key piece of the jigsaw was British Energy. The company, which had been pulled back from near-collapse by the government in 2002, owned many of the best sites for building new nuclear power stations. If the government wanted private companies to build nuclear power stations, it would have to sell British Energy to one of the companies. Various purchasers were considered for British Energy in 2008, with EDF the keenest. “At one point, we tried to get Centrica and British Energy to work together,” said a former senior civil servant. “But the department very quickly realised it would be like two drunks leaning together for support. EDF was the best bet.” With no real plan B after the private sector had lost interest in Hinkley Point, the government suddenly found itself in a weak negotiating position. “They perhaps didn’t foresee that only one developer, EDF, was prepared to go ahead,” said MacKerron. “So by definition, they were a bit over a barrel.” In September 2008, British Energy was sold to EDF. After months of long and difficult negotiations between EDF and a team of civil servants representing the UK’s interests in British Energy, and an earlier failed bid, the French company paid £12.5bn to take over eight UK nuclear power plants. It also announced its plan to develop four new power stations. These days, EDF looks like an unlikely white knight. The market value of the company has collapsed, from more than €150bn (£132bn) in 2008 to roughly €30bn (£26bn) today, and the French nuclear industry is facing an existential crisis. Because many of the 58 nuclear reactors in France were built in the 1970s, they are now reaching the end of their lifespan simultaneously. Not only is France’s nuclear industry facing the costs of decommissioning, which were grossly underestimated, but almost no new nuclear power stations are being built. At present, nuclear energy provides about 75% of France’s electricity, so the potential for a disastrous energy shortfall is growing by the day. To make matters worse, EDF’s attempt to build its first new nuclear power station for years has turned into an embarrassment. Flamanville, on France’s northern coast, has been beset by overruns since construction started in 2007. It is currently projected to cost €10.5bn (£9.2bn) – a steal compared to Hinkley, but still three times its original budget. The Flamanville reactor is a new European pressurised reactor (EPR), the same troublesome design that is planned for Hinkley. Magnin, the director who resigned from the board of EDF last year, told me that the company sees Hinkley Point as critical to proving “that nuclear and EDF are still a reality for the 21st century”. He added: “If it works, it could be good business. But there is a risk that it won’t work, and then everyone loses.” * * * The financial deal that EDF struck with the British in October 2013 to fund the project – which, in Magnin’s words, amounts to the British taxpayer funding France’s energy needs – remains one of the most controversial elements of the Hinkley deal. Given its commitment to building Hinkley Point C, the government had no choice but to make EDF an offer that was too good to resist. It offered to guarantee EDF a fixed price for each unit of energy produced at Hinkley for its first 35 years of operation. In 2012, the guaranteed price – known as the “strike price” – was set at £92.50 per megawatt hour (MWh), which would then rise with inflation. (One MWh is roughly equivalent to the electricity used by around 330 homes in one hour.) This means that if the wholesale price of electricity across the country falls below £92.50, EDF will receive an extra payment from the consumer as a “top-up” to fill the gap. This will be added to electricity bills around the country – even if you aren’t receiving electricity from Hinkley Point C, you will still be making a payment to EDF. The current wholesale price is around £40 per MWh. If there had been no inflation since 2012, the consumer would be paying an EDF tax of around £52.50 per MWh produced at Hinkley. However, because it is linked to inflation, the strike price has already risen since 2012. (The price will be reduced by £3 if EDF develops another new reactor in Sizewell in Suffolk, as it is planning to do.) In short, instead of using taxpayers’ money to fund a state subsidy for EDF, the government negotiated a deal whereby the electricity consumer foots the bill. Given that almost every taxpayer in the UK is an electricity consumer, the distinction is largely academic. Furthermore, people in a lower tax bracket often use a similar amount of electricity to higher earners, effectively creating a regressive tax. “The strike price was set when power prices were very high. They signed the contract when there was a bubble,” Juan Rodriguez, an analyst at equity research firm AlphaValue, told me. “It’s a brilliant deal for EDF.” (By contrast, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy maintains that “the government negotiated a competitive deal”. A spokesperson from EDF told me: “The UK Government agrees that Hinkley will provide value for money for consumers and that the overall costs of the electricity system are lower with nuclear as part of the mix than without it.”) The deal looks particularly bad when compared with the current cost of renewable energy. As Hinkley’s pricetag keeps rising, the cost of energy keeps falling. And, as a recent report from the public accounts committee pointed out, although energy costs are falling, this just drives up the top-up payment to EDF. “No one was protecting the interests of energy consumers in doing the deal,” the report noted. * * * In December 2013, the European commission decided that the payments to EDF were so big that they could distort the electricity price across the whole of Europe, and launched an investigation into the deal. The resulting document, published in 2014, can be read as a 33,000-word attempt by the EU to save the UK from its own poor negotiating. The commission raised several issues. First, it stated that the payout to EDF would give the company a huge and unjustifiable advantage over its competitors. The strike price agreement was designed “to entirely eliminate market risks from the commercial activity of electricity generation”. Second, it noted that EDF has been meticulous in passing on as much risk as possible to the British government. The contract included a state guarantee for any debt that EDF required from the financial markets to fund construction of the plant. Separately, if a nuclear catastrophe hits Hinkley, EDF is also protected. “We’re insuring it, so if there is a disaster, it comes back to the public,” says Molly Scott Cato, the MEP. “Nuclear never has and cannot exist in a private market setting.” One of the most serious concerns in the EU’s assessment was over the calculations for the “gap” between the wholesale energy price and the strike price. That gap is currently around £50. Once Hinkley starts operating, the European Commission pointed out, EDF’s market share will be so substantial that it could have the ability to manipulate the wholesale electricity market. Depending on the how the strike price is calculated, there might be an “incentive”, the commission noted, for EDF to “behave strategically” to “influence the reference price”. For instance, if EDF abruptly sold a lot of electricity on to the market at a pre-planned time, the wholesale price could drop substantially. The lower the wholesale price, the bigger the difference from the fixed strike price, and therefore the higher the “EDF tax” paid by consumers. As the commission put it, there remained a question over how a “vertically integrated operator” might “react to such an incentive framework”. EDF will have a duty to its shareholders to maximise its profits. But as the commission makes clear, at the same time, the company will have the capacity to move the wholesale electricity market at certain precise times, in a way that could benefit shareholders substantially. EDF declined to comment on this point. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said that the energy regulator, Ofgem, would be responsible for oversight of the wholesale electricity market. “They have a variety of investigatory and enforcement powers at their disposal for the detection and prevention of price manipulation by market participants,” said a spokesperson. Given the European commission’s concerns, the UK adapted its plans, slightly tilting the agreement with EDF so that the profits generated by the project will be better shared with UK consumers. Nonetheless, serious questions remain about how the strike price was calculated, and there has been a long battle to force the government to publish the documentation used to justify that price. In 2012, as it was preparing to negotiate the strike price with EDF, the government hired the consultancy firm LeighFisher to assess construction costs for Hinkley. The higher the cost estimated by LeighFisher, the higher the strike price for EDF. However, as the National Audit Office pointed out in June 2017, LeighFisher is owned by Jacobs Engineering Group. And at the same time that LeighFisher was assessing Hinkley Point construction costs, Jacobs was working for EDF, with some of its staff seconded to the French company. The National Audit Office points out that Jacobs staff were having “input” into LeighFisher’s cost verification exercise. In short, a division of a company employed by EDF was advising the UK government how much to pay EDF. The Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change first identified the potential conflict of interest in 2012, but it wasn’t until August 2015 that the department sent a letter to LeighFisher asking the company to ensure “organisational separation” on the project. The government also requested monthly updates on the arrangements, but the NAO says it did not receive these. In October 2015, two years after the strike price was agreed, LeighFisher signed the agreement for organisational separation, which included “ethical wall arrangements”. I recently called the number on LeighFisher’s website to try to learn more about how they put this “ethical wall” into practice. “Good morning, Jacobs,” answered the woman on the other end of the line. When I asked to speak to someone at LeighFisher, the woman responded, seemingly in confusion: “We’re not part of them.” When I emailed LeighFisher, someone from the Jacobs press office responded: “LeighFisher has forwarded your enquiry as they do not have a Communications team.” It was unclear how “organisational separation” was being achieved. In an email from a Jacobs account, a spokesperson stressed that “LeighFisher fully disclosed its relationship with affiliated entities in the UK and put in place robust procedures to address confidentiality and to maintain separation between LeighFisher and its affiliates in the UK. LeighFisher managed the work and resources in accordance with agreed protocols throughout.” A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy told the Guardian: “LeighFisher confirmed to the Department that there was no conflict of interest between the teams, and no employees from Jacobs were involved with advisory work for the Department.” In October 2014, the UK government’s amended plan was accepted by the European commission. A spokesman for EDF said: “The European commission carried out a detailed, 10-month investigation into the Hinkley deal and agreed that it was compatible with EU state aid rules. Gain share mechanisms to prevent EDF from making too much profit from Hinkley Point C were strengthened.” Austria is in the process of suing the European commission for signing off the Hinkley deal, saying that state aid should only be supplied in exceptional cases. “Nuclear power is the technology of the past. We should not keep it alive artificially with government subsidies,” Andrä Rupprechter, Austria’s minister of agriculture and forestry, environment and water, told me. * * * When I inquired in the summer, the EDF press office told me it would not be possible to visit Hinkley Point. Fortunately, it turned out that EDF runs free “meet the neighbours” tours of the development for Somerset locals, so I – only slightly surreptitiously – joined a busload of local pensioners on a tour. There had been a storm the night before my visit, and the site was a series of muddy puddles. As the bus made its way around, it became increasingly clear that the development was nowhere near where it was projected to be. “To be honest, it is just a lot of earth at the moment,” said one of the tour guides, staring out of the window. (“EDF was saying we would be cooking our Christmas turkeys on Hinkley electricity this year, and now they are clinging on to the 2025 dates,” says Prof MacKerron. A few days before my visit to Hinkley Point, EDF had admitted it was at least £1.5bn over budget, and that the project could be completed 15 months behind schedule.) Hinkley Point C will be the third nuclear reactor to be built on this site. These days, its oldest brother, Hinkley Point A, which began operating in 1965 and was decommissioned in 2000, is dilapidated, with large holes gaping in its blue walls. Hinkley Point B, which began operating in 1976 and is scheduled to be decommissioned in 2023, stands 300 metres to its right – an anonymous grey hulk, disappearing against the sky, as steam from its huge chimneys floods into the clouds. As the tour proceeded, the guide reeled off statistics about the project. Some 4.2m tonnes of earth will need to be moved around the 430-acre site. The 6.5km perimeter fence is now complete, with around 12,000 trees to screen local villages, including one called Shurton and one called Burton. She pointed out a digger that can fill a 100-tonne dumper truck in three bucket scoops. “One bucket was replaced recently, and that cost £70,000,” she said. Some of the logistical difficulties involved in building Hinkley Point C are so elaborate that they resemble satire. This part of Somerset is home to a flourishing population of at least eight different sorts of bat, including one of the last remaining colonies of barbastelle bats, which are protected by strict wildlife laws. EDF were given permission to cut down the trees that are home to the bats, only on the condition that they would be replaced by movable trees in huge boxes. Every morning, the “bat trees” are dragged out of the way for construction work, and every night they are moved back so the bats can find their specially built house. “I don’t quite understand it,” one EDF employee wearing a hi-vis jacket said. “The bats have a sort of radar.” At least the bats are less hassle than the badgers, she added. The badgers have been moved a field away, but are in denial. They have footage, she said, of a badger climbing a fence to get back to its old sett. * * * After just about stumbling through the European commission’s investigation, there was one more bump in the road for Hinkley. In September 2015, George Osborne – whose father-in-law, David Howell, as energy secretary under Thatcher, had first proposed new nuclear power plants for the UK back in 1979 – held a press conference in Beijing. Standing next to the Chinese vice-premier, Osborne – then chancellor of the exchequer, now the editor of the Evening Standard – announced that China would be investing in Hinkley Point as part of a £2bn deal. The state-owned China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) would own a third of the project. According to one source who worked on the deal, Osborne’s deal was structured as a “first step” in a grand plan for CGN to roll out a string of nuclear plants in the UK. Many commentators were alarmed by the deal Osborne had struck. CGN has established itself as a ruthless player on the world stage. Last year, a senior adviser to the company was accused of trying to obtain sensitive US nuclear technology for China. One Foreign Office source who has worked on US and Asian issues noted that while “America spends all its time trying to keep them [the Chinese] out,” by contrast, “we have literally invited them in. No one really knows what they will do.” (Others are less concerned. “People worry about intellectual property, but what intellectual property do we have?” said one source closely involved in the negotiations with CGN. “I suppose they could have the Sizewell B blueprints, but they’re a bit dusty and no one can remember how to read them.”) Whatever the potential costs, for EDF and the British government, CGN’s involvement may have been essential to the viability of the whole project. The UK was in a bad negotiating position, as it seems likely it could not do without Chinese expertise in building the Hinkley reactor. “There is an argument that this reactor is essentially unbuildable,” said Tom Burke, the energy policy expert. EDF says several reactors of this kind are close to completion in other sites around the world, and that construction at Hinkley is making great progress. If anyone can do it, it is the Chinese, who have established themselves as world leaders in the complex engineering challenges involved in building nuclear power plants. (There were 20 reactors under construction in China at the end of March 2017.) One of the central challenges is pouring the concrete – 3m tonnes in total – needed to build not only the massive foundations but also the vast biological shield around the reactor, which reduces the radiation to levels safe for humans. “You’d think it was straightforward, pouring concrete, but it’s actually quite touchy-feely, and doesn’t always go as you’d like,” said one source with knowledge of the build. “The Chinese are very, very good at pouring concrete.” When Theresa May became prime minister in July last year, one of her first acts was to pause Hinkley. The delay took EDF, whose directors were preparing to sign contracts, by surprise. But it was only a short pause, and just three months later, Hinkley was back on. * * * Several times during the research for this article, when people I spoke to tried to illustrate the impact of Hinkley Point C, they referred to future generations. “This is going to be something that my great-grandchildren might possibly work on,” Hutton told me. “My grandchildren will be paying for this,” Allan Jeffery from Stop Hinkley told me, as we walked around the outer boundary of the site earlier this year. The government estimates that the Hinkley top-up payments will cost consumers around £30bn over the course of the 35-year contract. One of the few figures on a comparable scale is the Brexit divorce bill. The story of Hinkley point contains another echo of – or perhaps a warning for – the Brexit negotiations. With Hinkley, even though the UK’s position got steadily worse, at no point did the government seriously try to force the terms of the deal. It simply couldn’t, because it had backed itself into a corner. The government believed it needed Hinkley, and the civil servants saw themselves as just filling in the detail. “If we had tried to squeeze the terms more, I genuinely think the chances of the deal surviving would have been negligible,” Stephen Lovegrove, the former permanent secretary for the Department for Energy and Climate Change, told MPs in October 2017, as part of a parliamentary inquiry into the financing of Hinkley Point. “This deal is a very good one within the policy constraints of the time,” he said. The stakes of the Hinkley deal were also high for both China and France, and neither country gave an inch. When it came to the crunch, the UK’s negotiators had to take the deal they were offered. “The issue now is that nobody has a good exit strategy,” says Prof Steve Thomas. “I think everyone wants out. But there are penalties to pay now, and there is the humiliation of 10 wasted years.” Despite all of the difficulties associated with nuclear energy, a spokesperson from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy told me that the government still believes nuclear is essential to securing Britain’s energy future and reducing carbon emissions. It is currently trying to edge forward nuclear projects at Wylfa in Anglesey, Moorside in Cumbria and Bradwell in Essex, but each of these would require complex new negotiations. In early December, the energy minister Richard Harrington announced new funding for research into a smaller network of nuclear reactors, branding nuclear power detractors as “naive and simplistic” for believing that wind power could replace the older tech. The detractors, however, are beginning to believe that vast nuclear projects will be defeated by economics alone. “We hope that this will be the last nuclear reactor built in Britain,” Allan Jeffery said, as seagulls screamed far above Hinkley Point C. “Anything else is madness.” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2019/feb/25/concrete-is-tipping-us-into-climate-catastrophe-its-payback-time-cement-tax","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-25T16:40:37Z","webTitle":"Concrete is tipping us into climate catastrophe.

It's payback time","bodyText":"Tucked away in volume three of the technical data for Britain’s £53bn high speed rail project is a table that shows 20m tonnes of concrete will have to be poured to build the requisite 105 miles of track, culverts, bridges and tunnels. It is enough, it has been calculated, to pave over the entire city of Manchester. A more modest 3 million tonnes of concrete will be needed to construct the Hinckley B nuclear power station in Somerset, and the proposed new runway at Heathrow will require one million tonnes. Cement, the key component of concrete and one of the most widely used manmade materials, is now the cornerstone of global construction. It has shaped the modern environment, but its production has a massive footprint that neither the industry nor governments have been willing to address. Because of the heat needed to decompose rock and the natural chemical processes involved in making cement, every tonne made releases one tonne of C02, the main greenhouse warming gas. Including the new Crossrail line through London, the building of Britain’s four largest current construction projects will, if completed, together emit more than 10m tonnes of CO2 – roughly the same amount as a city the size of Birmingham, or what 19 million Malawians emit in a year. Nearly 6% of all UK greenhouse gas emissions, and up to 8% of the world’s, are now sourced from cement production. If it were a country, the cement industry would be the third largest in the world, its emissions behind only China and the US. So great is its carbon footprint that unless it is transformed and made to adopt cleaner practices, the industry could, on its own, jeopardise the whole 2015 Paris agreement which aims to hold worldwide temperatures to a 2C increase. To bring it into line, the UN says its annual emissions need to fall about 16% in the next 10 years, and by far more in the future. While some of the biggest cement companies have reduced the carbon intensity of their products by investing in more fuel-efficient kilns, most improvements gained have been overshadowed by the massive increase in global cement and concrete production. Population increases, the urban explosion in Asia and Africa, the need to build dams, roads and houses, as well as increases in personal wealth have stoked demand. Annual cement production has quadrupled from nearly one billion to over 4 billion tonnes a year in 30 years. In the next decade it is expected to increase a further 500m tonnes a year. Unless there is a dramatic change, cement emissions are expected to continue to rise beyond 2050. Industry leaders are now embarrassed, aware that they are in danger of being financially penalised and tarred as climate laggards who refuse to change in the face of the climate emergency. They well know that not only is it quite possible to build most structures safely without cement, but their own research has shown that green, cement-like products using recycled byproducts which are just as strong can be made from other industries, such as steel slag, fly ash from coal-fired facilities or some types of clay. Instead they trust that nascent technologies like carbon capture and storage which could allow emissions to be buried will come on stream, and that more efficient plant will reduce cement emissions by as much as 20-25%. This is wishful-thinking. The great bulk of the industry is inherently conservative, ignorant of the alternatives to cement and reluctant to adopt change. Conventional, or Portland, cement is trusted to be safe and strong and developers continue to specify it because it is cheap and the alternatives are not well-known. Without major demonstration projects showing what is possible, and the education of architects and planners, progress will be incremental and possibly too late. But technological change will not alone drive cement emissions down fast enough. What is needed to speed up cuts is a global cement, or concrete tax. Only if the whole industry is forced to pay far more for the emissions of its product will companies shift to cleaner practices. A specific cement tax would fit well into the growing clamour for a simple revenue-neutral global carbon tax. These have been proposed and adopted on a limited basis for over 20 years, but the cement industry has strongly lobbied against them in Europe, the US, Canada and elsewhere. Indeed, such is the industry’s influence that governments have not only been shy to adopt anything more than token restrictions, but have been encouraged to promote giant concrete-intensive projects like HS2 and massive road building programmes. In Europe, where an emissions trading scheme has repeatedly stuttered, carbon regulation on cement makers has perversely resulted in windfall profits for the industry and no emission cuts. There are now at least 70 national and regional carbon tax schemes covering possibly 20% of all global emissions. Some, like those imposed in Norway, Sweden and Finland, are straight taxes; others, including California, the EU, China and South Korea, are emission-trading schemes which issue permits for industries to pollute. The consensus is that the carbon in all these schemes is still priced way too low to drive change and to encourage fuel-intensive industries like cement to change practices. At best, the carbon schemes have encouraged cement makers and other big emitters to relocate to avoid charges. Studies suggest that direct taxes not only cut emissions better than “cap and trade” schemes, but also raise more money. A high global cement tax, the theory goes, would concentrate industry’s minds and massively reduce demand for carbon-intensive cement, but any tax that raise energy prices would be very unpopular. The solution, say some economists, is to make a cement or carbon tax “revenue neutral”, with money raised from industry returned to people in the form of tax rebates to offset any rise in energy bills, or used to specifically reduce other emissions. Where similar approaches have been used, as in Switzerland which has a tax on heating fuel, or New Zealand, high carbon taxes have proved both popular and effective. The cement industry has transformed the world and enriched both itself and mankind. But it now threatens to tip the environment into uncontrolled warming. It’s now payback time and the industry must respond urgently to the problem it has helped to create. Guardian Concrete Week investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the modern world.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week: After finishing Dumas’ The Count Of Monte Cristo, orie1227 feels “like I’ve finally reached Everest’s peak”: It’s taken me 12 weeks to complete (my usual reading pace has expectedly crashed after becoming a father in August), but what a journey that book has been. Whilst it’s known primarily as a novel about revenge, it’s so much more than that. Seeing [Edmond Dantès’] internal moral dilemma at the end as he comes to realise what he’s done (and what he’s learnt, about both himself and what it means to live), makes for such a satisfying read. I think this is nicely summed up by a quote in the final page of this huge book: “All human wisdom is contained in these two words: ‘wait’ and ‘hope’” Cheery news from jimitron5000, who is reading Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of Bones of the Dead by Olga Tokarczuk: There are deaths (probably murder), heavy snow, melted snow, William Blake, a car with a name, a lot of moustachioed men, an outdoor dentist that uses booze as an anaesthetic and a main character is delightfully eccentric - calling people by qualities she sees in them rather than their name for example, and a whole lot more. All in all, thoroughly enjoyable thus far. Also looking on the bright side of life is Thomas75164 who is reading Thomas Hardy’s Far From The Madding Crowd: I am enjoying the visit to Hardy country again. Such a wonderfully evocative writer with the constant threat of doom lurking. American Tabloid by James Ellroy has given Tom Mooney a good going over: No one but Ellroy could pull this off. This is a takedown of the Kennedys. Of Jack and Bobby, and Joe too. An expose of the lurid collusion between the mob, the CIA, the FBI, the teamsters and the government. It’s 10 books of plot rammed into 600 frantic, bloody, filthy pages. It’s genius. But now I’m worn out and tired. I feel like I got a shakedown from Pete Bondurant. Until next time, Mr Ellroy. Reading A People’s Tragedy: The Russian Revolution from 1891-1924 by Orlando Figes has been an “effort” for greenmill, but “worth it”: I now feel that I have a reasonable purchase both on the events and the historical context in which they occurred. The book, although not a recent publication, also goes some way to explaining how Russia got to be the way it is in 2018. Highly recommended. The Soviet state has also been occupying rgilyead, who has just finished Serhii Plotsky’s Chernobyl: A serious historian’s view of what lead up to, and what followed from, the nuclear power station catastrophe. What is clear is that the instinctive secrecy of the Soviet state not only contributed to the causes of the disaster but also alienated the people of Ukraine and Belarus who were worst affected. This had a direct bearing on the rise of nationalistic political movements and the break up of the Soviet Union. The book may have a serious subject but the writing style is easy to read and rather compelling. “Another rather splendid work”, The Great American Novel by Philip Roth, has impressed julian6: An exuberant ode to baseball - a pastime with mythic status in the States. As a dabbler in softball - baseball’s gentler handmaiden - I do have quite a close rapport with this. With a joking nod to Moby Dick, Roth presents a gallery of absurd narratives about an impossibly strange and inept baseball team - the Ruppert Mundys. A wild satire and a wild ride, Roth’s liberating transgressive brio is a stunning tonic for our pinch-faced times. Finally, ChronicExpat has a good tip for reading beside the fire this Christmas: A couple of days ago I read Dickens’s The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton. This is actually an excerpt from The Pickwick Papers but is included as a free-standing short story (13 pages) in the Penguin Classics edition of A Christmas Carol and Other Christmas Writings. It struck me that this might be a brilliant thing for reading aloud – lots of opportunities for funny and scary voices, etc. I have no children, nieces, nephews or grandchildren upon which to test this hypothesis but if you do, it might be one to keep in mind for Christmas ghost story reading. Please report back if you do test it! Interesting links about books and reading Atticus Finch goes on trial in The New Yorker. World Literature Today lists 75 notable translations of 2018.

The government “has locked consumers into a risky and expensive project with uncertain strategic and economic benefits”. The 80-page report confirms one’s worst fears about how ministers fell in love with Hinkley. First, they wedded themselves to an inflexible financial model. Then they agreed commercial terms with developer EDF in 2013, when energy prices were sky-high, and ploughed on regardless when the economic case for Hinkley started to crumble. The first error is the easier to understand. Ministers followed a standard model in which the developer bears the construction risks in return for a state guarantee on the price of the electricity eventually produced. But Hinkley, scheduled to provide 7% of the nation’s electricity, was never a normal project. It is bigger than anything ever seen before and the price guarantee – to be funded via consumers’ bills – extends over 35 years. Could the government have saved money for consumers in the long run by shouldering some of the upfront costs? The NAO suggests so: “Alternative approaches could have reduced the total project cost,” it says. The scandalous part is that sums were never done. Thus we are locked into paying £92.50 per megawatt hour, index-linked to 2012 prices, when the market price is half that level. The second failing is worse. When the deal was finally signed by Theresa May’s administration last September, the energy landscape had been transformed. The economic case for Hinkley was “marginal”, says the NAO, and “less favourable, but reasonable, assumptions” about energy prices and renewables would have meant the deal was not value for money even on the business department’s own model. The document tells a depressing tale of inadequate scrutiny and successive governments ignoring the energy revolution taking place beyond their spreadsheets. “Time will tell whether the deal represents value for money,” says the NAO generously, before adding the killer clause: “But we cannot say the department has maximised the chances that it will be.” The rest of us call that a politician’s vanity project. Application of Imagination Soon we will discover if Apple really is engaged in a cunning plan to undermine the stock market value of Imagination Technologies and then buy the UK designer of graphics processors on the cheap. Imagination has put itself up for sale, a decision that has looked inevitable for weeks. Life changed overnight for the Hertfordshire firm when Apple said in April that, in 15 months, it would no longer require Imagination’s clever kit, which is used in smartphones, tablets, iPods, TVs and watches. Apple represents about half of Imagination’s revenues, which is why the share price crashed 60%. The two companies were immediately at legal loggerheads. Imagination wants evidence that its patents won’t be infringed if Apple tries to design its own graphics architecture. The dispute continues unhappily. But waging a long legal war with a giant like Apple would be an impossibly expensive strategy for Imagination, worth £400m. Finding a buyer is the more sober course, especially as it has received approaches from “a number of parties”. Is Apple one? You can’t blame conspiracy theorists for wondering. Apple owns 8% of Imagination and contemplated a bid last year. But one can say this: a bid from Apple in these circumstances would stink. An early statement from California that the speculation is wrong, and that it is not in the running, would be welcome. Passing the executive pay package buck Dennis Millard, the chairman of Halfords, says it is “disappointing” that chief executive Jill McDonald resigned last month to try her hand at selling clothes at Marks &amp; Spencer. Disappointed, in this context, means seriously annoyed. It shows. McDonald has been awarded zero bonus and her long-term incentive and retention awards cancelled. That’s entirely fair: she’s leaving a job half-done at Halfords by quitting 18 months into a three-year plan. But the episode also demonstrates the nonsense of companies’ claims that they need to pay all-singing, all-dancing remuneration packages to “recruit and retain” top executives. The retention bit is meaningless because the new employer just picks up the tab. In McDonald’s case, the bill for M&amp;S could run to £1.6m and may even include sums that Halfords agreed to pay to buy her out of her previous job at McDonald’s. M&amp;S, no doubt, will then add its own incentives on top and whistle the same empty tune about the need to pay for loyalty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2020/jun/17/hsbc-to-push-ahead-with-35000-job-cuts-covid-19-uk-inflation-eases-for-fourth-month-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-17T14:05:20Z","webTitle":"Global stocks extend rally as UK inflation eases - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jun/17/hsbc-to-push-ahead-with-35000-job-cuts-covid-19-uk-inflation-eases-for-fourth-month-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2020/jun/17/hsbc-to-push-ahead-with-35000-job-cuts-covid-19-uk-inflation-eases-for-fourth-month-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Global stocks extend rally as UK inflation eases - as it happened","bodyText":"Global stocks are extending their rally on hopes of a swift recovery from the Covid-19 crisis, but gains are limited by fears over a second wave, after an increase in infections in several US states and in Beijing.

The Opec oil cartel forecast a gradual recovery in global demand for oil in its monthly report today. It estimates demand will drop by 6.4m barrels per day (bpd) in the second half of 2020, less than the 11.9m bpd decline in the first six months of the year when many economies around the world came to a virtual standstill because of Covid-19. UK inflation eased for a fourth month to 0.5% in May, a two-year low, as oil and petrol prices tumbled, along with toys and games, while food prices rose. The US released disappointing data on housing starts and building permits, suggesting the recovery in the housing market is slower than expected. HSBC has revived a plan put on hold three months ago to cut 35,000 jobs worldwide. One of Britain’s biggest mortgage lenders, Nationwide, is to triple the minimum deposit that first-time buyers must put down from Thursday (not immediately, as reported earlier).

We’ll be back tomorrow. Thank you for reading and stay safe! -JK The opening bell has rung on Wall Street, and stocks have opened cautiously higher. Dow Jones up 49 points, or 0.19%, at 26,339 S&amp;P 500 up 8.5 points, or 0.27%, at 3,133 Nasdaq up 45 points, or 0.46%, at 9,940 Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Capital Economics, tweets: The number of new US houses started in May rose 4.3% to 974,000, according to data from the US Commerce Department – less than the £1.1m expected. In April, housing starts fell 26.4% during the Covid-19 lockdown. The number of housing permits granted rose 14.4% to 1.2m in May vs a 21.4% drop in April. The figures suggest the housing market is recovering more slowly from the coronavirus crisis than expected. One of Britain’s biggest mortgage lenders, Nationwide, has tripled the minimum deposit that first-time buyers must put down as it braces itself for falling house prices and the possible return of ‘negative equity,’ writes Patrick Collinson. Nationwide said it will immediately withdraw all its new loan deals where the first-time buyer only puts up a 5% deposit, and set a new minimum deposit of 15%. The rise represents a dramatic increase in the amount that buyers will now have to save to buy the average home. According to Nationwide’s own house price index, the average UK house price is £218,902 – which means that a buyer will now have to stump up a minimum deposit of at least £32,835 compared to £10,945 before. Britain’s longest streak without generating coal-fired electricity came to an end last night after the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire fired up one of its coal power units, writes the Guardian’s energy correspondent Jillian Ambrose. The power plant’s post-maintenance test run scuppered a consecutive coal-free stretch of 67 days, 22 hours and 55 minutes, according to National Grid’s energy system operator division. Britain’s energy system last month recorded its first fortnight without generating electricity from coal since 1882, when one of the world’s first coal plants opened at Holborn in London. The record stretched to almost 68 days amid a boom in solar power due to the brighter than usual start to summer, and comes only two years after Britain’s first coal-free day since the Industrial Revolution. Following the brief spell of coal generation last night the British coal-free streak stood at just over 8 hours by late morning. At the same time Britain used gas-fired power for over two-thirds of the electricity generated domestically, in part due to lower than average wind power output which made up 1% of energy generation. Meanwhile, solar power made up 11% of the electricity generation mix, nuclear power contributed 15%, and biomass made up 8% of GB generation. In the latest coronavirus news, the Russian president Vladimir Putin has had three airport-style disinfectant tunnels built for him at his residence and at the Kremlin; and New Zealand cancelled exemptions from quarantine for compassionate reasons, after two women who had flown in from Britain to see a dying relative tested positive after they had been released on compassionate grounds. Authorities are now trying to trace 320 close contacts of the pair. More on our coronavirus live blog: More job losses: the banknote manufacturer De La Rue plans to raise £100m from investors and cut jobs at its site in north-east England as part of a turnaround plan focused on shifting to plastic notes. The company, hit by a string of recent setbacks including losing a contract to make Britain’s blue post-Brexit passports, said on Wednesday it would end banknote printing operations in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, putting 260 jobs at risk. Gateshead has also been hit by the loss of the passport contract. In the financial markets, stock markets are holding on to their gains, while oil prices are tumbling again. Brent crude is down 1.15% at $40.49 a barrel and US light crude has lost 2.1% to $37.57. US stock futures are pointing to a higher open on Wall Street later today, although traders are not expecting massive gains. They are torn between hopes of a quick economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis, boosted by yesterday’s surge in US retail sales and reports of a $1tn infrastructure spending plan, and fears of a second Covid-19 wave. Six US states including Arizona, Florida and Oklahoma saw sharp increases in new infections yesterday as lockdowns were eased. Beijing closed all schools, cancelled flights and extended movement curbs in the capital after the worst coronavirus resurgence since early February. As reported earlier, Berkeley Group, the housebuilder, said today that the housebuilding and construction industry will need government support, including a simplification of the planning process, if it is to play a leading role in helping the British economy recover from the coronavirus. Here is our full story. Britain’s financial watchdog has fined the London division of Germany’s Commerzbank £37.8m for failing to have proper controls to prevent money laundering between October 2012 and September 2017. The penalty would have been even higher – £54m – had the bank not agreed to resolve the matter at an early stage of the investigation. The Financial Conduct Authority said: Commerzbank London was aware of these weaknesses and failed to take reasonable and effective steps to fix them despite the FCA raising specific concerns about them in 2012, 2015 and 2017. The FCA executive director of enforcement and market oversight, Mark Steward, said: Commerzbank London’s failings over several years created a significant risk that financial and other crime might be undetected. Firms should recognise that AML [anti-money laundering] controls are vitally important to the integrity of the UK financial system. The watchdog found that the bank failed to: carry out timely regular due diligence checks on its clients. address long-standing weakness in its automated tool for monitoring money laundering risk on transactions for clients. For example, in 2015 Commerzbank London identified that 40 high-risk countries and 1,110 high-risk clients were missing from the tool have adequate policies and procedures in place when undertaking due diligence on clients. Germany’s flag carrier Lufthansa has warned that its €9bn bailout deal is in jeopardy. In an effort to garner support from investors, it said it might need to apply for protection from creditors if the state-backed rescue deal fails to win the backing of shareholders on 25 June. The airline issued the statement after the German billionaire Heinz Hermann Thiele – one of Germany’s richest men and Lufthansa’s biggest single shareholder – heavily criticised the rescue package, which will give the German government a 20% stake in Lufthansa and two seats on its supervisory board. In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, Thiele said he had upped his stake to more than 15% and asked that alternative options be explored, suggesting that indirect state participation via the lender KfW could be an alternative to an outright government stake. He declined to say whether he would vote against the bailout package. Lufthansa’s executive board expects low attendance at its emergency meeting next Thursday, of below 50%, which would mean that two thirds of those present would need to vote in favour of the deal. The company said: In view of the latest public statements by the company’s largest single shareholder, Heinz Hermann Thiele, the board considers it possible that the stabilisation package could fail to achieve the two-thirds majority of votes cast that would be required in this case. This would mean that Deutsche Lufthansa AG would possibly have to apply for protective shield proceedings under insolvency law a few days after the annual general meeting if no other solution is found immediately. Lufthansa has also announced 22,000 job cuts as it battles for survival. Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton, said: Following the benign inflation data from the UK, it was the same story in the eurozone but is not something to concern the European Central Bank. There had been signs of some inflation prior to the crisis, but they have disappeared. As with everywhere else, policy measures are potentially inflationary, but that’s a problem for the future, not now. The eurozone consumer price inflation rate for May was 0.1%, down from 0.3% in April, according to Eurostat’s final reading. Similar to the UK, the highest contribution to the inflation rate came from food and alcohol. In several countries, the annual rate is negative, for example -0.9% in Spain, indicating that prices are falling year-on-year. In Germany, the eurozone’s biggest economy, inflation is running at 0.5%. You can view the details here. Scotland’s economic output fell by a record 24% in March and April, the first weeks of the coronavirus lockdown, according to provisional GDP figures released by the Scottish government, reports our Scotland editor Severin Carrell. The interim data, which came with a warning they were subject to high levels of uncertainty, showed output dropped by 5% in March and then by 18.9% in April. This is the first time the Scottish government has produced monthly GDP estimates and suggests warnings that the lockdown has had a severe impact on the economy are correct. Its official data for the first quarter of 2020, covering the period before the lockdown fully took hold, said GDP fell by 2.5%. On Tuesday, UK data showed Scotland had the worst joblessness figures of any UK nation. The labour market survey put its unemployment rate at 4.6%, up 1.3 percentage points on a year ago compared to a 0.1 point rise for the UK as a whole, to 3.9%. Scotland’s employment rate was at 74.3% versus 76.4% for the UK. These data will strengthen demands from businesses to speed up the relaxation of Scotland’s strict lockdown regulations, adding to pressure on Nicola Sturgeon to respond. The country’s substantial tourism and hospitality industries are particularly vulnerable. Andrew Wilson, a lobbyist and pro-independence economist who advises Sturgeon, told BBC Radio Scotland that Scotland’s short term prospects were dire. He said: What’s clear to me is the UK is set to be the worst performing economy in the developed world and Scotland’s probably going to be a bit worse because of the nature of our sectors and how the virus has behaved north and south of the border.” Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish government’s economy secretary, said it was now essential Scotland’s devolved parliament had greater borrowing and financial powers to deal with the crisis, and appealed again for the UK government to extend the Brexit transition period. She said: The coronavirus pandemic is having an extremely serious impact on the economy right across the UK and - as these figures demonstrate - Scotland is no exception. Ever since the start of this crisis the Scottish government has been working tirelessly to keep businesses afloat and ensure as many people as possible keep their jobs, and we will continue to do that.” SSE shares are also trading 9% higher, at £13.84, after the energy giant announced it would spend more than £7bn over the next five years to help power the UK’s green economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, including a major onshore windfarm on Shetland. Here is our full story on Boohoo. Shares in the online fashion retailer jumped more than 9% to 425p this morning, after it reported a 45% surge in quarterly sales and snapped up the online businesses of Oasis and Warehouse for £5.25m. Brexit negotiations between the UK and the European Union will enter a “hot phase” in September, according to a German government document, Reuters reports. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, suggested on Monday that an agreement could be reached in July with “a bit of oomph”. But the German government document, dated 15 June, appears to pour cold water on that idea. It says: From September the negotiations enter a hot phase. Britain is already escalating threats in Brussels, wants to settle as much as possible in the shortest possible time and hopes to achieve last-minute success in the negotiations. Europe’s main stock markets continue to push higher on economic recovery hopes. The mood in markets has also been lifted by clinical trial results yesterday that showed the steroid dexamethasone cut death rates by a third among severely ill Covid-19 patients in hospital. But fears of a second coronavirus wave persist, following an increase in Covid-19 cases in Beijing that has sparked a new travel ban in the Chinese capital, school closures and flight cancellations. Some US states have also seen higher infection rates. UK’s FTSE 100 up 0.75% at 6,289 Germany’s Dax up 0.9% at 12,429 France’s CAC 40 up 1.06% at 5,005 Italy’s FTSE MiB up 0.36% at 19,695 UK consumer price inflation fell to 0.5% in May, a four-year low, as oil prices tumbled. This has reinforced expectations that the Bank of England will respond with further economic stimulus tomorrow, by boosting its bond-buying quantitative easing programme by £100bn to £150bn. Crude oil prices have reversed earlier falls today. Brent crude is now trading almost 1% higher at $41.35 a barrel while US light crude is 0.86% ahead at $38.71. HSBC is pressing ahead with a massive redundancy programme that it put on hold three months ago because of the coronavirus pandemic. This will mean 35,000 job cuts across the bank’s 235,000 workforce. Chief executive Noel Quinn told staff in a memo, first reported by Reuters: “We could not pause the job losses indefinitely - it was always a question of ‘not if, but when’.” He said the measures first announced in February were “even more necessary today”. The continued easing in UK inflation reinforces expectations that the Bank of England will announce fresh economic stimulus at the end of its monthly meeting tomorrow at noon. The City is expecting that the central bank will boost its bond-buying quantitative easing scheme by at least £100bn, possibly £150bn. Here is our fully story: In case you are wondering what Domino’s new contact-free delivery box is -- my colleague Mark Sweney has put in a call to the company. It’s one big box to hold the whole order, rather than lots of smaller items. The Premier League resumes today after a 100-day absence because of the coronavirus pandemic, with Aston Villa v Sheffield United the first match to be played at 6pm BST. The NHS England director of mental health has warned betting companies not to exploit the return of televised football with “reckless” advertising campaigns that could cause more problem gambling while health service resources are stretched responding to the Covid-19 pandemic. The British bookmaker William Hill has raised £224m from institutional investors in a discounted stock sale, sending its shares down 4% to 133p. The company plans to use the funds to expand in the United States. The bookie is starting to reopen its betting shops gradually, as horse racing at Royal Ascot is underway (without spectators and with jockeys wearing face masks) and the Premier League restarts today, also behind closed doors. Virtual racegoers have been showing off their hats on social media as part of #StyledWithThanks, a charity appeal. The energy giant SSE is the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 this morning, with the shares jumping more than 9% to £13.85. It plans to spend more than £7bn over the next five years to help power the UK’s green economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, including a major new onshore wind farm on Shetland, writes our energy correspondent Jillian Ambrose. The company said it gave the greenlight to the £580m Viking onshore wind farm as part of its plan to spend almost £4m every day for the next five years to “spur a green economic recovery”. SSE will also move ahead as a minority partner in the £3bn Seagreen offshore wind farm spear-headed by French oil major Total, which will be the largest in Scotland. Together the projects will generate enough clean electricity to power around 1 million British homes. Alistair Phillips-Davies, SSE’s chief executive, said: “It’s easy to talk about a green recovery, but we’re putting our money where our mouth is with £7bn of low-carbon infrastructure projects that can deliver a win-win for climate and economy.” SSE also toughened its own climate targets by stretching a pledge to reduce the carbon intensity of the electricity it generates by 60% from 2018 levels by 2030, from 50% previously. Domino’s Pizza, Britain’s biggest pizza delivery company, has benefited from rising sales during the pandemic, but this boost has been wiped out by extra costs from implementing safety measures. It has had to re-route despatches to to stop two-person deliveries and invest in contact-free delivery boxes and face masks. Domino’s added: We have also seen a change in consumer purchasing behaviour and average basket composition, with a higher proportion of sides and desserts, which, whilst aiding our sales performance, has impacted our margins. As a result, the firm, a franchise of the US-based Domino’s Pizza, expects its core earnings in the first half to be slightly below last year’s. The company’s shares fell nearly 10% to 306p. New car sales in the EU suffered another sharp drop in May, with registrations down 52.3%, to 581,161 cars from 1.2m a year earlier. This was less steep than the 76.3% fall in April, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. This means car sales are down 41.5% in the first five months of this year. Double-digit declines were recorded in each of the 27 EU countries last month, although the percentage falls were less dramatic than in April. Spain posted the biggest fall among four major EU markets (-72.7%), while sales fell by roughly half in France (-50.3%), Italy (-49.6%) and Germany (-49.5%). European stock markets are rising again, as the rally of recent days continues. UK’s FTSE 100 index up 0.38% at 6,266 Germany’s Dax up 0.2% France’s CAC 40 up 0.2% Spain’s Ibex down 0.2% italy’s FTSE MiB up 0.4% Aside from the worrying spike in new Covid-19 cases in Beijing, which has prompted a new travel ban in the Chinese capital, school closures and flight cancellations, there has been some good news in the pandemic. Trial results for a steroid called dexamethasone released yesterday showed it reduced death rates by around a third among the most severe Covid-19 patients admitted to hospital. The steroid is normally used to reduce inflammation in diseases such as arthritis. UK health secretary Matt Hancock hailed the news this morning, speaking to Sky News. It does increase your chances of survival quite significantly. It is one of the best pieces of news we’ve had through this whole crisis. James Smith, developed markets economist at ING, expects headline UK inflation to stay below 1% this year, and “given the slack in the jobs market, we’d expect price pressures to stay fairly muted for some time”. He explains: The other argument that is often made in favour of inflation returning, is that governments and central banks are pumping vast amounts of cash into the system. But this is unlikely to lead to higher prices, at least in the short/medium-term. In the case of the government, its spending has so far been solely aimed at keeping firms and consumers afloat, rather than trying to stimulate demand (which by definition, is constrained by the ongoing lockdown measures). The bottom line is that inflationary pressures are likely to remain fairly muted for the time being. This, in turn, will keep the pressure on the Bank of England to maintain its current degree of stimulus, and we expect a further £150 billion of QE to be unveiled this week. Rising prices for food and non-alcoholic drinks partially offset the downward pressure from falling oil and petrol prices in May. However, the Office for National Statistics struggled to collect data because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Some 74 items were unavailable to UK consumers in May, down from 90 in April. Back to the UK inflation numbers. Official figures showed the annual growth rate in consumer prices slowed to 0.5% in May as oil prices tumbled, the lowest annual rate since the Brexit vote in June 2016. ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics Jonathan Athow said: The growth in consumer prices again slowed to the lowest annual rate in four years. The cost of games and toys fell back from last month’s rises, while there was a continued drop in prices at the pump in May, following the huge crude price falls seen in recent months. Outside these areas, we are seeing few significant changes to the prices in the shops. The housebuilder Berkeley Group, which focuses on London, Birmingham and the South East, has reported a 35% drop in pretax profits to £503.7m for the year to 30 April. The company called on the government to step in and support housebuilding, similar to the action taken after the global credit crunch of 2008/9. Rob Perrins, the chief executive, says: Housebuilding and construction can play a vital role in the broader economic recovery following Covid-19. This will require government support, similar to that seen following the 2008/09 financial crisis, including: the reversal of the property tax increases seen since 2014; a reduction in the bureaucracy and cost of planning; and direct investment into affordable housing. In other corporate news, the UK fashion retailer Boohoo has seen sales surge by 45% in the quarter to the end of May, as consumers turned to online shopping under the coronavirus, my colleague Mark Sweney writes. The online fashion specialist, which owns brands including Nasty Gal, Pretty Little Thing Coast and Karen Mullen, said that trading had initially been “mixed” as the UK went into lockdown. The company said that sales from the middle of March into early April fell year-on-year, as a result of the initial impact of the pandemic. However, throughout the rest of April and May its performance has been strong. Boohoo also said it was buying the online businesses of Oasis and Warehouse for £5.25m. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. Headline news this morning: HSBC will push ahead with 35,000 job cuts, Reuters reports, after getting hold of a memo. The bank is resuming a massive redundancy programme it had put on ice after the Covid-19 outbreak. The bank will also maintain a freeze on nearly all recruitment from outside, chief executive Noel Quinn said in the memo, which was sent to 235,000 staff worldwide. (Reuters said a spokeswoman confirmed the contents of the memo.) We could not pause the job losses indefinitely – it was always a question of ‘not if, but when’. UK consumer price inflation eased for the fourth month in a row in May and came in at an annual rate of 0.5%, as expected, according to the Office for National Statistics. That’s the lowest inflation rate since June 2016 and compares with April’s reading of 0.8%. Inflation has fallen as the coronavirus pandemic forced the government to impose a nationwide lockdown in late March and caused oil prices to tumble. Economists said this will no doubt add to the debate over whether the Bank of England might at some point be persuaded to take Bank rate below zero. Stock markets are expected to open flat after yesterday’s rally. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei dropped 0.56%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.2% while the Shanghai market has lost 0.18%. Beijing shut all schools again and cancelled flights after a spike in new Covid-19 cases, fuelling fears of a second wave. The UK’s FTSE 100 finished 2.9% higher at 6,242 points yesterday, and on Wall Street the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.89% while the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 2.04%. Stocks were boosted by reports of a draft $1tn infrastructure spending plan from the Trump administration, targeted mainly at roads and bridges, and news of a 17.7% surge in US retail sales in May after the Covid-19 lockdown was eased. The stock market rally came despite another cautious message from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, who warned of a “long road” to recovery that will leave the US economy “well short of” where it was in February for some time. Stocks came off their highs when Powell, in his semi-annual testimony to the Senate, also said that the Fed’s corporate bond-buying programme could be tapered if the market function improves. On Monday, it was announced the Fed would start to buy individual corporate bonds. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, says: Recent data flow has offered hope of a more vigorous economic rebound than we initially thought possible. The Fed remains wary though, with a renewed wave of infections arguing for caution. As such, Powell again emphasised policy will remain ultra-loose with the potential that they could have to do more to ensure the recovery continues. He again tries to provide a reality check to the optimism in risk markets, such as equities, which are seemingly seeing only good things ahead. He warned of the risk of insolvencies, particularly in the small business sector and suggested that “until the public is confident that the disease is contained, a full recovery is unlikely”. Given a vaccine appears some way off and fears over a pick-up in Covid-19 cases in several states, he is clearly sitting on the more cautious side of the fence.

The White House announced on Sunday that it was restricting travel from Brazil to the United States, two days after the South American nation became the world’s No. 2 hotspot for coronavirus cases. In its original announcement, it said the restrictions would come into force on 28 May. UK volunteering soars during coronavirus crisis Ten million UK adults have been volunteering in their community during the coronavirus crisis, and most say they will carry on after the lockdown ends, according to new research. The study also found that Britons have been extending a financial helping hand to local businesses. More than £1bn was spent on services and goods that people knew they would never be able to use during the pandemic, including payments to home cleaners and gardeners. The Irish Times reports that there were no new coronavirus deaths reported on Monday, for the first time since 21 March: The Department of Health reported 59 new confirmed cases of the virus however bringing the total number of known cases of the disease to 24,698. The death toll stands at 1,606. The State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the declining number of new cases and reported deaths over the past week shows ‘we have suppressed Covid-19 as a country.’ [The Taoiseach, Leo] Varadkar tweeted: ‘This is a day of hope. We will prevail.’ Kentucky lockdown protesters condemned for hanging effigy of governor from tree Political leaders in Kentucky have condemned rightwing protesters against the state’s measures to fight the coronavirus, after the demonstrators hanged an effigy of Democratic state governor Andy Beshear from a tree. The incident happened on Sunday during a protest in favor of gun rights and other mostly conservative causes. Several men produced a rope and an effigy and strung it from a tree outside the state capitol building in Frankfort. The state representative Charles Booker, who is African American and the Democratic party challenger for the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell’s seat in Kentucky in November, described the representation as “ vile and traumatic”. “It’s not just the threat on his life, it’s the fact that they demonstrated an act rooted in our history of racism. I’ve had family lynched in Kentucky,” Booker added. There are more than 5.4m cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins university coronavirus tracker, which has counted a total of 5,467,945 confirmed infections. The death toll stands at 344,731. Dominic Cummings, the UK PM’s aide, has said he does not regret breaching lockdown. Dominic Cummings, the chief of staff to Boris Johnson, admitted driving about 250 miles (400km) from his home during the UK’s lockdown, but insisted he acted reasonably. Health authorities in Spain revised downward the country’s death toll from the coronavirus by nearly 2,000, bringing the total number of deaths recorded to 26,834. A new system of gathering data had allowed them to identify cases that were counted twice and exclude deaths wrongly attributed to the virus, said Fernando Simon, the health ministry’s emergencies coordinator. About 15,000 Rohingya refugees are now under coronavirus quarantine in Bangladesh’s vast camps, officials said Monday, as the number of confirmed infections among them rose to 29.Health experts have long warned that the virus could race through the cramped settlements, housing almost a million Muslims who fled violence in Myanmar, and officials had restricted movement to the area in April. The World Health Organization has said it will temporarily drop hydroxychloroquine from its study into coronavirus treatments. Director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the decision was made in light research that showed people taking it were at higher risk of early death.

The moves, designed to kickstart the country’s tourist industry ahead of seasonal hotels reopening on 15 June, following almost three months of enforced closure. Spain will lift its quarantine requirement for people entering the country from 1 July, the government confirmed. At the moment, travellers from overseas are required to undergo a 14-day self-isolation on arrival. On Saturday the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the country would reopen to tourists from July. Italy reported its fewest number of new coronavirus cases since early March. Authorities confirmed the deaths of 92 more people, bringing the total death toll from the pandemic to 32,877. New infections grew by 300, down from 531 on Sunday, with zero new cases registered in five regions. Sweden’s top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, defended his country’s outbreak strategy as the number of people to have died after catching the virus passed 4,000. Critics have accused Swedish authorities of gambling with citizens’ lives by not imposing strict stay-at-home measures. Hi, Helen Sullivan joining you now – I’ll be bringing you the latest developments for the next few hours, and a summary of the most recent developments shortly. As always, it would be great to hear from you: get in touch via Twitter @helenrsullivan or email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. Tips, questions, feedback and fun all welcome. Two of the highest profile fashion houses are planning to cut back on how many collections a year they will launch, the Associated Press reports. Gucci and Saint Laurent will leave the fashion calendar behind, with its relentless four-times-a-year rhythm, which sees the industry shuttle between global capitals for runway shows. The coronavirus lockdown has hit luxury fashion houses on their bottom lines, and has also given pause to rethink the pace of fashion, offering the possibility to return to less hectic, more considered periods of creativity and production — and perhaps consumption. Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele imagines a twice yearly appointments — one in the fall and one in the spring — to present collections. “Two appointments a year are more than enough to give time to form a creative thought, and to give more time to this system,” Michele said in a video conference on Monday Saint Laurent hasn’t articulated its intentions, but said in a statement last month that it would “take control” of the fashion schedule “conscious of the current circumstances and its waves of radical change.” Belgian and Polish politicians are claiming that they are far better placed to deal with any second wave of coronavirus, Reuters reports. After nearly two months of clampdowns, pupils are returning to school and non-food shops or restaurants are re-opening, albeit with warnings that this easing could be stopped or even reversed if coronavirus cases start to spike. “We can rule out that we will have to go back to the tough measures,” Belgian interior minister Pieter De Crem told broadcaster VTM on Sunday. This was echoed by Polish health minister Lukasz Szumowski who told weekly newspaper Sieci that Warsaw was well equipped, after successfully halting the spread of an outbreak in Silesia. “One can’t do a second lockdown ... We have infrastructure, over 120 laboratories perform tests. There are tools to control this monster,” Szumowski said. The crisis that has engulfed the British government over top political aide Dominic Cummings’ conduct continues to rage despite a press conference in he repeatedly refused to resign or apologise for breaking lockdown rules, writes deputy political editor Rowena Mason. After an outpouring of public anger rattled No 10, Cummings attempted to explain why he drove 264 miles from London to his parents’ estate in Durham despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus. No 10 had hoped the move would draw a line under fury about Cummings’ behaviour after at least 20 Tory MPs called for him to quit and senior scientists accused him of undermining public health advice. But his appearance in the Rose Garden of No 10 raised yet more questions after Cummings admitted he had suspected both he and his wife had coronavirus when they made the decision to travel across the country with their son. Read the full story here Reuters reports that New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state, has urged locals to continue working from home despite schools reopening as the number of coronavirus cases slows. The country has reported just over 7,100 infections and 102 deaths, well below figures reported by other developed countries, and with fewer than 20 new cases most days, states are pressing ahead with a three-stage plan to remove most social restrictions imposed by July. In New South Wales, which includes the city of Sydney, children returned to full-time face-to-face learning on Monday, allowing many parents to return to offices – although lawmakers urged those who could to stay home to avoid putting pressure on the transport network. “I am very pleased that the system hasn’t been overwhelmed,” the NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney. “People are listening, making informed decisions, and that is the way we would like it to continue.” British prime minister Boris Johnson has said outdoor markets and car showrooms can reopen from 1 June as long as proper measures are put in place. He says the open nature of such places means they represent a lower risk than indoor places. At his daily briefing, Johnson also said that a further wave of reopening could start on 15 June, adding that indoor shops such as department stores would be allowed to open for business from that date as long as proper measures are put in place. It was also announced by Prof Yvonne Doyle of Public Health England that the current R rate is around 0.7. About 15,000 Rohingya refugees are now under coronavirus quarantine in Bangladesh’s vast camps, officials said Monday, as the number of confirmed infections among them rose to 29. Health experts have long warned that the virus could race through the cramped settlements, housing almost a million Muslims who fled violence in Myanmar, and officials had restricted movement to the area in April. On Monday, Bangladesh recorded a fresh high in coronavirus detections, with 1,975 more people reported as testing positive in the past 24 hours, bringing the cumulative total to 35,585. Of those who have tested positive, so far 7,334 have recovered and 501 have died, with 21 deaths reported in the past 24 hours, according to the country’s epidemiology institute. The first cases in the Rohingya camps were detected in mid-May. “None of the infections are critical,” Toha Bhuiyan, a senior health official in the surrounding Cox’s Bazar area told AFP. “Most hardly show any symptoms. Still we have brought them in isolation centres and quarantined their families.” Mahbubur Rahman, the chief health official of Cox’s Bazar, said authorities hoped this week they would double the number of tests being performed daily from 188. He said further entry restrictions have been imposed on the camp, with a 14-day quarantine in place for anyone visiting from Dhaka. “We are very worried because the Rohingya camps are very densely populated. We suspect community transmission (of the virus) has already begun,” Rahman told AFP. Health authorities in Spain have revised downward the country’s death toll from the coronavirus by nearly 2,000, bringing the total number of deaths recorded to 26,834, AFP reports. A new system of gathering data had allowed them to identify cases that were counted twice and exclude deaths wrongly attributed to the virus, said Fernando Simon, the health ministry’s emergencies coordinator. “A variation of 1,900, that’s a lot,” he added. “We are trying to check that it’s correct, but these are the figures that we have at the moment.” The health ministry, which gathers data from regional health authorities, also revised downwards the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus, from the 235,772 announced on Sunday to 235,400. “We are satisfied with the growing quality of the information that allows us to take decisions,” said Simon. “It is something that happens in every epidemic, when the evolution of the epidemic leaves us with a bit more time, you have to correct the figures and in certain cases you have to reduce them,” he explained. While the new system cut the number of deaths by 1,918, Spain remains one of the countries worst hit by the virus. The UK PM’s aide has said he does not regret breaching lockdown. Dominic Cummings, the chief of staff to Boris Johnson, admitted driving about 250 miles (400km) from his home during the UK’s lockdown, but insisted he acted reasonably. The World Health Organization has said it will temporarily drop hydroxychloroquine from its study into coronavirus treatments.

New infections grew by 300, down from 531 on Sunday, with zero new cases registered in five regions. Sweden’s top epidemiologist Anders Tegnell defended his country’s outbreak strategy as the number of people to have died after catching the virus passed 4,000. Critics have accused Swedish authorities of gambling with citizens’ lives by not imposing strict stay-at-home measures. Global cases passed 5.4m, according to the Johns Hopkins university coronavirus tracker, which has counted a total of 5,449,135 confirmed cases worldwide. The death toll stands at 345,721. The World Health Organization has said it will temporarily drop hydroxychloroquine — the malaria drug Donald Trump said he is taking as a precaution — from its global study into experimental coronavirus treatments after safety concerns. The WHO’s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in light of a paper published last week in the Lancet that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those who were not, it would pause the hydroxychloroquine arm of its solidarity global clinical trial. “The executive group has implemented a temporary pause of the hydroxychloroquine arm within the Solidarity trial while the safety data is reviewed by the data safety monitoring board,” Tedros said on Monday. “The other arms of the trial are continuing,” He said the concern related only to the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for Covid-19, adding that the drugs were accepted treatments for people with malaria and auto-immune diseases. Africa’s prompt and unified mobilisation to contain the coronavirus pandemic is a surprise to “those who have always belittled the continent,” the chair of the African Union commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, has said. In a statement marking Africa Day, the anniversary of the founding of the Organisation for African Unity, the forerunner of the modern AU, Faki paid tribute to member states that, he said, “promptly took appropriate measures, consistent with the continental strategy.” “Right from the onset the pandemic, much to the surprise of those who have always belittled the continent, Africa mobilised itself,” the former prime minister of Chad said. “A continental response strategy was developed and implemented promptly.” More than 14 weeks after the first case of coronavirus was detected in Africa, the continent has registered just over 100,000 cases and about 3,100 deaths – about 1.5% of the world’s cases and 0.1% of deaths. Faki called on Africa to continue to forge its own path, and not expect help from elsewhere as it prepared for a post Covid-19 world. He went on: We should however redouble efforts, determination and perseverance in strictly implementing the pillars of the strategy. We should go beyond the present situation, by preparing for post-pandemic conditions in the world. There is an urgent need for Africa to develop new forms of resilience. In a world in which multilateralism is sorely tested, Africa must stop expecting solutions from others. Africa should no longer be satisfied with this role of never-ending reservoir for some, and dumping ground for others. There is an urgent need for Africa to chart its own course. Its food dependency and insecurity are unacceptable and intolerable, as is the state of its road, port, health and educational infrastructure. Africa’s land, forests, rich fauna, mines, energy potential, and maritime and inland waterways, hold the necessary resources to provide an adequate response to the needs of its peoples. We should, in full lucidity, boldly opt for an innovative approach that is inward-looking rather than outward-looking. Let us live on what we have, using what we have, in other words let us live within our means! Click here to read the full text of his statement. Russia’s government spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has been discharged from hospital, just under a fortnight after he was admitted after testing positive for the coronavirus, Tass news agency reports. “[I] was discharged from hospital. For now, I will be in quarantine,” he was quoted as saying by the agency. “I will gradually start working from home.” Peskov, who as spokesman for the Kremlin is a recognisable figure on the world stage, was admitted to hospital on 12 May. Joe Biden, the Democrat candidate in the forthcoming US presidential election, has made his first in-person public appearance in more than two months to lay a wreath for the country’s war dead. The 77-year-old, who has not made a campaign appearance outside his Delaware home since quarantining himself due to the coronavirus pandemic 10 weeks ago, visited a nearby veteran’s memorial to mark the Memorial Day holiday. “It feels good to be out of my house,” Biden told reporters, his speech slightly muffled by the mask, Reuters reported. Maintaining his distance, he saluted about a dozen veterans and other onlookers standing a few yards away. The southern Africa regional collaborating centre has collated the latest coronavirus figures for the 10 countries in the region. Sweden’s top epidemiologist has defended his country’s coronavirus outbreak strategy, after the number of people dying after catching the virus passed 4,000 on Monday. Critics have accused Swedish authorities of gambling with citizens’ lives by not imposing strict stay-at-home measures. Death rates from the virus have been much higher than in Sweden’s Nordic neighbours, which did introduce coronavirus lockdowns, but still lower than those of countries such as Spain, Italy and the UK. On Monday, Anders Tegnell, the chief epidemiologist of Sweden’s public health agency, stressed countries’ death tolls should be compared with caution and pointed out that not all deaths registered among his country’s Covid-19 statistics would have been as a result of the illness. He told AFP: In Sweden, anybody who has the diagnosis of Covid-19 and dies within 30 days after that is called a Covid-19 case, irrespective of the actual cause of death. And we know that in many other countries there are other ways of counting that are used. Sweden’s board of health and welfare insisted the country’s nursing homes were functioning well in spite of the outbreak. It noted that 11,000 nursing home residents died in January-April this year, compared with 10,000 during the same period a year ago. Tegnell said the overall situation in Sweden was “getting better”, with a declining number of people being admitted to intensive care units, a drop in the number of cases being reported in nursing homes, and fewer deaths in nursing homes. On Sunday the Observer published an interview with Annika Linde, Tegnell’s predecessor, in which she said she now believed the authorities should have put in place tougher restrictions in the early stages of the pandemic. She said: I think that we needed more time for preparedness. If we had shut down very early ... we would have been able, during that time, to make sure that we had what was necessary to protect the vulnerable. There were 92 new coronavirus deaths in Italy on Monday, the lowest daily rate since early March, bringing the death count to 32,877, writes Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian’s Rome correspondent. New infections grew by 300, down from 531 on Sunday, with zero new cases registered in five regions including Bolzano, Umbria, Calabria, Molise and Basilicata, according to figures from the civil protection authority. There are 55,300 people who are currently suffering from the virus in Italy, 541 of whom are in intensive care. Italy has 230,158 confirmed cases to date, including the deaths and 141,981 survivors. The country is planning to ask 60,000 people to volunteer to help enforce social distancing rules amid concerns infections will rise again following scenes of group gatherings over the weekend. Brazil’s embattled leader, Jair Bolsonaro, has come under further pressure after his political idol, Donald Trump, banned flights from the South American country in response to its soaring number of coronavirus infections, writes Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro. The US announced the measure on Sunday as the number of cases in Brazil rose to more than 363,000 and the death toll to nearly 23,000. Only the US now has more confirmed infections than Brazil. Bolsonaro has faced severe criticism for flouting social distancing guidelines and has lost two health ministers in less than a month. The White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the move would “help ensure foreign nationals who have been in Brazil do not become a source of additional infections in our country”. The indefinite ban, which comes into force on Friday, will apply to all non-US citizens who have been in Brazil within the last 14 days. The news is a blow to Brazil’s far-right leader who touts his supposed closeness to Trump as proof he is steering Brazil in the right direction. Bolsonaro’s supporters frequently wave the Star-Spangled Banner at rallies, and the president himself recently donned a “Trump 2020” hat. “The US [message] to Brazil: Stay at Your Own Home,” one newspaper, the Estado de Minas, reported on its front page alongside an image of Bolsonaro supporters holding a US flag. Donald Trump has threatened to move the Republican party’s national convention from Charlotte, North Carolina, if the state is not able to commit to “full attendance” at the gathering despite Covid-19 restrictions, Edward Helmore writes for the Guardian US. In a series of tweets on Monday morning. Trump said the state’s Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, was “still in Shutdown mood &amp; unable to guarantee” that the party would be able to fill the arena with supporters. Trump’s tweets came two days after North Carolina recorded its largest daily increase in positive cases of the coronavirus. Even as fears grow in Italy about people failing to adhere to social distancing guidelines, a survey shows that the country’s people were strongly supportive of their government-imposed lockdown. Findings published on Monday by national statistics bureau Istat showed that 91% of respondents said the restrictions on movement and work were very useful or quite useful, against just 9% who deemed them not very or not at all useful, Reuters reports. The measures were also well understood and observed by a vast majority of respondents, with 89.5% describing the government’s instructions as “clear”. On average Italians washed their hands 12 times a day and used disinfectant gel five times a day, the survey showed, and on most days they did not leave their home for any reason, according to the poll, conducted from 5-21 April at the height of Italy’s epidemic. Earlier, my colleague Angela Giuffrida, who is based in Rome, reported on a video produced and circulated by the government in the Veneto region warning Italians not to drop their guard against coronavirus as they socialise. The video is mostly targeted at young people, who have been criticised for gathering in groups outside bars since they reopened last Monday. Luca Zaia, the president of Veneto, came under attack for posting it, with one Twitter user describing it as “pure terrorism”. Another wrote: “Dear president, this virus is cured (not fought against) in suitable places. Outside, one must live!” Today’s World Health Organization coronavirus briefing is marking Africa day, which is the anniversary of the founding of the Organisation for African Unity, the forerunner of today’s African Union. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, began by remarking on the relatively mild impact of the coronavirus outbreak on African countries. He said: So far, although around half of the countries in the World Health Organization Africa region have community transmission, concentrated mainly in major cities, Africa is the least-affected region globally in terms of the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths reported to WHO. Africa has just 1.5% of the world’s reported cases of Covid-19 and less than 0.1% of the world’s deaths. The World Health Organization’s daily coronavirus briefing is now beginning.

Vladimir Putin made a rare recent appearance in the Kremlin on Monday as Russia prepares to ease restrictions imposed over the coronavirus pandemic, Reuters reports. The 67-year-old has worked remotely over the past few weeks from his Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow, chairing meetings with officials by video conference. But on Monday, Putin held talks with the general director of Russian Railways, Oleg Belozerov, at the Kremlin, his office said. It came as Russia reported fewer than 10,000 new coronavirus infections for the tenth day in a row, recording 8,946 past 24 hours to Monday morning, taking the cumulative total to 353,427. Ninety-two more people died, the country’s coronavirus crisis response centre said, taking Russia’s total death toll from the outbreak to 3,633. Meanwhile, in the country’s east, authorities opened an investigation into a street party that drew hundreds of people, flouting the country’s coronavirus containment measures. The investigative committee in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk said it was looking into the case after photos and videos were posted online of young Russians dancing as music played from loudspeakers in the city’s central Lenin Square from Saturday night to Sunday morning. Russians can face up to seven years in prison for violating anti-virus lockdown rules, though in most cases face only a fine. Somalia has reported 95 new cases of coronavirus, and five more deaths from Covid-19. So far the east African country has reported 1,689 officially confirmed infections, while a total of 66 people have died after catching the virus. The countries of the European Union need to present a united front to shield – wait for it – the banks. That is the message from the EU’s banking regulator, José Manuel Campa, on Monday. Reuters says his intervention will rekindle a divisive debate about whether rich countries such as Germany should support banks of poorer neighbours, such as Italy. But it will also no doubt evoke memories of the 2008 financial crisis, when governments poured billions into propping up banks even as millions lost their homes and jobs, and income levels fell. Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron have proposed an EU recovery fund to help the bloc’s worst-hit members to rebuild their economies after the coronavirus outbreak. “It would make sense to have a European approach to support banks,” Campa told Reuters. “That could be in the form of a Tarp-style precautionary recapitalisation. Here, the EU recovery fund could play a role,” he said, suggesting that assistance could be aimed at banks that were fundamentally robust but hit by the coronavirus crisis. The World Health Organization’s thrice-weekly coronavirus briefing is due to begin shortly. Click on the player at the top of the blog to tune in. Mongolia is to remain under coronavirus lockdown until a vaccine is found, its prime minister said on Monday. The landlocked country, wedged in the heart of Asia between Russia and China, was one of the first to close its borders to protect itself against the pandemic. Other measures to curb the spread of the virus include a ban on children under 12 in malls and restaurants, mandatory face masks in public, and the closure of universities, schools and early years education until September. “The country will keep the quarantine rules until a vaccine becomes available,” Prime Minister Khurelsukh Ukhnaa told reporters in the country’s parliament, according to AFP. Thousands of Mongolians remain stranded abroad after the country said only vulnerable groups – including pregnant women, seniors, children with their parents, and people with serious health issues – could return The reopening of nightclubs in China have given a taster of what ravers around the world can expect when nightlife finally begins again amid the widely touted “new normal”. Reuters reports from 44KW, a techno club in Shanghai, that customers danced and mingled without much physical distancing over the weekend. But there have been some significant changes. Nightclubbers – at least those in the UK – are used to ID checks and stringent drugs searches. But if things proceed as they are in China, they will have to get used to submitting to a temperature check on the door now as well, and register their details. While face masks were not compulsory for the customers at 44KW, the staff, including bouncers, bartenders and waiters, all kept their faces covered. The club has installed hand-sanitiser dispensers throughout. Some changes will be welcomed. The Chinese nightclub has committed to disinfecting toilets every hour, and the entire venue is disinfected every day – before and after opening. The Czech Republic has lifted its trailblazing rule requiring face masks to be worn in public, a symbolic landmark in the country’s relatively successful battle against Covid-19, writes Robert Tait in Prague. The long-awaited lifting of the regulation – imposed in March shortly after a state of emergency was declared – coincided with the final phase of an easing of lockdown restrictions, in which pubs, restaurants, hotels and museums have been fully reopening their doors. Czech officials have pressed ahead with a phased easing of restrictions amid a consistent decline in the number of confirmed cases. The health minister, Adam Vojtěch, declared last week that “the Covid-19 crisis is behind us”. Health ministry figures reported 8,932 confirmed cases as of 24 May, with nearly 400,000 tests performed. There have been 315 deaths. The Czech Republic was among the first countries in Europe to close its borders against the spread of coronavirus, on 12 March, ordering the closure of most businesses days later. But the mask edict – in common with neighbouring Slovakia – quickly became the symbol of the Czech fight against the pandemic, prompting debate in other countries over whether they should follow suit. Poland’s health minister, Łukasz Szumowski, has denied any wrongdoing following accusations of inadequate supervision of the procurement of equipment to help combat the coronavirus pandemic, Reuters reports. The allegations against Szumowski, a highly popular politician of the nationalist government, risk damaging the popularity of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party ahead of a presidential election. PiS needs to win the election in order to retain control during the pandemic – which has infected 21,440 and killed 996 people in the country – as the president has the power to veto new legislation and to trigger an early general election. Polish media have accused Szumowski’s ministry of inadequate supervision of the procurement of items such as protective masks. The daily newspapers Gazeta Wyborcza reported that the ministry bought masks with fake certificates from a skiing instructor who is a family friend of Szumowski. “Neither I, nor my brother, nor my wife, have done anything wrong. There is not a single fact that would indicate any irregularities,” Szumowski told the private broadcaster Polsat News. Data released today showed the number of Portuguese young people requesting jobless benefitsrose 52% last month from a year earlier, way above the increase for other age groups, amid the coronavirus lockdown. Overall, nearly 200,000 people received unemployment benefits last month, a 17% jump from the same period last year and a near 14% increase from the previous month, social security service numbers showed. Reuters reports there was also an almost 33% increase among those aged 25 to 34 and a 20.4% rise among people aged between 35 and 44. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned of “unusual or aggressive” behaviour in American rats as a consequence of more than two months of human lockdown for city-dwelling rodents, who now find themselves unable to dine out on restaurant waste, street garbage and other food sources. Edward Helmore reports that last month – according to the national health body – dumpster-diving rats were observed resorting to open warfare, cannibalism and eating their young in the wake of urban shutdowns. “Community-wide closures have led to a decrease in food available to rodents, especially in dense commercial areas,” the CDC said in recently updated rodent-control guidelines. “Some jurisdictions have reported an increase in rodent activity as rodents search for new sources of food. Environmental health and rodent control programs may see an increase in service requests related to rodents and reports of unusual or aggressive rodent behavior.” Hello, it’s Frances Perraudin here again. I’ll be taking over the live blog while Damien has a break. You can contact me with hints and tips on frances.perraudin@theguardian.com and on twitter @fperraudin. Big crowds turned out for the Memorial Day weekend in the US amid warnings from authorities about people disregarding the coronavirus social distancing rules and risking a resurgence of Covid-19 as the country braces to surpass more than 100,000 deaths. The US is on track to hit the grim milestone in the next few days, while Europe has recorded more than 169,000 dead, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that almost certainly understates the toll. Worldwide, more than 5.4 million people have been infected and nearly 345,000 have died. Dr Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus taskforce, said she was “very concerned” about scenes of people crowding together over the weekend. “We really want to be clear all the time that social distancing is absolutely critical. And if you can’t social distance and you’re outside, you must wear a mask,” Birx said on ABC’s This Week. The Spanish arm of the international charity Médecins Sans Frontières has ended its coronavirus operations in the country, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian’s Madrid correspondent. For the past two months, MSF Spain has been running field hospitals and working to relieve some of the strains on the country’s overstretched health system. On Monday, the NGO said it was winding up its activities as Spain’s hospitals “have passed the most critical point”. But it warned that the hard-won gains against the virus could not be taken for granted and that systemic problems needed to be addressed. David Noguera, the head of MSF Spain, said: Everyone now appreciates what this epidemic means for the most vulnerable sectors of the population, such as older people in care homes. It would be unacceptable for our system not to be more prepared in order to avoid the repetition of the tragic situations and deaths we’ve seen. Noguera pointed out that more than 19,000 people had died in Spanish care homes, adding: “The dignity of the most vulnerable people in our society need to be our common focus.” The Netherlands reported 209 more confirmed cases of coronavirus on Monday, taking its cumulative total to 45,445, as officials said a second Dutch worker may have been infected by a mink. According to the latest update from the Dutch national institute for public health and the environment, eight more people have died from Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new virus, taking the country’s total death toll from the outbreak to 5,830. It came as the agriculture minister said on Monday that another person had been infected while working on a mink farm. The case follows a reported infection last week on one of two farms near the southern city of Eindhoven, where the disease was discovered in April among mink that are bred for their valuable fur. “A second case has become known where on one of the mink farms SARS-CoV-2 has been passed from a mink to a human,” Carola Schouten said, according to AFP. “The case is similar to the previous one,” she said in a letter to the Dutch parliament. The infection happened before it was known the mink were carrying the virus, meaning workers did not wear protective clothing at the time. Spain will lift its quarantine requirement for those entering the country from 1 July, the government has just confirmed, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian’s Madrid correspondent. At the moment, travellers from overseas are required to undergo a 14-day self-isolation on arrival. On Saturday the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the country would reopen to tourists from July. The official death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in Sweden has topped 4,000, statistics published by its public health agency showed on Monday. The data published on the agency’s website showed that deaths from Covid-19 had risen to 4,029, from 3,998 a day earlier, while the number of confirmed cases increased by 384 to 33,843. Unlike most other countries, Sweden has taken a soft-touch approach to fighting the virus, leaving most schools, shops and restaurants open and relying on voluntary measures focused on social distancing and good hygiene. Accumulated deaths in the pandemic in Sweden have been many times higher relative to the size of the population than in its Nordic neighbours, but still lower than in some hard-hit countries such as Spain and Britain that implemented strict lockdowns. On Sunday, people gathered in Stockholm to protest against their government’s perceived inaction over the outbreak. Vietnam reported a new case of coronavirus on Monday, its second in a week, bringing its total number of cases to 325, with no deaths so far. The new case is a 20-year-old Vietnamese student who has recently returned to the country from France, the ministry of health was quoted as saying by the Xinhua news agency. She is being treated in Ho Chi Minh City. Vietnam has recorded no local transmission of the coronavirus for 39 consecutive days. The country’s success in tackling the outbreak has been based on a fast, aggressive and comprehensive response. There are currently more than 15,400 people being monitored and quarantined. Newspapers in Brazil continue to rebel against President Jair Bolsonaro’s response to Covid-19, writes Tom Phillips, the Guardian’s Latin America correspondent. On Monday, with Brazil’s official death toll at 22,666, Rio de Janeiro’s O Dia newspaper led its coverage with this striking front page: Bolsonaro continues to cause outrage in Brazil by playing down the pandemic and flouting social distancing guidelines. On Saturday he was branded a “killer” by opponents as he popped out for a Saturday night hotdog on the day a further 965 of his citizens were reported to have died. Foreign newspapers have also joined the criticism of Bolsonaro. On Monday the Telegraph in the UK branded Bolsonaro “the man who broke Brazil”. Thirty-four more people in Iran have died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, the health ministry reports. But the lowest daily Covid-19 death toll in the country since March comes amid an apparently rise in new coronavirus cases. In his daily update, Kianoush Jahanpour, the health ministry spokesman, said 2,023 more Iranians had tested positive for the virus since yesterday, taking the total cumulative total number of cases in the country to 137,724. Daily new cases have been rising, on average, since 2 May, when the country recorded 802 new infections, but are still well short of a high of 3,186 reported on 30 March. The Covid-19 death toll in Iran is 7,451, while 107,713 have recovered, Jahanpour said. After months of working remotely while the continent has been frozen by coronavirus lockdowns, European Union leaders may meet face to face in the coming weeks to bargain over the next joint budget and a linked pandemic recovery fund. A senior EU diplomat told Reuters: The budget and recovery fund cannot be agreed without a physical summit. I haven’t yet met anyone who would think it possible on a video conference According to Reuters, technical issues, problems with translation and the less personal nature of video calls have made it hard for EU leaders to replicate the atmosphere of their all-night summits, a hallmark of Brussels where they meet to haggle over joint policies. On Wednesday the European commission, the EU executive, will propose its blueprint for the 27-nation budget, known as the Multiannual Financial Framework and worth around €1tn, and the accompanying coronavirus recovery fund. France and Germany have joined in support of granting handouts worth €500bn through the new fund to kickstart economic growth. But the so-called “frugal four” of Austria, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands are opposed, calling for aid to come in the form of repayable loans rather than free grants. A fortnight after the end of France’s strict eight-week lockdown, parks and gardens in Paris remain closed to city-dwellers, many of whom spent the confinement cooped up in apartments with no outside space, writes Kim Willsher, in the French capital. While the city’s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, continues her battle with the government to have the spaces opened – so far unsuccessfully – an unlikely hero has emerged from the night-time shadows. An anonymous lock-picker calling himself José, who says he has a full-time and perfectly respectable day job, is spending his evenings cracking park padlocks. “I’m not a thief, I steal nothing …,” he said. “But everything is closed, it’s worse than before the lockdown. I saw some children playing in the road in front of a locked-up park and it seemed so stupid. So I decided to open up a green corridor. I leave the gates open and people can do what they want.” José says the smiles on childrens’ faces when they discover their local park is open is worth the risk. If caught he risks five years in prison and a maximum €75,000 fine. Greece has taken another step towards normality today, reinstating ferry links with islands and allowing restaurants, cafes and bars to reopen, writes Helena Smith in Athens. The moves, designed to kick-start the country’s tourist industry ahead of seasonal hotels reopening on 15 June, follow almost three months of enforced closure thanks to coronavirus. In central Athens cafes began filling up from early morning – although it wasn’t quite business as usual. Waiters wore face coverings and, though not everywhere, hand sanitisers were visible on tables. Yachting industry activities also kicked off as the Greek government gradually opens up the sector in advance of seasonal hotels accepting guests in mid-June and international flights resuming to popular destinations on 1 July. In a nation so reliant on tourism – one in five Greeks work in the sector, which accounts for almost 25% of GDP – officials are desperate to capitalise on the country’s successful handling of the pandemic and salvage what is left of the season. But reopening borders is also replete with risk. With less than 3,000 confirmed coronavirus cases to date and a death toll of 172, questions are mounting over the ability of rudimentary health services on popular islands to deal with any outbreak of the virus. So far Greek isles have remained remarkably coronavirus-free. Civil protection officials and personnel from the national public health organisation have been dispatched to remote isles such as Kimolos, Folegrandos and Sikinos to look at boosting medical infrastructure in advance of tourists arrivals. More than 110,900 people have so far tested positive for the coronavirus across Africa, according to the World Health Organization’s office for the continent. More than 14 weeks after the virus was first detected on the continent, the 54 countries of Africa, which between them account for a population of about 1.4 billion people, have so far counted 44,500 recoveries and 3,300 deaths. On Friday, the WHO said it now seemed apparent that the coronavirus outbreak was “taking a different pathway” in Africa, which has not seen the kind of catastrophe that had earlier been feared. Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO regional director for Africa, said: For now Covid-19 has made a soft landfall in Africa, and the continent has been spared the high numbers of deaths which have devastated other regions of the world. It is possible our youth dividend is paying off and leading to fewer deaths. But we must not be lulled into complacency as our health systems are fragile and are less able to cope with a sudden increase in cases. To hunker in a medieval castle while a pandemic rages outside sounds like a Black Death chronicle but Laura Jamieson and Michael Smith have rather enjoyed their lockdown, writes Rory Carroll, the Guardian’s Dublin correspondent. The young couple have been the sole occupants of Ashford Castle, a five-star hotel with 83 rooms on the shores of Lough Corrib in county Mayo that is one of Ireland’s premier tourist magnets. Jamieson, from Surrey, and Smith, from Perthshire in Scotland, usually live in the nearby village of Cross and commute to the castle for work but have spent the past two months living there while maintaining the buildings and 350-acre estate until tourists return. “It’s like being in a TV reality show that’s nobody watching,” Smith told RTE. Duties include flushing 160 toilets, dusting chandeliers and fielding emails and phone calls. The working day often ends with a visit to the school of falconry to check on the owls and hawks. For date night they choose a bottle from the wine cellar to accompany a film at the 32-seat private cinema. The couple consider their quarantine there a once-in-a-lifetime adventure – a story of happy isolation in a big hotel that could be a Ladybird book reworking of Stephen King’s The Shining. Ashford Castle was built in the 13th century, rebuilt in Victorian times and subsequently refurbished. US presidents, Barbra Streisand and Brad Pitt have stayed there. Jamieson and Smith are due to move back to their more modest digs before the castle reopens on 20 July. Afghanistan’s health ministry has pledged to establish three more medical centres for Covid-19 patients in Kabul, as the capital experienced a record rise in infections and the number of confirmed cases nationwide passed 11,000, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports from Herat. Ferozuddin Feroz, the health minister, said in a meeting with his deputies on Monday that three more centres will be established in Kabul for Covid-19 patients. Last week the ministry said it had run out of hospital beds for treating patients with the disease in most parts of the country. “The hospitals which had empty beds until 10 days ago and we were sending patients to, are packed, with no more beds. We should launch more hospitals immediately,” Wahid Majroh, deputy health minister said last week. The health ministry said it had tested 1,095 more suspected patients, of whom 591 were positive, taking the total number of confirmed infections to 11,173. The official death toll reached 219 after one more patient died overnight. There have been 1,097 recoveries. The ministry has pledged to increase the number of daily tests – it has tested 31,718 suspected patients since the outbreak began. Most of the new infections were reported in Kabul, where 390 cases came back positive out of 697 tests. Kabul is the country’s worst-affected area in number of transmissions, with 4,141 confirmed cases and 29 deaths. The eastern province of Nangarhar and the western province of Herat, which have both recorded surges in the number of new infections in recent days, recorded 80 new cases combined. Herat is the country’s worst-affected area for deaths, with 36. Sunday was the first day of Eid in Afghanistan and concerns are high as streets are crowded with people, despite the government-mandated lockdown, According to a Guardian tally, Afghanistan recorded 3,920 new cases in the seven days before Eid – a record high. Meanwhile, after recent violence, the country is experiencing a rare period of calm, with the Taliban and Afghan government announcing a three-day Eid ceasefire. Local media reported there were only two security incidents recorded on the first day of Eid. Ethnic minorities have been the hardest-hit by the coronavirus in the US, and now Latino workers are facing fresh difficulty, as they and their communities suffer discrimination after contracting coronavirus in meat processing plants and warehouses, writes Adam Gabbatt for the Guardian US. More than 10,000 meatpacking workers, many of them Latino, have contracted coronavirus in the US, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers union, and dozens have died. Latino advocates say workers are also experiencing racism due to fears they have contracted the virus in the workplace. “We’ve received reports that some workers at a plant were turned away from grocery stores and not allowed in, because they were presumed to have the coronavirus because they worked at the local meatpacking plant,” said Domingo Garcia, national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens (Lulac). “We’ve also heard in Marshalltown [Iowa] people were being refused service because they thought they were positive for Covid-19 – just because they were Latino,” Garcia added. Global cases pass 5.4m There are currently 5,424,718 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The death toll stands at 345,296. Both figures are likely to be higher, due to differing test rates, definitions and deliberate underreporting. Germany enters recession in first quarter Falling consumer spending, capital investments and exports pushed the German economy into a recession in the first three months of the year, the national statistics office said this morning, as the virus continued to hurt the major economies. Capital investments slumped by 6.9%, private consumption by 3.2% and exports by 3.1% between January and March compared with the last three months of 2019. China says virus pushing US ties to brink of ‘cold war’ The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, has said Washington seemed infected by a “political virus” but that Beijing would nevertheless be open to an international effort to find the coronavirus source. “Some political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new cold war,” Wang said. Speaking on Sunday, Robert O’Brien, Donald Trump’s national security adviser, likened China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak to the Soviet Union’s cover-up of the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. US bars travellers who have been in Brazil in last two weeks The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they have been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world’s second-worst affected country in terms of coronavirus cases. Brazil meanwhile registered 15,813 new cases and 653 new deaths in 24 hours, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,666, and cases to 363,211 confirmed cases, the health ministry said. Japan ends state of emergency The Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, has lifted the state of emergency imposed due to the coronavirus crisis. He said on Monday that the country had managed to get the spread of the virus under control in under two months. Social distancing curbs were loosened for most of the country on 14 May as new infections fell, but the government has kept Tokyo and four other prefectures under watch. Boris Johnson under pressure to sack senior aide Pressure on Boris Johnson to sack Dominic Cummings has intensified, as at least 18 Conservative MPs publicly called on the adviser to face the consequences of breaking lockdown rules. The UK prime minister backed his senior aide at a defiant press conference on Sunday, saying it had been within the rules for Cummings to drive his family 264 miles to his parents’ estate in Durham while his wife was suffering coronavirus symptoms. Restrictions ease in Madrid and Barcelona Major parks and cafe terraces reopened in Madrid for the first time in more than two months as the capital and the surrounding region moved into the second phase of the loosening of lockdown restrictions. The Barcelona metropolitan area and parts of Castilla y León also joined Madrid in the same phase, which allows groups of up to 10 people to meet as long as they maintain physical distancing. Small shops can also open without prior appointments and places of worship can reopen at 30% capacity. Chile’s healthcare system ‘very close to the limit’ The Chilean president, Sebastián Piñera, said on Sunday that the country’s healthcare system was under strain and “very close to the limit”, as the number of confirmed novel coronavirus infections approached 70,000, after a rapid increase in recent days. The health ministry reported 3,709 new cases in the last day, bringing the total to 69,102. The death toll is at 718. South Africa announces further easing of lockdown South Africa will further relax coronavirus lockdown restrictions from 1 June, President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced, allowing large areas of the economy to fully reopen. “Cabinet has determined that the alert level for the whole country should be lowered from level four to level three,” he said in an address broadcast on television, describing the move as a significant shift in approach to the pandemic. Splits are emerging between federal and state governments in Germany over plans to end coronavirus lockdowns, the Associated Press reports. The overall number of coronavirus cases in the country has been in a steady decline after peaking in late April. but as restrictions, imposed 10 weeks ago, have slowly been eased there have been fresh clusters of cases linked to slaughterhouses, restaurants, religious services, nursing homes and refugee shelters. The governor of Thuringia, Bodo Ramelow, said on Saturday he hoped to lift the remaining statewide lockdown rules on 6 June and tackle outbreaks locally. Saxony, a neighbouring state, said on Monday that it too is aiming for a “paradigm change” on pandemic rules from 6 June if infections remain low. Jens Spahn, the health minister, on Monday cautioned against acting as though the outbreak was over. He told Bild, a German tabloid, that “on the one hand we are seeing whole regions where there are no new reported infections for days. And on the other hand local and regional outbreaks in which the virus is spreading quickly again and immediate intervention is required.” Federal and state officials agreed earlier this month that restrictions would be re-imposed if there are more than 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in a city or county within a week. Donald Trump, the US president, recently shared a doctored video of his head superimposed on to actor Bill Pullman’s character in the 1996 film Independence Day’s crowd-rallying scene, likening frontline workers to warriors. But it rang hollow for Denita Jones, a Dallas-area call center worker. For many black, essential workers like her, the message is about reopening the economy, but the real meaning is more subtle. “We’re not essential, we’re expendable,” she said. African Americans in Texas are dying of Covid-19 at a rate more than one-third higher than their share of the population. Yet across the country, the protesters who became the faces of the race to reopen have been mostly white. Guardian US writer Kenya Evelyn reports on how experts are warning that reopening states could have dire consequences on public health, and black Americans already face greater risk. The cumulative tally of officially confirmed cases of coronavirus in Germany has increased by 289 to 178,570, the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said on Monday, according to Reuters. The reported death toll rose by 10 to 8,257, the data showed. Meanwhile, the German federal government is recommending that states ease some social distancing regulations from 6 June, the Bild newspaper reported, but continues to urge that limits be placed on the size of social gatherings. According to an official paper seen by the newspaper, Helge Braun, the head of the office of the chancellor, recommended that private gatherings be held in the open air where possible and be limited to 20 people, while indoor meetings should be limited to 10 people. Hi, this is Damien Gayle taking over on the coronavirus live blog now, with thanks to Frances Perraudin for keeping things going for the past few hours.

A chilling video warning Italians not to drop their guard against coronavirus as they socialise has provoked a strong reaction on social media. The video, entitled Happy Hour? and created by leaders of the Veneto region, is mostly targeted at young people who have been criticised for gathering in groups outside bars since they reopened last Monday. The clip shows people drinking, chatting and haphazardly wearing masks, while warning that “it takes little … a warm greeting, innocent laughter, a handshake … before it’s all going to stop.” The characters then freeze in action before images of Covid-19 patients in intensive care are shown. Luca Zaia, the president of Veneto, said during a press conference that “Happy hour will be unhappy if you end up in hospital”. He came under attack for the video, with one Twitter user describing it as “pure terrorism”. Another wrote: “Dear president, this virus is cured (not fought against) in suitable places. Outside, one must live!” There was support from some quarters, particularly from Vincenzo De Luca, the president of the Campania region, who became somewhat of a star during the lockdown for his comical rants aimed at getting citizens to comply with rules. “Well done Luca,” he tweeted. “Sometimes we need to terrorise if they don’t understand.” A town in Veneto was among the first 11 in Italy to be quarantined at the start of the outbreak, but mass testing enabled the region to quickly get the virus under control. As of Sunday, there were 1,869 deaths and 17 new infections. Other Italian leaders have had to reimpose restrictions following scenes of people mixing closely together and without face masks. In Brescia, one of the areas in Lombardy hardest hit by coronavirus, bars will now have to close by 9.30pm, while in Verona in Veneto, bar customers must be seated at a table. Bars will also have to close by 9pm in Perugia, Umbria. Hungary has opened its southern border for citizens of Serbia and Hungary from today, the country’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, has told a news conference. He said Hungary had decided to reciprocate a similar measure taken by Serbia on Friday, Reuters reports, adding that the coronavirus pandemic was under control in both countries, which allowed the easing of restrictions. The move followed a gradual reopening of landlocked Hungary’s other borders, which now allow some movement although restrictions have not been fully lifted. Hungary has recorded 3,756 cases of Covid-19 and 491 deaths. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, is to lift the state of emergency imposed due to the coronavirus crisis. He said on Monday that the country had managed to get the spread of the virus under control in under two months. Physical distancing curbs were loosened for most of the country on 14 May as new infections fell, but the government has kept Tokyo and four other prefectures under watch. According to the public broadcaster NHK, the world’s third-largest economy has escaped an explosive outbreak with more than 16,600 infections and 839 deaths so far. A little over a month ago, health experts were saying Japan risked becoming one of the world’s coronavirus “disaster zones”. This report from the Guardian’s Justin McCurry in Tokyo looks at how the country’s government went on to win plaudits for its response to the crisis. Major parks and cafe terraces reopened in Madrid for the first time in more than two months as the capital and the surrounding region moved into the second phase of the loosening of lockdown restrictions. The Barcelona metropolitan area and parts of Castilla y León also joined Madrid in the same phase, which allows groups of up to 10 people to meet as long as they maintain physical distancing. Small shops can also open without prior appointments and places of worship can reopen at 30% capacity. Madrid’s mayor, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, marked the occasion by tweeting a picture of himself standing by the boating lake in the city’s famous El Retiro park. “Open,” he tweeted. “Good morning and let’s be responsible.” Almost half of Spain – 47% – has moved into the third phase of the de-escalation. The penultimate phase allows shops in shopping centres to reopen (but not communal areas) and restaurants to serve customers inside, but while operating at 40% capacity. Cinemas and theatres are also permitted to open, but must operate at 30% capacity. What if it had just fizzled out? What if leading Chinese scientist Zhong Nanshan had gone on state television on 20 January and delivered news that the unusual virus detected in Wuhan was not spreading between people, instead of what he really said that night: that human-to-human transmission was certain? ... What would we be talking about instead? What stories would have defined 2020 so far? Even before the worst pandemic in a century, tectonic shifts were already under way. The news felt exhausting. But the world is still turning, despite the movements of half of humanity being restricted in some way. Even apart from Covid-19, it has been a year of significant developments. The Guardian’s international correspondent Michael Safi looks at the global stories that would have been getting our attention if Covid-19 had never emerged. The Philippines’ health department has reported five additional coronavirus deaths and 284 more infections, the largest daily increase of cases in two weeks. In a bulletin, the government said total deaths had increased to 873, while confirmed cases had risen to 14,319. Seventy-four more patients have recovered, bringing total recoveries to 3,323. From crowded informal settlements to conservation areas teeming with wildlife, cottage industries have popped up around the globe producing and distributing face masks for frontline workers, taxi drivers, market sellers and more, Kate Hodal reports. Usually comprised of two fabric layers with a disposable filter, mask-making enterprises are stoking local economies and helping communities. Read the full story here: Singapore’s health ministry has confirmed 344 more coronavirus cases, taking its tally of infections to 31,960, Reuters reports. The lower number of cases on Monday is partly due to fewer tests being conducted, the ministry said in a statement. It said the vast majority of the newly infected people were migrant workers living in dormitories, adding that four were Singaporeans or permanent residents. The often unsanitary dormitories that house migrant workers in Singapore have become a hotbed of infections in recent weeks. For background, read this report from the end of last month from the Guardian’s south-east Asia correspondent, Rebecca Ratcliffe. Spain’s tourism minister has said this morning that foreigners can book vacations in Spain from July as the two-week self-quarantine for overseas travellers is likely to be suspended by then. Spain – one of the worst-hit nations in the world from the coronavirus – has an economy that is heavily dependent on tourism. While it is gradually easing its strict lockdown measures, it has kept a quarantine for foreign visitors to try to prevent a second wave of infections. “It is perfectly coherent to plan summer vacations to come to Spain in July,” Reyes Maroto said in an interview with the local radio station Onda Cero. The country’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said on Saturday the government would guarantee the safety of visitors and locals when they started to return from July. “Spain needs tourism, and tourism needs safety in both origin and destination,” he said. Hello, I’m Frances Perraudin in London. I’ll be taking over the live blog for the morning. You can contact me with hints and tips on frances.perraudin@theguardian.com and on twitter @fperraudin. Thanks for reading. India has resumed domestic flights despite the country recording its biggest daily number of infections yet. Here’s the full story from Amrit Dhillon. The pressure on Boris Johnson to sanction Dominic Cummings is already being ratcheted up after a member of the government’s advisory group on behavioural science told morning TV that the “debacle” has “fatally undermined” efforts to fight coronavirus. Prof Stephen Reicher told Good Morning Britain: If you look at the research it shows the reason why people observed lockdown was not for themselves, it wasn’t because they were personally at risk, they did it for the community, they did it because of a sense of ‘we’re all in this together’. If you give the impression there’s one rule for them and one rule for us you fatally undermine that sense of ‘we’re all in this together’ and you undermine adherence to the forms of behaviour which have got us through this crisis.” Reicher was reiterating criticism he voiced yesterday when he said Johnson’s defence of his favourite aide had “trashed” advice on how to build public consensus on following the rules of lockdown. Falling consumer spending, capital investments and exports pushed the German economy into a recession in the first three months of the year, the national statistics office said this morning, as the virus continued to hurt the major economies. Capital investments slumped by 6.9%, private consumption by 3.2% and exports by 3.1% between January and March compared with the last three months of 2019. 100 writers call for an end to anti-Asian hostility More than 100 prominent writers, including several top Asian American authors, have called for an end to a surge in anti-Asian hostility in the US which they say has been “egged on” during the pandemic by the Trump administration’s pandering to racist tropes. The joint statement, co-ordinated by Pen America and the Asian American Writers’ Workshop (AAWW), comes at a time when hate crimes, violence and other attacks against Asians and Asian Americans are on the rise in the US. There have been numerous reports since early in the pandemic of Asian Americans being blamed for “bringing the virus” into the country and being told “go back to China”. Asian stock markets have given back earlier gains amid concerns about growing US-Sino antagonism over the coronavirus crisis and trade. Hong Kong has slumped 1.4% to a two-month low after sinking 5.5% on Friday. The London stock market is closed today for the spring bank holiday but other European bourses are in business. Here are the opening calls. Lockdown gives asylum seekers reprieve and hope for change in policy Clare Considine reports for the Guardian: As Britain takes its first small steps out of lockdown, there is one group of people quietly wishing that it wouldn’t. For many asylum seekers, the two-month hiatus has meant reprieve. Freed from detention centres, liberated from the threat of imminent deportation and no longer obliged to report to the Home Office, many have welcomed the relief. And all this at a time when the general population have learned something of what it is like to live with severe curbs on civil liberties: That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, on a chilly and wet Sydney evening. I’m off to gently encourage some rather large insects seeking shelter in my house to rediscover their love of the great outdoors – and not so gently encourage others. Thank you for for following along, and, as always, to those who got in touch. The parts of Spain already in or entering Phase 1 today, according to El Pais, include: “The regions of Madrid, Castilla y León and Valencia, as well as most of Catalonia and the provinces of Ciudad Real, Toledo, Albacete, Granada and Málaga.” Those entering Phase 2 are: “The Canary and Balearic Islands, Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque Country, La Rioja, Navarre, Aragón, Extremadura, Guadalajara, Cuenca, Murcia, all of Andalusia apart from Málaga y Granada, Terres de l’Ebre (Tarragona), Camp de Tarragona (Tarragona), Alt Pirineu-Aran (Lleida), and the Spanish exclave cities of Ceuta and Melilla in North Africa.” Spain is easing lockdown restrictions today, with the country entering Phase 1 of the relaxed restrictions, while some parts will enter Phase 2, which is more relaxed. The El Pais newspaper has detailed the differences between the two phases: Phase 1 Under this stage of the deescalation plan, building work in properties that are being lived in will no longer be prohibited, while the opening of shopping malls will be made more flexible. Stores in malls will be able to open provided that they measure under 400 square meters, or they demarcate an area of that size for customers. They will also require an independent, direct access point from outside of the shopping mall in which they are located. Museums will be able to decide how many people to let in, within a range of 30% to 50% of normal capacity. Phase 2 Local councils will be able to establish access limits and control the number of people on beaches in order to guarantee a two-meter distance can be observed, as well as establishing time limits both on the sand and in car parks. The order specifies that access to beaches must always be free of charge. To calculate the maximum capacity of a beach, each bather is considered to occupy approximately four square meters. Thailand confirmed two new coronavirus cases and one additional death on Monday, a health ministry spokesman said. The new numbers brought the total number of cases in the Southeast Asian country to 3,042 and deaths to 57 since the outbreak began in January, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the Covid-19 Administration Centre. More than 96% of the patients, or 2,928 people, have recovered, he said. Get in touch via Twitter @helenrsullivan or email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com.

Boris Johnson’s defence of Dominic Cummings has dominated the front pages of the UK’s media landscape, with newspapers taking varied lines on the prime minister’s decision to excuse his senior aide’s lockdown breaches. The Daily Mail – whose coverage usually backs the prime minister and his government – has taken a particularly strong line against Johnson, simply asking: “What planet are they on?” The Telegraph has stuck closer to its usual pro-Conservative position, quoting Johnson’s defence of his senior aide. Nightclubs in China have mostly come back to life as owners and customers feel increasingly comfortable the novel coronavirus epidemic is under control, but disinfectant, disposable cups and masks have become part of the experience, Reuters reports. At 44KW, a club for electronic music lovers in the financial hub of Shanghai, customers sat, danced and mingled with little sign of social distancing on the weekend. The club re-opened in mid-March after closing for about six weeks, but it took a while for business to get back to normal. “There really weren’t many clients as most people were quite worried about their safety,” said Charles Guo, founder of 44KW. “Our client flow began to recover quickly towards the end of April”, Guo said, adding that business was back to last year’s average levels by mid-May. But not everything is like the old days: the club checks the temperature of every customer and gets them to register their details. Staff, including bouncers, bartenders and waiters wear masks and gloves all the time. Customers don’t have to wear masks but many do. Some glasses have been replaced with plastic cups and the club has installed hand sanitizer dispensers throughout. Door handles and toilets are disinfected every hour while the entire club is disinfected every day before and after opening, Guo said. President Donald Trump has further limited travel to the US from the world’s coronavirus hotspots by denying entry to foreigners coming from Brazil, which is second to the US in the number of confirmed cases. Trump had already banned certain travellers from China, Europe, the United Kingdom and Ireland and, to a lesser extent, Iran. He has not moved to ban travel from Russia, which has the world’s third-highest caseload, approximately 20,000 fewer than Brazil’s. The worsening situation in Latin America came as other nations started to emerge from coronavirus lockdown. Japan was expected to lift a state of emergency on Monday and India restarted domestic flights. Australia’s most populous state sent children back to school for the first time since the pandemic began. The authorities in New South Wales deployed hundreds of crowd-control staff on Monday to enforce social distancing on public transport amid an expected commuter surge as schools and offices reopened and coronavirus cases fell. The Guardian’s Charlotte Graham-McLay reports: New Zealand will further loosen its coronavirus lockdown restrictions from Friday, allowing gatherings - including funerals, church services and parties - to increase in size from 10 people to 100. Three weeks after a relaxation of the strictest-possible level 4 shutdown rules, prime minister Jacinda Ardern said, it was clear that a fresh wave of infection had been avoided. This was “counter to what many countries overseas have experienced,” she said, adding that the curb of the virus’ spread was “in large part to New Zealanders sticking to the rules” at levels 3 and 2 over the past few weeks. Under the current level 2 restrictions, schools and most businesses have been permitted to reopen, with strict physical distancing rules in place, but all gatherings are limited to a maximum of 10 people. That has generated criticism from some churches and those holding funeral services, who said they had expected looser rules at level 2. Ardern had earlier promised that the current rules might be relaxed if New Zealand’s record with the virus – health officials have regularly reporting days of zero or one new case for the country – continued. On Monday, she said that had happened. The country’s success to date in fighting the virus meant “we can now make choices others can’t,” Ardern added. “It’s another step in re-normaisling life as we continue to stamp out the virus.” Cabinet would discuss the lockdown rules again on 8 June, she said, and would consider by 22 June whether the country could safely move to the lightest, level 1 restrictions. New Zealand has recorded fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases and 21 deaths from the virus. One person is in hospital. Global cases pass 5.4m. There are currently 5,407,701 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The death toll stands at 345,036. Both figures are likely to be higher, due to differing test rates, definitions and deliberate underreporting. White House official likens China’s handling of coronavirus to Chernobyl cover-up. A top White House official on Sunday likened China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak to the Soviet Union’s cover-up of the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. National security adviser Robert O’Brien said Beijing knew what was happening with the virus, which originated in Wuhan, from November but lied to the World Health Organization and prevented outside experts from accessing information. China says virus pushing US ties to brink of “Cold War”. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday that Washington seemed infected by a “political virus” but that Beijing would nevertheless be open to an international effort to find the coronavirus source.“Some political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new Cold War,” Wang said. Dominic Cummings reported to police over lockdown breach. Boris Johnson’s chief advisor is facing a possible police investigation under health laws over a claim that he breached self-isolation rules in north-east England, after a weekend of mounting pressure on the prime minister to sack his chief adviser. Boris Johnson described Cummings as acting “responsibly, legally and with integrity”. World’s top drug firms turned down proposals for work on pathogens like coronavirus. The world’s largest pharmaceutical companies rejected an EU proposal three years ago to work on fast-tracking vaccines for pathogens like coronavirus to allow them to be developed before an outbreak. US bars travellers who have been in Brazil in last two weeks. The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world’s second-worst affected country in terms of cases. Brazil registers 15,813 new cases, 653 new deaths, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,666, the Health Ministry said. Brazil has 363,211 confirmed cases. France has lowest daily rise in new coronavirus cases and deaths since lockdown. French authorities reported the smallest daily rise in new coronavirus cases and deaths on Sunday since before a lockdown began on 17 March, raising hopes that the worst of the epidemic is over in France. The French government has discouraged citizens from travelling abroad this summer, recommending they holiday in France, the environment minister Elisabeth Borne has said. This follows Emmanuel Macron saying it was unlikely that French people would be able to undertake major foreign trips this summer. First Spanish beaches to reopen as lockdown eases. Coronavirus lockdown measures will finally be eased for people in Madrid and Barcelona from Monday, while elsewhere in Spain the first beaches are due to reopen, AFP reports. Residents in the two cities can now meet in groups of up to 10 people in their homes or on the terraces of bars and restaurants.The gates of the capital’s parks will also be reopened, and major museums will be able to receive a limited number of visitors. Australian children return to school. Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales, on Monday deployed hundreds of crowd control staff to enforce social distancing on public transport amid an expected commuter surge as schools and offices reopened and coronavirus cases fell. Australia has reported just over 7,100 Covid-19 infections, including 102 deaths, well below figures reported by other developed countries. New Zealand expected to further loosen lockdown restrictions. New Zealand has reported another day of no new cases of Covid-19, with the news from health officials coming hours before Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, is expected to announce further loosening of lockdown restrictions on the country. After a week of “zero days” for the coronavirus, peppered with the odd day of one new case – most recently on Friday – New Zealand’s total number of confirmed instances of Covid-19 remains under 1,500. Chile’s healthcare system “very close to the limit”. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Sunday that the country’s healthcare system is under strain and “very close to the limit”, as the number of confirmed novel coronavirus infections approached 70,000, after a rapid increase in recent days. The Ministry of Health reported 3,709 new cases in the last day, bringing the total to 69,102. The death toll is at 718. South Africa announces further easing of lockdown. South Africawill further relax coronavirus lockdown restrictions from 1 June, President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced, allowing large areas of the economy to fully reopen. “Cabinet has determined that the alert level for the whole country should be lowered from level four to level three,” he said in an address broadcast on television, describing the move as a significant shift in approach to the pandemic. India resumes domestic flights despite record spike in new cases. Domestic flights will resume across India on Monday, the federal civil aviation minister has said, despite a 24-hour record increase in new cases on Sunday. The announcement follows a day of “hard negotiations”, the minister said, after some states sought to limit the number of flights. Thousands of pro-democracy protesters assembled in Hong Kong against a controversial security law proposed by China, defying a coronavirus measure banning gatherings of more than eight people. The planned legislation is expected to ban treason, subversion and sedition, and the clashes between police and demonstrators were the most intense seen in months. Exclusive: The world’s largest pharmaceutical companies rejected an EU proposal three years ago to work on fast-tracking vaccines for pathogens like coronavirus to allow them to be developed before an outbreak, the Guardian can reveal. The plan to speed up the development and approval of vaccines was put forward by European commission representatives sitting on the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) – a public-private partnership whose function is to back cutting-edge research in Europe – but it was rejected by industry partners on the body. The commission’s argument had been that the research could “facilitate the development and regulatory approval of vaccines against priority pathogens, to the extent possible before an actual outbreak occurs”. The pharmaceutical companies on the IMI, however, did not take up the idea. The revelation is contained in a report published by the Corporate Observatory Europe (COE), a Brussels-based research centre, examining decisions made by the IMI, which has a budget of €5bn (£4.5bn), made up of EU funding and in-kind contributions from private and other bodies. Opposition leaders across Europe walk coronavirus tightrope The Guardian’s Shaun Walker reports from Budapest with Kate Connolly in Berlin: Opposition politicians across Europe, from cautious centrists to firebrand populists, have had to walk a tricky political tightrope over the past two months, as coronavirus has taken over the political agenda. How to stay politically relevant while governments, even when making errors, are benefiting from a ‘rally round the flag’ effect and seeing approval ratings rise? And how to hold those governments responsible for their mistakes, without playing political games during a health crisis? “It’s a very hard balance to strike, but there have been moments where we had no choice except to fight back,” admitted the mayor of Budapest, Gergely Karácsony, in a recent interview at his office. Chinas foreign minister is dismissing claims that the country is exploiting the coronavirus outbreak to expand its footprint in the South China Sea, labeling such accusations as sheer nonsense, Reuters reports. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters at a news conference on Sunday that China was cooperating closely on anti-virus efforts with Southeast Asian countries, several of whom have overlapping territorial claims with China in the strategically vital waterway. While China has long been stepping up its presence in the region, Wang said other countries, implying the United States and its allies, have been creating instability with military flights and sea patrols. Their ill-intentioned and despicable moves are meant to sow discord between China and (Southeast Asian countries) and undermine the hard-won stability in the region, Wang said. Sydney Opera House’s livestreamed concert series could be a game-changer for local bands Sydney’s Vivid festival was due to light up the city on Friday but instead the city is dark and silent bar a few night-joggers ploughing the streets. There’s a stir at Joan Sutherland theatre though, guitars leaning on amps ready for post-punk band Low Life’s concert – the first contemporary music act to be presented as part of the opera house’s digital season. At the band’s request, a slab of silver bullets (Reschs Pilsener) and KFC have been delivered to the green room. The venue is permitting individual dinners only: buckets and shared fries would breach its social distancing rules. Onstage, plastic bags are puckered around each microphone and, when they’re removed, engineers clap to test the audio. Say goodbye, world, to handshakes, shared Holy Communion, candles on cake and “microphone check 1-2”. New Zealand media group Stuff to be sold to chief executive Sinead Boucher for NZ$1 One of New Zealand’s largest media organisations will be sold for a single dollar to its chief executive, the owners announced on Monday. Stuff prints many of the nation’s daily newspapers and runs a popular news website of the same name. It employs about 900 staff, including 400 journalists. Owned by Australia’s Nine Entertainment, Stuff faced financial challenges before the coronavirus pandemic struck and has since seen advertising revenues plunge. In a statement to the Australian stock market, Nine said Stuff would be sold to CEO Sinead Boucher in a management buyout deal that will be completed by the end of the month. “We have always said that we believe it is important for Stuff to have local ownership and it is our firm view that this is the best outcome for competition and consumers in New Zealand,” said Hugh Marks, the CEO of Nine. Boucher said her plan is to transition the ownership by giving staff a direct stake as shareholders in the company. Coronavirus strands English-born musher in Alaska after Iditarod win Thomas Waerner won this year’s Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in March, but he is still waiting to return to his home in Norway. Waerner and his 16 dogs have been stranded in Alaska by travel restrictions and flight cancellations caused by the coronavirus pandemic, The Anchorage Daily News reported Saturday. “I like Alaska a lot,” Waerner said. “It’s kind of my dream place. But I have a family.” Waerner, whose official bio states he was born in England but lives in Norway, has five children and 35 other sled dogs in rural Torpa. He missed the 10th birthday of one of his children and misses morning coffee with his wife, Guro, who left Alaska in March shortly before health restrictions stopped travel. The 47-year-old plans to fly home in early June on a DC-6 aircraft bound for the Air History Museum in Sola, Norway. Everts Air Cargo of Fairbanks is selling the historic plane, and Waerner said the museum is expected to finalize the deal this week. “We are hitchhiking,” Waerner said. “The plane is going to Norway, and we are going with them. We are so lucky.” Blog readers: get in touch via Twitter @helenrsullivanor email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. Tips, questions, feedback or fun are welcome.

China said Sunday that its relations with the United States were “on the brink of a new Cold War,” fuelled partly by tensions over the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 350,000 people worldwide and pitched the global economy into a massive downturn. Fresh tensions between Beijing and Washington emerged as virus restrictions continued to shape and remake lives around the world, and in very different ways. US President Donald Trump has accused Beijing of a lack of transparency over the outbreak, suggesting the virus may have leaked from a top-security Chinese laboratory. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday that Washington seemed infected by a “political virus” but that Beijing would nevertheless be open to an international effort to find the coronavirus source. “Some political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new Cold War,” Wang said. Only locals will benefit from Spain’s open beaches for the time being. Travel between regions is still forbidden and foreigners arriving in Spain must quarantine for 14 days. But the government plans to reopen the borders to foreign tourists in July. The lockdown, in force since mid-March, has been among the most severe in the world. In the first few weeks, Spaniards could hardly set foot outside and their children were kept indoors. Many residents have become impatient over the government’s slow and cautious process of lifting the restrictions. Thousands of people protested on Saturday by car in major Spanish cities at the call of the far-right Vox party. Drivers honked their horns, waved Spanish flags and banged on pots and pans to denounce the management of the coronavirus crisis by the left-wing government of Pedro Sanchez. Coronavirus lockdown measures will finally be eased for people in Madrid and Barcelona from Monday, while elsewhere in Spain the first beaches are due to reopen, AFP reports. Residents in the two cities can now meet in groups of up to 10 people in their homes or on the terraces of bars and restaurants. The gates of the capital’s parks will also be reopened, and major museums will be able to receive a limited number of visitors. The Madrid and Barcelona regions, the most populated in the country, and a large part of Castile-Leon in the northwest are moving into the first phase of Spain’s four-phase deconfinement programme, following what has been one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. These regions have been on a slower deconfinement track as they bore the brunt of the pandemic in Spain, which has killed more than 28,700 people to date, one of the world’s highest tolls. Everyone must continue to wear a mask, which is already compulsory in buildings and on public streets when it is not possible to keep a distance of two metres (six feet). The rest of the country meanwhile - 22 million out of Spain’s 47 million inhabitants - is moving on to the second phase, which is expected to last until the end of June. Restaurants may then reopen to a limited number of customers, and outings for walks or sports will no longer be limited to certain hours of the day. Americans defy Covid-19 social distancing rules to celebrate Memorial Day holiday Americans across the country appeared to abandon social distancing guidelines as they sunbathed on beaches and gathered for pool parties on Memorial Day weekend. The long weekend traditionally signals the start of the US summer, and despite the country’s Covid-19 death toll approaching 100,000, many revellers dismissed any safety concerns to celebrate. At the Lake of the Ozarks, made famous by the television series with the same name, hundreds gathered for a pool party to enjoy the warm spring weather. Bar tables installed in the pool were filled with drinks, as people danced and apparently forgot that Covid-19 existed. Missouri, where the Ozarks are located, has had 686 deaths from Covid-19. There are currently 5,405,029 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The death toll stands at 345,036. Both figures are likely to be higher, due to differing test rates, definitions and deliberate underreporting. These are the ten worst-affected countries worldwide in terms of numbers of infections: US: 1,642,021 Brazil: 363,211 Russia: 344,481 United Kingdom: 260,916 Spain: 235,772 Italy: 229,858 France: 182,709 Germany: 180,328 Turkey: 156,827 India: 138,536 Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales, on Monday deployed hundreds of crowd control staff to enforce social distancing on public transport amid an expected commuter surge as schools and offices reopened and coronavirus cases fell. Australia has reported just over 7,100 Covid-19 infections, including 102 deaths, well below figures reported by other developed countries. With fewer than 20 new Covid-19 cases most days, Australian states are pressing ahead with a three-stage plan to remove most social restrictions imposed by July. In New South Wales, which includes the city of Sydney, children returned to full-time face-to-face learning on Monday, allowing many parents to return to offices. But officials warned locals to expect travel delays, with buses and trains operating at significantly reduced capacity due to distancing requirements. “We’ve got 1.2 million kids on the move,” NSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance told Australia’s Channel 9. “We just need everyone to be patient.” With international borders likely to remain closed for months, Morrison is also pressing locals to begin holidays locally to help support Australia’s tourism sector. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has spoken to the heads of the country’s six big banks to get their views on the state of the economy and the Covid-19 relief efforts, the Globe and Mail reported on Sunday, citing multiple sources. This was Trudeau’s first one-on-one dialogue with the CEOs since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, according to the report, which added that the calls took place around the Victoria Day long weekend. The topics covered included adjustments required in relief efforts rolled out by the government, need for further support and pressures faced by clients of the banks, the report said, adding that the talks were ‘high-level check-ins rather than deep policy discussions’. Brazil, the world’s second-worst coronavirus hotspot behind the United States, registered 653 new coronavirus deaths on Sunday, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,666, the Health Ministry said. Brazil has 363,211 confirmed cases, up 15,813 from Saturday, the ministry said. The Guardian’s Charlotte Graham-McLay reports: New Zealand has reported another day of no new cases of Covid-19, with the news from health officials coming hours before Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, is expected to announce further loosening of lockdown restrictions on the country. After a week of “zero days” for the coronavirus, peppered with the odd day of one new case – most recently on Friday – New Zealand’s total number of confirmed instances of Covid-19 remains under 1,500. 97% of all confirmed and probable cases of the virus have recovered, health officials said in a statement on Monday. One person in New Zealand is in hospital with Covid-19. They are not in intensive care. Ardern has drawn praise for a strict, swift lockdown of the country in late March, at a time when there were just over 200 cases and no deaths. 21 people have now died of the virus. She has slowly relaxed restrictions on the country as new case numbers have fallen, and is expected to announce today that her Cabinet has agreed gatherings can be increased to more than 10 people. She will also outline a plan to take the country from its current status of alert level 2 – out of a possible 4 – down to level 1. There is not currently a timeline in place for that to happen. Mexican health officials on Sunday reported 2,764 new cases of the novel coronavirus and 215 deaths, bringing the totals to 68,620 and 7,394, respectively. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Sunday that the novel coronavirus could cost as many as a million jobs in the country as many industries considered not essential remain shut, Reuters reports. The Mexican economy was already in recession before the pandemic struck and different investment banks have forecast contractions as large as 9% for this year with only a gradual recovery next year. “My prediction is that with coronavirus, a million jobs will be lost,” Lopez Obrador said in a televised speech. “But we will create two million new jobs.” The job loss number matches the estimate by the country’s business coordinating council. Lopez Obrador’s government repeatedly said it had the outbreak under control but since posted record numbers for new cases and deaths. Earlier this week, his government issued guidelines for restarting operations in carmaking, mining and construction in Latin America’s second-largest economy that is linked to the United States and Canada through a free trade agreement. In April, the finance ministry said in an annual economic report used to guide the budget that the economy could contract by as much as 3.9% this year, adding that the numbers incorporated a “drastic” impact from coronavirus. China reported 11 new imported cases yesterday, compared to three the day before, according to the People’s Daily. There were 40 new asymptomatic cases, up from 36 the day before. There were no new deaths. South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday said a controversial ban on the sale of alcohol would be lifted for home consumption when the country moves into level three of a five-tier coronavirus lockdown next month. South Africans were prohibited from buying alcohol and cigarettes when the country went into one of the world’s strictest lockdowns on 27 March. The booze ban was meant to prevent a spike in violence and reduce pressure on emergency wards as hospitals geared up to face a virus that has infected at least 22,583 people across the country and killed 429. “Alcohol will be sold for home consumption only under strict conditions on specified days and for limited hours,” Ramaphosa announced in an address to the nation. “The sale of tobacco products will remain prohibited in alert level 3 due to the health risks associated with smoking,” he added. South Africa started gradually easing confinement measures on 1 May, allowing citizens to exercise outdoors in the morning and some businesses to partially resume operations. Japan is considering a fresh stimulus package worth over $929bn that will consist mostly of financial aid programmes for companies hit by the coronavirus pandemic, the Nikkei newspaper said on Monday. The package, to be funded by a second extra budget for the current fiscal year beginning in April, would follow a record $1.1tn spending plan deployed last month to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic, reports Reuters. The second extra budget, worth ¥100tn ($929.45bn), will include ¥60tn yen for expanding loan programmes that state-affiliated and private financial institutions offer to firms hit by virus, the paper said. Another ¥27tn will be set aside for other financial aid programmes, including ¥15tn for a new programme to inject capital into ailing firms, it said. The government is expected to approve the budget, which will also include subsidies to help companies pay rent and wages as they close businesses, at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam has repeatedly urged Virginia residents to cover their faces in public during the coronavirus pandemic. On Friday, he told reporters wearing a mask “could literally save someone else’s life”. But the Democrat did not heed his own advice on Saturday, when he posed without a mask for photographs with residents during a visit to the Virginia Beach Oceanfront. A spokeswoman for the governor’s office said Northam should have had a mask. “He was outside and not expecting to be within 6ft of anyone,” Alena Yarmosky said. “This is an important reminder to always have face coverings in case situations change. We are all learning how to operate in this new normal, and it’s important to be prepared.” Northam has suggested he will announce a statewide policy on face coverings on Tuesday. At the beach on Saturday, he told reporters his administration was still working on the details. Critics on social media chided Northam, a doctor, for not practicing what he has preached. “Physician, heal thyself,” tweeted Todd Gilbert, Virginia’s Republican House minority leader. Chile’s healthcare system is under strain and “very close to the limit,” President Sebastian Pinera said on Sunday, as the number of confirmed novel coronavirus infections approaches 70,000 after a rapid increase in recent days, Reuters reports. The Ministry of Health reported 3,709 new cases in the last day, bringing the total to 69,102. The death toll is at 718. “We are very close to the limit because we have had a very large increase in the needs and demands for medical care, and for intensive care unit beds and ventilators,” Pinera said during a visit to a hospital in Santiago, which has the highest concentration of cases. More than 1,000 people have been hospitalized for disease associated with the coronavirus, according to the government. Chile, the world’s top copper producer, confirmed its first case of coronavirus in early March and surpassed 50,000 infections this week. A third of Chile’s population of about 19 million is under mandatory quarantine after the government put Santiago and several other cities under lockdown. Here’s the full story on Robert O’Brien, Donald Trump’s national security adviser, accusing China of a cover-up that will “go down in history along with Chernobyl”, and ramping up efforts to deflect attention from a Covid-19 death toll in the US fast closing on 100,000. A top White House official on Sunday likened China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak to the Soviet Union’s cover-up of the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. National security adviser Robert O’Brien said Beijing knew what was happening with the virus, which originated in Wuhan, from November but lied to the World Health Organization and prevented outside experts from accessing information. “They unleashed a virus on the world that’s destroyed trillions of dollars in American economic wealth that we’re having to spend to keep our economy alive, to keep Americans afloat during this virus,” O’Brien said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “The cover-up that they did of the virus is going to go down in history, along with Chernobyl. We’ll see an HBO special about it ten or 15 years from now,” he added, referring to a television miniseries. The disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, in the former Soviet republic of Ukraine, released radioactive nuclear material that killed dozens of people within weeks and forced tens of thousands to flee. Moscow delayed revealing the extent of what is regarded as the worst nuclear accident in history. “This is a real problem and it cost many, many thousands of lives in America and around the world because the real information was not allowed to get out,” O’Brien said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “It was a cover-up. And we’ll get to the bottom of it eventually.” More on the US travel ban from Brazil: The White House on Sunday broadened its travel ban against countries hard-hit by the coronavirus by denying admission to foreigners who have been in Brazil during the two-week period before they hoped to enter the US. President Donald Trump had already banned travel from the United Kingdom, Europe and China. He said last week that he was considering similar restrictions for Brazil. The ban on travel from Brazil takes effect late Thursday. As with the other bans, it does not apply to legal permanent residents. A spouse, parent or child of a US citizen or legal permanent resident also would be allowed to enter the country. The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world No. 2 hot spot for coronavirus cases. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the new restrictions would help ensure foreign nationals do not bring additional infections to the US, but would not apply to the flow of commerce between the new countries. Brazil became the No. 2 hot spot for cases on Friday, second only to the US. Brazil has recorded over 347,000 infections, while the US has over 1.6 million. The decision follows comments by the national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, to CBS.“We hope that’ll be temporary, but because of the situation in Brazil, we’re going to take every step necessary to protect the American people,” O’Brien said. Hello and welcome to today’s live global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan.

Tips, questions, feedback or fun are welcome. British PM Boris Johnson has doubled down on his defence of chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, who breached lockdown rules to drive his wife, who who was suffering coronavirus symptoms, and son 425km (264 miles) to his parents’ farm in Durham. Cummings is facing a possible police investigation after retired chemistry teacher Robin Lees made a complaint to the police over the breach. Meanwhile in the US, the Trump administration has barred travel from Brazil, which now has the second-highest number of confirmed cases worldwide. The White House announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks. Here are the main developments from the last few hours: Global toll passes 340,000 The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases stands at 5,344,539, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. There have been 342,695 deaths officially linked to coronavirus around the world. Dominic Cummings reported to police over lockdown breach. Boris Johnson’s chief advisor is facing a possible police investigation under health laws over a claim that he breached self-isolation rules in north-east England, after a weekend of mounting pressure on the prime minister to sack his chief adviser. Boris Johnson described Cummings as acting “responsibly, legally and with integrity”. US bars travellers who have been in Brazil in last two weeks. The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world’s second-worst affected country in terms of coronavirus cases. France has lowest daily rise in new coronavirus cases and deaths since lockdown. French authorities reported the smallest daily rise in new coronavirus cases and deaths on Sunday since before a lockdown began on 17 March, raising hopes that the worst of the epidemic is over in France. The French government has discouraged citizens from travelling abroad this summer, recommending they holiday in France, the environment minister Elisabeth Borne has said. This follows Emmanuel Macron saying it was unlikely that French people would be able to undertake major foreign trips this summer. South Africa announces further easing of lockdown. South Africa will further relax coronavirus lockdown restrictions from 1 June, President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced, allowing large areas of the economy to fully reopen. “Cabinet has determined that the alert level for the whole country should be lowered from level four to level three,” he said in an address broadcast on television, describing the move as a significant shift in approach to the pandemic. South Africa’s AngloGold Ashanti has suspended operations at its Mponeng mine after at least 164 employees tested positive for coronavirus. The mining company said it had tested 650 workers at the gold mining site in Merafong, Gauteng province, after a first case was detected last week. Contact tracing and sanitisation processes are under way. India resumes domestic flights despite record spike in new cases. Domestic flights will resume across India on Monday, the federal civil aviation minister has said, despite a 24-hour record increase in new cases on Sunday. The announcement follows a day of “hard negotiations”, the minister said, after some states sought to limit the number of flights. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Canada has risen to 84,081 from 82,892. There have been 103 more deaths, bringing the country’s toll up to 6,380. German authorities are trying to trace the people who attended a church service in Frankfurt after 107 tested positive for the coronavirus. The service took place at a Baptist church on 10 May, and it is not clear whether all the 107 attended the service, or whether the figure includes those who were infected by those who did. China’s top diplomat Wang Yi has said the US should stop wasting time in its fight against the coronavirus and work with China to combat it, instead of smearing the country. State councillor Wang’s comments came as he expressed his sympathy to the US for the pandemic, where the death toll is approaching 100,000. Thousands of pro-democracy protesters assembled in Hong Kong against a controversial security law proposed by China, defying a coronavirus measure banning gatherings of more than eight people. The planned legislation is expected to ban treason, subversion and sedition, and the clashes between police and demonstrators were the most intense seen in months. Italy has recorded 50 new deaths – but worst-hit Lombardy’s figures are missing due to late reporting. The number of new infections rose by 531, down from 669 on Saturday. There have been 32, 785 deaths and 140,479 people have recovered."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/sep/24/labour-wants-green-energy-to-power-most-uk-homes-by-2030-greenhouse-gas-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-09-24T21:00:04Z","webTitle":"Labour wants green energy to power most UK homes by 2030","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/24/labour-wants-green-energy-to-power-most-uk-homes-by-2030-greenhouse-gas-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/sep/24/labour-wants-green-energy-to-power-most-uk-homes-by-2030-greenhouse-gas-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Labour wants green energy to power most UK homes by 2030","bodyText":"Almost all of Britain’s homes and businesses would be powered by wind, solar and nuclear power by 2030, under bold new green energy plans being outlined by Labour. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, will declare on Tuesday that the party is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the middle of the century. The UK’s current goal is an 80% cut by 2050. Such a move would put the UK ahead of the EU and signal that it intends to be a strong international climate leader post-Brexit. It would also leapfrog Labour ahead of the Conservatives on climate-change action. The government is shortly expected to instruct its climate advisers to explore what a tougher global-warming goal means for the UK’s domestic carbon targets but has not yet pledged to hit zero emissions. Long-Bailey, who is seen by some as a potential future leader, will also outline a series of new proposals on energy to meet the long-term carbon goal. Experts said they were far more ambitious than the party’s current policy. The plan envisages 85% of electricity coming from renewable and low-carbon sources by 2030, a dramatic increase on the 50% they provide today. That would involve a sevenfold increase in offshore windfarms and a tripling of solar power, enabling nearly 20m homes to be powered by wind and solar. The party would also “remove the barriers” the Conservatives put in place for onshore windfarms. Labour would like to see doubling of onshore windfarms by 2030. Long-Bailey said: “The potential benefits of transitioning to a sustainable economy are enormous and we want to make sure these are shared by everyone … the Tories are not up to the job of dealing with the existential threat posed by climate change.” Beyond electricity, the party is also grappling with how to keep the UK warm without burning fossil fuels. Around 85% of the country uses gas for heating, with most of the rest coming from oil and a tiny proportion from renewable sources such as heat pumps and biomass. Labour is mulling a goal of providing 44% of heat from renewable sources by 2030 and reducing heat demand from buildings by almost a quarter. The party is expected to officially adopt the energy goals later this year. Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said: “These proposals are envisaging a much more ambitious approach than current policy. With respect to renewable electricity, particularly wind, the ambitions look achievable by 2030.” Industry sources told the Guardian that the proposals for more green electricity were ambitious but could be met provided there was a rethink on onshore windfarms, which are currently ineligible for subsidies. However, Watson said that meeting the targets on low-carbon heat would be more difficult and “a tall order”. Greenpeace said the adoption of a net-zero emissions goal for 2050 was “truly transformative”. Friends of the Earth said the energy proposals could help the UK seize the potential of “huge innovations happening in renewable energy technology.” Labour said it had created a working group with unions to “ensure workers are protected” as the energy industry shifts from fossil-fuel power stations to a renewable future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2019/feb/18/paul-flynn-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-18T17:48:15Z","webTitle":"Paul Flynn obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/18/paul-flynn-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2019/feb/18/paul-flynn-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Paul Flynn obituary","bodyText":"In many respects the Labour MP Paul Flynn, who has died aged 84 after nearly 32 years in the House of Commons, was the quintessential backbencher of his generation. He was an admirably energetic constituency MP, a tireless campaigner on a vast range of issues and fearless in the face of authority. It was thus a measure of his success that he was as much an irritant to his own party in government as he was to the Conservative frontbench, and that this was indubitably countered by the personal affection he generated among his Newport electorate. Born in Grangetown, Cardiff, and raised with his brother, Michael, by their widowed mother, Kathleen (nee Williams), he experienced the heady days of the post second world war Attlee government. As a 10-year-old lad, he cheered the election of James Callaghan as the local Labour MP in 1945 and recalled hearing Aneurin Bevan speak in the city in 1948, as the minister of health, establishing the new NHS. It was a topic of close family interest. His Irish father, James Flynn, had gone to the trenches of Belgium as a teenager in the first world war and had been shot and subsequently captured as a prisoner of war. He survived and returned home to work as a postman, but the family finances were defined by means-testing and doctors’ bills before his early death in 1940. Paul was raised as a Roman Catholic by his Welsh mother, and won a place at St Illtyd’s college, Cardiff, which was then a Roman Catholic boys’ grammar school. He qualified as an industrial chemist at University College, Cardiff, and in 1955 began work in the steel industry, first in the docks area of Cardiff, where he suffered serious hearing loss working in a nail factory, and subsequently at Llanwern, in Newport. In 1983 he was made redundant, and after a brief period in broadcasting started work the following year as a researcher for the MEP Llewellyn Smith. His election to Westminster as MP for Newport West came in 1987. He had joined the Labour party in 1956 and was elected as a member of Newport borough council (1972-81) and of Gwent county council (1974-82). He fought the second general election in 1974 in the safe Conservative seat of Denbigh. In the Commons Flynn’s brief experience of the frontbench came at the very beginning and end of his career. Neil Kinnock made him a junior spokesman for Wales shortly after his arrival in the house, aged 52. In 1988 he was moved to social security for two years, but then began his long sojourn on the backbenches, where he rejoiced in being described by the Guardian’s Simon Hoggart as “the thinking man’s Dennis Skinner”, a soubriquet he felt was suitable for his epitaph. Few could have been more surprised than he when, aged 81 in 2016, he was appointed by Jeremy Corbyn as shadow leader of the house and then also shadow Welsh secretary. They were temporary posts after a wave of frontbench resignations had hit the Corbyn leadership, and while Flynn spoke approvingly of his leader’s job creation for older people he found himself retired once more after three months to a less prominent parliamentary role. It was never one of obscurity. Flynn had strong opinions on most things and a vivid vocabulary with which to articulate his views. He had the eloquence of his Welsh and Irish forebears, which he could exhibit in both his native English and the fluent Welsh he learned in his teenage years. He could also do an unintelligible, but apparently accurate, rendition of Chaucerian English. A passionate advocacy of the use of the Welsh language was one of his lifelong concerns and he was a member of the Gorsedd of the Bards. Other topics with which he was very much involved included the medicinal use of cannabis, for which he started campaigning in 1999, and the dangers of overdosing from the use of paracetamol. He was opposed to nuclear power and nuclear weapons, and a strident critic of the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. On one occasion in 2009 he recited to the Commons a list of the 176 names of the UK military personnel who had been killed serving in Iraq. He was suspended in 2012 for accusing the Defence ministerial team, then headed by Philip Hammond, of lying about Afghanistan. He was a republican who, in 1996, proposed a private member’s bill for a referendum to abolish the monarchy. He believed in an elected second chamber and opposed the honours system. Other concerns included mis-selling of pensions, public corruption, ferry safety, daylight saving for road safety and the use of bull bars on cars, which he opposed. He was always near the top of any list of diligent parliamentary questioning, topping it in 1991 with a total of 928 parliamentary questions, costing an estimated £46,000 to answer. He won an award for campaigning for freedom of information that year and in 1996 was named the Spectator’s Backbencher of the Year. He was a member of the select committee on Welsh affairs and on transport, and was a delegate to the Council of Europe and the Western European Union. He was a passionate European, regarding Brexit as “the biggest political disaster of my lifetime”, and was not afraid to say so although his constituency voted 56–44 % in favour of leaving Europe. Before election to parliament he was a member of the Broadcasting Council for Wales (1975-80), the South Wales Docks Board (197680) and the National Museum of Wales (1978-82). Flynn suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, which was first diagnosed when he was nine years old. Although he recovered from a mini-stroke in 2007, his health had recently deteriorated with the onset of pernicious anaemia and he announced in October that while he wanted to go on being an MP “for ever”, he would stand down as soon as possible. He was a highly competent user of all forms of digital technology, having won awards for his MP’s website, and continued to work from his bed. He published a number of books about politics, including a guide to being a backbencher (1997), updated as How to Be an MP (2012). It includes the somewhat cynical advice for aspirant ministers: “Cultivate the virtues of dullness and safety. Be attuned to the nation’s lowest common denominator of conscience, idealism and cowardice. At all costs avoid any appearance of humour, originality or interest in your speeches.” It was advice he, of course, ignored himself. In 1962 he married Anne Harvey and they had a son, James, and daughter, Rachel, the latter of whom predeceased him in 1979. He and Anne divorced in 1984, and the following year he married Samantha Morgan (nee Cumpstone). She survives him, as do James, a stepson and a stepdaughter. • Paul Phillip Flynn, politician, born 9 February 1935; died 17 February 2019"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/mar/17/russia-ukraine-war-latest-kremlin-anger-after-biden-calls-putin-a-war-criminal-us-to-send-more-military-aid-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-18T04:48:33Z","webTitle":"Canada will offer fleeing Ukrainians temporary residence – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/17/russia-ukraine-war-latest-kremlin-anger-after-biden-calls-putin-a-war-criminal-us-to-send-more-military-aid-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/mar/17/russia-ukraine-war-latest-kremlin-anger-after-biden-calls-putin-a-war-criminal-us-to-send-more-military-aid-live","fields":{"headline":"Canada will offer fleeing Ukrainians temporary residence – as it happened","bodyText":"This blog is now closed. Please follow our live coverage here: Russia’s war on Ukraine has now entered its third week. Here is a recap of where the crisis currently stands: US president Joe Biden labelled Vladimir Putin “a murderous dictator,” and “a pure thug” during an address for St Patrick’s day. Biden will speak with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at 9am Eastern time (1300 GMT) on Friday to discuss Russia’s war against Ukraine “and other issues of mutual concern” the White House said. Meanwhile, a Chinese foreign ministry official met with Russia’s ambassador to China on Thursday to exchange views on bilateral relations, the Chinese foreign ministry said. The World Health Organization said it has so far verified 43 attacks on health care, with 12 people killed and 34 injured, including health workers in Ukraine. The agency said the war is having “devastating consequences for the health of Ukraine’s people; consequences that will reverberate for years or decades to come” during remarks made at the United Nations security council meeting on Thursday. Russia is being forced to divert “large numbers” of troops to defend its supply lines rather than continuing its attacks in Ukraine, British defence intelligence analysts believe. The UK Ministry of Defence’s latest intelligence report says logistical problems continue to beset Russia’s troops. The Ukrainian military claims Russia is taking up measures to “make up for the loss of personnel at the expense of foreigners” while preparing for a possible attack on Kyiv. A Russian editor who protested against Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine during a state TV news broadcast says she is quitting her job but not accepting France’s asylum offer, calling herself “a patriot”. More than 320,000 Ukrainian citizens have returned to help their country fight since Russia began its invasion, according to the state border guard service of Ukraine. Canada will offer Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion a temporary Canadian residence permit for up to three years. The Australian government has imposed sanctions on two Russian oligarchs who have assets in the country as well as placing sanctions on Russia’s finance ministry and 11 additional banks and government organisations. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest address: “The occupants thought they were going to Ukraine which they had seen before, in 2014-2015, which they corrupted and were not afraid of, but we are different now.” About 130 people have been rescued so far from the basement of a theatre hit by a Russian airstrike in the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, officials said. Hundreds of people were hiding beneath the theatre, which was designated as a shelter for displaced civilians, when it was struck on Wednesday. Meanwhile, about 30,000 civilians have fled Mariupol city so far, local authorities said. Mariupol’s city hall said that “80% of residential housing was destroyed” and about 350,000 residents were hiding in shelters and basements in Mariupol. More than 20 people were killed and 25 injured when a Russian airstrike destroyed a school and community centre in Merefa, close to the north-east Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, on Thursday local officials said. The mayor of the besieged Ukrainian city of Melitopol, who was allegedly abducted by Russian forces, was freed in exchange for nine captured Russian conscripts, according to the head of Ukraine’s presidential office. Russia says it will raise allegations that the United States has biological warfare laboratories in Ukraine during Friday’s UN security council meeting, claims that Washington says are disinformation and part of a potential “false-flag operation” by Moscow. Lawyers are drafting a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow but a breakthrough depends on the Kremlin accepting a ceasefire, Ukraine’s defence minister said. Here is a sweet snap amid the chaos of war shared by the armed forces of Ukraine. In it, a Ukrainian serviceman plays the violin to his fellow soldiers as the Ukrainian flag hangs in the background. US president Joe Biden labelled Vladimir Putin “a murderous dictator,” and “a pure thug” during an address for St Patrick’s day. Biden said Putin was paying the price for his aggression, while detailing his planned call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The call comes at western countries look to put pressure on China not to support Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. View the footage of his remarks in the video below. More photos of civilians fleeing Ukraine via train provide a powerful snapshot of the refugee crisis. The Ukrainian military has released its daily operational report as of 10pm local time, claiming Russia is taking up measures to “make up for the loss of personnel at the expense of foreigners” while preparing for a possible attack on Kyiv. “According to available information, the Russian occupiers have already picked up 1,000 volunteers from the so-called army of Bashar al-Assad and Hezbollah,” the ministry of defence said, adding that the main requirement for foreign fighters is the experience of fighting in the city. Officials said they believe the main efforts Russian forces are focused on are maintaining the previously occupied borders and carrying out measures to prepare for a possible attack on Kyiv. However, the losses inflicted on Russian personnel, low morale and psychological condition of privates and sergeants, as well as the lack of experienced commanders of tactical units make it impossible to resume offensive operations in the near future, the report adds. Russian forces continue to partially blockade the city of Chernihiv and carry out artillery shelling of the city while attempting to replenish stocks of ammunition and fuel in order to resume offensive operations on the cities of Sumy and Kharkiv. Troops are also encircling of Mariupol, the Ukrainian military adds. US President Joe Biden will speak with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at 9am Eastern time (1300 GMT) on Friday, the White House said. “This is part of ongoing efforts to maintain open lines of communication between the United States and the (People’s Republic of China),” according to the statement. “The two leaders will discuss managing the competition between the two countries as well as Russia’s war against Ukraine and other issues of mutual concern.” Canada will offer Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion a temporary Canadian residence permit for up to three years. Canada, which has a large Ukrainian diaspora, especially in the centre and west of the country, said in a statement that “Ukrainians and their immediate family members of any nationality may stay in Canada as temporary residents for up to three years.” Applicants are required to apply online and provide their biometric data in the form of fingerprints and a photo, according to Agence France-Presse. Ukrainian refugees can simultaneously apply for a work and study permit. Ukrainians and their families already settled on Canadian soil will also benefit from the new measures and can “extend their visitor status or work permit for 3 years, apply for a new work or study permit, or extend their existing permit.” An NGO in New York had hundreds of bulletproof vests stolen after they were donated by officers and destined for Ukraine as it battles a Russian invasion, police and the organisation has said. Security-camera footage from a next-door business showed three vans pulling up outside the building, one after another, with men in hoods carrying out boxes believed to be containing the vests and loading them into the vehicles, then driving away, WNBC-TV of New York City reported. The vests were intended to be sent to medical workers and humanitarian aid volunteers in Ukraine, the station reported. “It is despicable that someone would break into a building to steal supplies and materials intended to aid those affected by this humanitarian crisis,” Vicki DiStefano, a spokeswoman for the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office, which made a large donation of vests last week, told the outlet. A Russian editor who protested against Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine during a state TV news broadcast says she is quitting her job but not accepting France’s asylum offer, calling herself “a patriot”. Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at Channel One television, barged onto the set of its flagship Vremya evening news on Monday, shouting: “Stop the war. No to war.” he held a sign saying: “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” It was signed in English: “Russians against the war.” She was detained and a Moscow court rapidly fined her 30,000 rubles (£220). But despite being freed she could face further prosecution, risking years in prison under draconian new laws. She told France 24 television from Moscow on Thursday that she had “handed in all the documents” for her resignation from Channel One. “It’s a legal procedure,” she said. The World Health Organization has said the war in Ukraine is having “devastating consequences for the health of Ukraine’s people; consequences that will reverberate for years or decades to come” during remarks made at the United Nations security council meeting on Thursday. The WHO said they have so far verified 43 attacks on health care, with 12 people killed and 34 injured, including health workers. World Health Organization director-general Tedros Ghebreyesus said: WHO has verified 43 attacks on health care, with 12 people killed and 34 injured, including health workers. In any conflict, attacks on health care are a violation of international humanitarian law.” The disruption to services and supplies in Ukraine is posing an extreme risk to people with cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV and TB, which are among the leading causes of mortality in Ukraine, Ghebreyesus added. Services for mental health and psychosocial support are also urgently needed to help those in Ukraine cope with the effects of the war. “There are more than 35,000 mental health patients in Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals and long-term care facilities, which are facing severe shortages of medicines, food, heating, blankets and more,” the director-general said. The agency said have sent about 100 metric tonnes of medical supplies to Ukraine, including oxygen, insulin, surgical supplies, anaesthetics, and blood transfusion kits – enough for 4,500 trauma patients and 450,000 primary health care patients, for one month. “We have now established supply lines from our warehouse in Lviv to many cities of Ukraine, but challenges with access remain. We need unfettered access,” WHO said, adding that critical supplies ready for UN joint convoys are ready to enter difficult areas, but so far have not been successful. A UN convoy to Sumy that included a WHO truck carrying critical medical supplies was unable to enter on Thursday and loads ready for Mariupol remain in staging areas and cannot proceed. Here is where Russian forces currently stand as its troops continue in their invasion of Ukraine. On the first day of the invasion Russian forces arrived at the towns just north-west of Kyiv but since then they have become bogged down, failing to progress from Irpin and Bucha just outside the capital. Progress has also been stymied on the east side of the city, and western officials are beginning to question if Russia wants to fight its way through. Russian forces have also made significant gains in the south of the country, are already enforcing a naval blockade from the Black Sea, and, according to two analysts at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, are beginning to threaten Ukraine’s principal regular army formation, the Joint Forces Operation (JFO), which faces the Donbas region in the east. Three current and former members of the Tennessee national guard, who were falsely identified in a Russian media report as mercenaries killed in Ukraine, are in fact alive and well, the Tennessee national guard said on Thursday. Joe Biden ordered the withdrawal of US troops from Ukraine prior to Russia’s invasion of the country as part of a broader effort to avoid a direct confrontation with the nuclear-armed adversary. But the report published in Russia’s Pravda newspaper identified the Americans by name and gave military ranks for each of them, citing information from pro-Russian militia in Ukraine’s Donetsk. The report even offered an intricate explanation for how the three were identified, using items from a backpack “near the remains of one of the militants” – including a Tennessee state flag. “The Tennessee guard is aware of the fake news coming out of Russia,” said Tracy O’Grady, a spokesperson for the larger US National Guard. The Tennessee guard said in a statement: “They are accounted for, safe – and not, as the article headline erroneously states, US mercenaries killed in Donetsk People’s Republic.” A Chinese foreign ministry official met with Russia’s ambassador to China on Thursday 17 March to exchange views on bilateral relations, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday, Reuters is reporting. Cheng Guoping, commissioner for foreign affairs and aecurity affairs at China’s foreign ministry, met with Andrey Denisov of Russia and exchanged views on bilateral counter-terrorism and security cooperation, according to the statement. More than 320,000 Ukrainian citizens have returned to help their country fight since Russia began its invasion, according to the state border guard service of Ukraine. The agency made the announcement in a tweet on Thursday: More than 320,000 Ukrainian citizens, the vast majority of whom are men, have returned home since the beginning of Russia’s open armed aggression against Ukraine. Our guys do not give up, so we need to help, we need to fight for our country. Ukraine must be free, like all people.” A major fire broke out at a large street market in Kharkiv after Russian missiles hit new targets in the Ukrainian city earlier on Thursday. No casualties were reported. The market has been closed since the beginning of Russian’s invasion. The shelling comes as Russia continues to hit the eastern Ukrainian city with heavy bombardment and artillery fire. Video of the blaze can be viewed below. The Australian government has imposed sanctions on two Russian oligarchs who have assets in the country, after facing questions about why they were omitted from an earlier round of economic measures triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Oleg Deripaska, who has a stake in an alumina refinery in Gladstone, Queensland, run by Rio Tinto, and Viktor Vekselberg, who has an interest in a gas project in the Beetaloo basin in the Northern Territory, were not among 41 oligarchs and family members hit with sanctions by Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Monday. The head of Ukraine’s embassy in Canberra, Volodymyr Shalkivskiy, said on Wednesday: “We hope that those Russian oligarchs will be included in the next round of sanctions.” Australia also placed sanctions on Russia’s finance ministry and 11 additional banks and government organisations, covering the majority of the country’s banking assets along with all entities that handle Russia’s sovereign debt. “With our recent inclusion of the Central Bank of Russia, Australia has now targeted all Russian government entities responsible for issuing and managing Russia’s sovereign debt,” minister for foreign affairs Marise Payne said in a statement. Wrapping up his national address, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy cautioned Russian troops by drawing a comparison to hostilities back in 2014. The occupants thought they were going to Ukraine which they had seen before, in 2014-2015, which they corrupted and were not afraid of. But we are different now. And it allows us to defend ourselves against a full-scale attack for 22 days. [It is] everything we have done over several years for our defence, for our tactics that can’t be revealed while the war is ongoing.” Zelenskiy declined to reveal Ukraine’s negotiations tactics, adding he believes “it is better to work in silence rather than on television, radio or Facebook.” Zelenskiy also made a direct appeal to Germany. Today I addressed the parliament of Germany, one of the most influential countries in the world, in Europe, one of the natural leaders on the European continent. I spoke not only as the president but as a Ukrainian, as a citizen, as a European, as someone who has felt for many years that the German state is as if behind a wall from us, an invisible but a strong wall. We saw how, for decades, Germany fought for its economy, for new Russian gas pipelines and old European dreams. Dreams of some cooperation that Russia doesn’t take seriously for a long time.” The Ukrainian president said he believed the views of Germans are changing. We see that Germany is looking for a new way. We see how sincerely the majority of Germans support the review of the old policy. We see that Chancellor Olaf Scholz has a big chance and a big mission to grant Germany renewed leadership. Grant Europe peace. Long-lasting and, most importantly, an honest one.” Zelenskiy said he felt Ukraine is now “understood better” after speaking with French President Emmanuel Macron, US President Joe Biden and the German parliament. I feel that we are being understood better. In Europe, in the world, in different countries. And it gives us more and more support. The one we have been asking for.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has delivered another emphatic late-night national address, speaking to Russians directly and confirming that Ukraine continues to hold all the key areas under Russian attack. Referring to claims Russia has recruited foreign fighters to aid in its invasion of Ukraine, Zelenskiy said: We’ve got information that the Russian military is recruiting mercenaries from other countries and trying to deceive as many young people as possible into military service.” He added: More Russian conscripts have been taken prisoner of war. Among them, there are those who refuse to return to Russia. There are many who are not even talked about in Russia, who are not being taken back. Families of some soldiers have received death notices, although they are in captivity and alive.” Issuing a warning to those who may join Russian troops, Zelenskiy said: “It will be the worst decision of your life. Long life is better than the money that they offer for a short one.” Addressing Russian directly, Zelenskiy added: Every mother who knows that her son was sent to war against Ukraine has to check where her son is. Particularly, those who can’t get in touch with their children, who were told their children died but didn’t receive their bodies. There are phone numbers on the internet that you can call and find out what is happening with your children. We didn’t plan to take thousands of captives. We don’t need 13,000 or more dead Russian soldiers. We didn’t want this war. We only want peace. And we want you to love your children more than you are afraid of your government.” (Translation provided by Bermet Talant) The exodus of refugees fleeing Ukraine continues, with most seeking refuge in neighbouring Poland. According to UN estimates, more than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February. While tens of thousands of people continue to flee the country each day, a small but growing number are heading in the other direction. At first they were foreign volunteers, Ukrainian expatriate men heading to fight and people delivering aid. But increasingly, women are also heading back. Russia has said it will not ask the UN security council to vote on Friday on its draft resolution on humanitarian relief for Ukraine, the Associated Press reports. It will instead use the scheduled council session to again raise allegations that the United States has biological warfare laboratories in Ukraine, claims that Washington says are disinformation and part of a potential “false-flag operation” by Moscow. Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, made the announcement at a security council meeting on Thursday afternoon that was called by six western countries, including the United States. He said Russia is not withdrawing the resolution but decided not to seek a vote at this time because of what he called “unprecedented pressure” from western nations, especially the United States and Albania, on UN member states to oppose the measure. Russia is being forced to divert “large numbers” of troops to defend its supply lines rather than continuing its attacks in Ukraine, British defence intelligence analysts believe. The UK ministry of defence recently released its latest intelligence report, saying that logistical problems continue to beset Russia’s faltering invasion of Ukraine. UK defence attache AVM Mick Smeath said: Logistical problems continue to beset Russia’s faltering invasion of Ukraine. Reluctance to manoeuvre cross-country, lack of control of the air and limited bridging capabilities are preventing Russia from effectively resupplying their forward troops with even basic essentials such as food and fuel. Incessant Ukrainian counterattacks are forcing Russia to divert large number of troops to defend their own supply lines. This is severely limiting Russia’s offensive potential.” Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you back on the blog. Some intriguing news is being reported by the BBC’s world affairs editor, John Simpson. According to Simpson, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss negotiations with Ukraine. Putin’s demands include an acceptance by Ukraine that it should be neutral in future, and that it shouldn’t become a member of the western military alliance, Nato. Other demands Putin is making include a “denazification clause” and undertakings to protect the Russian language, according to Erdogan’s chief adviser Ibrahim Kalin. However, Putin is also demanding parts of eastern Ukraine and acceptance from Zelenskiy that Crimea be a permanent part of Russia. According to Putin, this can only be sorted out face-to-face with his Ukrainian opponent. It is 1:30am in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: About 130 people have been rescued so far from the basement of a theatre hit by a Russian airstrike in the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, officials said. Hundreds of people were hiding beneath the theatre, which was designated as a shelter for displaced civilians, when it was struck on Wednesday. Serhiy Taruta, a former governor of the Donetsk region, said rescue efforts had been hindered by the complete breakdown of social services and fear of future Russian attacks in the city. About 30,000 civilians have fled Mariupol city so far, local authorities said. Mariupol’s city hall said “80% of residential housing was destroyed” and about 350,000 residents were hiding in shelters and basements in Mariupol. In addition to the bombing of its theatre, the city hall said a swimming pool sheltering civilians, “mostly women, children and the elderly”, had also been shelled. More than 20 people were killed and 25 injured when a Russian airstrike destroyed a school and community centre in Merefa, close to the north-east Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, local officials said. The attack took place at 3.30am local time (1.30am GMT) on Thursday morning, the Kharkiv prosecutor’s office said. Ten people were in critical condition, it said. The US state department confirmed that a US citizen died in Ukraine today, after local reports that an American was killed during Russian shelling in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv. Earlier today, Chernihiv regional police said authorities were “documenting the aftermath of enemy shelling of civilians in central Chernihiv” that left more than 50 people dead. The US has anecdotal signs of flagging Russian troop morale in some units in Ukraine, a senior US defence official said, without citing evidence. The US has also observed that the Russian military is are moving some forces “from the rear to join their advancing elements” and “some of those capabilities are artillery, long-range artillery”, suggesting they “continue to want to conduct a siege of Kyiv”. The mayor of the besieged Ukrainian city of Melitopol, who was allegedly abducted by Russian forces, was freed in exchange for nine captured Russian conscripts, according to the head of Ukraine’s presidential office. Ukraine had accused Russia of kidnapping Ivan Fedorov last Friday, with surveillance footage appearing to show him being marched across a square in the city centre, apparently surrounded by Russian soldiers. Lawyers are drafting a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow but a breakthrough depends on the Kremlin accepting a ceasefire, Ukraine’s defence minister has said. Oleksii Reznikov, who has been leading the Ukrainian delegation in the negotiations, said technical work was progressing but that Russia had to stop its shelling for any compromise to be possible. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said “we have stronger hopes for a ceasefire” after meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, in Lviv. The meeting follows Çavuşoğlu’s visit to Moscow yesterday, where he declared: “We have not lost our belief in diplomacy.” But western officials have warned there remains a “very big gap” between Ukraine and Russia in peace talks between the two countries. Reuters quotes an unnamed official as saying that both sides are taking peace talks seriously but that there was little sign of an imminent breakthrough. Volodymyr Zelenskiy invoked the fall of the Berlin Wall in an attempt to persuade German MPs to do everything possible to halt Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Speaking to the German parliament via video, the Ukrainian president upbraided Germany for having persisted in the past in its insistence that the gas pipelines Nord Stream 1 and 2 and other business projects with Russia were “purely economic” and not political. The US president, Joe Biden, will speak with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on Friday to discuss Russia’s war against Ukraine “and other issues of mutual concern”, the White House said. Earlier, a Chinese official criticised the Nato secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, for his comments that China had an obligation as a member of the UN security council to help bring an end to the war in Ukraine. A Russian court has extended the arrest of the US basketball star Brittney Griner for at least two more months, according to the Russian state news agency Tass. Griner, a two-time Olympic champion, has been detained by Russian customs authorities, who claim they discovered vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage at an airport near Moscow. Uzbekistan’s foreign minister has called for a diplomatic resolution of the conflict in Ukraine and said it would not recognise Moscow-backed separatists in the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk, Reuters reports. Abdulaziz Kamilov’s remarks signalled the strongest anti-war statement to come from Russia’s former Soviet allies so far. – Léonie Chao-Fong Vladimir Putin can be expected to threaten the use of nuclear weapons as the war drags on, according to the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency. Bloomberg reports: “Protracted occupation of parts of Ukrainian territory threatens to sap Russian military manpower and reduce their modernized weapons arsenal, while consequent economic sanctions will probably throw Russia into prolonged economic depression and diplomatic isolation,” Lieutenant General Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said in its new 67-page summary of worldwide threats. The combination of Ukraine’s defiance and economic sanctions will threaten Russia’s “ability to produce modern precision-guided munitions,” Berrier said in testimony submitted to the House Armed Services Committee for a hearing on Thursday. Here’s the latest UK Defence Intelligence update: “Logistical problems continue to beset Russia’s faltering invasion of Ukraine,” the update says. From Reuters: The UN Security Council will no longer vote on Friday on a Russian-drafted call for aid access and civilian protection in Ukraine as Russia’s UN envoy accused Western countries of a campaign of “unprecedented pressure” against the measure. Diplomats said the Russian move would have failed with most of the 15-member council likely to abstain from a vote on the draft resolution because it did not address accountability or acknowledge Russia’s invasion of its neighbor nor did it push for an end to the fighting or a withdrawal of Russian troops. “Many colleagues from many delegations tell us about unprecedented pressure by Western partners, that their arms are being twisted, including blackmail and threats,” Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said on Thursday. Speaking at a council meeting on Ukraine’s humanitarian situation, requested by Western council members, Nebenzia said: “We do understand how difficult it is for those countries to withstand this kind of onslaught.” US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told Reuters after the meeting: “The only people who do arm-twisting around here are the Russians and they have to if they want to get anybody to support them.” Nebenzia said that Russia had instead requested the council meet on Friday - when the vote had been scheduled - to discuss “US bio-laboratories in Ukraine using the new documents we obtained in the course of the special military operation.” Reuters reports: Republican senators on Thursday introduced a bill to ban US imports of Russian uranium to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The bill comes as the Biden administration has been weighing sanctions on Russian nuclear power company Rosatom, a major supplier of fuel and technology to power plants around the world. The administration’s ban on US imports of Russian energy, such as oil and liquefied natural gas, does not yet include uranium. “While banning imports of Russian oil, gas and coal is an important step, it cannot be the last,” said Senator John Barrasso, who introduced the bill. Barrasso represents Wyoming, a state that could benefit from a revitalisation in US uranium mining. “Banning Russian uranium imports will further defund Russia’s war machine, help revive American uranium production, and increase our national security,” he added. The US has over 90 nuclear reactors, more than any other country, and is heavily reliant on imported uranium. Russian uranium made up 16% of US purchases in 2020, according to the Energy Information Administration, with Canada and Kazakhstan each providing 22%. Russia also supplies a fuel called highly enriched, low assay uranium (HALEU) which is enriched up to 20% and could be used in advanced nuclear plants expected to be developed later this decade or in the 2030s. The US would likely need to move fast on building bigger domestic capacity to supply HALEU if a ban is enacted. Kathryn Huff, who was nominated by President Joe Biden to be an assistant secretary for nuclear energy and is now a senior official in the US Energy Department, told Barrasso in her nomination hearing on Thursday: “I think it is critically important that we wean ourselves off of unstable, untrustworthy sources of our critical fuels, including uranium.” The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry’s main trade group, supports development of a US uranium industry. An NEI spokesperson said the group was reviewing the bill and assessing “the potential impacts of fuel disruption on the US nuclear fleet”. Many environmental groups and tribes have opposed expanding the industry on lands in the US west. When Jay got a phone call last week, the details were vague. “I was asked if I could come to Poland. All I was told was it involved helping evacuate Ukrainian children,” said the Canadian military veteran, who declined to give his full name because he hopes to carry out more rescue missions. “I didn’t have to think about it. Forty-eight hours later, I’m in Krakow.” In Poland, Jay joined other Canadian veterans as part of a high-stakes mission to safely evacuate cancer patients to Canada. On Wednesday, a chartered plane carrying two children and their families touched down in Toronto, successfully capping a multi-day rescue effort, at times marred by bureaucracy and bad luck. Toronto’s Sick Kids, the world-leading paediatric hospital, will treat the children for their cancers and says it’s prepared to take as many as 15 children and has contacted other hospitals across the country. But the journey of those two children and their families highlights the complexity of such missions. “We’ve really been upside down and backwards in the last 10 days. It’s been an emotional rollercoaster because at times, we thought this whole thing wasn’t going to happen,” said Brian Macdonald, a military veteran and executive director of the aid group Aman Lara. The efforts began in earnest last week after Macdonald saw jarring images of hospitals being bombed by Russian forces. Read more: As further news developments continue on Ukraine, with desperate scenes on the ground and heated talk at the United Nations Security Council in New York, we welcome our readers to stay tuned. The Guardian’s global, round-the-clock live blog covering the crisis in Ukraine now passes from the US east coast to the US west coast, where my colleague Maanvi Singh will keep you updated on the news emerging over the next few hours. Talk continues of atrocities in Ukraine, war crimes investigations against Russia and Vladimir Putin, as US leaders step up their rhetoric on that subject, and the prospect of more top-level NATO meetings in Europe in the coming days. United Nations undersecretary-general Rosemary DiCarlo has told the security council in New York of the UN human rights office’s latest estimated statistics on those killed and wounded in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, the Associated Press reports. The total of Ukraine civilian victims dead and wounded in Ukraine was given as: 1,900 civilian casualties from the start of the war on 24 February to 15 March, comprising 726 people killed, including 52 children, and 1,174 injured, with the actual number likely much higher. “Most of these casualties were caused by the use in populated areas of explosive weapons with a wide impact area,” DiCarlo said. The UN development agency, UNDP, projects that if the war continues, 90% of Ukraine’s population could be facing poverty and extreme economic vulnerability, “setting the country and the region back decades, and leaving deep social and economic scars,” she said. Meanwhile, more than three million people have fled Ukraine following the invasion. More than half have gone to Poland. Most of the rest are in the surrounding countries of eastern Europe, according to the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi. The United Nations political chief is calling for an investigation of massive civilian casualties in Ukraine and the destruction of hundreds of residential buildings, schools, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure, and for those responsible to be held accountable, the Associated Press reports. UN undersecretary-general Rosemary DiCarlo told the United Nations security council meeting in New York on Thursday that “international humanitarian law is crystal clear” in prohibiting direct attacks on civilians in military operations, and ensuring their protection. Yet, she said, many of the daily attacks that are battering Ukrainian cities “are reportedly indiscriminate, resulting in civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure”. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, tweeted that “Ukraine will never be a victory for Putin” no matter what. Thomas-Greenfield also said that Russia would be “held accountable for its atrocities” such as the bombardment of the theatre in Mariupol, where hundreds were taking shelter from the war and where the word “children” had been written outside prominently, in Russian. Thomas-Greenfield was picked by US president Joe Biden as his ambassador to the UN after he beat Donald Trump in the 2020 US presidential election. US president Joe Biden is due to speak with Chinese president Xi Jinping on Friday for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine more than three weeks ago. The White House signalled that Biden will warn Xi Jinping against bolstering his ally Vladimir Putin in his war mission. The two leaders will talk as Washington warned China was considering military support for Russia’s war, a step that would dramatically widen the gulf between Beijing and Western governments, Reuters writes. The news agency further reports: The call, first announced by the White House on Thursday, comes at a pivotal moment in US-China relations - and in Ukraine, where heavily outnumbered local forces have prevented Moscow from capturing any of the country’s biggest cities so far. The Biden administration has issued public and private warnings that Beijing would face dire consequences if it provides material support to Russian president Vladimir Putin’s war. “President Biden will be speaking to President Xi tomorrow and will make clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia’s aggression, and we will not hesitate to impose costs,” US secretary of state Antony Blinken told a news briefing in Washington. Blinken said China had a responsibility to use its influence with Putin and to defend international rules, but that it appeared Beijing was “moving in the opposite direction”. “We’re concerned that they’re considering directly assisting Russia with military equipment to use in Ukraine,” he said, officially confirming for the first time reports earlier in the week that US officials believed China had signalled its willingness to provide Moscow with such support. Blinken did not elaborate on what the costs might be to China, and Washington has not yet offered evidence of the claim that China has signalled a willingness to help Russia. Moscow has denied asking China for military assistance, and China’s foreign ministry has called the idea “disinformation”. White House press secretary Jen Psaki characterised the call as “an opportunity for President Biden to assess where President Xi stands”. “The fact that China has not denounced what Russia is doing, absence of denunciation by China of what Russia is doing in and of itself speaks volumes,” Psaki said. China’s official Xinhua news agency said the call would happen in the evening Beijing time. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, has said Joe Biden’s administration has seen “no evidence” that Russia is de-escalating its aggression in Ukraine. The US House of Representatives has voted overwhelmingly in favour of suspending normal trading relations with Russia, taking the rare move to strip it of so-called “most favoured nation” status. This is a move to back up with legislation what Biden announced last week he wanted to happen and the appropriate steps were being taken to do this. Meanwhile, Psaki addressed Biden’s scheduled call with Chinese president Xi Jinping on Friday, their first since Russia invaded Ukraine just over three weeks ago, and said the fact Russia is asking for military help from China “is a clear sign that this war is not going how President Putin planned for it to go”. United States leaders have stepped up their rhetoric against Russia, with the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, saying he agreed with what Joe Biden said yesterday accusing Vladimir Putin of war crimes. “Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime. I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise,” Blinken said, speaking at the State Department in Washington DC. He cited Russian aerial bombardments of, among numerous civilian targets, a hospital, people waiting in a bread line, and the latest atrocity where rescuers are continuing to try to help people get out of the ruins of a theatre in Mariupol, where hundreds had been sheltering. Blinken said such aggressions “join a long line of attacks on civilian locations in Ukraine”, echoing past merciless killings perpetrated by Russian forces in Grozny, Chechnya, and Aleppo, Syria, where “the goal is breaking the will of the people”. Yesterday, Biden said he thought the Russian president was a war criminal. “Personally, I agree with him,” Blinken said. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said earlier on a trip to Slovakia to meet fellow Nato member ministers that Russia’s actions were being investigated within the frame of suspected war crimes. At a St Patrick’s Day event in Washington today, Biden called Putin a “murderous dictator” and a “pure thug”. It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: About 130 people have been rescued so far from the basement of a theatre hit by a Russian airstrike in the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, officials said. Hundreds of people were hiding beneath the theatre, which was designated as a shelter for displaced civilians, when it was struck on Wednesday. Serhiy Taruta, a former governor of the Donetsk region, said rescue efforts had been hindered by the complete breakdown of social services and fear of future Russian attacks in the city. About 30,000 civilians have fled Mariupol city so far, local authorities said. Mariupol’s city hall said “80% of residential housing was destroyed” and about 350,000 residents were hiding in shelters and basements in Mariupol. In addition to the bombing of its theatre, the city hall said a swimming pool sheltering civilians, “mostly women, children and the elderly”, had also been shelled. More than 20 people were killed and 25 injured when a Russian airstrike destroyed a school and community centre in Merefa, close to the north-east Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, local officials said. The attack took place at 3.30am local time (1.30am GMT) on Thursday morning, the Kharkiv prosecutor’s office said. Ten people were in critical condition, it said.

Abdulaziz Kamilov’s remarks signalled the strongest anti-war statement to come from Russia’s former Soviet allies so far. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, as I hand the blog over to my US colleague, Joanna Walters. Goodbye for now. A senior US defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the US has registered anecdotal signs of flagging Russian troop morale in some units in Ukraine. The official told reporters: We certainly have picked up anecdotal indications that morale is not high in some units. The official also used the word “flagging” to describe Russian troop morale in some units, without citing evidence. Some of that is, we believe, a function of poor leadership, lack of information that the troops are getting about their mission and objectives, and I think disillusionment from being resisted [by Ukrainians] as fiercely as they have been. Reuters could not independently confirm the account. The US has also observed that the Russian military is moving some forces “from the rear to join their advancing elements” and “some of those capabilities are artillery, long-range artillery”, a senior US defence official said. The official told reporters that based on these observations, it appeared that Russian forces “continue to want to conduct a siege of Kyiv”. Russia has been accused by the UK, the US, France, Albania, Ireland and Norway of war crimes in Ukraine, as Paris claimed that Vladimir Putin was only pretending to be interested in negotiating a peace deal, Daniel Boffey and Dan Sabbagh report. The six countries challenged Russia before a UN security council meeting as the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said there was now “very, very strong evidence” of war crimes being committed by Russian forces. “Vladimir Putin is behind them,” Truss said. It is ultimately a matter for the international criminal court to decide who is or isn’t a war criminal and for us to bring the evidence. Rescue workers continued this evening to search through the rubble for survivors of a Russian airstrike on a theatre in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol where hundreds of people had been sheltering. Officials said more than 20 people were killed and 25 injured in an airstrike on a school and community centre in Merefa, close to the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, in the early hours of Thursday morning. Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s defence minister, described the pilot who bombed the theatre in Mariupol as a monster. The word “children” had been painted in large Russian script on the ground outside the red-roofed theatre building to warn off fighter jets. The US state department has confirmed that a US citizen died in Ukraine today, after local reports that an American was killed during Russian shelling in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv. A US state department spokesperson did not comment further on the circumstances of the citizen’s death. Earlier today, Chernihiv regional police said authorities were “documenting the aftermath of enemy shelling of civilians in central Chernihiv”. It said in a Facebook post: Today, the invaders once again launched a heavy artillery attack on unarmed civilians. There are dead and wounded people. Among the dead – there is a US citizen. More than 50 people died in the attack in Chernihiv, according to the Ukrainian general prosecutor’s office. Earlier today, the governor of Chernihiv, Viacheslav Chaus, said the city had experienced “colossal losses and destruction” amid relentless bombardment from Russian artillery and airstrikes. Chaus told Ukrainian broadcasters that 53 people had been killed in the city by Russian forces on Wednesday alone, Reuters reported. The Belgian royal family will officially host three Ukrainian refugee families at their royal properties, the Belgian royal palace has confirmed. Three Ukrainian families will be hosted by the Royal Trust, an entity managing the Belgian royal family’s assets, at two properties, in Brussels and Wallonia. An additional property in Tervuren, on the outskirts of Brussels, will also be made available to the municipality for the collective accommodation of Ukrainian refugees. Rescue efforts to find survivors of the Russian bombing of a theatre in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol have been hindered by the complete breakdown of social services in the city, according to the former Donetsk region head, Serhiy Taruta. Speaking in an interview on Ukrainian television, Taruta said he believed 1,300 people were in the building when it was bombed and 130 have so far been rescued. Taruta said: People are doing everything themselves. My friends went to help, but due to constant shelling it was not safe. People are clearing away the rubble themselves. There is no rescue operation, because all the services that are supposed to rescue people, to treat them, to bury them, these services no longer exist. Authorities in Mariupol said it was still not possible to estimate the number of possible casualties from the attack. In an online statement, the city council said: Yesterday and today, despite continuous shelling, rubble is being cleared as much as is possible and people are being rescued. Information about victims is still being clarified. Earlier today, Italy’s culture minister, Dario Franceschini, said the Italian government was ready to rebuild the theatre in Mariupol. “The cabinet ... has approved my proposal to offer Ukraine the resources and means to rebuild it as soon as possible. Theatres of all countries belong to the whole [of] humanity,” Franceschini wrote on Twitter. A two-year-old child has died and four people were wounded in Russian shelling of the Ukrainian village of Novi Petrivtsi, to the north of Kyiv, regional police said. In a statement on Facebook, the police said Russian forces fired heavy artillery at residential houses in the Vyshhorod district. An apartment building was destroyed and neighbouring residential buildings were damaged in the attack, it said. Note: the Guardian has not been able to verify the report. About 30,000 civilians have fled the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, local authorities said. Mariupol’s city hall said on Telegram that “around 30,000 people have left on their transport”, adding that “80% of residential housing was destroyed”, AFP reports. Officials were still “clarifying information on victims” of the Russian shelling of a theatre on Wednesday, it said. Ukraine has accused Russia of bombing a theatre in Mariupol where hundreds of people were taking refuge, despite a sign saying “DETI” – or children, in Russian – written on the ground on either side of the building. The city hall said a swimming pool sheltering civilians, “mostly women, children and the elderly”, had also been shelled. About 350,000 residents were hiding in shelters and basements in Mariupol, officials said, describing the situation as “critical”. Russia is struggling to make military progress in and around Kyiv, western officials said on Thursday afternoon, and “there is a question as to whether Moscow now intends to try to assault Kyiv or not”, Dan Sabbagh reports. An estimated 7,000 Russian troops have died in the fighting so far and 10% of the invading army’s equipment has also been destroyed, prompting questions as to whether the army on the ground has the will to continue fighting. I would be quite cautious in terms of my understanding of Russian intent on Kyiv, an official said, noting that Russian forces had been trying to encircle the Ukrainian capital for many days but had failed to make any real progress in either the north-west or the east. “I think there is a question as to whether Moscow now intends to try to assault Kyiv or not, and I don’t know the answer to that,” the official added. To do so, in my judgment, with or without bombardment, would be very costly. It may even be possible for Ukraine to fight Russia to a standstill, the official added, and the growing possibility of a military stalemate could help bring a successful conclusion to the ongoing peace negotiations on both sides. Britain and other western countries believe those discussions are becoming increasingly serious, but it remains unclear if Russia is “in a compromising mood” at the moment, after Vladimir Putin claimed on Wednesday night that it was possible “the pro-Nazi regime in Kyiv” could have “got its hands on weapons of mass destruction”. It is 7pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: Survivors have begun to emerge from the basement of a theatre hit by a Russian airstrike in the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, officials said. Hundreds of people were hiding beneath the theatre, which was designated as a shelter for displaced civilians, when it was struck on Wednesday. Authorities said it was not known if there were injuries or deaths among those inside. More than 20 people were killed and 25 injured when a Russian airstrike destroyed a school and community centre in Merefa, close to the north-east Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, local officials said. The attack took place at 3.30am local time (1.30am GMT) on Thursday morning, the Kharkiv prosecutor’s office said. Ten people are in critical condition, it said. Losses are mounting in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, with 53 people killed by Russian forces on Wednesday alone, the regional governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said on Thursday. “We are suffering heavy losses – 53 citizens were killed yesterday,” he said. The mayor of the besieged Ukrainian city of Melitopol, who was allegedly abducted by Russian forces, was freed in exchange for nine captured Russian conscripts, according to the head of Ukraine’s presidential office. Ukraine had accused Russia of kidnapping Ivan Fedorov last Friday, with surveillance footage appearing to show him being marched across a square in the city centre, apparently surrounded by Russian soldiers.

The meeting follows Çavuşoğlu’s visit to Moscow yesterday, where he declared: “We have not lost our belief in diplomacy.” But western officials have warned there remains a “very big gap” between Ukraine and Russia in peace talks between the two nations. Reuters quotes an unnamed official as saying that both sides are taking peace talks seriously but that there was little sign of an imminent breakthrough. Volodymyr Zelenskiy invoked the fall of the Berlin Wall in an attempt to persuade German MPs to do everything possible to halt Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Speaking to the German parliament via video, the Ukrainian president upbraided Germany for having persisted in the past in its insistence that the gas pipelines Nord Stream 1 and 2 and other business projects with Russia were “purely economic” and not political. The US president, Joe Biden, will speak with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on Friday to discuss Russia’s war against Ukraine “and other issues of mutual concern”, the White House said. Earlier, a Chinese official criticised the Nato secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, for his comments that China had an obligation as a member of the UN security council to help bring an end to the war in Ukraine. A Russian court has extended the arrest of the US basketball star Brittney Griner for at least two more months, according to the Russian state news agency Tass. Griner, a two-time Olympic champion, has been detained by Russian customs authorities, who claim they discovered vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage at an airport near Moscow. Uzbekistan’s foreign minister has called for a diplomatic resolution of the conflict in Ukraine and said it would not recognise Moscow-backed separatists in the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk, Reuters reports. His remarks signalled the strongest anti-war statement to come from Russia’s former Soviet allies so far. The UK’s defence minister, Ben Wallace, said an impostor claiming to be the Ukrainian prime minister contacted him today and asked several “misleading questions”. Wallace said he terminated the call after becoming suspicious, adding that “no amount of Russian disinformation” can distract from its human rights abuses. The European Space Agency (ESA) has suspended a joint mission with Russia to land a rover on Mars, because of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The venture had been planned to launch in September using a Russian launcher and lander in order to drill into the surface of Mars in search of signs of life. Hello, I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll continue to bring you all the latest developments from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The mayor of the besieged Ukrainian city of Melitopol, who was allegedly abducted by Russian forces, was freed in exchange for nine captured Russian conscripts, according to the head of Ukraine’s presidential office. Dariya Zarivna, a press aide to President Zelenskiy, was quoted by Ukraine’s Interfax news agency on Wednesday as saying: Ivan Fedorov was released from Russian captivity ... For him, Russia received nine captured soldiers who were born in 2002 and 2003. These are actually children. Ukraine had accused Russia of kidnapping Fedorov last Friday. Surveillance footage appeared to show the Melitopol mayor being marched across a square in the city centre, apparently surrounded by Russian soldiers. Zelenskiy confirmed that Fedorov had been freed in an address on Wednesday night: We have finally managed to release the mayor of Melitopol from captivity. Our Ukrainian Melitopol, which did not submit and will not submit to the occupiers. Ivan Fedorov is free. I talked to him today. The Russian military abducted him on 11 March, trying to persuade him to collaborate. But our man withstood. He did not give up. Just as we all endure. You all. Just as we all do not give up. Because we are Ukrainians. And we always protect our own. The UK’s defence minister, Ben Wallace, said an impostor claiming to be the Ukrainian prime minister contacted him today and asked several “misleading questions”. Wallace said he terminated the call after becoming suspicious, adding that “no amount of Russian disinformation” can distract from its human rights abuses. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said “we have stronger hopes for a ceasefire” after meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, in Lviv, Ruth Michaelson reports. The meeting follows Çavuşoğlu’s visit to Moscow yesterday, where he declared: “We have not lost our belief in diplomacy.” Çavuşoğlu said that he and Kuleba discussed a proposal to secure a humanitarian corridor for the besieged city of Mariupol, where Russian airstrikes hit residential buildings, a maternity ward and a theatre where an estimated 1,000 people were sheltering. We proposed humanitarian corridors and a ceasefire for at least 24 hours for Mariupol, which came when Mr Kuleba visited Antalya and I have fully supported that proposal, Çavuşoğlu said, in reference to a meeting between Lavrov and Kuleba that took place last week in Turkey. Çavuşoğlu added: We are in contact with both parties. The Russian side says that they want to evacuate people but Ukraine prevents it; Ukraine says they are ready for it but Russia prevents that. Unfortunately, so far we have not succeeded in that the conflict is still going on and tens of thousands of people, civilians, have not been able to leave the city. Lavrov, standing alongside Çavuşoğlu at a more tepid news conference in Moscow yesterday declared: We will propose corridors that ensure the safety and security of our soldiers. The Ukrainian side has their own proposals. People are free to make their own choices. Çavuşoğlu’s visit to Ukraine and Russia is part of Turkey’s efforts to position itself as a mediator, asserting itself on the international stage. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is also threatening to become a domestic issue for the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, as Russia and Ukraine provide the vast majority of Turkey’s wheat supply. Russia also provides about a third of Turkey’s natural gas supply, also a foundational issue for the Turkish government as energy costs rise dramatically amid rapid inflation and an economic crisis that has seen the lira lose half its value in just one year. Turkey has repeatedly positioned itself as a bridge between Russia and Ukraine due to alliances with both countries, capped with its membership of Nato and important geographical position at the entrance to the Black Sea. Erdoğan spoke with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, yesterday by phone, and Vladimir Putin earlier today where he reiterated an offer to host both leaders for peace talks and stressed the need for humanitarian corridors. “War does not benefit anyone,” he told Putin. Kuleba told journalists in Lviv that a 15-point negotiation plan between Russia and Ukraine published by the Financial Times yesterday “was the Russian position”. The plan would see Russian forces withdraw if Ukraine gives up any ambition to join Nato, and declines to host any foreign military bases in exchange for protection from its allies, including Turkey. “Security guarantees are the key issue. Regarding this we are conducting negotiations now,” said Kuleba. Çavuşoğlu also attempted to tamp down on any enthusiasm about the role of Turkey’s Bayraktar TB2 drones, which have quickly acquired folk hero status in Ukraine, due to their usefulness in blowing up Russian military equipment. “These are products procured from a company in Turkey,” he said, repeating statements by the Turkish authorities that the drones are part of a private military sale and not government assistance. Kuleba was unrepentant, joking about “our new Ukrainian national anthem, Bayraktar”, in reference to an ode to the drones composed by the Ukrainian land forces. “Bayraktar UAVs are very popular in Ukraine,” Çavuşoğlu responded dryly. More than 20 people were killed and 25 injured when a Russian airstrike destroyed a school and community centre in Merefa, close to the north-east Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, local officials said. The attack took place at 3.30am local time (1.30am GMT) on Thursday morning, the Kharkiv prosecutor’s office said on Telegram. It said 21 people were killed and 10 were in critical condition. Local authorities said the city of Merefa, home to 21,500 residents, came under fire overnight as missiles struck a school, a community centre and a scientific institution. The region has seen heavy bombardment in a bid by stalled Russian forces to advance. A peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow is being drafted by lawyers but a breakthrough depends on the Kremlin accepting a ceasefire, Ukraine’s defence minister has said, as the French government accused Russia of pretending to negotiate. My colleague Daniel Boffey, in Brussels, has more on the peace talks between the two sides. He writes: Oleksii Reznikov, who has been leading the Ukrainian delegation in the negotiations, said technical work was progressing but that Russia had to stop its shelling for any compromise to be possible. Speaking via video link to MEPs on the committee of foreign affairs and the security and defence subcommittee, Reznikov said international leaders, such as Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, were trying to mediate but that it appeared Russia would have to be forced into real negotiations. He said: We will, of course, first of all, during the negotiations talk about a ceasefire, about humanitarian corridors, the provision of the civilian population with evacuation, with water, with food, and maybe later we can sign this agreement for peace. There remains a “very big gap” between Ukraine and Russia in peace talks between the two nations, western officials have said. Reuters quotes an unnamed official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, as saying that both sides are taking peace talks seriously but that there was little sign of an imminent breakthrough: Both sides are taking them seriously but there is a very, very big gap between the positions in question. Another official said: “Those ... who saw [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin addressing the nation yesterday would be forgiven for thinking that Russia was not in compromising mood.” The European Space Agency (ESA) says it has suspended a joint mission with Russia to land a rover on Mars, because of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The venture had been planned to launch in September using a Russian launcher and lander in order to drill into the surface of Mars in search of signs of life. But that will no longer go ahead as planned, the ESA says: As an intergovernmental organisation mandated to develop and implement space programmes in full respect with European values, we deeply deplore the human casualties and tragic consequences of the aggression towards Ukraine. While recognising the impact on scientific exploration of space, ESA is fully aligned with the sanctions imposed on Russia by its member states. The ESA’s full statement is linked in the tweet below: Reports are emerging of survivors being rescued from the wreckage of a theatre bombed by Russian forces in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, according to local officials. Ukrainian authorities are working to rescue hundreds of civilians trapped in the basement of the Drama Theatre of Mariupol, which had been designated as a shelter for displaced civilians, including children and older people. Pyotr Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor, said it was not yet clear how many people survived at the facility, which had been used to shelter up to 1,000 people in recent days. Serhiy Taruta, a former head of the Donetsk region, wrote on Facebook: After an awful night of not knowing, we finally have good news from Mariupol on the morning of the 22nd day of the war. The bomb shelter [of the theatre] was able to hold. The rubble is beginning to be cleared. People are coming out alive. Another lawmaker, Lesia Vasylenko, who was in London as part of a delegation, said there were reports of injuries but no deaths, Associated Press reported. Liudmyla Denisova, the Ukrainian parliament’s commissioner for human rights, said adults and children were coming out alive but the full extent of the impact remained unclear. She wrote on Telegram: In Mariupol, the release of civilians from the rubble of the drama theater has begun. The building withstood the impact of a high-powered air bomb and protected the lives of people hiding in the bomb shelter. Work is under way to unlock the basement. Vladimir Putin has spoken about the west’s sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine on the eighth anniversary of the country’s annexation of Crimea. While acknowledging the sanctions had caused problems, the Russian president claimed they were also “creating opportunities” for businesses who now had “nothing to fear”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has invoked the fall of the Berlin Wall in an attempt to persuade German MPs to do everything possible to halt Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Speaking to the German parliament via video, the Ukrainian president said attempts to address Germany’s links with Russia over the years had been repeatedly met with the response: “Economy, economy, economy”. More than 187,000 refugees from Ukraine have arrived in Germany since Russia’s invasion three weeks ago, according to Germany’s interior ministry. German police have recorded 187,428 refugees, mostly women, children and older people, as of Thursday, the ministry said. Around 4,500 Ukrainian refugees have also been registered in Spain, although the real number is probably much higher, Spain’s migration minister, José Luis Escrivà, said today. Escrivà said: It is difficult to know the real number of refugees because many go directly to their families here in Spain without registering with the authorities. More than 3 million people have fled Ukraine in what the UN Refugee Agency called Europe’s worst refugee crisis since the second world war. Arnold Schwarzenegger has pleaded for Vladimir Putin to “stop this war”, and told Russian soldiers their lives are being “sacrificed for a senseless war condemned by the entire world”. In a nine-minute video posted to his Twitter account, the actor and former California governor outlined his history with Russia and said the “strength and heart of the Russian people” has always inspired him. Part of the video’s purpose was to try to make Russian soldiers more aware of the circumstances around the conflict, he said. To the Russian soldiers listening to this broadcast, you already know much of the truth that I have been speaking. You have seen it with your own eyes. He added: This is not the war to defend Russia that your grandfathers or your great-grandfather’s fought. This is an illegal war. Addressing the Russian president directly, Schwarzenegger says: To President Putin, I say: ‘You started this war. You are leading this war. You can stop this war.’ A Russian court has extended the arrest of US basketball star Brittney Griner for at least two more months, according to Russian state news agency Tass. Tass quoted the Khimkinsky court of the Moscow region as saying: The court granted the request of the investigation and extended the period of detention of the US citizen Griner until May 19. Griner, a two-time Olympic champion, has been detained by Russian customs authorities, who claim they discovered vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage at an airport near Moscow. She was arrested last month and could face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of bringing drugs into Russia. The Russian state-owned news agency also quoted Ekaterina Kalugina, a member of Russia’s public monitoring commission, a semi-official body with access to Russian prisons. Kalugina told Tass that Griner, 31, was sharing a cell with two other women with no previous convictions, adding that Griner’s only issue was that the prison beds were too short for her 6’7” frame. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has invoked the fall of the Berlin Wall in an attempt to persuade German MPs to do everything possible to halt Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Kate Connolly reports. Speaking to the German parliament via video, the Ukrainian president upbraided Europe’s largest economy for having persisted in the past in its insistence that the gas pipelines Nord Stream 1 and 2 and other business projects with Russia, were “purely economic” and not political. Zelenskiy said attempts to address the issue with Germany over the years had been repeatedly met with the response “economy, economy, economy” and delays in efforts to allow his country to become a member of Nato and the EU, as well as insufficient economic sanctions on Russia before the invasion, had contributed to allowing the attack. He referred to a “new wall” in the middle of Europe, “between freedom and lack of freedom” which he accused Germany of having helped to build by protecting its business interests with Russia at the cost of isolating Ukraine, epitomised by its support of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline via the Baltic Sea, which has now been abandoned. “This wall is only getting bigger with every bomb that lands on Ukraine and with every decision that is not taken,” he said. Uzbekistan has called for a diplomatic resolution of the conflict in Ukraine and said it would not recognise Moscow-backed separatists in the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk, Reuters reports. The Uzbek foreign minister, Abdulaziz Kamilov, told parliament that while Uzbekistan wanted to maintain good relations with both Russia and Ukraine, it opposed the war. His remarks signal the strongest anti-war statement to come from Russia’s former Soviet allies so far. Kamilov said: First, Uzbekistan is seriously concerned by the situation around Ukraine. Second, we are the proponents of finding a peaceful solution to this situation and resolving the conflict through political and diplomatic means. But in order to do that, first of all, hostilities and violence must stop immediately. Uzbekistan’s economy is heavily dependent on exports to Russia as well as remittances from its citizens working in Russia. Last week, Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, said “all countries must strictly adhere to the norms and principles of the charter of the United Nations” and “new diplomatic opportunities must be sought to resolve the conflict situation peacefully”. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has called for a “natural cleansing” of “scum and traitors” within Russia who question his invasion of Ukraine. In a television address on 16 March, he also accused the west of trying to split Russian society and provoke civil confrontation. Rescue workers searching in the rubble of a theatre smashed by a Russian airstrike in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol say they believe there are survivors to Wednesday evening’s attack. Ukrainian authorities are struggling to determine the fate of hundreds of civilians who had been sheltering in the theatre after images showed an entire section of the three-storey building had collapsed after the strike. Petro Andrushchenko, an adviser to the city’s mayor, said some people had survived the blast. He told Reuters: The bomb shelter held. Now the rubble is being cleared. There are survivors. We don’t know about the (number of) victims yet. Rescue work was under way to reach survivors and establish the number of casualties, Andrushchenko added. The theatre, which had been designated as a shelter for displaced civilians, including children and elderly people, withstood the strike and some people managed to escape, said the former governor of the Donetsk region, Sergiy Taruta, without providing further details. Tetyana Ignatchenko, a spokesperson of the Donetsk regional military administration, said there had been 1,000 people inside the Mariupol theatre a week ago. But after that, many people were able to escape. We can’t say exactly how many people were in the theatre. We can only assume 400-500. Half of them. In a late-night address on Wednesday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, referred to the theatre attack. The heart is breaking from what Russia does to our people, our Mariupol, and our Donetsk region. Speaking to reporters today, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the allegation that Russia had bombed the theatre was a “lie”. Zakharova said: Russia’s armed forces don’t bomb towns and cities. The US president, Joe Biden, will speak with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on Friday to discuss Russia’s war against Ukraine “and other issues of mutual concern”, the White House said. The call comes after US officials warned China may have already decided to provide Russia with economic and financial support during its war on Ukraine. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, met his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, in an “intense seven-hour session” earlier this week to present the US case against Russia’s invasion. A US official familiar with the discussion said the Chinese had “already decided that they’re going to provide economic and financial support” before the Rome meeting. “The question really is whether they will go further,” they added. Earlier today, a Chinese official criticised the Nato secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, for his comments that China had an obligation as a member of the UN security council to help bring an end to the war in Ukraine. Speaking after a meeting of Nato defence ministers yesterday, Stoltenberg called on China to “clearly condemn the invasion and not to support Russia”, adding that China had an obligation to condemn the invasion. In response, the Chinese mission to the EU said: We need no lecture on justice from the abuser of international law . . . Nato continues to expand its geographical scope and . . . needs to have good reflection. The remark was in reference to Nato’s accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999, which killed three journalists. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has not changed his position that the international borders in place since 1991 must continue to be recognised, a presidential adviser said. Zelenskiy has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine will not compromise on its “territorial integrity” since the Russian invasion on 24 February, Reuters reports. Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 but the region is still regarded by the United Nations as part of Ukraine. Russia has also recognised declarations of independence by the two self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Speaking on national television today, Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Zelenskiy, said: His main position has not changed. We will never give up our national interests. A Russian airstrike on civilians sheltering in a theatre in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol “looks to be specific targeting” of a civilian building, a UK Foreign Office minister said. Ukrainian authorities are still attempting to determine the fate of hundreds of people who had taken refuge in the theatre, with the pavements outside the venue reportedly marked with huge white letters spelling out “children” in Russian. Images showed an entire section of the three-storey building had collapsed after the strike on Wednesday evening. James Cleverly, the minister for Europe in the UK’s Foreign Office, said the attack appeared to be a “self-evident breach of international law” and called for evidence to be documented of the assault to put together a war crime case. In an interview with ITV’s Good Morning Britain, the minister was asked whether he thought the bombing of the shelter “looked like a war crime”. Cleverly responded: Ultimately it is for international courts and tribunals to make the formal decision but self-evidently, this is civilian infrastructure which we’ve seen had the word ‘Kids’ painted in Russian outside of this building. This looks to be specific targeting of civilian infrastructure and, as I say, that is a self-evident breach of international law and the law of armed conflict.” He added that evidence of potential war crimes must be collated so that “those people who are responsible for these, whether they are battlefield commanders, right up to the top of the organisation, can be held accountable once this war is concluded”. The Russian defence ministry has denied bombing the theatre in Mariupol. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you as we unpack all the latest developments in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has been speaking via video link to MEPs on the committee of foreign affairs and security and defence subcommittee and the issue of the peace negotiations with the Kremlin has been raised, Daniel Boffey reports. Reznikov said lawyers were involved in drawing up joint documents but that any breakthrough would depend on Russia agreeing to a total ceasefire. He said: We will, of course first of all, during the negotiations talk about a ceasefire, about humanitarian corridors, the provision of the civilian population with evacuation with water, with food, and maybe later we can sign this agreement for peace. But on the terms of Ukrainian people, we would never accept any capitulation and our armed forces are ready to resist. So today, we could say the negotiations are more or less on a technical level. And of course, lawyers are involved, politicians are involved and I’m not going to go into more details about negotiations. But I have to assure you that there is nothing yet to be satisfied about. But I hope that we will end this war very soon and of course by defeating the Kremlin. The time in Kyiv is 1pm. Here is a round-up of today’s main headlines: Losses are mounting in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, with 53 people killed by Russian forces on Wednesday alone, the regional governor said on Thursday. “We are suffering heavy losses - 53 citizens were killed yesterday,” Governor Viacheslav Chaus said. One person has been killed by a Russian missile attack in Kyiv this morning, Ukraine’s emergency services are reporting. Rescue services said they received a report of a residential building on fire in the Darnytsky district at 5.02am on Thursday. Ukrainian authorities struggled to determine the fate of hundreds of civilians who had been sheltering in a theatre smashed by a Russian airstrike in the besieged city of Mariupol, the Associated Press reported. An educational institution in the city of Merefa in the Kharkiv region was also reportedly struck by Russian missiles overnight, Ukraine’s state emergency services said. The Kremlin claimed it was putting “colossal” energy into talks on a possible peace deal with Ukraine. “Our delegation is putting in colossal effort and demonstrates more readiness towards them than the other side,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The UK defence ministry released its latest intelligence report, claiming the Russian invasion of Ukraine has “largely stalled on all fronts”. The Ukrainian military also released its morning operational report, claiming Russia has been unsuccessful in carrying out its ground operation and continues to launch rocket-bomb strikes on Ukrainian cities. Officials said Russian troops are launching cyber-attacks and destroying TV and radio signals in order to discredit Ukraine’s leadership. Ukraine is asking Japan for high-quality satellite imagery to help it fend off Russian troops, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Thursday. The exodus of refugees fleeing Ukraine continues, with most seeking refuge in neighbouring Poland. According to UN estimates, more than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest. Ukrainian authorities struggled to determine the fate of hundreds of civilians who had been sheltering in a theatre smashed by a Russian airstrike in the besieged city of Mariupol, the Associated Press reported. It came as officials said Russian artillery had on Thursday destroyed more civilian buildings in another frontline city. Some hope emerged, as an official said some people had managed to survive the Mariupol theatre strike. The AP reported: A photo released by Mariupol’s city council showed an entire section of the large, 3-story theater had collapsed after the strike Wednesday evening. Several hundred people had taken refuge in the building’s basement, seeking safety amid Russia’s 3-week, strangulating siege of the strategic Azov Sea port city. At least as recently as Monday, the pavement in front of and behind the once-elegant theater was marked with huge white letters spelling out “CHILDREN” in Russian, according to images released by the Maxar space technology company. Rubble had buried the entrance to the shelter inside the theater, and the number of casualties was unclear, Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional administration, said on Telegram. Ukrainian parliament member Sergiy Taruta, a former governor of the Donetsk region where Mariupol is located, later said on Facebook that some people had managed to escape alive from the destroyed building. He did not provide any further details. Kyrylenko said Russian airstrikes also hit a municipal swimming pool complex in Mariupol where civilians, including women and children, had been sheltering. “Now there are pregnant women and women with children under the rubble there,” he wrote, though the number of casualties was not immediately known. The Kremlin claimed it was putting “colossal” energy into talks on a possible peace deal with Ukraine. “Our delegation is putting in colossal effort and demonstrates more readiness towards them than the other side,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “Agreeing such a document, the observance of all its parameters and their implementation could very quickly stop what is happening.” Asked about a Financial Times report that Ukraine and Russia had made significant progress on a tentative peace plan, Peskov told Reuters: “It is not right - there are elements there that are right but on the whole it is incorrect.” The Kremlin, he said, would announce progress when there was progress to report. “Address all other questions to the Financial Times though,” Peskov said. Peskov said Joe Biden’s claim that Vladimir Putin was a war criminal was unacceptable and that the United States had no right to lecture Russia after its involvement in so many conflicts. About 4,500 Ukrainian refugees have been registered in Spain since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, but the real number is much higher, Spain’s migration minister, José Luis Escrivá, said on Thursday. More than 3 million people have fled the war in Ukraine in what the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) called Europe’s worst refugee crisis since World War Two. “It is difficult to know the real number of refugees because many go directly to their families here in Spain without registering with the authorities”, the minister said. The majority of European countries have offered to take in refugees in the past weeks to help alleviate the pressure on Ukraine’s neighbours as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues. Poland has taken in more than 1.8 million Ukrainians so far while Romania and Moldova have registered 435,432 and 337,215, respectively, following the invasion. Railways ground to a halt in many places across Poland on Thursday, hit by a widespread traffic control system outage, operator PKP PLK said, disrupting an important means of transport for refugees fleeing Ukraine. Infrastructure minister Andrzej Adamczyk said that railway workers were dealing with the situation and normal service would be resumed as soon as possible. Almost 2 million people have fled to Poland from Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion on 24 February. Poland has offered free rail tickets to refugees, allowing them to travel to stay with friends and family around the country. “Regarding the transport of refugees, which has been the key task of the railway over the past few days, we are in full coordination of the process together with the ministry of infrastructure ... so that the process is not halted and can be carried out to the extent possible,” The PKP PLK deputy chief executive, Mirosław Skubiszyński, told reporters. The traffic control outage was nearly nationwide, affecting 820 km (510 miles) of track, he added to Reuters. Ukraine is asking Japan for high-quality satellite imagery to help it fend off Russian troops, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Thursday. Japanese governments and private companies operate satellites that have the ability to capture detailed images day and night, and through clouds and other obstructions in the atmosphere. The Japanese government will carefully consider whether providing such data to Ukraine is politically acceptable or allowed under the current legal framework, the report said without citing sources. It comes as Japan’s military says it spotted four large Russian amphibious warfare ships sailing close to its islands as they traveled west, possibly towards Europe, Reuters reported. Pictures of the amphibious transports, typically used for landing expeditionary forces ashore, published by Japan’s defence ministry showed what appeared to be military trucks loaded onto the deck of one of the vessels. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the world must officially recognise that Russia has become a terrorist state. During his daily video address, the Ukrainian president once again called on western leaders for the implementation of a no-fly zone and new sanctions packages against Russia. An official in the Mariupol mayor’s office said on Thursday the city authorities did not yet have a casualty toll after what they said was a Russian bombardment of a theatre in the besieged Ukrainian city. Russia’s defence ministry on Wednesday denied it had carried out an air strike against a theatre in Mariupol, RIA news agency said. Russian government websites are facing unprecedented cyber-attacks and technical efforts are being made to filter foreign web traffic, the Tass news agency cited the digital ministry as saying on Thursday. Russian government entities and state-owned companies have been targeted over events in Ukraine, with the websites of the Kremlin, flagship carrier Aeroflot and major lender Sberbank among those to have seen outages or temporary access issues in recent weeks. The ministry was working to adjust to the new conditions, it said, as cyber attacks ratchet up. “If previously their power at peak moments reached 500 gigabytes, then now it is at 1 terabyte,” the ministry said. “That is two to three times more powerful than the most serious incidents of this kind that have been previously reported.” As Russia becomes increasingly isolated from global financial systems and supply chains, the government has proposed a raft of measures to support the IT sector, among others. Technology firms will have access to preferential tax and lending conditions and the digital ministry has previously suggested Russian IT companies discuss a phased transfer of technical support components with foreign firms. Citing draft government documents, Interfax reported late on Wednesday that the digital ministry had proposed allocating 14 billion roubles ($134.30m) to support IT companies in the form of grants. Reuters could not immediately verify that report. Russia has the might to put enemies led by the United States in their place and Moscow will foil the west’s Russophobic plot to tear Russia apart, one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies said on Thursday. Dmitry Medvedev, who served as president from 2008 to 2012 and is now deputy secretary of Russia’s security council, said the United States had stoked “disgusting” Russophobia in an attempt to force Russia on its knees and then rip it apart. “It will not work - Russia has the might to put all of our brash enemies in their place,” Medvedev said. Losses are mounting in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, with 53 people killed by Russian forces on Wednesday alone, the regional governor said on Thursday. “We are suffering heavy losses - 53 citizens were killed yesterday,” Governor Viacheslav Chaus said. The information could not immediately be verified. Russia denies targeting civilians, Reuters reported. It comes as Russia’s armed forces said they had hit a military depot in the Rivne region in western Ukraine on Wednesday. High-precision missiles hit a depot in Sarny, Rivne region, destroying storage facilities for missiles and ammunition, the ministry said. I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news throughout the morning. Before I hand over to my colleague Tom Ambrose here is a rundown of the latest developments. For a more detailed summary, please refer to our earlier update. One person has been killed by a Russian missile attack in Kyiv this morning, Ukraine’s emergency services are reporting. Rescue services said they received a report of a residential building on fire in the Darnytsky district at 5.02am on Thursday. An educational institution in the city of Merefa in the Kharkiv region was also reportedly struck by Russian missiles overnight, Ukraine’s state emergency services said. The UK defence ministry released its latest intelligence report, claiming the Russian invasion of Ukraine has “largely stalled on all fronts”. The Ukrainian military also released its morning operational report, claiming Russia has been unsuccessful in carrying out its ground operation and continues to launch rocket-bomb strikes on Ukrainian cities.

According to UN estimates, more than three million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February. The comedy satire in which Volodymyr Zelenskiy unexpectedly becomes Ukraine’s president will be aired again on Netflix in the US. The resurrection of the TV series Servant of the People comes amid a global outpouring of praise for the former comedian who is now leading his country’s fight against the Russian invasion. “You asked and it’s back,” Netflix announced. Russian government websites are facing unprecedented cyber attacks and efforts are being made to filter foreign web traffic, Russia’s state news agency TASS cited the digital ministry as saying on Thursday. Russian government entities and state-owned companies have been targeted over events in Ukraine, with the websites of the Kremlin, flagship carrier Aeroflot and major lender Sberbank among those to have seen outages or temporary access issues in recent weeks. According to UN estimates, more than three million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February. Most have sought refuge in neighbouring Poland, arriving to the border by train or bus. United Nation secretary-general António Guterres gave an update on the number of refugees late on Wednesday, saying: “The people of Ukraine desperately need peace. And the people around the world demand it. Russia must stop this war now.” Here’s a quick take on the markets, according to a recent Reuters report. Hong Kong led strong gains in Asian stock markets on Thursday, buoyed by signs of progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine and by expectations of more support for China’s wobbly economy. Pan-European stock futures also looked set for a firmer open, pointing 0.21% higher. US stock futures indicated a slightly lower restart, but followed a 2.2% surge for the S&amp;P 500 overnight. Investors took in stride the long expected start of monetary tightening in the United States. Treasury yields eased a little after spiking to nearly three-year highs overnight - with shorter-end yields rising more to flatten the curve - after the Fed on Wednesday raised the policy rate for the first time since 2018. The Fed increased rates by a quarter point, as expected, and telegraphed equivalent hikes at every meeting for the remainder of this year to aggressively curb inflation. The dollar, though, remained on the back foot and oil stabilised well south of recent multi-year highs amid signs of material progress in talks between Russia and Ukraine to end the war. In some lighter news, the comedy satire in which Volodymyr Zelenskiy unexpectedly becomes Ukraine’s president will be aired again on Netflix in the US. The resurrection of the TV series Servant of the People comes amid a global outpouring of praise for the former comedian who is now leading his country’s fight against the Russian invasion. “You asked and it’s back,” Netflix announced. On Tuesday, Zelenskiy received a standing ovation as he addressed the US Congress via video link with an impassioned plea for more weaponry and the establishment of a no-fly zone to help Ukraine survive the Russian invasion, which began on 24 February. Before politics, Zelenskiy wrote and produced standup comedy shows, TV series and films, and sold tickets to live concerts. Servant of the People sees Zelenskiy, who is now 44, play a teacher who unexpectedly becomes president after a video of him complaining about corruption goes viral. Once elected, Zelenskiy’s character faces a difficult task to reform Ukraine, fight corruption and unify the nation despite resistance from politicians serving the interests of oligarchs. The show resonated with Ukrainians and audiences in other former Soviet countries The UK defence ministry has released its latest intelligence report, claiming the Russian invasion of Ukraine has “largely stalled on all fronts”. The report reads: Russian forces have made minimal progress on land, sea or air in recent days and they continue to suffer heavy losses. Ukrainian resistance remains staunch and well-coordinated. The vast majority of Ukrainian territory, including all major cities, remains in Ukrainian hands.” Hungary says it expects a “bigger wave” of refugees to arrive from Ukraine next week, prime minister Viktor Orban said in a video message posted to his official Facebook page. Visiting a border crossing point near Hungary’s border with Romania and Ukraine, Orban said more border guards would be posted there next week to handle an increased number of refugees. Orban did not say why he expected more refugees next week. Over the past week the number of Ukrainian refugees arriving to Hungary has fallen substantially, according to a Reuters report. An educational institution in the city of Merefa in the Kharkiv region was reportedly struck by Russian missiles overnight, Ukraine’s state emergency services is reporting. Rescue services said they received a call at 3.39am this morning with reports a two-story building was partially destroyed and on fire. “On March 17, as a result of another shelling, enemy missiles hit one of the educational institutions in the city of Merefa in the Kharkiv region,” the agency said in an update this morning Rescue teams are working to extinguish the blaze and no casualties have so far been reported. The exodus of refugees fleeing Ukraine continues with most seeking refuge in neighbouring Poland. According to UN estimates, more than three million people have fled the country since Russia invaded on 24 February. The latest Ukrainian city to suffer wide-spread damage from Russian missile attacks is the besieged port city of Mariupol. A before and after comparison photo shows the extent of damage inflicted upon the city’s theatre which was the site of a makeshift civilian shelter and bombed by Russian forces on Wednesday, officials said. Mariupol council posted an image of the city’s theatre showing it sustained heavy damage in the attack and said casualty numbers were being confirmed. The word “children” had been written outside the theatre. Zelenskiy said “our hearts are broken” by the strike, and likened the siege of the city to that of Leningrad in the second world war. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba called the attack “another horrendous war crime” and said the building is now “fully ruined”. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave a national address late last night where he called Russia a ‘terrorist state’ and said its attack on Mariupol was no different from the siege of Leningrad. In case you missed it, here is a recap of his remarks: The war has not stopped yet. Russia’s war crimes continue. The Russian economy is still able to maintain the military machine. That’s why we need new sanctions against Russia. The world must finally recognise officially that Russia has become a terrorist state.” Zelenskiy also directly addressed Russians, asking them to question whether the siege of Mariupol is any different from the siege of Leningrad and promising Russian soldiers who lay down their arms a chance to survive. Speaking in Russian, he said: Citizens of Russia! How is your siege of Mariupol different from the siege of Leningrad during WWII? Who are you taking over from?” Every Russian soldier who lays down his arms will get a chance to survive, he added. There is still an opportunity. There is [an opportunity] for every soldier sent to the territory of our country, for every single one who hasn’t been killed or injured or captured. The Russian army is suffering losses that it did not see in Syria or Chechnya; that Soviet troops [didn’t have] in Afghanistan. If your war, war against the Ukrainian people, will continue, mothers of Russia will lose more children than in the Afghan and Chechen wars altogether. Why do you need it? Every Russian soldier who lays down his arms will get a chance to survive. I’m addressing conscripts, who were thrown into a boiler of this war - not their war, - and other soldiers who still have a self-preservation instinct. Lay down your arms. It is better than dying on the battlefield on our land.” An emergency UN Security Council meeting is set to get underway today. The United States, Britain, France, Albania, Norway and Ireland requested the meeting due to the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Ukraine, diplomatic sources said. “Russia is committing war crimes and targeting civilians,” the British diplomatic mission to the UN said on its Twitter account late on Wednesday evening. “Russia’s illegal war on Ukraine is a threat to us all.” Russia asked to postpone a UN Security Council vote on a resolution it drafted about the “humanitarian” situation in Ukraine. The vote, first scheduled for Wednesday and then pushed to Thursday afternoon, is to be set for Friday morning - unless the draft is dropped altogether due to lack of support from Moscow’s allies. Discussions are also underway, according to other diplomatic sources, to allow Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to speak to the United Nations General Assembly. Ukraine’s UN representative Sergiy Kyslytsya called Russia’s appeal to UN members an “egregious hypocrisy” . “UN member may like to think twice before they dive in blood of children and adults executed by Russian military in Ukraine,” he added. The Ukrainian military has just released its morning operational report, claiming Russia has been unsuccessful in carrying out its ground operation and continues to launch rocket-bomb strikes on Ukrainian cities. Officials said Russian troops are launching cyberattacks and destroying TV and radio signals in order to discredit Ukraine’s leadership. “In addition to this, the opponent continues to actively disseminate misinformation about the so-called ‘special operation’ movement among the own population,” the ministry of defence report reads. “The occupation forces continue to bear losses. They have major problems with the assembling of combat units and security units. The personal composition of the opponent is demoralised, which led to an increase in the number of cases of desertification and the refusal of the military forces of the Russian Federation to participate in the war on Ukraine.” One person has been killed by a Russian missile attack in Kyiv this morning, Ukraine’s emergency services are reporting. Rescue services said they received a report of a residential building on fire in the Darnytsky district at 5.02am on Thursday. “On arrival, rescuers found that as a result of a damaged missile remains, the 16th and technical floor of the building was demolished, and the 16th floor of the apartment was set on fire,” the agency said in an update this morning. Some 30 people were evacuated with a search still underway. One person was confirmed to have died while three were injured as a result of the shelling and destruction of the building, emergency services said. Joe Biden has denounced Vladimir Putin as a war criminal, delivering his sharpest rebuke yet of the Russian leader just hours after the Ukrainian president pleaded with Congress to provide more aid to his country. “I think he is a war criminal,” Biden said of Putin on Wednesday. The president’s comment marked a distinct rhetorical shift for the White House, which had deflected previous questions about whether Putin should be considered a war criminal for the Russian military’s attacks on Ukrainian civilians. “There is a process, and we have stood up a process internally – an internal team – to assess and look at and evaluate evidence of what we’re seeing happen on the ground,” the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said earlier this month. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Biden’s comments were “unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric”, according to Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency. Thanks for joining us for today’s live coverage on the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold. It is just before 7am in Ukraine and here is where the crisis currently stands. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said humanitarian corridors failed on Wednesday because “Russian soldiers didn’t stop shelling and didn’t guarantee safety” in a national address late last night. The president called Russia a “terrorist state” and pleaded for more support from the west, including air defence systems, jets, lethal weapons and ammunition. Zelenskiy also directly addressed Russians, asking them to question whether the siege of Mariupol is any different from the siege of Leningrad and promising Russian soldiers who lay down their arms a chance to survive. Russian forces bombed a theatre and swimming pool complex where civilians were sheltering in the encircled Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, officials said. Mariupol council posted an image of the city’s theatre showing it sustained heavy damage in today’s attack and said casualty numbers were being confirmed. Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of Donetsk regional administration, said that pregnant women and children were sheltering at the pool, calling the attack “pure terrorism”. The word “children” had been written outside the theatre. Zelenskiy said “our hearts are broken” by the strike, and likened the siege of the city to that of Leningrad in the second world war. Satellite imagery revealed extensive damage across Sumy, Chernihiv and Kharkiv. The images, taken by US space technology company Maxar Technologies, shows burning homes in a residential area of Chernihiv, Ukraine, as well as artillery impact craters next to a residential area in Kharkiv and a damaged Olympic sports training centre. Joe Biden referred to Vladimir Putin as a “war criminal”, his sharpest rebuke yet of the Russian president, after he announced an extra $800m in security assistance to Ukraine, to buy more weapons and military equipment. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Biden’s comments were “unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric”, according to Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on the US Congress to provide more weapons to help his country fight off Russian airstrikes and for further sanctions against Russia, including the withdrawal of all US businesses. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba said that what his country needs from the west is “weapons and sanctions, and the rest will be done by Ukraine” in an interview with CNN. The United States committed to more military aid to Ukraine, including long-range missile defence and Switchblade armed drones to better defend against Russian aircraft and armour from a distance. Russian forces shot and killed 10 people standing for bread in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, the US embassy in Kyiv said. Ukrainian officials said the attack took place at 10am local time on Wednesday (8am GMT). Russia’s defence ministry denied the report, claiming no Russian soldiers were in Chernihiv. The UN security council will meet Thursday at the request of six western nations that sought an open session on Ukraine. The UK’s UN mission tweeted: “Russia is committing war crimes and targeting civilians. Russia’s illegal war on Ukraine is a threat to us all.” The meeting comes ahead of an expected vote on a Russian humanitarian resolution that has been sharply criticised for making no mention of Moscow’s war against Ukraine. Russian forces released the mayor of the Ukrainian city of Melitopol, the Ukrainian president said. Ukraine’s state services for communications shared a video showing Zelenskiy speaking to Ivan Fedorov following his release. The president said Fedorov was abducted by Russian forces on 11 March who tried to persuade him to collaborate but “our man withstood. He did not give up.” China’s ambassador to Ukraine praised Ukraine’s unity and resistance in remarks which appear to contradict the country’s earlier stance. Fan Xianrong said China “will never attack Ukraine” but will support it economically and politically during a meeting with Lviv’s regional military administration, Ukrainian media outlet Ukrinform originally reported. British intelligence said set backs for Russian forces has meant its troops are resorting to the use of “older, less precise weapons” which are “less militarily effective and more likely to result in civilian casualties.

Since there are fewer fish to eat them, they appear off the British coast in vast swarms. This is a threat to nuclear power stations – because they can block the intake of cooling water – and to fish farms, where thousands get caught in the netting, sometimes killing hundreds of salmon by depriving them of oxygen. Some species are poisonous, and so caution is required when jellyfish float next to you in the sea or are stranded on beaches. Their sting can be powerful. With the problem worsening as the seas get both more acid and warmer, the European Union has decided it needs to better understand how these blooms occur and think of a way of stopping them before they reach our coastal waters. Since the potential mass of these blooms in Europe is enormous – already 1bn tons for one imported species, the American comb jelly (Mnemiopsis leidyi) – the EU also wants to find a way of utilising this potential resource. Scientists from 15 institutions have been allocated €6m (£5.3m) over four years to try and find a way of converting them into something useful. One idea is processing them into food for fish farms, or better still, thinking of a way to make them less slimy and presenting them as a human food. Other suggestions include converting them into cosmetics, since they contain collagen, much used in skin creams, or using their sticky mucus to tackle another environmental problem – microplastic. Jellyfish biofilters fixed to sewage outfalls could capture the plastic before it reached the sea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/feb/03/mildura-deputy-mayor-joins-climate-driven-challenge-to-nationals-in-mallee","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-02T22:00:42Z","webTitle":"Mildura deputy mayor joins climate-driven challenge to Nationals in Mallee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/03/mildura-deputy-mayor-joins-climate-driven-challenge-to-nationals-in-mallee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/feb/03/mildura-deputy-mayor-joins-climate-driven-challenge-to-nationals-in-mallee","fields":{"headline":"Mildura deputy mayor joins climate-driven challenge to Nationals in Mallee","bodyText":"The deputy mayor of Mildura, Jason Modica, will become the second independent candidate to challenge the National party in the seat of Mallee – running on the issues of water, climate change and people power. Known as “Jake the Tradie”, Modica served on Mildura council with Ali Cupper, who unexpectedly won the state seat of Mildura last year as an independent, a seat held by the Nationals on a 8% margin. Modica enters the field after the sitting Nationals MP, Andrew Broad, a vocal supporter of traditional marriage, announced his retirement following New Idea allegations he met up with a younger woman in Hong Kong via a sugar daddy dating website. Modica is an Australian Conservation Fund river fellow, a program aimed at providing advocacy on behalf of the Murray Darling communities. Last year he was one of several councillors who wrote to Broad asking him to “speak up about Queensland and NSW’s refusal to acknowledge natural and historic flows” through the Darling and clarify his stance on alleged theft and over-allocation in the Barwon Darling system. Broad wrote back, telling councillors to stick to issues at their own level of government and noted that the Barwon-Darling was not within the Mallee electorate. He pointed to $103m of government funding for the Sunraysia irrigation upgrade. Modica enters the fray alongside the former Yarriambiack mayor and Wimmera farmer Ray Kingston, who is running on climate change, federal funding for local councils and roads as well as attracting more people to the Mallee through immigration. While there has been speculation that Tony Abbott’s former chief of staff Peta Credlin may run as a Liberal candidate, the Victorian Liberal party did not return Guardian Australia’s calls or emails. The son of an Italian migrant market gardener, Modica grew up at Gol Gol just outside Mildura and owns a local ceramic tile business. Modica said the river was the catalyst to run federally on “people, power and water”. “Even people in smaller towns outside Mildura, who might be reliant on ground water and not directly effected by the Murray, see [the rivers] as on ongoing issue and that [ground water and river water] is all connected,” Modica said. “Our region is also ripe for energy generation because we are the link between South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. Yet the Coalition have looked away from grid upgrades and securing future energy generation because of the power of the coal lobby. “After the last 10 years, people have disengaged and they are very concerned that politicians represent parties more than voters.” But independents face an uphill battle in the western Victorian seat, which covers 82,000 square kilometres and elected Broad with a margin of 19.8%. Last month, the National party chose sociologist Anne Webster, who founded the Zoe Support not-for-profit group in Mildura – an organisation that helps young mothers find services and return to education. But one of the biggest debates in the 2019 election, following the entrance of high-profile centre-right independents, is climate change. Rural independent candidates in Mallee as well as Indi’s Helen Haines are mirroring the climate concerns of city-based independent candidates including former Liberal MP Julia Banks in Flinders, the former Liberal member and banker Oliver Yates in Kooyong, Wentworth MP Kerryn Phelps and Warringah candidate Zali Steggall. Their stance is in marked contrast in rural areas to the Coalition, which has pushed taxpayer funding for new coal fired plants. The Nationals leader and deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, rejected the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report’s call to phase out coal power by 2050. Webster told Guardian Australia that climate issues needed to be addressed and resolved, saying she did not want to “warm the seat” and wanted her grandchildren to look up to her. “Regardless of what anyone in politics says, the reality is climate issues have to be resolved, international covenants have to be followed through and I would like to see that we are more open to all kinds of energy,” Webster said. “There has been a polarisation around coal, which has a finite end date, and the fact is everyone wants affordable and reliable energy. If we don’t have economic prosperity, we will all be lighting our own candles.” Webster said she would also personally welcome a proper investigation into uranium, given Finland has five nuclear power stations. “Obviously there are lots of questions which need to be answered about waste and other issues but, if you don’t ask, the same debate keeps kicking around.” Webster told Guardian Australia that her sociology background gave her an interest in people living at the fringes of society, whether they were in small towns or larger regional centres. “Health and aged care are absolute priorities and inequity in healthcare,” she said. “[Current] funding models don’t allow for regional population ratios. Just because there are less people living in [a community] doesn’t mean they need less services.” Webster urged voters not to support independents “because they can make a lot of promises but they can’t deliver”. “Parties have the best capacity to bring change,” she said. But Kingston, who has been campaigning in Mallee since December, said the benefit of an independent was that both Labor and the Coalition would deal with the electorate. “This election there could easily be enough independents to form united independent voice on some issues,” Kingston said. “They may not be aligned on every issue but there will be a good chance of getting numbers of independents, particularly country ones, and that has potential for rural seats.” Kingston said small towns and regional centres were working hard on their own issues, such as targeting migrants to join communities and fill employment gaps. He cited the town of Pyramid Hill where the Filipino community had reversed population decline and filled jobs at the local piggery. “For example, my own home town of Rupanyup is now teaming up with Edenhope and Charlton to find skilled migrants while making sure there is good housing and support to ensure integration,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2019/mar/20/amyas-morse-head-national-audit-office-ministers-waste-taxpayers-billions","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2019-03-20T07:00:09Z","webTitle":"Amyas Morse: ‘I’m angry when ministers waste taxpayers’ billions’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/20/amyas-morse-head-national-audit-office-ministers-waste-taxpayers-billions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2019/mar/20/amyas-morse-head-national-audit-office-ministers-waste-taxpayers-billions","fields":{"headline":"Amyas Morse: ‘I’m angry when ministers waste taxpayers’ billions’","bodyText":"I still get angry – and that is the word for it, angry – 10 years into the role, when I see badly-thought-through programmes and wasted public money,” says outgoing watchdog chief Sir Amyas Morse. “And the reason I’m angry is because the citizen ends up picking up the tab. They are the ones who end up suffering.” For almost a decade, as comptroller and auditor general – the head of the National Audit Office – it’s been Morse’s statutory duty to keep an eagle eye on the spending of central government departments, holding ministers and civil servants to account for cost overruns, project mismanagement and profligacy with taxpayers’ money. He doesn’t have far to look. As he prepares to leave his post in May, Morse’s final public speech at the Institute for Government last week included a damning list of failures: Crossrail costing £2.8bn more than forecast; changes to probation costing £467m to put right; the smart meters fiasco that will cost at least £500m more than originally estimated; and the Ministry of Defence’s latest unaffordable and unsustainable 10-year equipment plan going over budget by at least £7bn. And that’s just a selection from the past few months. Morse looks back in anger at the billions that could have been spent on vital services, wasted instead through what he calls “inappropriate bravado” on the part of government ministers, lording it over cowed civil servants, behind an increasing amount of secrecy and spin. “We don’t need people jumping out of an aeroplane in the dark with a parachute of taxpayers’ money,” he says. A proud Scot – his only meeting with Theresa May was a “brief conversation” at a No 10 Burns Night last year – Morse cares passionately about public services. While his upbringing has contributed to his concern for fairness, it’s his decade at the watchdog, to which he came from a senior position in consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers via the MoD, that has fuelled his rage over the wasteful ways of too many government ministers. “I really realised that society belongs to us. We’re all paying for it.” Public money is finite, he points out. There is no magic money tree. When money is lost in one place, it’s taken away from another programme, usually one that’s easier to cut. Every wasted £1bn, he says, is enough to run NHS England for three days, fund 6.25m A&amp;E attendances, 1.35m day cases in hospital, or 4m ambulance attendances. Morse has warned the government that it needs to invest more in the NHS and social care, to meet the needs of an ageing population. In 2016-17, the UK spent just over £170bn on health and social care – more than 10% of GDP, but less than the 11.2% of GDP Germany spent in 2015 on health alone. Despite highlighting last year that the size of the task in preparing for Brexit means “points of failure” will be inevitable, Morse says the civil service has done well since article 50 was triggered. “It was an impossible ask, and they’ve tried very hard to meet it.” Since 2010, ministers have steadily increased their powers within government departments, intent on driving through their own ideas, not always wisely, according to Morse. He sees it as vital to call this out. “Being Mr Tactful won’t change things,” he says. Last year, he famously had a public run-in with the then work and pensions secretary Esther McVey, after she wrongly claimed that the NAO had called for the rollout of universal credit to be accelerated. Morse wrote an open letter to McVey to “clarify the facts” – the first time the watchdog had released personal correspondence with a minister. “Some ministers see themselves more or less as chief executives, but without the qualifications to go with that,” says Morse. The result is a litany of projects that have been overoptimistic (“When I see the words ‘world-beating’, my heart sinks”), with unrealistic timescales. These include universal credit, the Hinkley Point nuclear power station saga, and, of course, Brexit. Every year, the NAO audits the accounts of around 370 central government departments, agencies and other public bodies. It has 796 staff, only slightly fewer than the 854 it had in 2007, who also publish more than 60 value-for-money inquiries a year, most followed up with investigations by the Commons public accounts committee (PAC). Between them, the two bodies have now published hundreds of damning and scathing reports. But has it made any difference? “I always liken myself to a squawking crow, squawking away, irritating people. If you squawk for long enough, it’s surprisingly effective in changing people’s behaviour,” says Morse. He points to the NHS, finally collaborating more closely with local social services, after a lot of NAO work on how local primary care systems interact. It’s not just about publishing reports. Morse has also talked to Whitehall departments and MPs. “He has to deal with the Whitehall geopolitics and fight his corner and he’s very good at it,” says Meg Hillier, chair of the PAC. “He’s good on wider issues, which he’s embraced enthusiastically.” Hillier and Morse have had a close, smooth working relationship from the start, says Morse, unlike his initial relationship with the previous PAC chair, Margaret Hodge. “We’re now good friends, but initially we fought like cats and dogs,” he says. Hodge agrees she was “really cross” with Morse at the start of his tenure over a couple of issues where she’d suggested changes to existing audit arrangements – something Morse felt was a threat to his authority and that of the NAO. “We’re both strong-willed and like our own way,” says Hodge. “But we realised we would get much more done if we worked together.” She commends Morse’s bravery in speaking out. Morse says he likes working with strong women: “They’re more fun than strong men. More insightful and more interested in what you’re thinking.” While the NAO and Morse are seen as successful, some would like to see an expanded remit. “Within the current system, the NAO has consistently been the voice to expose the failings of the current framework and has been doing this over a long cycle now,” says social entrepreneur Hilary Cottam. “The question is how they can use the data and critique to begin to advocate for something new.” For now, Morse leaves with good advice for all those spending public money: ask people about where they want their money spent and, above all, understand that hard choices have to be made. When big projects go wrong, they suck up money from other services. “By looking over the walls, I can see that.” Curriculum vitae Age: 69. Lives: Suffolk and London. Family: Married, three children.

French state-owned EDF said the cost overrun for two new reactors at Hinkley in Somerset could hit £2.2bn, taking the total spend to £20.3bn, up from £18bn previously. EDF confirmed the first reactor – originally due to become operational by the end of 2025 – risked being 15 months late and might not start generating electricity until 2027. The second unit is estimated to face a nine-month delay. Experts said the UK faced significant challenges to electricity supply and the prospect of further delay at Hinkley meant ageing power stations may need to be kept open longer. In a review of costs for Hinkley, EDF said £1.5bn of the increase was due to a “better understanding” of the construction work needed and UK regulatory requirements. The estimated delay on completing the reactors – which are meant to set a new standard for nuclear safety – would add a further £0.7bn in cost. But the company insisted it was still aiming for a delivery date of the end of 2025, and said it was on track to pour the concrete for the first reactor in 2019. “We are very clear that the team must remain mobilised on the initial objective of 2025,” said Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy. “We have in our hands what we need to deliver [the project on time].” The two other major nuclear power stations using the same design, in France and Finland, are years behind schedule and significantly over budget. De Rivaz told the House of Lords last year that the company had “dramatically” changed its approach for Hinkley, compared with Flamanville 3 in north-west France, which was originally due to be finished in 2012 but was not expected to be complete until late 2018. The chief executive, who is stepping down in October, told the Guardian the very existence of this review was an example that lessons had been learned. Asked if he could guarantee that the UK taxpayer would not be on the hook if costs continued to escalate in the future, he said: “Absolutely. Definitely. Totally.” In 2007, De Rivaz predicted that by Christmas in 2017, turkeys would be cooked using atomic power from new reactors at Hinkley. The latest bad news about the plant came just over a week after the public spending watchdog condemned the government for locking consumers into an “expensive and risky” project by signing a subsidy deal guaranteeing a set price for power from the reactors. The Green party said EDF’s review of costs should be the “final nail in the coffin” for Hinkley, a third of which is financed by the Chinese General Nuclear Power Group. “Hardly a week passes at the moment without new evidence that Hinkley is a terrible deal,” said the party’s co-leader, Jonathan Bartley. John Sauven, executive director at Greenpeace UK, said: “Hinkley is already over time and over budget after just a few months of building work. Today’s news is yet another damning indictment of the government’s agreement to go ahead with this project.” EDF said if the £2.2bn cost increase came to pass, its rate of return on the project would drop from 9% to 8.2%. The company’s share price fell 0.3% to €9.45 on Monday after the announcement. Some analysts have factored in a delay to the plant. Dr Paul Dorfan, a vocal Hinkley critic at University College London’s Energy Institute, said the admission showed that lessons had not been learned from the same reactor design being built at Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland. “On top of the National Audit Office [report], on top of the fiasco of Flamanville and Olkiluoto, on top of the [UK subsidy] deal itself, which has been universally slated by every financial expert, now we see another £2bn on the top,” he said. Dorfman said the estimated delay also called into question new-build nuclear’s ability to keep the lights on during the next decade. Jenifer Baxter, head of energy at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, said any delay to Hinkley “means that it’s possible that some existing power stations will require further life extensions”. Any gap in electricity generation would need to be filled with gas and other technologies, she said. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “As the developer has made clear the project remains on track to meet its first major milestone in 2019. “The UK government negotiated a competitive deal which protects consumers and ensures that all of the cost of construction, including any overruns, sits with the contractor.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/feb/08/we-have-a-rare-chance-to-make-our-electricity-system-fair-again-but-we-need-to-act-fast","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-08T05:32:04Z","webTitle":"We have a rare chance to make our electricity system fair again, but we need to act fast | Nicky Ison","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/08/we-have-a-rare-chance-to-make-our-electricity-system-fair-again-but-we-need-to-act-fast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/08/we-have-a-rare-chance-to-make-our-electricity-system-fair-again-but-we-need-to-act-fast","fields":{"headline":"We have a rare chance to make our electricity system fair again, but we need to act fast","bodyText":"While some politicians pretend there is still a choice between dirty and clean energy, the reality is like the dinosaurs they are being left behind. Our choice is actually about how we will transition to clean energy. We have already failed to stop climate change, we now need to manage the effects and prevent it from getting worse. The path we take to renewables could be slow, bumpy, costly and unjust. Or it could be a rare chance to make our electricity system fair again, but only if we act fast. The inevitable transition The good news is the transition to clean energy is now inevitable. It is happening and will continue and ultimately we will move to a system powered by renewable energy and storage. This long-term trajectory is now locked-in because the economics of energy are such that it is now cheaper to build solar and wind, backed-up by batteries or pumped-hydro than to build a new coal, gas or nuclear power station. That means that when Australia’s 19 operating coal power stations close they will be replaced with clean energy solutions. Because Australia has some of the best renewable resources in the world, forward looking business people such as Sanjeev Gupta are seeing the long-term economic opportunity of clean energy in Australia and are working to speed it up. And businesses aren’t the only ones – more than two million Australian households and businesses have installed rooftop solar and this trend is set to continue. The bad news is, that while Australia will move to clean, renewable energy in the long run, there is no guarantee that it will happen fast enough or in a way that doesn’t entrench existing inequality. A fast transition Analysis by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that if the world is to have a hope of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees, countries like Australia must move beyond coal by 2030. That means that just waiting for coal power plants to naturally retire and be replaced with cleaner alternatives will take too long. Burning coal for longer means more floods, more droughts, more record-breaking heatwaves, more coral bleaching, more heat-related deaths and the list goes on. The great news – a faster transition to clean energy is entirely possible. Australia is in the midst of a renewables boom, we are building 6GWs of renewables and storage this year. If we can keep this rate going, we can move beyond coal generation for electricity by 2032 according to analysis by ANU. Unfortunately, what their analysis doesn’t state is that to keep building renewables at the current rate for the next decade, will require the removal of a number of significant barriers. Specifically, speeding up the timeframes for upgrading our transmission infrastructure (big poles and wires) and putting in place more ambitious policy support than either the ALP or Coalition currently has on the table. The current plans by the federal energy minister Angus Taylor to use taxpayer funds to support a new coal power station is just one example of Australia choosing the slow and costly path to clean energy. These efforts are tantamount to Taylor standing in front of the Townsville dam last week, trying to keep the floodgates closed. With a year’s worth of rain falling in nine days, the flooding of Townsville was unfortunately inevitable, the water was going to come over the spillway whether we liked it or not. Keeping the floodgates closed any longer would have just made the flooding worse and damaged the dam in the process. Taylor’s plans to support a new coal power station, delays the inevitable transition to clean energy. However, it damages the climate, investor confidence, Australia’s international reputation, will cost taxpayers billions of dollars in the process. While Labor is no doubt better than the Coalition on climate, even the ALP’s plans do little to put us on the right path. Indeed, everyone from the market operator, to the ALP are developing plans that are slower than the science says is necessary and what current industry growth shows is possible. Current industry and ALP plans only get only half of the job done by 2030. This is not good enough and it comes at a cost. Analysis of the ALP’s 50% renewables target by 2030 shows that the rate of renewables deployment would drop by 65% from current rates. That means a 75% reduction in renewable jobs between 2020 and 2030. A fair transition As we move to replace coal power stations with renewables and storage, there is no guarantee that we will look after the people most affected. The owners of Hazelwood gave their workers a mere five months warning that they would be out of a job. Meanwhile AGL which owns Liddell coal power station gave its workers a five-year warning, only to be subject to a scare campaign by the Federal Government, discouraging actions to drive a fairer transition. While more than six million Australians enjoy the opportunity to lower their carbon pollution and electricity bills through rooftop solar, the most vulnerable low-income renters are not able to enjoy the same benefits. Then there are the people most affected by climate change, be they Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory battling fracking or households in Western Sydney suffering from intense urban heat islands. There are practical and popular policy solutions to all these injustices – from the ALP’s proposed Just Transition Agency, to a new Solar for All rebate idea, to banning fracking and planting trees and upgrading building standards. We know what to do, we merely need our political leaders to get on with it. A fairer pathway is also faster. A fair energy transition involves everyone in the task be they the 30% of households locked out of solar or Australia’s coal communities and helps to remove opposition in the process. In the transition to renewables, people as well as the environment matter. For those of us who care deeply for this planet we call Earth and all that live on it, our job is clear: to ensure Australia and all other countries around the world choose the faster and fairer path to a clean energy future.

Well, we’re not laughing now, are we? On the day before the hottest day of the year so far (temperatures at Glastonbury hit 30C, elsewhere in the UK 35C), Crow knocks out hit after hit on the Pyramid stage under a giant globe, Glastonbury’s reminder that we’ve only got one planet, and dedicates Soak Up the Sun to Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist and school striker. Thunberg’s spirit is embedded in Worthy Farm this year. There are murals of her face with the slogan: “What would Greta do?” But another environmental legend makes it in person. David Attenborough, a surprise addition, comes out to enormous cheers from the massive crowd in front of the Pyramid stage – possibly the loudest of the entire festival. Giving a shoutout to Glastonbury for going plastic-free, he then introduces a little treat – a trailer for his next show, One Planet: Seven Worlds. This year’s festival has been sold as Glastonbury’s greenest ever. As Attenborough mentions, there has been a much-publicised ban on single-use plastic on site (although actually this is just a ban on vendors giving out single-use plastic; punters are allowed to bring in plastic bottles, but encouraged to reuse them at 850 refill points). At the last festival, in 2017, visitors used 1.3m plastic bottles, and the clean-up operation cost almost £800,000 and took six weeks – despite perennial pleas from Emily and Michael Eavis to “Love Worthy Farm, Leave No Trace”. Festivalgoers have been informed that leaving tent pegs in the ground could result in cows eating them and dying. Despite the 15,000 colour-coded bins, the site is still a sea of detritus. But nobody I speak to admits to having discarded, say, the Calvin Klein underpants I spot on the ground while queueing for ice-cream. (The ice-cream vans, of course, idle all day long, exhaust fumes mixing with the dust kicked up by thousands of marching feet. A lot of the stewards pair their fluorescent jackets with face masks.) There is excitement around Extinction Rebellion’s appearance on the Park stage on Thursday. Friends Harry Hayward and Minnie Bartley (both 22) and Joe Holley (23) are sitting in the park eating pizza, Harry in a multi-coloured umbrella hat (“It’s quite sweaty”). It’s their first time at Glastonbury. They want to talk about environmentalism and politics (it has been noted that more people yelled: “fuck the government and fuck Boris” at Stormzy’s Saturday headline set than will actually be able to vote for Johnson to be prime minister, while Zac Goldsmith was booed at his own event). “It’s definitely good that Glastonbury is pushing the green agenda. I’ve been on the last two out of three Extinction Rebellion marches in Leeds,” says Harry. “But we need to do something about this Tory government. Some of the reaction [to the climate demonstrations, to Thunberg’s parliamentary address] has been really negative.” Minnie has noticed an increase in people caring. “Even in a year, with things like plastic straws. Every little helps.” But Joe outlines the wider problem when he says that, in preparation for Glastonbury, he bought a reusable water bottle from Amazon, “and it came in so much packaging, loads of it”. The Extinction Rebellion set features Kurukindi, a Kichwa Amazonian shaman. Many in the crowd (some dressed in bee headdresses, or holding placards painted with whales) are visibly moved by his performance. Speeches by Extinction Rebellion’s co-founder, Gail Bradbrook, and Greenpeace’s Rosie Rogers follow. A huge cheer erupts when Rogers calls the MP Mark Field, who grabbed a Greenpeace protester by the back of the neck before marching her out, a “scumbag”. “The only thing we were armed with were leaflets and peer-reviewed science.” A procession to the stone circle, ending in people forming a giant human hourglass (because time is running out), is fairly shambolic, but Extinction Rebellion’s pastel pink boat – the one that hosted Emma Thompson in Oxford Circus, and is named after Berta Cáceres, the late Honduran activist – is even prettier in the flesh. At the Extinction Rebellion base in the Green Fields, Clarissa Carlyon, who has been volunteering with the group since October 2018 and was heavily involved in planning the April occupation, says Glastonbury has been really accommodating to the group. But is it enough, I ask. And doesn’t she think other festivals have been way ahead of the curve? Mandala festival in the Netherlands, or Shambala in Northamptonshire, for instance, which is powered by 100% renewable energy and doesn’t allow Coca-Cola and Nestlé products to be sold on site. “I think it’s really tough when you have something the size and scale of Glastonbury,” she says. “But they have given us this space, and other spaces, and we’ve got videos playing around. It is great that the festival is embracing what we’re talking about. I do feel it is seeping into the DNA of the place.” Glastonbury has long been conscious of its footprint. The reusable 80% recycled stainless steel cups sold on site for a fiver were originally produced in 2016 as a way to help support the besieged British steel industry. (Although I watch loads of people being served their drinks in cardboard cups even when they proffer their steel cup, and the cardboard cups do not always end up in the correct bins.) It is also customary that any tents left behind are repurposed. In 2016, a charity called Aid Box Convoy collected abandoned tents and sent them to refugee camps in Europe. (But it is estimated that 90% of tents left at festivals end up as landfill.) At a Leftfield event called How to Save Our Planet, the Labour MP Clive Lewis and Minnie Rahman, from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, point out that climate justice intersects with social, racial and class justice. Rahman says: “White people are overwhelmingly represented in the climate movement. I’d really like to see the movement taking forward the connection that climate change doesn’t affect us all equally. We see people in the global south, for instance, dying to protect their land, or the health impacts in parts of Britain because of air pollution.” A panel by gal-dem makes similar points in their own discussions. The Leftfield tent is rammed. Although a few brims of straw hats are sliding down noses in the midday heat, the Green party’s Caroline Lucas is afforded a rock-star welcome and a huge cheer goes up when she mentions Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Lucas’s reference to the Green New Deal, a private member’s bill she has tabled with Lewis that is inspired by Ocasio-Cortez, is met with a cacophony of applause. An audience member mooting the role nuclear power might have in addition to renewables is quickly talked down. The Norwegian singer Aurora released A Different Kind of Human (Step II), an album themed around ecological disaster, earlier this month. Before performing on the John Peel stage, she tells me that she always knew the album was going to be about the climate crisis. When I ask if she will be sticking around after her set, the answer is no, because she is flying to Belgium. What does she do to lessen her own environmental impact, especially when touring? She mentions wooden toothbrushes and being vegetarian. Johannes Hogebrink, an artist from Amsterdam, has also flown to the UK for Glastonbury and is busy crafting a sand sculpture for Extinction Rebellion. The sculpture is a huge skull with a beetle crawling out of one eye and money coming out of the mouth. “You cannot eat money, oh no!” as Aurora’s song The Seed has it. Over at the Shangri-La, this year’s theme is “Junkstaposition” and it is home to the Disruption Bureau, a training centre for activists. Organisations including Amnesty International and Extinction Rebellion offer activities such as placard-making and flag-printing, but the most common interactions I observe are the handing out of leaflets and the signing of petitions. However, there is a great audio installation by Echoic Audio called Memory Tree, and the open-air art pieces are impressive, if not beautiful (that’s kind of the point), including trees that are made from assorted waste. The Gas Tower is made entirely from recovered ocean plastic. Before her panel, I ask Lucas about Glastonbury 2011, when she appeared on the Pyramid stage before Wu-Tang Clan. “It was great,” she says, “inspiring and exciting. But terrifying.” She is thrilled that young ipeople are taking up the climate cause, such as George Bond, a 16-year-old activist, also on the panel. Equally inspiring at the other end of the age spectrum is Barbara Richardson, here on behalf of the Fracking Nanas. Bond throws an important date out, 20 September, which he says will be “the largest climate demonstration this country ever has seen. It’s gonna be huge, it’s gonna be beautiful, but it’s also gonna be filled with anger and rage that nothing has been done.” Last week, the government pledged to get net emissions down to zero by 2050. But it is simply not good enough. As Lucas puts it, it’s a bit like calling the fire brigade in an emergency and asking them to turn up in 30 years’ time. As the burning sun goes down and jumpers are pulled out from backpacks, a man tosses his chip wrapper on the ground, his mate crushing a can before hurling it into the grass. A bunch of people take cocaine in the gloaming, which in its own way is ravaging the parts of the world Kurikunda talked about protecting. Glastonbury is making a massive effort, albeit with room for improvement. And the ecstatic response to Attenborough is an indication that environmentalism is much cooler than it ever was – people genuinely care now. But we’ll know soon enough whether the festivalgoers matched the organisers’ green aspirations and took away with them not just brilliant memories, possible sunburn and multiple blisters, but all the other rubbish they were asked politely to do so."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/sep/07/north-korea-turns-70-all-eyes-on-missile-displays-at-biggest-parade-of-the-year","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-09-07T00:49:39Z","webTitle":"North Korea turns 70: all eyes on missile displays at upcoming military parade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/07/north-korea-turns-70-all-eyes-on-missile-displays-at-biggest-parade-of-the-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/sep/07/north-korea-turns-70-all-eyes-on-missile-displays-at-biggest-parade-of-the-year","fields":{"headline":"North Korea turns 70: all eyes on missile displays at upcoming military parade","bodyText":"North Korea is set to hold a massive military parade on Sunday to mark the 70th anniversary of the country’s founding, a powerful display of martial might as talks with the US over the country’s nuclear weapons program stall. The parade will coincide with visits from foreign dignitaries and a large-scale choreographed performance known as the Mass Games, held for the first time in five years. The display of military hardware and phalanxes of goosestepping soldiers is likely to be larger than another parade held earlier this year, though more subdued compared with last year, according to analysis. Whether large intercontinental ballistic missiles are included in the parade will be key. They could be seen as a provocative move. North Korea has suspended nuclear and missile tests as talks continue with US officials. Satellite images did not show vehicles used for carrying ICBMs in the parade staging area, but “they could still be onsite but housed in the heavy equipment shelters”, according to monitoring group 38 North. It will “likely be considerably larger than the military parade earlier this year,” 38 North analyst Joseph Bermudez wrote. Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who focused on North Korea policy, said: “If it does display ICBMs, it would be wise for the United States to take it in stride as another North Korean propaganda spectacle and not as something that should materially affect negotiations.” Oba added: “North Korea has been consistent in signalling that it is strong, able to defend itself, and that its status as a nuclear power is a done deal. I imagine those are the biggest themes we'll see here. “I would be surprised if North Korea did anything in this parade to compromise negotiations or President Trump took something in the parade as a reason not to continue engaging North Korea.” The last parade held in February saw 13,000 soldiers participate as about 50,000 people gathered in Pyongyang’s Kim Il-sung square to watch, according to the South’s Yonhap news agency. North Korea showcased its Hwasong-15 long-range ICBM, theoretically capable of striking most of the US mainland with a range of 13,000km (8,000 miles). Vipin Narang, a politics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that for Sunday’s procession “the most provocative move would be for Kim to parade new nuclear capable systems that we have not seen before”. “The signal in this case would be: ‘not only did I say I’m not unilaterally disarming, but I’ve even got some new toys in the works.’” But he added it was unlikely Kim would want to be so aggressive while their talks with the US continue. China will send Li Zhanshu, chairman of the National People’s Congress and senior advisor to president Xi Jinping, to attend the parade, after rumours that Xi himself would travel to Pyongyang in what would be his first official trip to North Korea. The warm atmosphere of Donald Trump’s meeting with Kim in June has largely faded, and there has been little progress on the goal of “complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula”. Trump cancelled a trip by secretary of state Mike Pompeo last month and the US could resume large-scale military exercises, halted as a good will gesture, next year if North Korea does not make progress on relinquishing its nuclear arsenal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2019/feb/03/green-new-deal-climate-change-jobs-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-03T16:59:18Z","webTitle":"Climate change 2020: can the Democrats make it an election issue?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/03/green-new-deal-climate-change-jobs-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2019/feb/03/green-new-deal-climate-change-jobs-plan","fields":{"headline":"Climate change 2020: can the Democrats make it an election issue?","bodyText":"Carl Shoupe, a 71-year-old who lives in Benham, Kentucky, at the foot of the tallest mountain in the state, does not feel well served by America. When he came back from Vietnam, he went to work in the coalmines. At 22, he was nearly killed by a roof collapse. He spent a year on his back in the hospital. When he was mobile again, he got a job with the United Mine Workers Union. But after 12 years his injuries flared up and he had to quit. Then Vietnam memories started coming back, and he took to alcohol and pills. “I was a wasted man for several years,” he recalled. In September 2005, everything changed. He went to church and got sober. When his mind was clear, he didn’t like what he saw. “Man,” he said, “I seen all this destruction the coal companies were doing, tearing the mountains down.” Since then, Shoupe has worked with Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, a grassroots environmental and social justice group that wants to do things like insulate old camp homes and use the energy savings to pay the costs. It is also looking to create jobs to replace those that left with the mining companies as coal use declined. Such ideas could now form the backbone of a national strategy that more and more Democrats are supporting and which will also aim to help slow the pace of climate change: a Green New Deal. The concept has the backing of the 2020 presidential contenders Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren and the likely candidate Bernie Sanders. The New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts senator Ed Markey will soon roll out a brief outline. A Green New Deal will aim to spur jobs and tackle inequity. It will aim to help people of color and indigenous communities. And it will try to help places like Benham, Kentucky. But most importantly, people involved say, the document will push candidates for the White House to explain what they plan to do about climate change. “Where 2020 contenders stand on this legislation will make it clear who is using the Green New Deal as a buzzword and who is serious about transforming our economy in line with what science and justice demand,” said Varshini Prakash, founder of the Sunrise Movement, a youth climate advocacy group. The concept is already entering the mainstream. Earlier this week, Harris declared her support, telling an Iowa town hall: “Climate change is an existential threat to us, and we have got to deal with the reality of it.” The California senator also touted statistics projecting huge growth in wind and solar power jobs. Behind the scenes, environmental groups, unions and climate justice advocates have been laying out their thoughts on what a Green New Deal should include. A challenge on Capitol Hill For people like Shoupe, it’s hard to get excited just yet. They need help now, while climate scientists stress that the world is already off the pace, having failed to begin phasing out coal and petroleum and working to limit greenhouse gas emissions from industry, agriculture and land use. Donald Trump is still president, still openly doubting climate change science. Then there is the legislative challenge a Green New Deal would present, even if all the groups involved could agree on the best way forward. So far, organizations are aligning around general aspirations, people familiar with discussions said. As concrete policy is generated, that will become more difficult. One conflict will come around whether a Green New Deal can include nuclear power, which is carbon-free but runs on mined uranium. Another will regard the use of carbon sequestration, a technology to collect and store emissions from power plants, thereby letting them keep running. Basav Sen, who works with a national consortium of groups, the Climate Justice Alliance, is against the inclusion of nuclear and carbon sequestration. “There can be disagreement about other things,” he said, “[but] those are things there’s no compromise on.” For Paul Getsos, national director of the Peoples Climate Movement, an umbrella group for community organizations and environmental justice and labor groups, the Green New Deal “has to be about reducing emissions” as well as building a more just economy. Working with unions, meanwhile, could make it hard to set specific goals for phasing out fossil fuels, because organized labor represents people working in coal, oil and gas, steel and concrete: all sources of greenhouse gases. The plan could also divide Democrats in Congress. Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland has been calling for a “green deal” including a carbon fee and dividend. “Enthusiasm on the Democratic side is overwhelming,” he said, adding that he favored “a comprehensive deal that commits us to meet goals [with] some detailed policy commitments built into it”. But he acknowledged: “I know some members of the House have concerns about overly ambitious goals built into the Green New Deal, such as trying to wean us off fossil fuels in a decade.” One such member was John Delaney of Maryland, who left the House last month in order to run for president. In January, he told the Guardian: “There’s a way of doing something really big on climate change in my opinion: it involves putting a price on carbon … That’s the best way to do it: it’s a market-based solution. But suddenly some people are saying, ‘No, no, that’s not good enough, we’ve got to go further, we’ve got to basically ban carbon in 10 years.’ Now, that’s just not going to happen. “I worry that they move the goalposts to a point where you can’t get anything done and I think that plays into Trump’s hands, actually.” Advocates insist nonetheless that they have an opportunity to overcome such obstacles. Ben Beachy, with the Sierra Club, said he has been happy “to see just how much alignment on the broad goals there has been”. Furthermore, for once, some say they might have an advantage in the messaging war. Julian Brave NoiseCat, a policy analyst for the climate group 350.org and a Guardian contributor, said: “Climate change and climate policy has been framed through tradeoffs, scarcity and sacrifice for so long. “But what’s powerful about the Green New Deal is it frames it as: ‘We can build and provide millions of jobs and do phenomenal things for everyday people through climate policy.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/dec/29/green-new-deal-plans-proposal-ocasio-cortez-sunrise-movement","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-29T11:00:17Z","webTitle":"What is the Green New Deal and is it technically possible?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/29/green-new-deal-plans-proposal-ocasio-cortez-sunrise-movement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/dec/29/green-new-deal-plans-proposal-ocasio-cortez-sunrise-movement","fields":{"headline":"What is the Green New Deal and is it technically possible?","bodyText":"Most US voters would support a “Green New Deal”, for the country to transform its infrastructure with a rapid shift to clean energy. But while the idea is gaining attention on Capitol Hill, it lacks key political support. According to a survey from the Yale Climate Change Communication program, 81% of voters backed its description of a Green New Deal. Similar plans vary in detail, but all are inspired by the New Deal that Franklin Delano Roosevelt launched to battle the effects of the Great Depression. The idea was central to the high-profile campaign of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young Democratic socialist from New York who won a US House seat in November. Ocasio-Cortez and the youth-led Sunrise Movement are encouraging Democrats, who will retake the House majority in January, to produce a blueprint. Their Green New Deal would center around creating new jobs and lessening inequality. Aiming to virtually eliminate US greenhouse gas pollution in a decade, it would be radical compared with other climate proposals. It would require massive government spending. Dozens of Democrats have signaled support, including potential 2020 presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker. This month, New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo said his state would launch its own Green New Deal, seeking carbon-neutral electricity by 2040. But Nancy Pelosi, Democrats’ nominee to run the House, has not agreed to direct a select committee on climate change to focus on the strategy. Why now? With Republicans in control of the White House and Senate, any climate change legislation would be dead on arrival. But supporters of a Green New Deal say Democrats need to lay the groundwork for a plan that could achieve what scientists say is necessary. “If you’re starting to organize on it after you get into power, it’s too late,” said Sunrise Movement founder Varshini Prakash. Scientists say the landmark Paris agreement on climate change, which the US plans to leave, is not strong enough to avoid the worst effects of rising temperatures. The earth is on track for 3-4C degrees of warming, which would cause sea level rise of several feet and make extreme weather more frequent and dangerous. The next four to 12 years are critical if the world wants to limit that warming. Waiting to reduce greenhouse gases will make the challenge harder. So far, US government efforts to meet the challenge have failed, including an effort by Democrats for cap-and-trade and Barack Obama’s rules to reduce coal use, which the courts stalled and Donald Trump is rescinding. Republicans have largely opposed any substantial action. But a few have joined Democrats in backing a tax on carbon pollution. How would it work? The Sunrise Movement’s Green New Deal would eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from electricity, transportation, manufacturing, agriculture and other sectors within 10 years. It would also aim for 100% renewable energy and includes a job guarantee program “to assure a living wage job to every person who wants one”. It would seek to “mitigate deeply entrenched racial, regional and gender-based inequalities in income and wealth”. Other groups have floated a more flexible vision. Greg Carlock, an energy expert writing for the group Data for Progress, proposed reaching 100% clean or renewable energy in 15 years, allowing more time to decarbonize other sectors. Demond Drummer, founder of the New Consensus thinktank, said it was working on a plan that will require a reimagining of the whole US economy. “You can’t address the climate crisis without these other issues being addressed as well,” he said. “The entire economy is built around fossil fuels. The same economy that creates rampant poverty and wage stagnation is the economy that’s built around fossil fuels.” Is it technically possible? With enough money and political will, the US electric grid could make major changes. Currently, the US gets 17% of its power from renewable energy and less than half of that is from wind and solar, the quickly growing renewable sources, according to the Energy Information Administration. Nuclear power, which uses mined uranium but is carbon free, makes up 20% of the grid. Turning to all-renewable power would require large amounts of battery storage, for when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining. The technology is not available but it is advancing. Christine Tezak, an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners, said decarbonizing electricity in 10 to 15 years would be “practically overnight in infrastructure terms”, even if policymakers allowed low-polluting technologies too. A mid-century goal would be more reasonable, she said. Decarbonizing the rest of the economy would be “an even heavier lift, particularly given what we consider to be the absence of a bipartisan catalyst of any sort in the next two years”, she said. Is it politically possible? Right now, no. But proponents say that shouldn’t stop them pushing the envelope. Republicans are unlikely to support any Green New Deal, which would require acknowledging the threats posed by climate change and increasing spending to avoid them. The proposal could be divisive among Democrats too. Much of it goes beyond addressing climate change and invokes more of the progressive platform. While voters like the idea of eliminating greenhouse gases, they may not sign on for the costs unless lawmakers can definitively show a Green New Deal would stimulate the economy and improve their lives. Tezak said she expects the country to remain divided in terms of how fast to cut climate pollution, because some places are more dependent on fossil fuels and would have a harder time transitioning. Meeting the ambitious timeline would require “substantive action well before the 2020 election results are in” and “a strong swing toward very progressive policies”, she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2021/oct/13/australia-covid-news-new-south-wales-victoria-coalition-climate-cop26-environment-act-victoria-lockdown-vaccination-barnaby-morrison-","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-13T07:46:20Z","webTitle":"TGA grants provisional determination of Pfizer vaccine for ages 5-11 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/oct/13/australia-covid-news-new-south-wales-victoria-coalition-climate-cop26-environment-act-victoria-lockdown-vaccination-barnaby-morrison-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2021/oct/13/australia-covid-news-new-south-wales-victoria-coalition-climate-cop26-environment-act-victoria-lockdown-vaccination-barnaby-morrison-","fields":{"headline":"TGA grants provisional determination of Pfizer vaccine for ages 5-11 – as it happened","bodyText":"What we learned, Wednesday 13 October: With that, we’ll wrap up the blog for this evening. Here’s what we learned today: The Therapeutic Goods Administration has told Pfizer it can apply for vaccine approval for five- to 11-year-olds. The former senator Nick Xenophon is planning to run as an independent for the upper house in the next election. It comes as the NSW Liberal MP Melanie Gibbons quits state politics to contest the federal seat of Hughes, currently held by Craig Kelly. NSW recorded 444 new local Covid-19 cases and four deaths. The state will confirm its 80% reopening plan tomorrow. Melbourne’s Royal Children’s hospital is on high alert after a Covid-positive person visited the neonatal ward. Victoria recorded 1,571 new locally acquired cases and 13 deaths as the state’s youngest ICU patient urged anyone eligible to get the vaccine. The Mitchell shire will be released from lockdown at midnight. The high court has ruled against Clive Palmer and his company Mineralogy in a challenge against a Western Australian law banning him from seeking billions of dollars in compensation. The academic Peter Ridd lost his high court appeal against James Cook University. The ACT recorded its second-most infectious day ever, with 51 local Covid cases. The vaccination will become mandatory for teachers. All frontline workers in the Northern Territory must get vaccinated as the territory pushes to boost vaccination rates in vulnerable communities. The former New South Wales premier Mike Baird and the newly sworn-in deputy Liberal leader, Stuart Ayres, have been called to give evidence at next week’s hearings into the conduct of Gladys Berejiklian. And a traveller who breached hotel quarantine has tested positive to Covid-19 in Hobart. The airport has been listed as an exposure site. Reports Australia will cease locally producing the AstraZeneca vaccine. A stonemason has died after being crushed by a forklift at a factory in Melbourne’s north, as a solar installer was handed a hefty fine for multiple worksite safety breaches, AAP reports. The forklift was being operated on a sloping driveway at the Somerton factory on Tuesday when it tipped and crushed a worker standing nearby. The 25-year-old stonemason was killed and WorkSafe is investigating the incident, the watchdog confirmed on Wednesday. It comes after solar panel installer Global Renewable Energy Solutions was on Monday found guilty of five workplace safety breaches at sites across Victoria and ordered to pay $500,000 in fines. Werribee magistrates court heard three workers were installing a solar electrical system on a 4.5-metre-high Werribee South shed in June 2019 when one of them fell through a skylight to the concrete floor below. The worker fractured his spine and pelvis, and spent more than a week in hospital. WorkSafe found there was no perimeter guardrail on the roof or fall protection around the skylight, none of the workers were using a safety harness and a “method statement” did not identify skylights were in the roof. It also ruled Global Renewable Energy Solutions had engaged in unsafe practices at four other rooftop solar installation sites at Cobram, Truganina, Newham and Corio that same year. Andrew Keen, WorkSafe’s executive director of health and safety, said the company had shown a continued disregard for its workers’ safety: This case should serve as a wake-up call to any employer that thinks it can put profits above the safety of its workers. Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration has issued a release granting a provisional determination to Pfizer for children between five and 11: On 12 October 2021, the TGA, part of the Department of Health, granted a provisional determination to Pfizer Australia Pty Ltd in relation to its Covid-19 Vaccine, Comirnaty. Currently, Comirnaty is provisionally approved for use in individuals 12 years of age or older. The granting of this determination means that Pfizer is now eligible to apply to vary the provisional approval for the vaccine to include children aged 5 to 11 years. This provisional determination is the first step in the process and does not mean that an application for variation has been made by the sponsor – or that any such variation will be provisionally approved by the TGA. In making its decision to grant Pfizer a provisional determination for use in individuals 5 to 11 years, the TGA considered eligibility criteria, including factors such as the evidence of a plan to submit comprehensive clinical data in relation to use in this age group – and the seriousness of the current Covid-19 pandemic. Victoria’s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, has told the ABC’s Raf Epstein there is a possibility lockdown restrictions will be lifted earlier than planned if vaccination targets are met. Net zero commitments are rolling in thick and fast, as the federal cabinet debates its own plans for 2050. Tasmania became fully powered by renewable energy in November last year, in large part due to its wind and hydro-electricity projects. It has achieved net zero emissions in six of the past seven years. An industry-wide strike of delivery workers planned for next week may be avoided after one courier company reached an in-principle agreement with staff over conditions and job protection, AAP reports. The union hopes other companies will soon follow suit. Union members from Toll, Linfox, StarTrack, FedEx and BevChain voted last week for a day of national strike action, an escalation after six months of stalled negotiations. But workers at Toll have now reached an in-principle agreement with their bosses, which will go to union delegates for a vote on Friday. If the agreement is endorsed, they will pull out of the planned strike. The Transport Workers’ Union is pushing for its members to get better job security, with limits on the use of outsourcing. Contract workers are paid less, which the TWU says makes them more attractive to employers, thereby creating job insecurity for permanent staff. The union says the Toll deal would mean outside workers are paid the same as employees, outsourcing is limited, and employees get first dibs on work before it is sent elsewhere. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, is getting around donuts. Case numbers have increased by 36% in regional NSW. NSW Liberal MP Melanie Gibbons will quit state politics to contest preselection for Craig Kelly’s federal seat. Prime minister Scott Morrison has been urged to put regional communities at the centre of his plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050, AAP’s Georgia Moore reports. Morrison was meeting with cabinet colleagues on Wednesday afternoon to thrash out the final details of his “new energy economy” plan, which would set a 2050 target and update the target of cutting emissions to 26 to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030. A cabinet-approved plan will need to run the gauntlet of a Nationals party room meeting scheduled for Sunday afternoon, just ahead of a two-week parliamentary sitting and the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow later in the month. Speaking before the meeting, cabinet minister Bridget McKenzie demanded the Nationals be “respected as the second party of government” in negotiations where calls for agriculture and resources sector concessions have been a sticking point. This actual debate isn’t about climate change, it’s about regions. We haven’t supported anything that has been put before this parliament previously because it hasn’t been right for the regions. Agriculture minister David Littleproud has seen the detail of the plan and indicated the junior coalition partner wouldn’t simply roll over. Barnaby Joyce won’t be accepting any deal unless the National party room accepts it. No individual will make a determination of that. We are a party room of 21. Energy minister Angus Taylor maintained the coalition would stick by Australia’s resources sector while talking up rural and regional opportunities for carbon abatement. You have to make sure that you’re abating (emissions), that you’re carrying them in your soil, that you’re sequestering them under the ground so those industries can continue to have a great future. The Morrison government has so far only expressed a “preference” for a target of net zero by 2050. But other countries and business and industry groups have been pressing for a strong commitment from Australia ahead of Cop26. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has committed his party to legislating a net zero by 2050 target and raising the existing 2030 target, which he says has the ability to create jobs while cutting emissions. He questioned the Liberal-National coalition’s commitment to climate action. Covid-19 exposure sites have been listed in the northeast Victorian rural city of Wangaratta. Some 50 Queensland schools will have on-site GPs next year as part of a pilot program to roll out from May. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk: For many young people, getting in to see a GP is often difficult and expensive. We know that one of the greatest barriers for many young people is the difficulty in finding a GP that bulk bills. The last 18 months have affected us all. Our students, in particular, have had to overcome great challenges throughout the pandemic. This has undoubtedly had an impact on their health and wellbeing. Victoria’s minister for energy, environment and climate change, Lily D’Ambrosio has responded to a report by the state’s auditor general that has found the government can’t demonstrate how well, or even if, it is managing to halt the decline of endangered wildlife. We reported some of the findings of this review earlier including that the state’s environment department relies on old, potentially outdated data on threatened species, tells the public little about the “cost, quality or effectiveness” of its work, is significantly underfunded by the Andrews government and does not make use of all of the powers available to it under the law to protect the state’s unique plants and animals. D’Ambrosio has provided Guardian Australia with a statement, though it doesn’t go directly to the findings of the report: The decline in biodiversity is a global challenge – exacerbated by climate change, and Victoria’s early history of land clearing. In response we’re making record investments to protect our precious native flora and fauna. We are also leading the way on our climate change response - cutting our greenhouse gas emissions at the fastest rate in the country as we work towards halving our emissions by 2030. D’Ambrosio said since the Andrews government released in 2017 a 20-year plan for protecting Victoria’s biodiversity it had provided an extra $400m “to deliver environmental initiatives and we have invested more than $270m in the past two state budgets to protect our key waterways and catchments”: Responding to this global challenge is urgent and we make no apologies for prioritising on-the-ground action to protect the largest amount of species possible. Josh Nicholas has just updated the Guardian’s chart comparing how the Delta outbreak is tracking in NSW, Victoria and the ACT. Satisfyingly, there is a definite bending of the curve in NSW. Victoria’s health authorities are combining Melbourne’s hatred of lockdowns with its love of sport. Over at Ibac: The Queensland government has agreed to terms of a memorandum of understanding with the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, which could soon lead to the exporting of hydrogen to Europe’s largest port. The Port of Rotterdam has an ambition to import up to 20 million tonnes of hydrogen by 2050, starting with imports of ammonia in 2025. The agreement would see Queensland and the Port of Rotterdam collaborate on opportunities to develop a hydrogen export supply chain between Queensland hydrogen producers and Rotterdam. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk: This is the start of the green industrial revolution and the announcements this week prove that Queensland has what it takes to be a global leader in renewable energy and hydrogen. Mining magnate Andrew ‘Twiggy’ Forrest says green energy will one day dwarf the size of the iron ore and coal industries and he is demanding “short-termists” stop betraying the trust of voters, AAP reports. Up to $3bn in government incentives for “green hydrogen” energy projects will be on offer as part of NSW’s new hydrogen strategy, unveiled today. The state will also exempt green hydrogen production from government charges, significantly discount electricity network charges, and roll out a hydrogen refuelling network. Green hydrogen power involves the use of renewable energy sources to split water molecules and extract energy which can be used for household power, vehicles and industry. The NSW government hopes to attract more than $80bn in private investment to the sector. Forrest, appearing alongside premier Dominic Perrottet and treasurer Matt Kean, said he intends to co-develop green hydrogen hubs in NSW through Fortescue Future Industries. A plan by Forrest to build a hydrogen-gas turbine power station in the Illawarra region was declared in August to be “critical state-significant infrastructure” and will be fast-tracked. The Port Kembla station will use up to 5% green hydrogen. Forrest told reporters fossil fuels had enjoyed a “magnificent day” but belittling green energy was tantamount to denying the future: There will be no bigger industry than green hydrogen, ammonia, electricity ... it will dwarf the scale of iron ore and coal. I just say this to everyone concerned about this massive global-scale green energy and green product future coming our way ... do not deny your voters, constituents, their future. To talk down and belittle the huge green energy sector, which will be the largest in the world, to your constituents, means you’re betraying their trust in you, you’re giving them absolute falsehoods. It will last as long as mankind is on this planet. Kean said he hoped to make NSW one of the world’s best places to invest in green hydrogen: Nothing will secure our energy future more than taking advantage of our abundance of renewable energy (sources) and providing products like hydrogen to the rest of the world. And we’ll make a lot of money doing so. News of the incentives comes days after Queensland announced Gladstone will become a world-leading hub for the manufacture of electrolysers - vital to the production of renewable hydrogen. The federal education minister, Alan Tudge, has released a statement on the high court’s upholding of Peter Ridd’s sacking. He says he is “concerned that employment conditions should never be allowed to have a chilling effect on free speech”. In other environmental news today, Victoria’s auditor general has published a scathing report on the state government’s management of threatened species. The audit finds the state’s Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning can’t demonstrate if, or how well, it is going in halting the decline of Victoria’s endangered wildlife. Among the issues, the audit finds the department relies on old, potentially outdated data on threatened species, tells the public little about the “cost, quality or effectiveness” of its work, is significantly underfunded by the Andrews government and does not make use of all of the powers available to it under the law to protect the state’s unique plants and animals. The report is reminiscent of another audit that was released last year by the federal auditor general that made similar findings about the federal environment department’s work managing assessments under national environmental laws. The Victorian audit makes nine recommendations, including that the department develop a new monitoring program to assess how well wildlife is responding to environmental management work and that it make use of all tools available to it under the law. It also recommends the department develop criteria to help it prioritise species after the audit found some plants and animals at extreme risk of extinction were being missed in the department’s work. The department has accepted all nine recommendations. Brendan Sydes, of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said although the report was very critical of the department, it was the Victorian government that needed to take responsibility: The auditor general’s report shows the Victorian government isn’t even attempting to protect some of the state’s most endangered threatened species. The lack of monitoring or reporting on progress to protect threatened species highlighted by the audit should be a great concern to all Victorians. Without the commitment, systems or resources to track progress the public is being kept in the dark about the perilous situation faced by our threatened species and the lack of government action to address the situation. Guardian Australia sought comment from Victoria’s minister for energy, environment and climate change, Lily D’Ambrosio. The Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, has confirmed a 31-year-old man who breached quarantine in Hobart has tested positive to Covid-19: A 31-year-old New South Wales man arrived in Tasmania via Melbourne on Monday evening, despite his to go pass having been refused. He was placed in quarantine at the hotel in Hobart that night, the following welfare check undertaken by security on Tuesday afternoon he was found not to be in his room. The police were immediately notified and tried to locate him. Late yesterday afternoon he was located in the northern suburbs of Hobart by police. He was immediately returned to hotel quarantine and additional security was allocated to him. The man has been tested overnight and through this morning for Covid-19. It has been confirmed that he has returned a positive result ... It bothers me greatly that when the vast majority of Tasmanians do the right thing, day in and day out, people will put others at risk ... The 31-year-old will receive two fines totalling just over $3,000, one for breaching quarantine and one for attempting to enter the state without necessary approvals. The former New South Wales premier Mike Baird and the newly sworn-in deputy Liberal leader, Stuart Ayres, have been called to give evidence at next week’s hearings into the conduct of Gladys Berejiklian. The Independent Commission Against Corruption has just released the witness list for the first week of hearings, which will investigate whether Berejiklian broke the law by failing to report the conduct of her ex-lover, the former Wagga Wagga MP Daryl Maguire. Berejiklian’s bombshell resignation a fortnight ago followed Icac’s announcement that it had broadened its investigation to include an investigation into whether she had been involved in “a breach of public trust” between 2012 and 2018 because of her relationship with Maguire. In its statement a fortnight ago, Icac also announced it was investigating whether Berejiklian’s conduct “involved the dishonest or partial exercise of any of her official functions”. The former premier has consistently denied she acted improperly during her relationship with Maguire. During her resignation speech she said: “I state categorically that I have always acted with the highest level of integrity.” Among the witness names released ahead of next week’s hearings are Berejiklian’s predecessor, Mike Baird, who led the state from 2014 to 2017, and Ayres, the minister for western Sydney and tourism who was sworn in as the deputy leader of the Liberal party last week. Ayres was formerly the sport minister. The witness list also includes Nigel Blunden, a veteran political strategist who worked for Baird when he was premier, Chris Hanger, a deputy secretary in the Department of Regional NSW, Michael Toohey, a director in the NSW Office of Sport, and Paul Doorn, a former Office of Sport director who now heads up Rugby NSW. At the centre of the Icac investigation are grants to two organisations: the Australian Clay Target Association in 2016-17, which Maguire had championed, and the Riverina Conservatorium of Music in Wagga Wagga in 2018. It certainly shows what stage Victoria is at in the pandemic – prioritising vaccination rates over Covid-19 transmission – that Greater Shepparton won’t head back into a snap lockdown despite 21 new local cases overnight. The Mitchell shire was also released from lockdown today despite ongoing transmission in the LGA. Over in the rich marine world, turtles have come out of their shell early for nesting season in Queensland this year. One of the world’s most important nesting sites in Bundaberg has welcomed its first turtle a month earlier than expected. The state member for Bundaberg, Tom Smith, said on Saturday night 9 October the first flatback turtle had arrived on the shores of Mon Repos. This is the earliest recorded beginning to nesting season on the Woongarra Coast. To mark the arrival of the first turtle, Bundaberg has the long-standing tradition of ringing church bells. Mon Repos acting ranger Nicole Murnane said the ringing of the bells was based on an ancient Scottish tradition to welcome fishing boats back to port. Mon Repos supports the largest concentration of nesting marine turtles on the eastern Australian mainland and has the most significant loggerhead turtle nesting population in the South Pacific region. The success of nesting and hatching turtles at Mon Repos aids the survival of the endangered loggerhead turtle. More from Ibac, which has just adjourned for lunch: Here is some more clarity on the Northern Territory mandating the vaccine by 14 November from a ministerial release. Workers who are required to get the Covid-19 vaccine are: Workers who come into direct contact with people who are at risk of severe illness from Covid, including Aboriginal people and people who cannot be vaccinated due to age or a medical condition. Workers who are at an increased risk of contracting Covid-19 because they work in a high-risk setting where there is a known risk of Covid-19 transmission or outbreak. Workers who perform work in essential infrastructure, food or essential good security or supply, or logistics in the territory. This hasn’t been independently confirmed by the Guardian, but hopefully we will receive an update from health authorities later today. The National Tertiary Education Union has released a statement on the termination of the employment of Dr Peter Ridd. It says the high court has “endorsed the key principles of academic and intellectual freedom” despite finding James Cook University was within its right to terminate Ridd. Ridd was issued with two censures by James Cook University and in 2018 his employment was terminated for serious misconduct under the enterprise agreement. Ridd fought the university, arguing his conduct was an exercise of intellectual freedom. In its judgment delivered today, the court found: The 2016 Censure and part of the basis of the Final Censure were unjustified because they related to the expression of honestly held views by Ridd within his academic expertise. It also found “intellectual freedom is not qualified by a requirement to afford respect and courtesy in the manner of its exercise.” The NTEU general secretary, Matthew McGowan, said: As the High Court found ... Ridd was exercising his legitimate rights to academic freedom ... James Cook University should never have taken disciplinary action against Ridd in the first place. The High Court’s findings demonstrate the only real protections for academic freedom in Australia are in the enterprise agreements negotiated by the NTEU. Enterprise agreements are the only effective legal remedy to protect academic and intellectual freedom. We reassert the NTEU’s commitment to academic freedom, even where its expression contains statements that are controversial or unpopular. Academic staff must have the right to engage in robust scientific, political and academic debates without fear of retribution, otherwise universities will cease to be worthy of the title. More updates from the Ibac hearing, where the Labor staffer Adam Sullivan continues to be questioned. Back in Victoria, the Guardian reporter Josh Taylor has found the state’s vaccination certificates, which are contained in the Service Victoria app, can be faked within minutes. The certificates are key to proving a person’s vaccination status when the state emerges from lockdown at 70% vaccination targets. The Northern Territory chief health officer, Hugh Heggie, is urging his community to get vaccinated. We’ve seen Heggie relatively infrequently, because the NT has managed to have just two short lockdowns and no lives lost throughout the pandemic. He addresses anti-vaccination influencers who have been infiltrating Aboriginal communities: I know some of the influencers and they are from the US anti-vax lobby and faith organisations. They may be the same. They’re using social media particularly in Aboriginal communities and they’ve done this before when we had the measles outbreak. There’s a whole explanation that people won’t get it, God will save us. I’ve said ‘well maybe God sent us the immunisation and the vaccine ... to help us’. The Pope and his representative said recently getting the vaccine and indeed before Christmas is a gift from God. Border rules between NSW and the ACT are likely to be fully loosened in December. From December, fully vaccinated travellers from hotspots can undertake home quarantine instead of quarantining in Alice Springs or Howard Springs. Gunner says: In the New Year, we’ll take more steps, bigger steps, to safely relax quarantine restrictions. These steps could include reducing the 14-day quarantine period of vaccinated people or allowing vaccinated people to leave quarantine as soon as they’ve returned a negative test result and comply with an ongoing testing regime. It will also include welcoming back vaccinated people from overseas on the same conditions. Just a reminder – these changed rules will only be for vaccinated travellers. Unvaccinated people from hotspots outside the territory will see no changes. Gunner: This is not about stigmatising or demonising those communities. I don’t want that to happen and I ask the media, let’s not do that. It is about highlighting there is still a lot of work to do. All this points to one conclusion – despite the high overall vaccination rate, we are not where we want to be in all parts of the territory. This is not a remote versus urban thing. This is not an Aboriginal versus non- Aboriginal thing. I want to remind everyone, the vast majority of remote Aboriginal Territorians are getting vaccinated. There is one thing I can promise you – 100% guarantee, Covid-19 will hit the territory at some stage. It will spread here. We have held it off for more than 18 months but we cannot hold it off forever. Because we are not keeping our borders closed forever. Gunner is turning to the vaccination rollout, which is, worryingly, lagging in certain high-risk communities. This week, the NT reached 80% first vaccination doses for people over 16. Gunner says he doesn’t want to single communities out, but cites Yuendumu as sitting at just 20% first doses despite six separate visits from health teams. The overall numbers are really good and the regional numbers are pretty good. There are many remote communities that have incredibly high rates, but some that have worryingly low rates. I am making sure we do everything possible to get everyone vaccinated, but the reality is this. At the end of the day, with all the best information, with all the goodwill, with all the repeated attempts, there are some people and some communities who have said no to the jab and could keep saying no. You can’t hold people down and stick a needle in their arm. It is their choice and some are choosing against it. The same rules for mandatory vaccinations in the NT apply to the second vaccination dose. This means all workers who interact with members of the public must be fully vaccinated by 24 December. Double dosed by Christmas! The Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, is up. From today, the Covid-19 vaccine will be mandatory for all frontline workers in the NT. If workers haven’t received their first vaccine by Saturday 13 November they will not be permitted to attend their workplace. Failure to comply will cop a $5,000 fine: You must receive the vaccine if in the course of your work you come into contact with vulnerable people, your workplace has a high risk of infection or you perform maintenance of essential infrastructure or logistics in the territory. Workplaces where workers must have the vaccine is not an exhaustive list. If you are not sure if it applies to you, ask yourself these three questions. In my work, do I come into contact with vulnerable people? Is my workplace a higher risk of infection? Do I work on infrastructure or logistics that are critical to the territory? If your answer is maybe or I don’t know then you need to get the jab. Critically, the direction also applies to industries who directly face customers and circumstances where the worker may not know the vulnerability of the person they are interacting with. Thanks as always to Matilda Boseley. I have my fingers poised to bring you updates from the NT. With that, I shall hand you over to the amazing Caitlin Cassidy, who will bring you all the updates from the Northern Territory press conference and the afternoon to come. Clive Palmer’s Palmer Group has sold all its shares in Qantas in protest at the airline’s mandatory vaccination policy. We should be hearing from the Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, soon with some big news on mandatory vaccinations. I will bring you updates from that as soon as he stands up. Victorian press conference: Every Victorian is likely to catch Covid once the state opens up, Brett Sutton says. We’re going do everything we can to protect those who are not eligible yet for a vaccine and some who won’t be eligible in the longer term, so there are good prospects for the TGA approving a vaccine for kids five to 11 years of age, maybe before the end of the year. I think, over the course of another big year, another two years, absolutely, everyone will get it as we open up because we are not going to hold back in terms of how we live our lives and move around when we are a fully vaccinated population, the fully vaccinated – my fullest vaccinated population we can be – that means there will be widespread transmission of this virus. ACT chief health officer Kerryn Coleman says the territory may soon phase out daily press conferences, in favour of social media and website updates. As foreshadowed yesterday, there will be some changes to the way the ACT treats close contacts once lockdown ends. Victorian press conference: Brett Sutton is asked if he remains “cautiously optimistic” Victoria’s case numbers are trending downwards. He says the state is probably “on the plateau”, but they “will, unfortunately, see days of significant deaths”. Sutton: Even though today’s number is a little bit more than yesterday, it is well below the peak of 1,900 plus cases that we have seen previously. I think we are very likely to be headed down from here. But it will be a bit of a bumpy numbers ride day-to-day. On deaths, as the minister has reflected, we see people who relapse, people who develop their severe illness a week or two weeks after they have been confirmed with Covid. We will, unfortunately, see days of significant deaths. I am also pleased that we have seen a lower relative hospitalisation rates and ICU occupancy compared to NSW with similar cumulative confirmed cases. Some updates from the Victorian Ibac hearings into branch-stacking in the Labor party. (ICYMI branch-stacking is when a party member signs other people up to their branch, potentially paying their membership fees for them, in order to gain power and votes when it comes to pre-selection time.) A few things. One: This clip is weirdly short. Two: Was the dramatic vignette really necessary? ACT Health has announced in a pre-press conference media release that those working as teachers and a range of other educational roles will be required to have the Covid-19 vaccine in order to work. This is in order to “help to reassure parents of children under 12 – and particularly vulnerable children – that everything possible is being done to reduce the risk of Covid-19 as we go back to school and early childhood education and care”. Perrottet: We’ve always committed that we will have the next stage of the roadmap on the Monday following. We’ve made that commitment. There was a lot of pressure for us to bring [drinking while standing up] forward when we hit the 70% mark*. But you know, that’s obviously part of the 80% roadmap. It’s something that’s on the table and it will obviously be part of the discussions tomorrow. And we don’t want to speculate in terms of what that day will be. We didn’t set a date. We didn’t set a date for this specific reason. We set a vaccination target and every single person across our state has made an enormous effort. We haven’t just led the nation**, we’ve led the world. That’s the key to keeping people safe. Your friends and your family. And the faster we can do that, the better that’s going to be for everyone across NSW. * We are discussing this as Perrottet made a bit of a blunder when skulling a freedom frothy while standing in a pub up during a press event on Monday. ** They haven’t, ACT is leading the nation in vaccines. Perrottet has been asked if regional travel will be on the table at 80%, and while he says they are committed to the general shape of the plan, concerns have been raised by regional communities whose vaccination rates are lower. As I said, the key here, and while we’re having this conversation, is an incredibly positive one, because what it’s shown is that we did not expect to be in a position where the double vaccination rate has come forward in the way that it has and what a great thing that is. And our commitment to the people of our state has been – we can get vaccinated and reach those target, we can open up freely. That has been our commitment. That has been our agreement with the people of NSW. Having said that, there has been concerns raised about regional NSW. If you look at those double vaccination rates. I have not had many discussions with my ministerial colleagues in relation to that aspect, yet. We are having that meeting tomorrow. That will be an issue that will be discussed. The deputy premier, as the National party’s leader in New South Wales, will obviously have a view. And that will be considered. But in government, we have these constructive discussions with each other before we have them with the media. That’s where policy is determined and that’s where we will be tomorrow. OK, jumping over to the NSW press conference now, where Dominic Perrottet was speaking a short time ago. He is discussing what the state will look like once the 80% vaccination milestone is reached. (Which is coming up sooner than expected, potentially as soon as Sunday.) What we’ve said is that once we hit the 80% double-dose that we will ease further restrictions in our state. Obviously, we’ll be sitting down with the health teams tomorrow. I will look at the data. So will the members of the cabinet. And, as we said, it will be the Monday following where we hit that 80%, that’s the commitment that we’ve made. That’s the commitment that we will sustain. So we need to look at that. There might be some other issues that come through that. I will work through that with the cabinet ministers tomorrow with our economic and health teams. And we should be able to provide a clearer update at back end of this. Australia has signed a deal with Nasa to send an Australian-built rover to the moon, supporting a mission to collect lunar soil and examine how its oxygen could support human life in space. The $50m project will be supported by the federal government’s Moon to Mars program, with the rover to be launched as early as 2026, provided it meets a range of Nasa’s conditions during development. The partnership comes after Australia signed up to Nasa’s Artemis Accords late last year, an agreement that outlines principles to “guide space exploration cooperation” between nations and allows Australia to work with the space agency. Under Nasa’s Artemis exploration plan, the agency hopes to land the first woman and person of colour on the moon, and “establish the first long-term presence on the moon” at the Artemis base camp. It then wants to send astronauts to Mars. You can read the full report below: Victorian press conference: Oooft! Foley has snuck in a pretty sharp jab at the federal government’s delayed acquisition of vaccine supplies. Reporter: Are the new ways of administering vaccines really a sign of what options open up when supply is guaranteed and is more plentiful? Foley: Yes, I think that’s a fair description. Now into mid-October with the commonwealth program having commenced in February, we’ve now got enough certainty of supply, enough distribution points across state-run clinics. Victoria has delivered more vaccines than any other jurisdiction through its state-run clinics, our GPs, our pharmacists, our community health centres and now with support from a range of those groups, we’re able to really drive these locations down, particularly at the most at-risk communities to that really local level. And the mini pop-ups are all about making sure that we get those vaccine opportunities in your neighbourhood. And I’d encourage everyone to reflect on Saela’s story and do your bit, come forward and get vaccinated. Jumping back up to NSW and the state opposition leader, Chris Minns, has attacked treasurer-turned-premier Dominic Perrottet’s latest budget, calling for more support for businesses and students, AAP reports. Minns said Perrottet’s financial record is scarier than his personal views in a lockdown-delayed speech attacking the state budget while calling for an extension of lockdown business support and a building blitz for schools and social housing. Back in June – four days before Sydney was thrust into lockdown – Perrottet announced a 2020/21 state budget deficit of $7.9bn, with a $500m surplus by 2024/25. But the circumstances in which Perrottet outlined his economic vision have shifted greatly since then. NSW has changed premier, parts of the state have been locked down for more than 15 weeks, and the budget’s bottom line has been hard hit. And – Minns argues – the city of Sydney has been divided. No one can make the case that the devastating effects of this outbreak have been felt evenly. No one in the state has been spared. But the people of west and south-west Sydney have paid the highest price. The areas were coronavirus hotspots and subject to stricter rules than the rest of Sydney – “the harshest lockdown of any place in Australia at any time during the pandemic. More jobs have been lost in that part of Sydney than elsewhere, and businesses have suffered greater declines in turnover. Support – from both the federal and state government – is going to be cut off too early, he said, calling for measures like jobsaver and payroll tax reductions to continue. He stated that if Labor were in government, it would also make a huge investment in social housing and schools, to help boost the economy and repair social housing and classroom shortages. Minns is badging his budget reply as a “positive plan” for “inclusive growth”. The taxpayers of this state should be far more concerned about the premier’s record of tolls, taxes, fines, charges – and record debt – than about the Perrottet collection of Trump hats and toy nuclear power stations. Every time you pay a toll, send your kids to an overcrowded school, are stuck in traffic, or find the cost of living just that little bit harder – that’s the record of the former treasurer – the new premier, Dominic Perrottet. Victorian press conference: A reporter has asked 17-year-old Saela what her final message is for people at home. Saela: To get vaccinated, at all. To avoid getting coronavirus. I’ll say, it’s best to get vaccinated, to protect yourself and the people around you. Her mum, Michelle, added: Definitely. Just glad to have my mini-me back! The pair receive applause from the media as they leave the podium. New Zealand has announced 55 new cases of Covid-19 today, taking the total cases in the outbreak to 1,719. Director general of health Ashley Bloomfield said one of the cases was a teacher in an Auckland early learning service centre who tested positive yesterday, and six children had been exposed. The centre of the outbreak is still Auckland, and almost all of the day’s cases were there. Two cases were in Waikato. Northland and parts of the Waikato will remain in level 3 lockdown for at least another five days, Covid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said. Auckland also remains at level 3. The country has hit some new milestones in its vaccination rollout. 80% of the eligible (aged 12+) population have had at least one dose of the vaccine, and 68% of the full population. 49% of the full population is fully vaccinated with both doses. 57% of the eligible population are fully vaccinated. Twenty-six of the cases today were yet to be linked to existing infections, and there are 75 unlinked in the last 2 weeks, suggesting New Zealand could have wider spread happening in the community. Thirty-two New Zealanders are in hospital with the virus. The Australian Rugby League Commission has confirmed the Dolphins will become the NRL’s 17th team, beating the Brisbane Jets and Firehawks to a licence. The ARL Commission on Wednesday ended a process lasting more than two years and means the Dolphins – the first expansion team since the Gold Coast Titans in 2007 – will enter the competition in 2023 as part of a push to grow the game in Queensland. Wayne Bennett is widely expected to be named as inaugural coach, after leaving South Sydney after this month’s grand final loss. The competition will expand to 26 rounds with every team continuing to play 24 regular-season games and receiving two byes each. The Dolphins have agreed to invest $1m per annum on grassroots rugby league and pathways as well as an additional $1m per annum on women’s rugby league pathways and development. The club will be required to submit an annual budget for commission approval which sets out how the $2m in funding will be spent each year. ARL Commission chairman Peter V’landy said: Rugby league is part of Queensland’s DNA and to have four teams based in Queensland will further strengthen our game as the No 1 sport in the state. The key to long-term success is growth. Michelle: I do believe she wouldn’t have been this sick if she’d been vaccinated in time. Please. No family should have to go through what we did. No parent should see their child suffer and almost die. Don’t leave it until it’s too late. Please consider the vaccine. Michelle has acknowledged that by speaking up about her Covid-19 experience Saela may be subjected to online abuse. She wanted to share her story. She wasn’t forced. I admire her bravery. Maybe anonymous people online will try and make her feel bad for speaking out but they should know nothing will make her feel worse than Covid did. We’re all over this – I hate Covid. I’m done with lockdown and soon we won’t need it because enough of us will be vaccinated. We have the option to get back to some sort of normal and the vaccine will protect us and provide reassurance to our family and loved ones. I personally have seen how Covid has affected my family from the fully vaccinated and unfortunately to the unvaccinated like Saela. I honestly believe the vaccine protected my parents and I’m so grateful they got it and that one dose that me and my husband got had helped and that says so much. My parents should have been the most at risk because of their age but they were vaccinated so they were OK and Saela should have been the least at risk because of her age. But she wasn’t vaccinated and she almost died. Michelle: I thought someone was going to die and it was much easier for me to prepare for a loss than to hope. I was watching Covid rip through every member of my family and hurt them and it was so painful ... I was alone. I was helpless. My daughter responded to treatment. Her body was fighting the virus. I would call her bedside every night and, even though she was sleeping, the nurse would put that speaker near her ear and I would talk to her. She wasn’t awake. I don’t think she heard it but I spoke to her and did a bit of a podcast, my way of connecting with her. My husband came home from hospital after three days and got the all-clear to continue recovering at home. I got clearance from Covid and I was finally allowed to visit Saela. I was escorted to the Covid ICU. It was so daunting. I saw her just lying there. She wasn’t awake. Once the tracheotomy was done, where they took the ventilator out of her mouth and put it through her throat, they began to wake her up. We were so happy. But she wasn’t ... She was so sad and it was a long way to go and she didn’t understand what was going on. She woke up nine days later. Michelle: In the next 24 to 48 hours, she was critical. It was hour by hour. Her lungs had filled with so much fluid and there was little air for her to breathe. She needed a lot of help from the ventilator and I wished that she had been vaccinated. But it was too late. She was will already in ICU. I remember speaking to the doctor and I said, “Please. You need to save my baby”. And he said, “Michelle, I promise you we are doing everything that we can.” He said, “At this moment, she is the sickest person in this hospital. At this movement, she is the sickest person in Eastern Health.” Covid, without the protection of the vaccine, had done this to her. There was no other reason she was in ICU. Last week, she was in school and next week she was in a coma. At the same time, my dad became Covid positive and I was so grateful he was fully vaccinated. My older son was becoming sicker. He was going through his relapse. He had high fevers and nausea and I was so worried about him because he was unvaccinated. And then my husband started coughing up blood. He didn’t tell me at first. But I found out. His coughs were so powerful it left him weak. He struggled to breathe. He struggled to lift his head up and keep his eyes open. He didn’t want to go to the hospital. He was so worried about Saela. But he did. And again I saw another ambulance take another one of my family members away to a different hospital and I was like, come on, who next? Saela’s mother, Michelle, is speaking now at the Victorian press conference about the trauma of watching her teenage daughter ventilated and in a coma. It’s still so sensitive when I hear her talk about it. I’m still hurting from this experience because of Covid and I’m so thankful I have my daughter standing next to me right now. I admire her bravery and resilience and it’s sad to know there are still a lot of families out there who are affected by Covid. When I got the call from the doctor to say that Saela’s health had deteriorated so rapidly and was getting transferred to ICU and put on a ventilator I was in shock. I thought how? Literally I just talked to her two hours ago. And we were talking about coming home in the next few days and I said to the doctor, “Please, please, let me talk to her before you do this.” And he said, “It’s best that you don’t, she is so distressed.” And before that call ended I heard her screaming. I don’t know if it’s my imagination or a mother’s intuition but I heard her screaming. Saela: With each passing day, I slowly got better. I started breathing on my own and, five days later, I waved goodbye to the ventilator. My strength was coming back. I had to learn to walk again. I cried every day but I worked very hard on my recovery so I could be home for the AFL grand final, which I was. I spent nearly a month in the hospital and 15 of those days was in ICU. I’m so thankful to the team at Box Hill hospital, they’re amazing. I’m so grateful I was gifted with life again. I was close to death. There are a lot of people my age who think they’re invincible and don’t need the vaccine. They think they are young, they don’t have just like conditions. They won’t be affected but Covid almost killed me. I know people in their teens and 20s have not been eligible for long and its numbers are catching up and growing fast but we’re still the least vaccinated age group above the age of 17. I don’t want anyone my age to have to lie in a hospital bed and tell their family they’re sorry they did not get vaccinated in time. I don’t know the lasting effects of Covid will have. I’m still recovering. I’m not 100%. My mind is still fragile. My bruises are fading. I’ll have this scar from the tracheotomy on my neck for the rest of my life. At the time I was the youngest person to be on a ventilator because of Covid. There’s still Covid in our community. There are still so many families right now being affected and it makes me so sad. I’m blessed I’m home now with my family. I just want things back to the way it was and when we have that chance, please don’t wait. If you can get the vaccine, please consider it. Saela has gone into details of her second week of Covid-19, when her condition worsened. My coughing fits lasted longer and I struggled to breathe. My whole family looked at me with worry. As I got worse, we had to call the ambulance. I knew that if I went with them, I would be alone. They took me to Box Hill hospital, a 40-minute drive away. I decided to go to the hospital as I thought it was only a check-up and I’d be home the next day. I sat alone in the ambulance and I had never been in an ambulance before. I said goodbye to my family. I was so scared and lonely. My health progressively got worse and then one night I couldn’t stop coughing. I was struggling to breathe. The day before, they said I had pneumonia. I had no idea it was. I felt so many needles. I couldn’t catch my next breath. There was commotion around me. I didn’t know what was going on. I was so scared I was screaming and I thought I was going to die and then I felt nothing. They had put me to sleep. They woke me up nine days later. I had no idea what had happened or how much time had passed. I wasn’t fully awake and I was hallucinating. I had a tube coming out of my neck. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t talk. I was scared to sleep again. I just stared at the ceiling and I was alone. There was so many machines around me, so many wires and needles, so much beeping and everything made me scared. I was broken. None of this was fair. Seventeen-year-old VCE student Saela* is speaking now at the Victorian press conference, sharing her experience of being ventilated due to severe coronavirus in late August. Last month, I nearly died from Covid-19. In late August, my family got Covid from my baby sister’s daycare. At the time I was not eligible for the vaccine and now I wish I was vaccinated before I got Covid. My whole family was sick. Everybody was covering and suffering from aches and pains and a sore throat. We couldn’t taste or smell. My symptoms were worse with coughing fits that left me breathless. As a family, we were more worried about my grandma as she was older. We thought she would be at risk the most. I thought I was safe, I was young and Covid usually affects older people. *Confirming the spelling of her name now. Victoria will begin doing pop-up vaccination “blitzes” in order to help lagging LGAs catch up with the rest of the state. Foley: Over the coming weeks, we will roll out a local neighbourhood pop-up vaccine program, which means Victorians will be able to get vaccinated in an increasingly vast array of places – gyms, local clubs, shopping strips, culturally safe locations in increasingly diverse and really localised range of settings. The first neighbourhood pop-up is opening today at a coffee shop in Melbourne’s outer north, with more locations to follow, particularly in our high-risk local government areas that are the subject of our greatest attention. These neighbourhood pop-up models are designed to support Victorians to get access to vaccines, Pfizer in particular, in the most convenient, familiar and easy to deal with locations. And equally, in culturally safe and protective locations for those Victorians who might need that further reassurance as to the need to come forward and get vaccinated. The pop-ups will vaccinate dozens of people over two, three, four-hour periods of blitzes in those local communities. Victoria’s health minister, Martin Foley, has announced that the large local government area of Mitchell shire, just north of greater Melbourne, will be released from lockdown from midnight tonight. As a result of the changing patterns of the Covid-19 in the Mitchell shire, the chief health officer has recommended that Mitchell shire be released from its lockdown as of midnight tonight. The public health team are confident that that outbreak is now understood and is being well managed and that Mitchell shire will come back into alignment with the rest of regional Victoria as of midnight. The limited reasons to leave home and the 15km travel radius will no longer apply in Mitchell shire. WA premier Mark McGowan has labelled the state’s high court win again Cline Palmer a “monumental victory for all Western Australians”. Victoria’s health minister Martin Foley is giving the state’s Covid-19 update now after the state recorded 1,571 cases overnight and 13 deaths. Very sadly, 13 people have lost their lives in the most recent reporting period to COVID-19. These were a man in his 50s, a man in his 60s, a man in his 70s and two men in their 80s, all from the Whittlesea area. A woman in her 90s from Darebin. A man in his 80s from Hume. A woman in her 80s from Moonee Valley. A man in his 70s from Brimbank. A woman in her 70s from Banule. A man in his 70s from Moreland. A woman in her 6 from Stonnington and a man in his 60s. Can I take the opportunity to pass on our deepest sympathies to the families, friends and communities of those Victorians and we pay our deepest sympathies and concerns to all involved. The high court’s decision in the Ridd case has now been published – and despite the academic losing his case, it’s not all doom and gloom for those hoping for protection of intellectual freedom in enterprise agreements. Basically, Ridd’s case was an all-or-nothing, he had to prove that every alleged breach of JCU’s code of conduct was invalid or he would lose the case. In the majority judgment, the justices said that the university’s enterprise agreement did guarantee that “intellectual freedom is not qualified by a requirement to afford respect and courtesy in the manner of its exercise”. They said: That interpretation aligns with the long‑standing core meaning of intellectual freedom. Whilst a prohibition upon disrespectful and discourteous conduct in intellectual expression might be a “convenient plan for having peace in the intellectual world”, the “price paid for this sort of intellectual pacification, is the sacrifice of the entire moral courage of the human mind”. The 2016 Censure given to Dr Ridd was, therefore, not justified. So some of his speech was protected but he lost on other grounds including breaching the confidentiality of the disciplinary process. JCU dismissed Ridd after he publicly questioned the scientific evidence upon which rested claims that the Great Barrier Reef was being damaged by climate change, including through publications for the Institute of Public Affairs. The IPA has come riding to Ridd’s defence again today. Its executive director John Roskam said: Dr Ridd’s battle for integrity in science will not end today. The IPA is pleased to announce that Dr Ridd will become a fellow of the IPA to lead a new research program at the IPA entitled the Project for Real Science. Dr Ridd will donate his time to the IPA as fellow without salary to work to improve quality assurance in science, making documentary and educational films, and ensuring that no academic speaking out for integrity in science will endure the ordeal Peter suffered. Here is what those ACT numbers look like on the outbreak graph: The ACT has recorded 51 cases of Covid-19 in the last reporting period, its second-most infectious day ever after recording 52 cases on 1 October. ACT Health has just released a statement: Out of the total cases, 32 are linked to known cases or ongoing clusters with 19 of these household contacts. 13 cases were in quarantine during their whole infectious period and 22 have been assessed as presenting a risk of transmission to others. We will be hearing from the Victorian health minister and chief health officer at 11am AEDT by the way. It’s the same time as the NSW premier is up to chat about his new hydrogen plans, but I’ll try to bring you updates from both! Nino Bucci will be updating us on the Victorian Ibac hearings this morning, which have just begun their third day. Queensland has recorded another doughnut day, its eighth in a row! Let’s hear a little more from the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, while we are at it. It’s hard to hear the exact questions but he is being asked about the ongoing Ibac hearings into branch-stacking in the Labor party, as well as how engaged he is with the inner party workings. I’m sure I attended many different caucus meetings. As the leader of the party. Let’s be very clear about the context in which I’m providing when asked yesterday. It’s been put to me that I’m some sort of linchpin, and I was making a point. We don’t have time to be involved in some of these matters. I’ve got some of these to do and I do them full-time and as a leader of the party, it’s not appropriate to be. Before then I was not the leader of the party, but there is nothing inappropriate about a group of MPs sitting around and talking about things in here. If you want a brand that, fine. As the leader of the party, I’ve not been involved in those matters. Things are looking hopeful when it comes to Victoria potentially getting out of lockdown ahead of schedule. Andrews says he will be able to give residents “greater clarity” by the end of the week. Things are getting spicy on “Auspol climate change Twitter” today. The general vibe today. More from Queensland parliament: Academic Peter Ridd has lost his high court appeal against James Cook University. Ridd was sacked for breaches of the university’s code of conduct relating to public commentary about the Great Barrier Reef which the university said denigrated a colleague. At first instance he was awarded $1.2m compensation by the federal circuit court for the dismissal but this was overturned by the federal court on appeal. At issue was whether Ridd could be sacked for breaching the code of conduct despite the fact the enterprise agreement gave staff a right to “intellectual freedom”. On Wednesday the high court unanimously dismissed the appeal. The high court has ruled against Clive Palmer and his company Mineralogy in a challenge against a Western Australian law banning him from seeking billions of dollars in compensation. Mineralogy is in dispute with WA over the stalled Balmoral South iron ore project rejected by the then-premier Colin Barnett in 2012. When Palmer sought arbitration of the dispute in the Queensland supreme court the WA parliament rushed through legislation to extinguish his claim, warning it could cost the state up to $30bn. On Wednesday the high court unanimously held that the WA law is “not invalid or inoperative in its entirety”. The court ordered Palmer and Mineralogy to pay costs. Some extinction rebellion drama is going down at Queensland Parliament. From the backdoors at Victorian parliament. Albanese has been peppered with questions about the branch-stacking scandal in Victoria. Federal Labor MP Anthony Byrne admitted to engaging in branch stacking in an Ibac enquiry earlier in the week. The federal Labor leader responded by comparing his party’s response to political scandals to the government’s. I think the Victorian Liberal party have a lot to answer for ... What I did within 24 hours, along with Daniel Andrews of the Channel Nine revelations on 60 Minutes, was expel Adam. We then went and intervened into the Victorian branch ... We suspended operations of the membership committee. We wrote to every member who had been signed up over many years and asked them to verify their membership, and if it didn’t stack up they were removed from the roles. We took strong, decisive action ... compare what Labor has done with the Liberal party or with our view that we need a strong national anti-corruption commission, with Scott Morrison who continues to attack Icac because they have the former premier of New South Wales giving evidence next Monday. I welcome inquiries, I welcome transparency. Inside our party or inside the political processes in general. The Liberal party cover-up, attacked these independent bodies, and won’t have a national anti-corruption commission. What they want is a body whereby the only thing they look at other things that are referred to them by the government itself. Albanese is on the warpath this morning and the federal energy minister (and now industry minister) Angus Taylor is in the firing line. Can I add something about Angus Taylor to think about? Tritium is a company in south-east Queensland. It is producing some of the fastest electric vehicle charging stations in the world with Australian science and innovation, Australian resources, made by Australian labour on-site in Queensland. What we have from Angus Taylor, with regard to electrical vehicle charging stations – that are fastest in the world are being exported to America and northern Europe – this government says that electric vehicles would destroy the weekend. That is the alternative here. Are you going to believe someone who is now an industry minister and an energy minister who is a part of that scare campaign with the Morrison government during the last campaign? This man speaks about embracing technology while he trashes it, when he trashes Australian technology what he is really doing is trashing Australian jobs. Federal opposition minister Anthony Albanese is out and about this morning talking about all things jobs and the environment. (And he is wearing high-vis, so you know he is feeling particularly salt-of-the-earth today.) Why aren’t we making batteries here? Why aren’t we making solar panels, more of them here? Why aren’t we making wind turbines here? We have every natural resource that goes into the products that will be in demand in the future, and what we have done is set back from people like [federal environment minister] Angus Taylor who has no credibility - no credibility on these issues, on energy or industry which he is now in charge. The truth is, it will take a Labor government prepared to shape the future, prepared to take up the opportunities that are there to create jobs and to really drive Australia forward. 50 greyhounds have now been killed on NSW racetracks this year, more than the total death toll of 2020. According to the Coalition for the Protection of Greyhounds who track dogs deaths and injuries during racing events, fatalities have increased by 39% this year, cementing NSW’s place as the deadliest state for racing greyhounds. 2,342 greyhounds have also been injured on NSW tracks in 2021. In a press release, the coalition’s president Dennis Anderson has called on NSW racing minister Kevin Anderson to move more races from curved tracks to straight. Greyhound racing is inherently dangerous for greyhounds. Curved racetracks are the most lethal and the most common, with only one straight track in the state. NSW racing minister Kevin Anderson has admitted that curved tracks are dangerous, but refuses to shift more race meetings to the new straight track at Richmond... 90 percent of fatalities were dogs euthanased with broken legs. Many of these injuries would have been treatable but greyhounds are often considered disposable products. More dogs should have been treated under the Race Injury Rebate Scheme and their lives saved. Here is what today’s Victorian numbers look like on the outbreak graph. Thanks to Josh Nicholas for whipping that up: Victoria has recorded its most deadly day of the outbreak so far, with 13 people infected with Covid-19 dying in the last reporting period. The state recorded 1,571 cases, a slight jump up from yesterday. The prominent Murdoch commentator Andrew Bolt says News Corp Australia’s major editorial campaign to speed up climate action is “rubbish” and the “global warming propaganda” provides political cover for Scott Morrison. After the company published 16-page wraparounds in every tabloid, Bolt told his Sky News Australia audience: Millions of Australian readers would have got a shock this morning when they picked up their Murdoch newspapers around the country. Prime minister Scott Morrison will actually be delighted because he can now have the Malcolm Turnbull-type policy that he wants – net zero emissions – and take it to the next big global warming conference in Glasgow in November, knowing that he has the backing of the Murdoch media. On Monday Murdoch’s Australian arm launched Mission Zero, to “inform Australians about the key environmental and climate issues of our time” in support of net zero emissions by 2050. You can read the full report below: Melbourne’s Royal Children’s hospital is on high alert after a Covid-19 positive person visited the neonatal ward. A spokesperson for the hospital spoke about the matter this morning: We have had another exposure in our Butterfly ward, which is our neonatal intensive care ward, and that was the result of a positive parent who came into the hospital ... There were 29 babies in at the unit at the time, so all families of those 29 babies have been contacted and have been tested, and continue to be tested and checked. And they have been no transmissions for babies as a result of that exposure, which is great. She also announced the start of a new outbreak prevention program, where visitors to the hospital will undergo rapid antigen Covid-19 tests: This morning we come to you to let our community know that we are commencing with rapid antigen testing for our visitors to the hospital, especially those parents going into clinical wards. We know that mums and dads need to see their children, and children need to see their mums and dads, especially when they are in hospital, but we need to protect everyone, given the rising numbers of Covid in the community. The NSW press conference will be at 11am AEDT. The NSW numbers are a slight jump up from yesterday, but nothing overly dramatic. Here is a look at today’s cases on the outbreak graph: The NSW numbers are in and the state has recorded 444 local cases of Covid-19. Sadly, four infected people have died. It’s nearly 9am, which means the Victorian Ibac saga is kicking off again. Environment minister Sussan Ley says she wants Australia to be “heading to net zero and doing it with confidence and seizing the opportunities in provides”. Speaking to ABC Radio National Breakfast, Ley said she would leave the prime minister to make statements about government policy, but she believed there were “huge advantages” for rural and regional Australia, and opportunities for agriculture. Asked about Bridget McKenzie’s earlier comments, which seems to emphasis the threat to regional Australia, Ley said: I don’t see, I don’t get a sense of feeling worried or threatened around me and I feel that I know my community very well, but each community is different. Let’s not forget that. I’m a rural Liberal … we’ll all bring different perspectives, as I know the national party members will, as I know the National party leadership has made clear. This is a good discussion to be having, because it thrashes out perspectives – every single point of view, and of course I will bring mine. And of course I want us to be heading to net zero and doing it with confidence and actually seizing the opportunities that it provides. Asked about the growing diplomatic push to strengthen Australia’s 2030 target (which is now just a 26% to 28% cut on 2005 levels), Ley pulled out the “meeting and beating” talking point. Ley said she would leave that issue to the “very live” internal government discussions. So there has been a bit of drama in the South Australian parliament, with a Liberal party defector somehow taking the Speaker of the House role in a late-night upset. Dan Cregan, who left the Liberal party to sit on the crossbench last week, managed to take the job in a secret ballot. This came after Labor and several independents teamed up to pass legislation which made it a requirement that the Speaker be independent from the two major parties. While the upset won’t cost the Liberals the government, it’s a considerable blow as the the state election looms next March. The federal government is chipping in to support the push to increase Tasmanian tourism in the lead-up to Christmas. It is offering $3m in holiday incentives, with 10,000 $300 vouchers available for residents of South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland who book a holiday in November and December. Here is what federal tourism minister Dan Tehan had to say about it: A recent Tourism Australia Travel Sentiment Tracker found 59 per cent of Australians want to take a holiday in the next six months. Pent-up demand combined with this innovative voucher program represents a fantastic opportunity for Tasmanian tourism to welcome back visitors and give local businesses and the economy a much-needed boost. Australians want to travel again so they can visit family and friends and take a holiday, in places like Tasmania. All Australians can help to make that a reality by getting vaccinated so we can reach our 80 per cent vaccination targets to trigger the resumption of travel. Five million doses of hydroxychloroquine imported by Clive Palmer were sent for destruction after a standoff with the commonwealth over who should take responsibility for a shipment sitting unclaimed in Melbourne airport. Last year Palmer promised to donate 32.9m doses of the antimalarial drug to the Australian government, in the hope that it could aid the country’s Covid-19 response, if trials proved it to be an effective treatment. The commonwealth took about 22.4m doses into its stockpile by June but its enthusiasm for the drug waned, given mounting evidence of its ineffectiveness as a Covid-19 treatment. The government told Palmer it wouldn’t take any more donations in May, according to documents obtained by the journalist William Summers for Guardian Australia.

The South Australian powerbroker plans to run as an independent for the upper house at the upcoming election. He told ABC radio this morning: Like Al Pacino in The Godfather, once I thought I was out, they try to drag me back in ... I would run as an independent – it’s where my natural habitat is as a pesky independent. His decision to throw his hat back into the ring follows a long-running legal battle with the US footwear company Dekkers over use of the term “ugg”. The Sydney bootmaker Eddie Oygur was sued by Dekkers in 2016 for selling 13 pairs of ugg boots to US customers, after a US court found Dekkers had the sole rights to using the term “ugg”. While the federal government has contributed $200,000 to fight the case, Xenophon said the commonwealth had fallen short of assisting Oygur as a “friend of the court”, which means there’s little chance an appeal would be heard by the US supreme court: “The [Australian] government is being so out of touch on this. I don’t know why they won’t do what’s needed for every ugg boot maker in the country. Xenophon resigned from politics in 2017 at the height of the dual citizenship scandal, after he announced he was unsure whether he was a dual citizen, which would have made him ineligible to run for parliament. But the high court later found Xenophon was validly elected and able to run for office. Xenophon said he had spoken about his potential move with Stirling Griff, who was his replacement in the Senate as part of the Nick Xenophon Team, before the party name was changed to Centre Alliance. The ABC is reporting that the Victorian case number will be in the 1,500s today. We shall know for sure when the numbers are released in about an hour. A majority of Australians are worried about the threat posed by global heating and want serious action to address it, but Queenslanders are less concerned than people in other states, according to the latest Climate of the Nation report. The authoritative annual survey of 2,626 voters – now in its 14th year and managed by the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute – suggests three-quarters are worried about the climate crisis, the largest proportion in its history. As cabinet meets on Wednesday to consider a new climate roadmap the prime minister, Scott Morrison, wants to unveil before the Cop26 talks in Glasgow, the poll suggests a clear majority – 69% – want the Morrison government to put Australia on a path to net zero emissions. The same proportion wants the Coalition to do more to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles. You can read the full report by Katharine Murphy and Adam Morton below: ABC radio host Fran Kelly is not copping Bridget McKenzie’s politicking this morning. McKenzie: We represent the poorest of marginalised people in the country, out of sight out of mind, outside of big business out of sight of [Greens leader] Adam Bandt. Fran Kelly: Big Business! Big businesses?! The mining companies are out the in regions. What are you saying? McKenzie: We have been out of sight out of mind of the Greens, the Labor party, big business. The National party has done our job over the last decade. And all we’re asking is that we are respected, as the second party of government. Federal Nationals frontbencher Bridget McKenzie is on ABC radio now, trying to convince people that the net-zero emission debate ... isn’t about climate change? Here are the reasons she gives as to why the decades-long delay on meaningful climate change action from Australia is actually a good thing: We’ve actually been able to avoid very bad outcomes for our country and our communities. We don’t have a carbon tax*, the big emitters like India and China are now going to be included in that global infrastructure. And we now have a framework, where countries like Australia can put forward plans to reduce emissions that are in our national interest. We’ve had that for quite a while in the sector, and agriculture has created jobs in the region, which is something the National party is very very keen on, and we’ve cut our emissions by 20%. So, this actual debate isn’t about climate change, it’s about regions. *Weird flex. Good morning everyone, it’s Matilda Boseley on the blog with you this morning. Get yourself a cup of coffee and settle in, because right off the bat we are talking about climate change. Yep, today the federal cabinet will thrash out the details of a plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050*, and potentially a more ambitious medium-term target. But first, the prime minister needs to find a way to placate the Nationals about regional jobs and power prices. At the moment, the Coalition has a 2030 target of reducing emissions by between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels and a “preference” to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Watch this space. Now to the states and the ever-present Covid-19 situation, where we actually have some good news. NSW is now rapidly approaching its next vaccination milestone, 80%, just three days after the state’s 70% reopening. 75.23% of residents over 15 are fully vaccinated and 90.77% have had at least one dose. That means NSW could reach the 80% fully vaccinated milestone by Sunday, and potentially start the next phase of reopening next week. Victoria is also slightly ahead of schedule, with the state expected to reach 70% in the next week or so and the ACT could well achieve almost complete vaccination coverage, upwards of 99% of the eligible population, by the end of November. The territory is also set to relax its lockdown at the stroke of midnight Friday, with 98.2% of over-12s in the ACT having received a first dose (72% are double dosed). OK, with all of that going on, let’s not delay any further and jump right into the day! *Known in environmental circles as “the bare minimum”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/19/japans-metoo-senior-bureaucrat-resigns-over-sexual-misconduct-allegations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T05:14:20Z","webTitle":"Japan's #MeToo: senior bureaucrat resigns over sexual misconduct allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/19/japans-metoo-senior-bureaucrat-resigns-over-sexual-misconduct-allegations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/19/japans-metoo-senior-bureaucrat-resigns-over-sexual-misconduct-allegations","fields":{"headline":"Japan's #MeToo: senior bureaucrat resigns over sexual misconduct allegations","bodyText":"Japan’s most senior finance ministry bureaucrat has resigned over allegations of sexual misconduct, in what is being described as the country’s #MeToo moment. Junichi Fukuda, the vice minister of finance, said he would quit after a weekly magazine published allegations he had sexually harassed a female reporter. Fukuda’s resignation will come as a further embarrassment to the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who is struggling to contain a cronyism scandal that centres on finance ministry officials. Fukuda has denied allegations carried in last week’s Weekly Shincho magazine that he sexually harassed a reporter in a bar. The magazine, which also released an audio clip of the incident, claimed he told the journalist he wanted to kiss her. “I’ll tie up your hands. Can I touch your breasts?” a voice allegedly belonging to Fukuda is heard saying on the recording. “Shall we have an affair once the budget is approved?” The magazine alleged Fukuda made similarly inappropriate remarks to other female journalists covering the ministry. The finance minister, Taro Aso, drew widespread criticism for resisting calls to sack Fukuda, who initially said he would launch a libel suit against the magazine. On Wednesday, Fukuda said he would step down because the allegations were affecting his ability to do his job. He told reporters he could not confirm if it was his voice in the audio clip. “But at least I have no recollection of making an outrageous conversation like that,” he said. “I am not aware of making any remark that could be taken as sexual harassment.” The finance ministry has launched an investigation and urged the alleged victim to come forward so it can determine if Fukuda was guilty of sexual misconduct. Aso, who conceded the remarks on the audio were unacceptable, said Fukuda could not be accused of sexual misconduct until the unnamed female reporter, an employee of the private broadcaster TV Asahi, comes forward. “Because no victim has come out, only the wrongdoer has been put on the spot and it’s a one-sided story,” Aso said. “Fukuda could be the victim instead of a wrongdoer.” In another allegation of sexual impropriety, the governor of Niigata prefecture, Ryuichi Yoneyama, said he would resign over claims in another magazine that he had paid money and given gifts to women with whom he had sex after meeting them on an internet dating site. Yoneyama, who is single, insisted he had not paid for sex with the women, but acknowledged his actions could “look to some like prostitution”. His resignation could create confusion over contentious plans to restart a nuclear power plant in his prefecture. Yoneyama has said he will resist the restart of two reactors at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa – the world’s biggest nuclear power plant – until a prefectural panel has completed its investigation into the cause of the March 2011 triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Both plants are operated by Tokyo Electric Power. The #MeToo movement has been slow to gain traction in Japan, where victims are often reluctant to speak out. But criticism of how the country’s authorities handle allegations of sexual harassment and violence has risen since last year, when Shiori Ito, a journalist, claimed she had been raped by a high-profile TV journalist with close ties to Shinzo Abe. The police suddenly dropped their investigation into the case and Ito is now suing her alleged attacker, Noriyuki Yamaguchi, in a civil lawsuit. She claims Yamaguchi raped her in a hotel room in 2015 after they had met for a meal and drinks to discuss a job opportunity. She alleges Yamaguchi dragged her to the hotel room and sexually assaulted her after she passed out while they were dining."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2019/apr/26/friday-briefing-pressure-mounts-to-find-source-of-huawei-leak","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-04-26T05:26:14Z","webTitle":"Friday briefing: Pressure mounts to find source of Huawei leak","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/26/friday-briefing-pressure-mounts-to-find-source-of-huawei-leak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2019/apr/26/friday-briefing-pressure-mounts-to-find-source-of-huawei-leak","fields":{"headline":"Friday briefing: Pressure mounts to find source of Huawei leak","bodyText":"Top story: Calls for police to investigate Good morning, and welcome to today’s briefing with Alison Rourke. There are calls for whoever leaked details about the government’s decisions on Huawei to be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act, as cabinet ministers denied they were responsible for revealing details of the National Security Council’s decision to allow the Chinese telecoms firm to help build parts of the UK’s 5G phone network. Whitehall’s most senior civil servant, cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill, demanded that those present at the NSC meeting “categorically deny” they were behind the leak, prompting just that from Jeremy Hunt, Gavin Williamson, Sajid Javid, Liam Fox and Penny Mordaunt. But there are calls for the investigation to go further, including from the former defence secretary Michael Fallon, who said Downing Street should bring in the police and mount a “a proper Scotland Yard investigation”. He said cabinet ministers should have their mobile phones checked and if anyone was found to be responsible they should be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act. Another former minister, Andrew Mitchell, said Theresa May should ask MI5 to conduct a full investigation. Calls to widen the investigation reflect concerns that the leak could damage intelligence-sharing relations with key allies. It comes at a particularly sensitive time for May’s premiership, not least because several of those present at the meeting hope to take over from her when she steps down as PM. As if Theresa May didn’t have enough on her plate, a new report commissioned by the German Green party has suggested that the Irish backstop is not, as hard Brexiters would have you believe, designed to handcuff Britain to the EU. Instead, it’s being suggested it could be a brilliant way of allowing a more reckless British PM (read Boris Johnson) to undermine the EU’s green and social standards, while still keeping access to the European single market. * * * Lung cancer – One in six people dying from the disease in the UK do not smoke, according to a study published today in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine. Car fumes, secondhand smoke and soot from wood-burning stoves are being blamed for the growing numbers. People rarely think of lung cancer as a non-smoker’s disease, says Prof Paul Cosford, Public Health England’s director for health protection, himself a non-smoker with lung cancer. “They’re so focused on smoking as the main risk factor that we forget that there are quite a few causes of lung cancer that affect non-smokers,” he said. * * * ‘Hugely affected’ – Residents of tower blocks wrapped in combustible Grenfell-style cladding are turning to drink and drugs and suffering bouts of depression and suicidal feelings, as they wait for remedial work on their buildings to be completed. A survey by the UK Cladding Action Group found that people’s mental health had been “hugely affected” by the delays. Tens of thousands of people live in 166 privately owned tower blocks where work has yet to be completed. There are no plans in place for 71 blocks, according to latest government figures. Leaseholders are facing bills of tens of thousands of pounds each to fix their homes. Some have even been conducting their own 24-hour fire watches to reduce the costs of keeping residents safe in the meantime. * * * Mozambique cyclone – Wind speeds of 140mph have hit the southern African nation, in the strongest storm ever to make landfall. Cyclone Kenneth is expected to dump 1.5 metres of rain. “Nothing like this has happened in this region, and rarely happens anywhere in the world, where a cyclone of this strength stalls for this many days,” said meteorologist Eric Holthaus. It comes just five weeks after Cyclone Idai devastated the country. * * * ‘Do you have a daughter?’ – Prince William has met a five-year-old survivor of the Christchurch mosque shootings who woke up from a coma six weeks after the attack. William told Alen Alsati that his daughter Charlotte was about the same age as her. The prince also addressed worshippers at Al Noor mosque, where a lone gunman began his shooting attack on 15 March that killed 50 people, praising their and the country’s response to the atrocity. “In a moment of acute pain you stood up, and you stood together. And in reaction to tragedy you achieved something remarkable … An act of violence was designed to change New Zealand but instead the grief of a nation revealed just how deep your wells of empathy, compassion, warmth and love truly run.” * * * ‘Gorilla selfie’ – The ranger who snapped two orphaned mountain gorillas posing for a photo with him say the pair – orphaned 12 years ago – are so close to their caretakers that they imitate them. “In terms of behaviour, they like to mimic everything that is happening, everything we do,” said ranger Mathieu Shamavu, who snapped the shot at the Virunga national park in eastern Congo. “They know we are their mum.

Kicked out of the Libertines, his song Fuck Forever (with his subsequent band Babyshambles) left many thinking he wasn’t in it for the long haul. Now at 40, astonishingly, he is still writing and performing, making records and addicted to drugs. As Simon Hattenstone found out, despite Doherty’s grubbiness and grey hair, he still has a fragile, boyish beauty. Doherty’s latest album, made with his part-time band the Puta Madres, is a likeable mix of Gypsy folk-punk. He talks to Hattenstone about dogs, drugs and Brexit.

About 180,000 workers throng quietly around a pristine campus in the new-build city, which prizes digital expertise so highly that some outstanding engineers are lured with special rent deals to work on a campus that looks more like architect-designed Silicon Valley than the crowded factories that feature in much of urban China. I was whisked around examples of sleek bicycles, remote-controlled fridges telling me when food needed to be consumed and super-fast immersive gaming – all showcasing the speed and flexibility of 5G-honed technology. Huawei is the jewel in China’s tech crown, a subject of pride at home and an export success as the world’s biggest supplier of telecoms equipment. But that jewel is fast turning into a flashpoint between Beijing and western governments, emblematic of deeper tensions about trade, security and a divide over the hidden risks of globalised digital advances. The UK’s defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, has voiced “grave “and “very deep concerns” at the prospect of Huawei providing technology to upgrade Britain’s lagging mobile phone network – after the head of MI5 called coyly for a “conversation” about the risks of embedding Chinese technology in national infrastructure. The US, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Germany are raising more vocal concerns about prospective leakage from Huawei and other tech companies to the Chinese intelligence services. Yet in many ways Huawei exemplifies the successes of globalisation. It is a successful global exporter (often backed by huge Chinese bank loans to spread its telecoms products into Africa). You can see a splurge of adverts for its phones in teenage-friendly pastel hues, and it provides a good-value alternative to the dominance of Apple and Samsung in western markets. Huawei worries the west in part because China’s push into 5G and artificial intelligence (AI) threatens to fulfil the Khrushchev-era promise of “catching up with and overtaking” its technological advances. The arrest in Canada this month of the company’s chief financial officer (and daughter of its founder), Meng Wanzhou, on suspicion of overseeing deals that broke US sanctions against Iran, raised the stakes. Huawei protests innocence, and says its products would never allow a “back door” for the Chinese government to access sensitive data. But given the close eye the Chinese state keeps on major tech companies and laws that put intelligence requirements ahead of the autonomy of businesses, precautionary measures look like a good idea. The question facing the British and other governments, however, is what these should look like without adding to counterproductive trade wars. Our experience in western democracies teaches us to beware both governments and companies gathering data without restraint. We have seen the temptations to abuse that follow. That goes with extra vigour for countries where open debate on such matters is fiercely constrained. One of my interviews with a China tech titan concluded in (his) bad temper about the audacity of asking about the risks to personal liberties from AI. Another, until recently more open, begged for such matters to be discussed off the record. Yet our own messages are mixed and mangled – and they are not getting any clearer. Britain’s politburo has been split for years on the issue. Theresa May as home secretary dug in against Chinese investment in the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant. Williamson is an ally of the prime minister – he orchestrated her leadership bid and is keen to play a similar role in anointing her successor. So it will be intriguing to see whether his warning is followed up by Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, who has cultivated a pro-China stance as the leading advocate of a free-trade no-deal Brexit. Choices, so far fudged or muddled through, are unavoidable. We host lavish state visits to drum up trade with royal bells and whistles, and pints of bitter consumed with President Xi in a country pub. May headed her own delegation of business folk to the country, rivalling Chancellor Merkel’s habit of bussing Germany industrialists to China to signal state support for lucrative deals. Post-Brexit visions for offsetting the damage of leaving the European single market tout business with Asia as the solution (in the absence of any major trade deal with the US) – and that means foregrounding China. Alas, there is only so much cake and tea we can sell to each other, so technology has to be part of new trade deals, in the way that steel and machinery was in the past. More household items will be 5G-enabled in the next few years and it will be essential to the development of driverless cars. So even if 5G is kept out of the main telecoms systems, that may prove more symbolic than decisive, as it makes its way into our lives through sundry products and the lure of cheap, available innovations. Huawei, after a bit of ritual Chinese huff, seems to have got the message: the company is reported to have offered up to £1.5bn worth of “technical changes” to satisfy British concerns, a sign that it is serious enough about western markets to offer compromises. Beyond this standoff, Beijing needs to decide whether the short-term gains of cyber-hacking – in terms of both data and prestige – are worth the damage being done to the companies that are the badge of China’s innovation and diligence. The west will need to balance fretfulness about security with a confidence that global trade remains the building block of our prosperity and peaceful relations – especially with awkward large powers. It’s not a new trade war we need with the People’s Republic in the year ahead, but a technological truce. • Anne McElvoy is senior editor at the Economist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/nov/16/experience-i-dropped-two-nuclear-bombs","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-16T09:59:00Z","webTitle":"Experience: I dropped two nuclear bombs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/nov/16/experience-i-dropped-two-nuclear-bombs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/nov/16/experience-i-dropped-two-nuclear-bombs","fields":{"headline":"Experience: I dropped two nuclear bombs","bodyText":"I became aware of Operation Grapple in July 1956. There wasn’t a big Top Secret stamp on it. Everyone in the country had an idea that Britain was trying to become a nuclear power. I was a 22-year-old co-pilot in the RAF, just happy to be chosen for the mission. My main role was to monitor the flight instruments to make sure the captain was flying correctly. We practised dummy drops for months, flying Valiant bombers from Wittering airbase on the Cambridgeshire/Northamptonshire border to a range over Orford Ness. After almost a year perfecting the drills with 1321 flight and, later, No 49 Squadron, we left for Christmas Island. Our drop proper came on 31 May 1957. The target was Malden, a tiny uninhabited island in the Pacific. After 50 minutes of flying we reached the rendezvous and the bomb aimer, one of five crew, went to lie down on a mattress in the well in the belly of the fuselage; from that position, he looked straight ahead through the bomb sight at the aiming point. We then made a practice run – up to the release point, then a sharp turn to get away. When the order was given to proceed with the live run, we put metal shutters over all the windows in the cockpit so the violent light from the explosion wouldn’t affect our eyesight; the bomb aimer had to keep his shutter open until the drop, though. I could only see through a small piece of welder’s glass in one of them. Despite being 45,000ft above the Pacific, we were in total darkness, the captain, Sqn Ldr David Roberts, and I flew purely by instruments. The bomb aimer took the safety latch off the weapon and said, “Steady, steady, steady”, to get us to hold our heading. As we crossed the release point, he pressed the button and announced, “Bomb’s gone.” We felt some elation, and the aircraft noticeably lifted as the 12,500lb bomb – codenamed Orange Herald – fell away. But almost immediately came the escape manoeuvre: Roberts rolled the aircraft into a steeply banked turn to get away from the upward rush of the exploding nuclear bomb. If we had carried on in a straight line, the fireball would have come up under the aircraft and that would have been it. The trouble was the accelerometer wasn’t showing any G-force at all. I told the captain “More G!” but as he pulled back on the stick we started to judder; the aircraft was stalling. We had been turning, we just hadn’t felt the added G. We realised the accelerometer wasn’t working, and the overcorrection sent the bomb aimer – who was making for his seat – crashing back into the well. We knew that if we didn’t turn, we wouldn’t escape the explosion. Thankfully the captain regained control, the bomb aimer scrambled to his seat and, 53 seconds after the moment of release, the weapon exploded. Complete darkness turned to unfiltered daylight. It was as if there was no dark glass in the small aperture; you could see the sky and the land below as clear as anything. Three minutes later, we felt a biggish bump as the shockwave hit the aircraft, then a smaller one a second later. We saw the sky lit up; 10,000ft above our eye level was a writhing molten mass. I was in a state of awe. At 85, I’m one of three aircrew still alive from Operation Grapple, and to my knowledge I’m the only person to drop two nuclear bombs. For my second flight, the captain was Sqn Ldr Barney Millett, and instead of targeting an atoll like Malden, the drop on 8 November was just off Christmas Island itself. Same procedure, this time no faulty instruments, though this was a thermonuclear bomb – a hydrogen bomb yielding 1.8 megatonnes of TNT – more than twice the power of the previous one. We were checked with a Geiger counter when we got back: it wasn’t mentioned that we were in major danger, so no one was in a state of jitters. To date, I haven’t had medical issues resulting from Grapple, but I know that people on the ground who watched the explosions claim to have been affected. I think the services took the precautions they believed sufficient, but I don’t want to decry the people who say they have fallen ill. As for the ethics, my feeling was, it was a weapon of war. Whether it’s a 1,000lb bomb or a 10,000lb bomb, they’re not nice things to have, but they’re essential to defend our country. This was at the height of the cold war. The Soviet Union was a powerful nation; we assumed it would use nuclear weapons if necessary, just as we would have done. • As told to Nick Thompson. Do you have an experience to share?

You can find our continuing coverage here. Ukrainian internet is experiencing serious disruptions as the fighting continues, according to a network monitoring organisation. The report said it had confirmed “significant disruptions” in Kharkiv on Thursday and further disruptions have been tracked across Ukraine, reaching Kyiv on Saturday morning with a “major disruption” registered to GigaTrans, Ukraine’s “backbone internet provider... which supplies connectivity to several other networks”. “While connectivity does remain available through other routes, the incident is likely to have a significant impact on infrastructure, limiting citizens’ ability to communicate,” it said. “Work is ongoing to assess the incidents and their contexts. Telecoms disruptions in Ukraine have so far been attributed to power outages, cyberattacks, sabotage, and kinetic impacts.” So far there is still contact coming out of Kyiv, including social media posts, pictures and photos, and some of those posting from the city say they haven’t experienced any trouble, so the extend of the disruption still seems unclear. Japan is considering imposing economic sanctions on Belarus for its support of Russia’s invasion, Reuters is reporting. Citing two officials, the report said Tokyo will coordinate with other G7 governments, but there were no other details about the specifics. It said Japan’s foreign ministry declined to comment. US sanctions already announced against Belarus include 24 Belarusian individuals and entities. A short time ago, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he had spoken with Japan’s foreign minister about “how we are standing together with Allies and partners to hold Russia accountable for its illegal, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine”. “Japan is helping to lead a coalition of partners and allies in response.” Japan has already announced sanctions on Russia over the invasion, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida terming Moscow’s moves an unacceptable violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and international law. Kira Rudik is a Ukrainian parliamentarian currently in Kyiv. She’s just spoken to CNN, saying it is strange to go from working as a member of parliament, under the threat of Russian attack, and then to have it suddenly start. “Then you know you have to do something,” she says. “That’s when you get a gun and you learn how to shoot it. You understand you have to get a group of resistance, which we did, and now we are helping our army to fight Russian soldiers who are trying to take Kyiv right now as I am talking to you.” Rudik says this is the “new reality”. “We are not leaving. This is our town and this is our country, and no Putin soldiers will tell us how to live.” A report from the Reuters news agency suggests it is looking more likely that Russia could be excluded from the Swift global bank payments system – a step that some countries had been reluctant to take: Germany and Italy softened their opposition against kicking Russia out of the world’s main international payments network, US and European officials said. Doing so would hit Russian trade and make it harder for Russian companies to do business. Italy, which had been reluctant to take that step, on Friday said it would not veto proposals to ban Russia and pledged to continue working in unison with its EU partners. Germany, which has the EU’s biggest trade flows with Russia, is also open to banning Russia from Swift, but must calculate the consequences for its economy, said its finance minister, Christian Lindner. Justin Trudeau, Canada’s PM, and Boris Johnson in Britain want Russia removed from Swift immediately. It would mark be a significant escalation of sanctions already imposed against Russia and its leadership, including some aimed personally at Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. Fighting is in the east, west and south of Kyiv, according to multiple reports. “All of this is now happening within the city limits,” reports CNN’s Clarissa Ward, but it doesn’t appear to have reached the centre. There are no signs of residential areas being targeted yet, she says, “but we’re hearing a lot of explosions from many different directions.” Interfax Ukraine news agency reports Russian forces have tried to attack an electricity-generating station, while the Ukrainian military says it has repelled an attack on a Kyiv army base, according to Reuters. The Ukrainian government also says it stopped a Russian advancement down Peremohy Avenue - which runs past the Beresteiska metro station, where heavy fighting has also been reported. The Guardian has not independently verified the reports. The assault appears to line up with Zelenskiy’s warning that tonight could see Russia’s attempt to storm the city. Three million people call Kyiv home. Earlier Zelensky posted a video from the streets in Kyiv. “Tonight, they will launch an assault. All of us must understand what awaits us. We must withstand this night,” he said. “The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.” Guatemala has recalled its ambassador from Russia. The central American country’s president Alejandro Giammattei said on Friday that he had ordered the return of Guisela Atalida Godinez Sazo, adding that his government rejected Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Giammattei had earlier expressed “full support for the sovereignty of Ukraine as like-minded countries and stand in solidarity with its people and government.” Kazakhstan is denying a request for its troops to join the Russian offensive, NBC has reported. The former Soviet Republic state has also refused to join Putin’s recognition of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states, his pretext for the hostility. A significant and interesting move here, from one of Russia’s closest allies. There are mounting witness reports now of artillery and fire in Kyiv now. One person told Reuters they could hear artillery blasts coming from an unspecified location somewhere near the city centre. A reporter for the Kyiv Independent is reporting “extremely hard combat” near the Kyiv Zoo - the Guardian has not verified this. The Washington Post’s correspondent in Kyiv is reporting “dozens and dozens” of explosions heard. BBC has also reported a large explosion heard in Maidan square, and multiple blasts in Troieshchyna, where that thermal power station is. Burning vehicles have also been seen on Kyiv’s Peremonhy Ave. Nick Walsh, CNN’s reporter in Kherson, in the south of the country reports heavy fighting over a key bridge as Russian forces move through the area. “Locals here we’ve spoken to are terrified,” he says. Central Kyiv is deserted tonight: There are sporadic reports of heavy fighting around Kyiv right now. A CNN reporter in the capital says there is heavy fighting in Obolon in the city’s north, while other reports note clashes in Vasylkiv, in the southwest outskirts. Just over the river to the East is Troieshchyna where there are several reports of Russian forces attacking a thermal power station. It’s the second time in 24 hours Russia has targeted the power plant, and Ukrainian forces are attempting to repel them, according to the Kyiv Independent. The Guardian has not independently verified these reports, which have come through in just the last few minutes. Australia plans to join allies in personally sanctioning Vladimir Putin and Russia’s foreign affairs minister, Sergei Lavrov. However it is not currently planning to expel Russian diplomats. A few hours ago Australian foreign minister Marise Payne said she was taking advice from her department on expanding sanctions to include the Russian president, who would be “personally responsible for the deaths and the suffering of innocent Ukrainians”. Payne said while sanctioning a country’s leader was an exceptional step, the Russian invasion of Ukraine was “an exceptional situation”. “It is clear that the only way to exact a cost for those actions is to ensure that he, himself, shares some of that cost and some of the pain that he is inflicting on everyone else around him in Ukraine.” Read more here. Ukraine has asked Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, to cut Russia off from the App Store and Apple products. Mykhailo Federov, the country’s vice prime minister and the minister of digital transformation, has published the letter he sent on Friday, appealing for Cook to bolster the impact of government-level sanctions. The whole world is repelling the aggressor through the imposition of sanctions - the enemy must suffer significant losses. But we need your support - in 2022 modern technology is perhaps the best answer to the tanks, multiple rocket launchers (hrad) and missiles... I appeal to you and I am sure that you will not only hear, but do everything possible to protect Ukrainem Europe, ad finally, the entire democratic world from bloody authoritarian aggression - to stop supplying Apple services and products to the Russian Federation, including blocking access to the App Store! We are sure that such actions will motivate youth and active population of Russia to proactively stope the disgraceful military aggression. Hello, this is Helen Davidson taking over the reins of the liveblog for the next few hours. Stay with us for the latest developments as Ukraine enters a night that its leader has predicted will be “harder than the day”, as Russian forces threaten Kyiv. In Kyiv, a woman has reportedly given birth in an underground metro station, where she’d been sheltering with other residents. Trains and platforms have been staying open to assist people, with many people taking cover. This post was amended to remove incorrect details, which had beentaken from an earlier and unrelated report. The day focused on the capital, Kyiv. Russian forces entered the city’s outskirts on Friday and were threatening the Ukrainian capital from the north-west and east in a lightning attack apparently aimed at seizing the city. The Russian defence ministry claimed its forces had taken control of the strategic Hostomel airfield to the north-west, while Russian tanks were filmed by locals in the Obolonskyi district about six miles north of the city centre in the morning. Vladimir Putin urged the Ukrainian army to overthrow its leadership, whom he labelled as a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who have has lodged itself in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.” The US department of defense has confirmed that a Russian “amphibious assault” has been launched in Mariupol, a coastal city in south-east Ukraine. “This night will be harder than the day. Many cities of our state are under attack: Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, our boys and girls in the Donbas, the cities of the south, special attention to Kyiv,”said the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy . “We can’t lose the capital.” Zelenskiy pleaded for international help and for western powers to act faster to cut off Russia’s economy and provide Ukraine with military assistance. “When bombs fall on Kyiv, it happens in Europe, not just in Ukraine,” he said. “When missiles kill our people, they kill all Europeans.” Nato will deploy significant extra troops to countries in eastern Europe who are part of the alliance, its secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said. UK ministers warned there would be no forces going to Ukraine itself to avoid an “existential” war between Russia and the west. The EU and the UK moved to freeze foreign-held assets of Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The initiative is largely symbolic but the move by Brussels and Downing Street followed recognition that appeals for action from Volodymyr Zelenskiy had to be heard. The UN security council voted on a resolution deploring Russian invasion of UkraineEleven member states voted for the resolution, three abstained (China, India, and UAE) and one voted against (Russia). As Russia holds a veto the resolution was not upheld. The Council of Europe suspended Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The 47-nation council announced that Russia was suspended with “immediate effect” from the organisation’s committee of ministers and parliamentary assembly on Friday “as a result of the Russian Federation’s armed attack on Ukraine”. Russia will no longer be allowed to compete in this year’s Eurovision song contest, with organisers saying its inclusion could “bring the competition into disrepute”. The US treasury has imposed sanctions on Vladimir Putin and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov. “The United States, in coordination with allies and partners, continued to forcefully respond to Russia’s unjustified, unprovoked, and premediated invasion of Ukraine,” the department said in a statement. “If necessary, we are prepared to impose further costs on Russia for its appalling behavior on the world stage,” said secretary of the treasury Janet Yellen. The UN security council voted on a resolution deploring Russian invasion of Ukraine. Eleven member states voted for the resolution, three abstained (China, India, and UAE) and one voted against (Russia). As Russia holds a veto the resolution was not upheld. But the US and its allies will see it as a victory to have Russia voting alone, and China abstaining. They were able to bring China on board by softening the resolution slightly, changing the word ‘condemning’ to ‘deploring’ for example and removing a reference to the Russian president. It is a loss however not to persuade India or UAE off the fence. Vasily Nebenzya, the Russian permanent representative is chairing the Security Council meeting and is reading out all the countries sponsoring a resolution deploring Russia’s invasion. It is a very, very long list. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, said that “Russia’s latest attack on our most fundamental principles is so bold, so brazen, that it threatens our international system as we know it.” “One country is invading another. Russia is the aggressor here,” she added. “There is no middle ground.” The Albanian permanent representative, Ferit Hoxha, said Russia “has stained the UN Charter with innocent blood.” “This is a defining moment for the council...Future generations will know who stood up for the respect of human life, for international law,” he said. And Mexico’s Juan Ramón de la Fuente noted, in support of the resolution: “Mexico has itself suffered four invasions over the course of its history as an independent state” twice by France, twice by the US. Ukrainian media are reporting gunfire in Kyiv. In the meantime, the defence ministry has advised Kyiv residents to make petrol bombs to repel invaders, Reuters is reporting. Zelenskiy had a dire message for Ukrainians tonight : “This night will be the hardest... We must withstand,” he said in an address. “This night the enemy will be using all available means to break our resistance. This night they will launch an assault.” “This night will be harder than the day. Many cities of our state are under attack: Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, our boys and girls in the Donbas, the cities of the south, special attention to Kyiv,” he added. “We can’t lose the capital.” The US department of defense has confirmed that a Russian “amphibious assault” has been launched in Mariupol, a coastal city in south-east Ukraine. We do believe that such an assault is being conducted today but we dont have perfect visibility on the progress of that,” John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said. “It certainly appears to us to be a piece of their designs in the south to further cut off the Donbas region and to – from a southern perspective – continue to try to take population centers.” Speaking in a press briefing at the Pentagon on Friday afternoon, Kirby was also asked about a direct threat issued by Russia to Finland and Sweden, which have been considering joining Nato. A Russia foreign ministry spokeswoman said the countries’ “accession to Nato can have detrimental consequences … and face military and political consequences”. Kirby said: “That would be extremely destabilizing”, but said there was no indication “that is necessarily in the offing”. Kirby said during the Ukraine conflict Nato has been prepared to “step up in ways that truly are historic and significant”. “The secretary [of defense] said it best: Mr Putin is getting exactly what he says he didn’t want: a strong Nato on his western flank,” Kirby said. “So without speaking to Finland specifically, we stand up for sovereignty and territorial integrity of independent nation states. That’s not going to change, and Mr Putin, should he want to violate that in new ways, will find new costs, I’m sure, imposed upon him.” Regarding the threat Russia could pose to countries other than the Ukraine, Kirby said: “It’s not entirely clear if Mr Putin has designs beyond Ukraine, and it’s because that is not perfectly clear that we continue to look for ways to bolster our Nato capabilities and to reassure our allies.” A spokesman for the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy suggested that a negotiated settlement was still possible, Reuters reported. “Ukraine was and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace,” spokesman Sergii Nykyforov added. Earlier today, the US State department cast doubts about whether Russia had legitimate plans for diplomacy, saying that Russia must stop bombing Ukraine first. “Now we see Moscow suggesting that diplomacy take place at the barrel of a gun, or as Moscow’s rockets, mortars, artillery target the Ukrainian people,” said the US state department spokesperson Ned Price. “This is not real diplomacy. Those are not the conditions for real diplomacy.” Those on the ground in Kyiv are reporting an air raid warning happening in the capital with multiple air strikes occurring. From Buzzfeed News reporter Christopher Miller: Air raid warning in Kyiv. And missiles being fired on the capital. I’ve counted three large strikes in past five minutes. Watching from my window and seeing the sky light up; roar of explosions reverberating across the city. US President Joe Biden will directly sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top Russian officials for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, confirmed White House press secretary Jen Psaki. Biden’s decision to personally sanction Putin follows an announcement from the EU today that Putin and the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, will be personally sanctioned following Russia’s attacks. Psaki went on to say that sanctioning Putin personally has remained an option and that Biden came to that decision “over the last day or so” in coordination with European allies. Psaki also said that she believes personal sanctions against Putin could prevent him from traveling to the US, reported CNN. Anonymous announced on Twitter today that they had reportedly hacked the database of the Russian Ministry of Defence website, breaching and leaking the private data. From the Anonymous Twitter account: JUST IN: Hacktivist group #Anonymous has successfully breached and leaked the database of the Russian Ministry of Defence website | mil[.]ru |. In the same tweet, the group also posted screenshots of the reported data and provided a link where users could access it. Russia Today, the country’s state-sponsored media source, confirmed that they had experienced a cyberattack following a “cyber war” declaration from Anonymous after a request for cyber defense volunteers from the Ukrainian government: “After the statement by Anonymous, RT’s websites became the subject of massive DDoS attacks from some 100 million devices, mostly based in the US. Due to the attacks there might be temporary website access limitations for some users, yet RT is promptly resolving these issues.” Ukrainian officials, in turn, said today that they have also experienced hacks, but from Belarus, targeting the private email addresses of Ukrainian military personnel “and related individuals,” reported Reuters. Another glimpse of what life is like for Ukrainian residents from the Guardian’s Shaun Walker, who is currently near Kyiv: I’ve just driven back across Ukraine from Lviv to close to Kyiv. A lonely drive in my direction but still packed roads going west as many escape from the Russian military action. At the border between Lviv and Rivne regions, a few hours’ drive from the western border with Poland, there was a queue stretching back several miles as soldiers checked documents. Closer to Kyiv, many people are avoiding the main roads west out of the capital due to the fact that some Russians are expected to come in that way, and are taking the back roads to the south. Along these roads I’ve just seen locals building makeshift checkpoints and barricades of sandbags. On the radio, one of the items on the news was instructions on how to make Molotov cocktails. Video was posted on social media of Ukrainian TV anchors reporting live from bomb shelters due to ongoing fighting throughout the country. From journalist and writer Maksym Eristavi: Satellite images taken today showed several large deployments of troops and about 150 transport helicopters in the south of Belarus, said a private US company, reported Reuters: The images showed one large helicopter deployment near the Belarusian town of Chojniki, which had over 90 helicopters parked on a road with the deployment extending for more than five miles. Images also showed a large deployment of ground forces with several hundred vehicles in convoy position in several fields. The images released by Maxar Technologies, which has been tracking the buildup of Russian forces for weeks, could not be independently verified by Reuters. Here’s a summary of today’s events on the second day of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine: The day focused on the capital, Kyiv. Russian forces entered the city’s outskirts on Friday and were threatening the Ukrainian capital from the north-west and east in a lightning attack apparently aimed at seizing the city. The Russian defence ministry claimed its forces had taken control of the strategic Hostomel airfield to the north-west, while Russian tanks were filmed by locals in the Obolonskyi district about six miles north of the city centre in the morning. Vladimir Putin urged the Ukrainian army to overthrow its leadership, whom he labelled as a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who have has lodged itself in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.” A senior US defence source briefed Pentagon reporters that they believed Russia had launched an amphibious landing with thousands of naval infantry to the west of the key southern coastal city of Mariupol. President Zelenskiy pleaded for international help and for western powers to act faster to cut off Russia’s economy and provide Ukraine with military assistance. “When bombs fall on Kyiv, it happens in Europe, not just in Ukraine,” he said. “When missiles kill our people, they kill all Europeans.” Nato will deploy significant extra troops to countries in eastern Europe who are part of the alliance, its secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said. UK ministers warned there would be no forces going to Ukraine itself to avoid an “existential” war between Russia and the west. The EU and the UK moved to freeze foreign-held assets of Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The initiative is largely symbolic but the move by Brussels and Downing Street followed recognition that appeals for action from Volodymyr Zelenskiy had to be heard. The Council of Europe suspended Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The 47-nation council announced that Russia was suspended with “immediate effect” from the organisation’s committee of ministers and parliamentary assembly on Friday “as a result of the Russian Federation’s armed attack on Ukraine”. Russia will no longer be allowed to compete in this year’s Eurovision song contest, with organisers saying its inclusion could “bring the competition into disrepute”. The Ukrainian ambassador to the US said today that attacks from Russia on Ukraine have “been more brutal”, but that Russian forces did not advanced as planned. “The enemy is clearly surprised by the result of the armed forces and volunteers to protect the integrity of our country,” said Oksana Markarova, who is currently speaking at the the embassy of Ukraine in Washington DC. Markarova also said that Ukrainian authorities are gathering evidence of “crimes” by Russian authorities to submit to international tribunals. On the Chernobyl power plant that Russian troops captured yesterday, Markarova said that responsibility for it now lies with Russia as strict regulations for the plant are not being observed, adding that 92 plant personnel were taken as hostages. Markarova also confirmed that Russian troops hit an orphanage in Ukraine, but did not injure any of the 50 children that were inside. The Russian army has reportedly destroyed the Kyiv thermal power plant, says Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko, a sign that Russia’s army is targeting critical infrastructure in the capital city. This announcement follows another report from Klitschko that five blasts were heard in three to five minutes near a power station located north of Kyiv, reported the Telegraph. “The emergency services are under way. We’re finding out the details,” said Klitschko of the five blasts. “The situation now – without exaggeration – is threatening for Kyiv. The night, close to the morning, will be very difficult.” Boris Johnson has recorded a video in which he aims to speak to both Ukrainians and Russians after a phone call with Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy this morning, ITV News reports. The video – in which he describes the invasion as a tragedy for Ukraine and Russia – was recorded after the PM held a phone call this morning with the Ukrainian leader. Speaking in Russian, the prime minister says: To my Russian friends I do not believe this war is in your name. It does not have to be this way. In a recording that will be released this evening, Johnson also says in Ukrainian: This crisis, this tragedy, can and must come to an end because the world needs a free and sovereign Ukraine. There are reports of loud explosions in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. A Reuters witness said artillery rounds have been heard in the capital. Another witness told the news agency that there was intense gunfire in western part of Kyiv. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, writes that five blasts within three and five minutes were heard near a power station in the north of the city. The UK will “imminently” level personal sanctions against Russia’s president Vladimir Putin and foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, Boris Johnson has said. Johnson’s announcement echoes measures announced by the EU to target the Russian leader. According to a No 10 spokesperson, Johnson told allies the UK would introduce sanctions against President Putin and foreign minister Sergei Lavrov imminently, on top of the sanctions package the UK announced yesterday. The PM also used the meeting to urge “immediate action” over the banning of Russia from the Swift payment system to “inflict maximum pain” on the Kremlin, they said. The missile left a crater two metres’ deep, twisted shards of metal beside a playground slide, and shattered glass below the windows of a nearby kindergarten, the Guardian’s correspondent in Kyiv, Emma Graham-Harrison, reports. In one apartment block 10 floors of kitchens, living rooms and bedrooms sat open to the skies, their balconies, doors and windows broken off or shattered into pieces by the weapon that brought the Russian invasion to this corner of the city. The missile hit soon after 4am on Friday, before Russian troops reached the city outskirts, or Ukrainian troops set up defensive positions in its historic centre. “People are grieving. This is already a tragedy,” said Gorban Abasov, a 70-year-old singer. Most of the people who lived there were pensioners like him, he said, none had army links and nearby buildings were civilian as well. There was no reason for such a lethal weapon to land here, but none of those gathered to inspect the damage seemed surprised that civilians were already in the line of fire, even before the battle for Kyiv had really begun. After all, there was no reason for Russian troops to be in their country, beyond the terrifying whim of an ageing autocrat. As Abasov stared at the ruins of his home, Ukrainian soldiers were already taking up position in Kyiv’s historic centre and its strategic bridges across the Dnieper and fighting advance Russian forces on its outskirts. Britain believes Russia’s goal is to encircle Kyiv in the coming hours and days and effect “regime change” which intelligence officials warned could be achieved by killing or capturing President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the country’s leadership, the Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh writes. Western officials cited Russian president Vladimir Putin’s aggressive rhetoric from earlier on Friday, in which he called on the Ukrainian army to revolt and rid the country of “this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis”. The official added: It’s clear the kind of vitriol coming from Russia about the Ukrainian leadership, so I think we can expect that they would be targets for Russian forces coming into the city. Previously US and to a lesser extent British intelligence have warned that Russia’s spy agencies have drawn up “kill lists” of key figures, who would be targeted by Moscow if their forces take control of the key cities. The western assessment is that “the bulk of Russia’s armoured forces” aiming for Kyiv from the north west and north east remain more than 50km away at present, although some advance forces have reached the north western suburbs, near the Hostomel airport. Although the airfield was claimed to have been captured by Russia, it appears to have been too badly damaged in the fighting to be usable to fly in reinforcements, the officials indicated. The timing of any Russian planned encirclement of Ukraine’s capital would depend on “the level of resistance” put up by the Ukrainian forces who have largely sought to halt the Russian advance in built up areas. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and US president Joe Biden discussed the US providing “concrete defence assistance”, according to Zelenskiy. The Kremlin’s objectives are not limited to Ukraine, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg says. He describes Putin’s decision to pursue aggression against Ukraine as a “terrible strategic mistake” for which Russia would pay a “severe price for years to come”. We are facing a new normal in European security. Nato allies and the EU have already introduced significant sanctions and must stand ready “to do more”, he says. Even if it means we have to pay a price because we are in this for the long haul. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg is holding a news conference after world leaders held a meeting to discuss the ongoing crisis. Russia has “shattered the peace of Europe”, he says. The people of Ukraine are fighting for their freedom in the face of Russia’s unprovoked invasion. We deplore the tragic loss of life, enormous human suffering and destruction. He called on Russia to stop the “senseless” war. Nato member countries will deploy more troops to eastern Europe, world leaders said. In a joint statement after a virtual summit chaired by secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, the 30 Nato leaders described Russia’s attack on Ukraine as “brutal and wholly unprovoked and unjustified”. We deplore the tragic loss of life, enormous human suffering and destruction caused by Russia’s actions. Peace on the European continent has been fundamentally shattered. The world will hold Russia, as well as Belarus, accountable for their actions, they continued, as they called on states to condemn this “unconscionable attack”. No one should be fooled by the Russian government’s barrage of lies. The statement continues: We have deployed defensive land and air forces in the eastern part of the Alliance, and maritime assets across the Nato area. We have activated Nato’s defence plans to prepare ourselves to respond to a range of contingencies and secure Alliance territory, including by drawing on our response forces. We are now making significant additional defensive deployments of forces to the eastern part of the alliance. Russia’s communications watchdog Roskomnadzor on Friday said it was partially restricting access to Meta Platforms (FB.O) Facebook in response to restrictions the US social media giant has imposed on Russian media, accusing Facebook of censorship, Pjotr Sauer writes. “On February 25, the prosecutor general’s office, in agreement with the foreign ministry, decided that the social network Facebook is involved in the violation of fundamental human rights and freedoms, as well as the rights and freedoms of Russian citizens,” a statement of the Roskomnadzor website said, adding that starting from today, measures would be taken to “partially restrict access” to Facebook. It was not immediately clear what the restrictions would involve. Russia has recently turned up the pressure on western social media giants. Last year, the country slowed down the operations of Twitter, after it was accused of failing to remove illegal content. Kremlin critics have previously warned that a potential invasion of Ukraine could have negative consequences for Russia’s civil society. “Any potential military action of any scale puts Navalny’s life at greatest risk yet,” Maria Pevchuk, the ally of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, tweeted just two weeks ago. Local Ukrainian staff at the US embassy in Kyiv say they feel abandoned by the American government with no support or means of escape as the Russian military continues its invasion of Ukraine, Foreign Policy reports. In a letter sent to US state department officials, the locally employed staff pleaded for help, including evacuation from fighting zones, relocation, US visas, and clear lines of communication with the state department in Washington, as fighting intensifies across Ukraine. The letter reads: We have worked side by side with you for two decades, and always had strong faith in the work US government was doing. We need your help now. This is not a time to wait and research. This is time to act. Your actions can save our lives. FP writes that the letter mirrors concerns from thousands of local employees who worked for the US government in Afghanistan and were later abandoned as Taliban forces gained control of the country late last year. Before, we were told, that Ukraine is not Afghanistan. We don’t want it to be, but if the difference is in size of bombs flying over our heads, it is not fair. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted a video of himself outside the presidential administration in Kyiv to dispel rumours that he has fled the capital. Wearing olive green military-style clothing and standing with his prime minister, chief of staff and other senior aides, Zelenskiy vowed stay and defend the capital against the Russian invasion. He said: We’re all here. Our military is here. Citizens in society are here. We’re all here defending our independence, our country, and it will stay this way. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, has warned both Finland and Sweden that they will face “detrimental military and political consequences” if they attempt to join Nato. Zakharova was speaking at a press conference in Moscow earlier this afternoon, where she warned that the Nato accession of either Finland or Sweden would spark a serious response from Moscow. We regard the Finnish government’s commitment to a military non-alignment policy as an important factor in ensuring security and stability in northern Europe. There are reports of a large fire and explosion in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city. Note: events are moving fast and the above footage has not been independently verified. In the latest alarming development, a senior US defence source has briefed Pentagon reporters that they believed Russia has launched an amphibious landing with thousands of naval infantry to the west of the key southern coastal city of Mariupol, the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont reports. While the claim had few details, video posted on social media earlier appeared to show a column of Russian armoured vehicles, including T-72B3 tanks and BMP-3 armoured vehicles, moving through the coastal town of Prymorsk which is located between Melitopol and Mauripol. Describing the “amphibious assault” under way from the Sea of Azov a senior US defence official told reporters on Friday that Russians “putting potentially thousands of naval infantry ashore there.” He added: The general assumption is they are going to move towards the north-east, towards Mariupol and the Donbas region. Several social media accounts in the region also show images and accounts of volleys of Russian Grad missiles hitting targets near Mariupol late on Friday afternoon. If the account of the landing is confirmed as true, the aim would appear to be to allow Russian marines to link up with forces further east in the Donbas region. More than 50,000 Ukrainians have fled the country in the past 48 hours, according to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. He said the majority of those who have fled have gone to Poland and Moldova. Russia will “partly limit” access to Facebook, Russia’s censorship agency has announced. Russia’s communications regulator Roskomnadzor said the move was in response to restrictions Facebook has imposed on Russian media, accusing it of “censorship”. It was not immediately clear what the restrictions would involve. Russia has been banned from entering the Eurovision Song Contest, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said. A statement from the body, which produces the competition, said the decision “reflects concern that, in light of the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine, the inclusion of a Russian entry in this year’s Contest would bring the competition into disrepute”. Greece’s foreign ministry has said it is taking the emergency step of closing its embassy in Kyiv, our Greece correspondent Helena Smith writes. In an urgent statement it said it had instructed the entire diplomatic mission to be dismantled with immediate effect because of the radically deteriorating security situation in the Ukrainian capital. Staff, including the Greek ambassador, would be leaving the country by car, it said. With a large ethnic Greek community in Ukraine, Athens in contrast to other EU capitals has been reluctant to close any of its diplomatic representations in the crisis-torn nation. Missions in the east have instead been reinforced. The ministry said Greece’s general consulates in Mariupol - the frontline city that is home to a 120,000 strong Greek diaspora - and Odessa would remain open. Plans are also afoot to evacuate ethnic Greeks via Rumania and Bulgaria if need be, diplomats say. Within minutes of the first explosions, Ukraine’s great exodus began, our correspondent Luke Harding writes. Some had been planning for a Russian invasion for months. They had carefully filled the car with petrol, bought food supplies, and packed a getaway bag, just in case. And, in many cases, a carrier for much loved family pets. Others had done nothing whatsoever. Until Russia’s blitzkrieg invasion began early on Thursday, many people in Kyiv believed the prospect fanciful. And yet the nightmare was real enough: air raid sirens, Russian helicopters flying low against a grey sky in attack formation, the roar of enemy war planes. By Friday, as Russian forces approached Kyiv from the north-west, Ukraine responded in two ways. One was by fighting. Its protagonists were soldiers, military veterans, volunteers. Ukrainian servicemen tried to hold back a powerful enemy advancing on multiple fronts: from the east and Russia; the south and Crimea; the north and Belarus. The other, bigger group were civilians fleeing the surging conflict. They left by any means possible. This meant cars – a great, wheeled caravan which filled the road west out of the city, and continued for dozens of miles. For hours this procession scarcely moved. Drivers emerged to stretch their legs. It was unprecedented, Ukraine’s biggest ever jam. Those without vehicles had to find other options. There were long queues at Kyiv-Pasazhyrsky railway station. Some trains were cancelled but a few, remarkably, were running, albeit delayed by five or six hours. Military transport took priority, railway staff explained. Buying a ticket was almost impossible in a panicked city of three million people. Some set off on foot, walking along the verge of the E40 road in the early hours of Friday morning, pulling carry-on cases. One departed on a mountain bike. On the day of invasion the Ukrainian government introduced a 10pm-7am curfew. Trains on the Soviet-built Kyiv metro stopped promptly. The underground stations remained open all night, now serving as bomb shelters. We left at 5.30am when we heard the first explosions Vera Ivanovna said, wiping away tears. She said she had been driving for 28 hours, after setting off from her home in Sumy, in north-eastern Ukraine, close to the city of Kharkiv and the Russian border. I didn’t bring any clothes. I took my mother, nine-year-old daughter, and sister. The Council of Europe has suspended Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, AFP reports. The 47-nation council announced that Russia was suspended with “immediate effect” from the organisation’s Committee of Ministers and parliamentary assembly on Friday “as a result of the Russian Federation’s armed attack on Ukraine.” If you’ve just joined us, here are the key events from today so far: Fighting has reached the suburbs and historic centre of Kyiv after a night of Russian missile attacks on the Ukrainian capital. Russian forces advanced to the outskirts of the city from three sides while Ukrainian soldiers established defensive positions at key bridges and patrolled in armoured vehicles down the city’s streets. Russia’s defence ministry claimed its forces had cut Kyiv off from the west and seized the strategic Hostomel airfield to the north-west, on the city’s outskirts, allowing it to airlift troops to the front. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said the city had entered “a defensive phase”. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia was ready to send a delegation, including foreign and defence ministry officials, to the Belarusian capital, Minsk, for talks with Ukraine, providing the country agreed to demilitarise. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier in the day urged Russia to start negotiations, although it is unclear under which terms he would be ready to talk. President Zelenskiy, pleaded for international help and for western powers to act faster to cut off Russia’s economy and provide Ukraine with military assistance. “When bombs fall on Kyiv, it happens in Europe, not just in Ukraine,” he said. “When missiles kill our people, they kill all Europeans.” The west scrambled to respond to Vladimir Putin’s aggression with a range of fresh sanctions against Moscow, with the US also announcing it would send a further 7,000 troops to Germany to shore up Nato’s eastern borders. There were divisions, however, on the strength of the response. EU foreign ministers announced they will seek to freeze the foreign-held assets of Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, under a new sanctions package due to be finalised on Friday. The move is largely symbolic and does not include a travel ban, as ministers wish to maintain a diplomatic way through the crisis. But the EU is holding back from blocking Russia from an international payments system through which it receives foreign currency or from personally targeting Putin with sanctions. The UK has said it will work “all day” to persuade fellow European states to cut Russia off from the international Swift payment system. The Council of Europe has launched a process to suspend Russia’s membership, Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said. A member of the 47-nation human rights body since 1996, Russia was kicked out of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly over the annexation of Crimea in 2014, but reinstated in 2019 with full rights. Formula One has cancelled the Russian Grand Prix after a meeting between F1’s CEO Stefano Domenicali, team principals and the FIA, concluded with the clear, widespread opinion that the sport could not go to Russia while it engaged in an invasion of Ukraine. All 13 Ukrainian soldiers defending an island in the Black Sea from an air and sea bombardment died after refusing to surrender to Russian troops on Thursday, Ukrainian officials said. Vladimir Putin’s extraordinary appeal to Ukraine’s army to overthrow the country’s democratic government is the first time the Russian president has openly spoken about regime change in Kyiv, writes the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth. In the video, Putin claimed that Ukrainian fighters were firing rocket artillery from large cities like Kyiv in order to provoke a Russian response and civilian casualties. He did not provide any evidence for that claim. He also praised the activities of the Russian military, who he said were bravely protecting “our people and our fatherland.” Military analysts have suggested that regime change is a goal of the campaign, based on the scale of the Russian invasion and the Kremlin’s political goals. But by calling for soldiers to overthrow Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Putin may be looking for a political pretext to explain what US intelligence have said may be the plan in Ukraine: to overthrow Ukraine’s president and replace him with a puppet leader Barely 24 hours before Russia launched all-out war on its neighbour, Chinese pundits had predicted that conflict in Ukraine was not inevitable. Now Beijing finds itself walking a tightrope, writes the Guardian’s China Affairs correspondent Vincent Ni. On Thursday, as she refused to use the word “invasion” to describe Russia’s action, the foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, also indicated that China would not provide arms to Russia. “I believe that as a strong country, Russia doesn’t need China or other countries to provide weapons to it,” she said. Bonny Lin, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC, said “Besides China’s effort to balance its various goals, all indications point to the fact that China prioritises its relationship with Russia at the moment,” adding that Moscow’s action also posed a problem for Beijing. In public, Beijing advocates the position that sovereignty is sacrosanct. This is a discourse it often deploys when it talks about Taiwan, which it regards as a breakaway province. On the other hand, the Ukraine crisis offers Beijing the opportunity to express grievances against its common adversaries with Russia: the US and Nato. So far, the latter appears to be weighing heavier in Beijing’s messaging. Read Vincent’s piece here: China ponders how Russia’s actions in Ukraine could reshape world order Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the exiled Russian businessman and Putin opponent, has said he believes the Russian President is “capable of anything”, even, he said potentially “pressing the red button” to launch a nuclear war, the Guardian’s Kate Connolly reports. He said if he was not stopped Putin could set his sights on threatening other countries, citing the corridor between Lithuania and the Russian province Kaliningrad as a likely next target. The most important contribution the west could make to help bring the Russian invasion of Ukraine to an end was to show unity against Putin’s aggression and provide training, weaponry and voluntary fighters to Ukraine. Media on the ground in Ukraine and Russia also had a vital role to play. But he said he feared that a weak leadership in the west made Putin “feel safe” and would be exploited by him. If more was not done to help Ukraine he would feel emboldened to go further, he said. Speaking from the London office of his pro-democracy NGO, The Dossier Centre, on Friday via Zoom with European journalists, Khodorkovsky, who spent ten years in a Russian prison on fraud and embezzlement charges that were widely believed to have been politically motivated, said sanctions against Russia were important “from an ethical viewpoint” but otherwise largely tokenistic. Whilst they might have an impact in the medium term, they would take around three years to properly kick in and Putin would have “taken all of that into account” before launching his attack, he said. The world was such a global village an oligarch could easily offset the effect of many of the sanctions, he said. They can do their shopping in Dubai rather than in Milan. They can get supplies of microprocessors from China instead of from the United States and so on. Asked if there was evidence that Putin was suffering from an illness, or was simply playing on the “crazy man strategy”, Khodorkovsky responded: “He has found himself in an information bubble which forms a very distorted picture of the world in his eyes.... what does that mean for the rest of us? It means he’s very dangerous. Does it mean that he’s capable of pressing the red button? The nuclear button? I hope that he hasn’t gone that far yet in his understanding of the world, but one could never be confident about this.” Khodorkovsky said that it was time for Britain to decide whether it should continue to tolerate the extent to which Russian influence and investment in Britain, in everything from business and banking to sport and the arts, played an integral part in British life. I would be very intolerant and uncompromising of that part of Putin’s establishment who use the UK... to try to influence the political system of the UK... Is it acceptable, ethically and morally? British society has to decide that for itself. He said he was particularly disturbed at the extent to which “the Kremlin uses US and British legal companies in order to reduce the impact of the sanctions on it by lobbying its interests and bribing representatives of both US and British societies.” He said he might choose to share specific examples at a later date. Khodorkovsky said that opposition to Russia was in a far worse state than when he was behind bars as a Putin opponent in 2003, citing the case of the imprisoned opposition activist Alexei Navalny. “I was at least tried in the Moscow City Court, whilst Navalny is being tried in his penal colony.” Referring to his military attack on Ukraine, Khodorkovsky said he believed the biggest challenge facing Putin would be the “psychological task” of keeping the army on board because Ukrainians had long formed a significant part of the Soviet forces up to the highest ranks and many would therefore question what they were doing attacking Ukraine or would face the questioning and doubts of their families.. He fought back tears as he described being overwhelmed as he had watched the invasion unfold. It is just impossible, unimaginable. Except the day before it was impossible and today it’s reality. Russian forces have renewed their assault on the eastern city of Kharkiv hitting it with air strikes and shelling, the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont reports. Residents in the city close to the Russian border had earlier reported air raid sirens and the sounds of bombers over head. Now Roland Oliphant of the Telegraph, who has been reporting from around Kharkiv, is tweeting that it sounds as if a multiple launch rocket system is hitting the city. Russian President Vladimir Putin has urged the Ukrainian army to overthrow its leadership whom he labelled as a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who have has lodged itself in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.” Addressing the Ukrainian military in a televised address, a visibly angry Putin urged the military to “take power in your own hands”. It seems like it will be easier for us to agree with you than this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis. Putin further repeated his claim that the Ukrainian leadership had been engaged in “genocide” in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. We are fighting with nationalist groups that are directly responsible for the genocide of the Donbas and the bloodshed of peaceful civilians in the two republics. In the address, Putin further accused the Ukrainian “neo-Nazi” leadership of acting like terrorists, by ‘cowering behind civilians’. The Council of Europe has launched a process to suspend Russia’s membership, Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said, Reuters reports. Russia has been a member of the 47-nation human rights body since 1996. It was kicked out of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly over the annexation of Crimea in 2014, but reinstated in 2019 with full rights. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has urged the US to use its influence on “hesitant European countries” that oppose banning Russia from the Swift payments system. Kuleba did not name those “hesitant” countries, but we know they include France, Germany and Italy. Earlier, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy was withering about Italy’s prime minister Mario Draghi, in a tweet about apparent attempts to set up a phone call. Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister Sergey Lavrov are expected to be put on an EU list of individuals facing asset freezes, the bloc’s high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, has confirmed. Speaking ahead of a meeting of EU foreign affairs ministers, where a second tranche of sanctions against Russia will be approved, Borrell said: If there are no surprises and no one objects as we require unanimity then, yes, Putin and Lavrov will be on the list. As the Guardian’s Daniel Boffey reports, the move is largely symbolic, as the Russian president is unlikely to have identifiable personal assets abroad, but it will be part of an attempt to highlight the EU’s resolve. “I think we agree that Putin and Lavrov, as far as the freezing of assets is concerned, that we will find a consensus here,” said Luxembourg’s foreign minister, Jean Asselborn. Putin and Lavrov, who has been foreign minister since 2004, would not face travel bans as the EU wishes to maintain a diplomatic way through the crisis, ministers said. The hacker group Anonymous has said it is “officially in cyber war against the Russian government” reports the Guardian’s global technology editor Dan Milmo. The statement in a tweet thread came as several Russian government websites such as the Kremlin and the Duma, as well as the state-backed RT news site (formerly Russia Today), were hit by so-called distributed denial of service attacks. Anonymous, whose targets in the past have included the CIA and IS, added in another tweet that private sector entities would be affected too. In a DDoS, a website is deluged with spurious requests for information – akin to stuffing a thousand envelopes through a letterbox every second – that render the site unreachable. According to Craig Terron, a senior analyst at Recorded Future, which monitors cyber-threats, the RT site remained “intermittently available” today, having gone down at 5pm (2pm GMT) Moscow time on Thursday. The website is intermittently available, with continued reports of users unable to access the website, as of 1330 Moscow time on 25 February. RT said it had been “able to repel” the hit on its servers. Ukrainian officials have said that higher than usual radiation levels have been detected in the area near the old Chernobyl nuclear plant, scene of the world’s worst nuclear disaster. After Russia said it had taken control of the plant, Ukraine’s State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate reported on Friday higher gamma radiation levels had been detected in the Chernobyl zone. It said the levels were “not critical”, but didn’t provide details of the increase, Associated Press and Reuters reported. The inspectorate attributed the rise to a “disturbance of the topsoil due to the movement of a large amount of heavy military equipment through the exclusion zone and the release of contaminated radioactive dust into the air”. Nuclear experts said on Friday that radiation levels had risen at the Chernobyl plant, based on automated monitoring data, but cast doubt about attributing that to disturbed soil, reports the Guardian’s science correspondent Hannah Devlin. Prof Tom Scott, a nuclear expert at Bristol University, who was in touch with the Ukrainian team responsible for managing Chernobyl earlier this week, said: Radiation levels have gone up, which in normal times would be very unusual, but not to levels where I’d be really concerned or panic. Scott said reports of the spike being caused by disturbed radioactive topsoil did not entirely fit with automated monitoring data he had seen, which showed highest levels of radioactivity immediately around the power plant, which doesn’t have any soil. The most toxic nuclear waste is encased in a concrete sarcophagus inside Reactor No 4, covered by a large metal arch-shaped structure. Scott said that the metal exterior could be damaged by artillery fire, but that “it would take something deliberate and substantial” to damage the internal concrete sarcophagus and cause a major radioactive leak. Moldova’s national naval agency has said a ship in “neutral waters” of the Black Sea has been hit by a missile, leaving two crew members seriously injured, Associated Press reports. The Naval Agency said in a statement that the source of the missile that hit the Moldova-flagged Millennial Spirit on Friday was unknown. A fire broke out onboard the ship; the equipment and lifeboats were destroyed. The ship’s crew left the ship equipped only with life jackets. The agency said that the company that operates the tanker is a Ukrainian legal entity and the crew members are Russian citizens. Rescue operations were carried out by Ukrainian authorities, the Moldovan agency said. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney has hit back, after Russia cited Ireland as part of an attempted justification for invading Ukraine. Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov referred to Ireland and the status of the English language, as he accused the west of double standards over Ukraine. The response from Dublin was swift: While most global powers have been roundly damning of Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine, India’s response has been somewhat muted – a reflection of the diplomatic dilemma that the country now finds itself in: torn between Russia and the west. As the Guardian’s south Asia correspondent Hannah Ellis-Petersen writes, hours after Putin’s invasion began, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, was among the first to call the Russian president, calling for a “cessation” of violence, but steering clear of directly condemning his actions. India’s top diplomat at the UN was equally evasive, expressing “regret” at the invasion, and calling for “urgent de-escalation of tensions”. India currently relies on Russia for around 60%-70% of their arms and military hardware, which are crucial at a time when they are engaged in a frosty stand-off with China along their border. India recently purchased a missile defence system from Russia and relies on it for essential spare parts for defence machinery. Putin made a visit to India as recently as December 2021, one of the only countries the Russian President has travelled to during the pandemic, a sign of the close ties between the two countries. India also relies on Russia for vital supplies of fertiliser, and the severe sanctions on Russia could severely impact Indian farming and industry. On Friday, the Russian chargé d’affaires in Delhi, Roman Babushkin, said that they “expect our Indian partners to support Russia” at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) when a resolution opposing the military Russian operation against Ukraine will come up for a vote. India is expected to abstain. India’s relatively neutral position is likely to anger the US, another ally of the Indian government. In a call to the Indian foreign minister S Jaishankar on Thursday, US secretary of state Antony Blinken urged a “strong collective response”. But the request was met with derision by a ministry of information spokesperson, Kanchan Gupta, who in a mocking tweet questioned why India should back the US position when they had taken “consistently anti-India positions at the UN...yet you want India’s help”. The Ukrainian ambassador to India, Igor Polikha, pleaded with Modi to use his influence with Russia to restrain Putin’s actions, calling it a “moment of destiny”. Talking to India media, Polikha said: I don’t know how many world leaders Putin may listen to, but the stature of Modi makes me hopeful. We are waiting, asking, pleading for the assistance of India. Russia is ready to send diplomats to Minsk for talks with Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. According to the Interfax news agency, Peskov said Vladimir Putin was ready to send officials from the Kremlin, defence and foreign affairs ministries for talks in the Belarusian capital to discuss “the neutral status of Ukraine”, adding that Ukraine’s “demilitarisation and denazification” were an essential part of this neutral status. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier in the day urged Russia to start negotiations, although it is unclear under which terms he would be ready to talk. Putin’s entirely unfounded claim that Ukraine is under Nazi rule is a key part of the Kremlin’s justification for war. As Russia has just sent a massive invading army into Ukraine, the latest announcement is been treated with scepticism by Moscow reporters. The Kremlin statement came not long after foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia was only prepared to talk once Ukrainians “put down their arms”, suggesting, perhaps, some confusion over the Russian government’s intentions. From an Associated Press reporter in the north of Kyiv: Kyiv “has entered into a defensive phase”, its mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has said, as Russian forces closed in on Ukraine’s capital. Speaking to journalists, he said: The city has gone into a defensive phase. Shots and explosions are ringing out in some neighbourhoods. Saboteurs have already entered Kyiv. The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us. Quote from Reuters. Russia’s military has said it has blocked Kyiv from the western side and captured the strategic Hostomel airport outside the capital, news agency Interfax reports. Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov also said more than 200 people from Ukrainian special units had been killed. The Russian claims have not been independently verified. As Associated Press reports, the airport has a long runway allowing the landing of heavy-lift transport planes, which means Russia could airlift troops directly to Kyiv’s outskirts. Hostomel is just 7 km (4 miles) northwest of the city. Ukrainian military vehicles were reported to be entering Kyiv to defend the capital, according to TV news cited by Reuters. The EU is preparing to freeze the assets of Russia’s president Vladimir Putin and foreign minister Sergei Lavrov as part of a third round of sanctions against Russia, the Financial Times reports. Foreign ministers are planning to approve the sanctions package this afternoon, along with a number of measures against Russian banks and industry, the paper quotes three people familiar with the matter. Putin and Lavrov will not be subject to a ban on travelling under the measures, the FT writes, underlining the EU’s willingness to keep symbolic diplomatic possibilities open. An EU official, speaking under condition of anonymity, told Reuters: “We are moving as quickly as we can,” adding the bloc could also target “many more” oligarchs. Russian forces have taken control of Hostomel airfield near Kyiv and landed paratroopers in the area, Russia’s Interfax news agency is reporting. Russia’s defence ministry said the Russian military “eliminated” more than 200 people from Ukraine’s special units during the capture of the strategic aerodrome. It said forces had blocked access to Kyiv from the west, and separatist forces in eastern Ukraine had attacked Ukrainian army positions with Russian army support. Kyiv has entered into “a defensive phase”, the mayor of the Ukrainian capital, Vitali Klitschko, says. Speaking at a news briefing, Klitschko said: The city has gone into a defensive phase. Shots and explosions are ringing out in some neighbourhoods. Saboteurs have already entered Kyiv. The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us. The Russian news agency Tass reports that the Russian defence ministry says forces will not strike residential areas of Kyiv. Formula One has cancelled the Russian Grand Prix after the state’s invasion of Ukraine, the Guardian’s Giles Richards reports. The sport did not issue any condemnation of Russia but cited the “impossibility” of holding the race under the current circumstances. The meeting, set to take place in September, is expected to be provisionally replaced on the calendar by Turkey, with the Istanbul Park circuit already on standby as a replacement for potential Covid-related cancellations. On Thursday evening F1’s CEO Stefano Domenicali held a meeting with the team principals and the FIA to discuss the Russian GP, with clear, widespread opinion that the sport could not go to Russia while it engaged in an invasion of Ukraine. Red Bull’s team principal Christian Horner had described the idea of going to Russia as simply untenable and the world champion Max Verstappen had decried the idea of going racing in a country that had declared war on a neighbouring state. Aston Martin’s Sebastian Vettel was the first driver to declare he would boycott the race if it went ahead. A statement from F1 read: the FIA Formula 1 World Championship visits countries all over the world with a positive vision to unite people, bringing nations together. We are watching the developments in Ukraine with sadness and shock and hope for a swift and peaceful resolution to the present situation. On Thursday evening Formula One, the FIA, and the teams discussed the position of our sport, and the conclusion is, including the view of all relevant stakeholders, that it is impossible to hold the Russian Grand Prix in the current circumstances. China’s president, Xi Jinping, told Vladimir Putin that China supports Russia in efforts to resolve the Ukraine crisis via dialogue, Chinese state media is reporting. In a readout of the call on state broadcaster CCTV, Xi pointed out that the “situation in eastern Ukraine has undergone rapid changes... (and) China supports Russia and Ukraine to resolve the issue through negotiation”. According to the Chinese media readout, Putin outlined the reasons for Russia launching the “special military operation”, and told Xi that Nato and the United States had “long ignored Russia’s reasonable security concerns”. He also told Xi on the call that Russia was ready to hold “high-level” talks with Ukraine. According to the CCTV readout, Xi said China was “willing to work with all parties in the international community to advocate a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept, and firmly safeguard the international system with the United Nations at the core”. Here’s more on Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s recent comments as he called on Vladimir Putin to sit return to the negotiation table. In a televised statement today, Zelenskiy said he is calling on the Russian leader to negotiate to put an end to the fighting. I would like to address the president of Russia once again: fighting is happening all over Ukraine, let’s sit down for talks to stop deaths. The Ukrainian leader urged Europe to act more quickly and forcefully in imposing sanctions on Moscow for invading Ukraine, accusing western allies of politicking as Moscow’s forces advanced on Kyiv. “Europe has enough strength to stop this aggression,” Zelenskiy said, adding that everything from banning Russians from entering the European Union to cutting Moscow off from Swift to an oil embargo should be on the table. You still can stop this aggression. You have to act swiftly. According to a leaked draft of the new sanctions agreed by EU leaders, all members of the Duma, the Russian security council and any Belarusian officials in the military and ministry of defence who “facilitated” the invasion of Ukraine will be subject to travel bans and asset freezes, the Guardian’s Daniel Boffey reports. The previous sanctions hit the 351 Duma members who had supported recognition by Russia of the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. There is a proposal to enlarge the listing criteria for sanctioning individuals as well to “better capture other forms of support to the regime, including oligarchs”. Two additional banks will be subject to sanctions: Alfa bank and Otkritie, and there will be a prohibition on EU financial service providers lending to eight companies, ranging from the owners of seaports to automobile manufacturers. There is also a proposal to prohibit new deposits of over €100,000 in EU banks by Russian nationals. Foreign ministers will meet later this afternoon to approve the draft text. “Those pictures, that footage that everybody saw, that’s literally my home... Thanks god my family is safe.” This was the moment on a live broadcast when a BBC journalist from Ukraine saw footage of her family home, partially destroyed overnight in Kyiv. Afghanistan’s Taliban have said they are “concerned” about the possibility of civilian casualties in Ukraine, reports the Guardian’s Akhtar Makoii The Taliban foreign ministry said in a statement they will remain neutral in line with their foreign policy. The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan calls for restraint by both parties. All sides need to desist from taking positions that could intensify violence. We are closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine and express concerns about the real possibility of civilian casualties. Afghanistan’s new rulers, who have not been recognised by any country, have asked Ukraine and Russia to resolve the problem through “dialogue and peaceful means.” The statement called on parties to pay attention to safeguarding the lives of Afghan students and migrants in Ukraine. Hundreds of Afghans were evacuated to Ukraine after the country fell to the Taliban last August. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called on Vladimir Putin to join him at the negotiating table, according to Russian newswire Ria Novosti. Zelenskiy also said Europe can still stop Russia’s aggression if it acts swiftly. Here are some of his other comments, via Reuters. UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ACCUSES EUROPE OF INSUFFICIENT REACTION, SLOW HELP TO UKRAINE WHILE RUSSIAN UKRAINE’S ZELENSKIY SAYS RUSSIAN ASSAULT LIKE REPEAT OF WORLD WAR TWO UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT TELLS ARMED FORCES “YOU ARE ALL WE HAVE” UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT CALLS ON EUROPEAN CITIZENS TO PROTEST TO FORCE THEIR GOVERNMENTS TO MORE DECISIVELY The mayor of Milan has told Valery Gergiev, a conductor close to the Russian president Vladimir Putin, that he will not be allowed to lead an orchestra at the prestigious La Scala opera house in March unless he condemns Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, reports the Guardian’s Angela Giuffrida from Rome. Mayor Giuseppe Sala, who is also president of La Scala, said. We are asking him to take a clear position against this invasion, and in the event he doesn’t do so, we will have to renounce the collaboration. Gergiev, a music director of St Petersburg’s Mariinsky Theatre who was awarded a Hero of Labour of the Russian Federation prize by Putin, is due to return to La Scala on 5 March to finish a programme of Tchaikovsky’s ‘The Queen of Spades’. People are too scared to go out, one resident of the Black Sea port city of Odesa, told the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont. Maryna who lives in Odesa who described the situation in the Black Sea port city. I live in Odesa in Kotovsky settlement on the northern edge of the city. There are not many explosions where I am. It’s a narrow, long town along the coast and I’m in the north whereas most of the military units are in the south. The only thing near me is a training area which I can usually hear and it is quiet. One of strikes yesterday hit a residential area called 411 Battery. It’s a historic area named after the gun battery that defended Odessa in World War II but now it is residential. People in Odessa are mainly staying indoors. The shops are open but people are too scared to go out and yesterday people bought all the bread because they were worried it would run out. Asked what she thought Vladimir Putin intended for Ukraine, she answered: It doesn’t matter what I think. I don’t think anyone really knows what will happen. But what I want is for the Ukrainian armed forces to stop the invaders. I am scared and I am unhappy but I hope they can protect us. More reports of gunfire that can be heard in Kyiv’s historic city centre. Earlier on Thursday the Guardian’s Emma Graham-Harrison met Kyiv residents in an area of the city that had been hit. A selection of the most powerful images from the conflict this morning. See more in our live gallery here which will be updated through the day. India is exploring ways to set up a rupee payment mechanism for trade with Russia to soften the blow on New Delhi of Western sanctions imposed on Russia. Reuters reports that government and banking sources said Indian officials aere concerned that vital supplies of fertilizer from Russia could be disrupted as sanctions intensify, threatening India’s vast farm sector. India has called for an end to violence in Ukraine but refrained from outright condemnation of Russia, with which it has long-standing political and security ties. Fuel, cash and medical supplies are running low in parts of Ukraine after Russia’s invasion, which could drive up to five million people to flee abroad, UN aid agencies said. Reuters reports: At least 100,000 people are uprooted in Ukraine after fleeing their homes, while several thousand have already crossed into neighbouring countries including Moldova, Romania and Poland, UN refugee agency spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told a U.N. briefing in Geneva. “We are still trying to see which civilian infrastructure in Ukraine has been hit where,” Afshan Khan, Unicef’s regional director for Europe and Central Asia, told the briefing. UN human rights office spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said that it had reports of at least 127 civilian casualties in Ukraine, including 25 killed and 102 injured, “caused by shelling and air strikes”. This was likely a significant under-estimate, she said. Turkey cannot stop Russian warships accessing the Black Sea via its straits, as Ukraine has requested, due to a clause in an international pact that allows vessels to return to their home base, the Turkish foreign minister said. Reuters reports: Ukraine has appealed to Turkey to block Russian warships from passing through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits which lead to the Black Sea, after Moscow on Thursday launched a full-blown assault on Ukraine from land, air and sea. Russian forces landed at Ukraine’s Black and Azov Sea ports as part of the invasion. Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, Turkey has control over the straits and can limit the passage of warships during wartime or if threatened, but the request has put the Nato member in a difficult position as it tries to manage its Western commitments and close ties with Russia. Speaking in Kazakhstan, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey was studying Kyiv’s request but said Russia had the right under the Convention to return ships to their home base, in this case the Black Sea. So even if Turkey decided after a legal process to accept Ukraine’s request and close the straits to Russian warships, he said, they would only be prevented from travelling in the other direction, away from their home base into the Mediterranean. The mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv has urged residents to head to subway stations, bomb shelters and basements. Loud blasts were heard in the city earlier, a witness told Reuters, as missile strikes and air raid alerts were reported in a number of cities in Ukraine. There are several lines from the Kremlin coming in on Reuters: Putin will meet the UN Security Council today and hold several international phone calls Russia will impose retaliatory sanctions on western countries Russia recognises Volodymyr Zelenskiy as president of Ukraine Sanctions will cause problems but are solvable since the country has reduced its dependence on foreign imports Russia expects relations with the west to normalise once people understand it was forced to act to protect its security No comment on the duration of the military operations The Kremlin has declined to comment on possible talks between Russia’s President Vladmir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, but acknowledged the latter’s willingness to discuss a possible neutrality pledge by Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would analyse the offer and added that Moscow’s expectations of Kyiv remained unchanged, Reuters reports. Moscow has long demanded guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or allow the bloc to deploy troops and weapons on its territory. The Ski Association of Japan said on Friday it will pull out its team from a ski cross World Cup event in Russia after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, according to news agency Kyodo. The team also plans to ensure the safety of its athletes and bring them home from Russia, the report said. Japan joins several other nations, including Australia and Canada, in abandoning the event. The authorities in Kyiv have told citizens to stay home to avoid “active military operations” in the Obolonskyi district, just north of the city centre, Reuters reports. Meanwhile Unicef’s regional director has said the agency is still trying to see which civilian infrastructure has been hit and where. Russian independent news agency Interfax reports Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov as saying “no one is planning to occupy Ukraine”. He added that Russia still does not recognise the current government in Ukraine as democratic and that president Zelenskiy is lying when he says he is ready to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine. Lavrov said the Russian government wants the Ukrainian people to be independent and that it would ensure the demilitarisation of the country. Separately Reuters reports that Lavrov said Russia is ready for talks once Ukraine’s army stops fighting, and that no one plans to attack the Ukrainian people. “We do not want Neo-Nazis to rule Ukraine,” he said. The UN Refugee Agency has predicted that 4 million people may flee Ukraine to other countries “if the situation escalates further”, Reuters reports. Unicef, which has projected 5 million refugees, said it is strengthening its capacity to help Ukrainian refugees in Moldova, Romania and Poland as a “first call”, and “obviously Hungary and Slovakia as well”. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights denounced the arrests of some 1,800 anti-war protesters in Russia and called for the release of those unlawfully held for voicing opinions. Virgin Atlantic has announced it will avoid Russian airspace, meaning flights between Britain, India and Pakistan will take between 15 and 60 minutes longer. A spokesperson said: We apologise for any inconvenience caused to customers by slightly longer flight times. The safety and security of our customers and people always comes first and we’re monitoring the situation in Ukraine and Russia extremely carefully following the escalation of conflict, continuing to operate in full compliance with relevant safety regulators, authorities and governments. Russia’s ministry for the economy said it is working on measures to minimise the impact of the sanctions imposed by western countries following the invasion of Ukraine. The ministry said this will include plans to expand trade and economic ties with Asia, Reuters reports. The ministry said: We understand that the sanctions pressure we have faced since 2014 will now intensify. The rhetoric of some of our foreign colleagues was such that we have been ready for potential new sanctions for a long time. Thousands of people fleeing war in Ukraine are pouring into Poland, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia as Russian missiles pound the capital Kyiv, with many waiting for hours at congested border crossings in freezing temperatures. Reuters reports: A day after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion, it was mostly women and children crossing, after Ukraine restricted passage for men between 18 and 60 years old. Local media in Poland said some had waited 16-18 hours to cross into Medyka in southern Poland in freezing temperatures. Border authorities said 29,000 people had entered Poland from Ukraine on Thursday, though it was unclear how many were war refugees and not foreigners going home. Poland’s deputy interior minister Pawe* Szefernaker said Ukrainian bus drivers were unable to drive across the border as conscription-age men were being held back in Ukraine. Micha* Mielniczuk, a spokesman for the southern Polish region of Podkarpackie said temporary accommodation was being offered to people arriving. “The vast majority continue on to other places throughout Poland after receiving a warm meal,” he told the PAP news agency. On the border with northern Romania, women were crying as they bid goodbye to male loved ones, setting off to cross into Sighetu Marmatiei, a Reuters witness said. Long queues had formed as cars waited to board a ferry over the Danube river into Isaccea, a town between Moldova and the Black Sea, local media in Romania showed. Slovak authorities urged people to donate blood and set up hospitals with 5,380 beds assigned for the army or NATO use. Across central Europe, on NATO’s eastern flank, volunteers were putting up messages on social media to organise housing and transport for people arriving from the borders. Activists were setting up food and hot drink distribution points and vets were offering to take care of pets. Bulgaria started issuing passports to its citizens in Kyiv who needed travel documents and had sent four buses to the Ukrainian capital to evacuate people. The city of Sumy in northeaster Ukraine has been taken by Russian forces, a resident told the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont. He has been speaking to people across the country, as the all-out Russian attack continues. Sasha, 33, is a vet who lives in Sumy, the main city in the Sumy region, about 200km west of the Russian border, which was taken yesterday by Russian forces. She said: I live not far from the artillery training school which is where there was fighting yesterday when the Russians came. I have elderly parents and a small child, so we think it’s best to stay. A friend is also with us with her child. We have some food and from what I know from friends who tried to leave people are queuing at borders out of Ukraine and men not being allowed leave. All the traffic in the city has stopped and there is Russian armour in the streets. If the citizens don’t shoot at the Russians, they don’t shoot back. They arrived before lunchtime yesterday which is when we heard the shooting. It’s quiet now. So far it is only Russian soldiers and they are not making any proclamations. Everything is closed down and people are staying inside. People spent yesterday in cellars and shelters hiding. I can’t see the Russians... but the artillery school is near us, so we heard the fighting. I don’t know what is going to happen and I’m really scared. I think the Russians want a new Soviet Union and they want us as part of that but no one wants that. We’ve also heard that the Russians have taken Okhtyrka which is 70 kilometres from here and further west. They have put up the Russian flag. Yulia, aged 33, is a translator for an IT programme who normally lives in the centre of Kyiv but has evacuated to a village on the capital’s western outskirts. We’ve been hearing lots of explosions and shelling, mainly in the early morning and late at night. Pretty much, villages around here are now ghost villages. I’m with my mother in law. We have some supplies but my mother in law is a school director and she’s been in the bomb shelter with the children with the children since the invasion and that’s not nice. We’re close to the outskirts of Kyiv. From what I’ve heard some Russian troops have got hold of Ukrainian armed forces and uniforms and are trying to enter Kyiv [a reference to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s comments about “infiltrators” and other Ukrainian government statements.] I think it’s safer to stay where we are. A lot of people trying to leave, but there are attacks across the country. Asked what she thought Vladimir Putin wanted she replied: I’ve been following the Russian social media. I think honestly that their president is a sick person. He wants to restore the USSR. Their people are just following that idea. They are not living in a modern society. They are just following that idea that it is Russia against the US us and the west. It’s just showing the world. Ukraine is just a war fighting platform. I don’t even think it’s personal.” Olena Serdiuk is a 43 year old economist who lives in Dnipro, a city on the river Dnieper just over 200 km from the Black Sea coast. It’s relatively calm here. There’s no shooting and last night there were few people in the streets. There were air strikes on Thursday morning aimed at a radio tower and airfield but I don’t think this city is seen as a valuable target. I’m scared and stressed. I can’t say I feel physically threatened by invasion but I’m, worried about the future and the economy. My husband’s company is in Mariupol. I think I was more [She said she was ] more shocked and shaken by the attack in western regions because no one expected that to happen. While I say I don’t believe the Russians will come into Dnipro maybe that’s just me protecting myself because I don’t want to believe it. I do hope we can manage fight back and that we’ll get help from other countries, because the Kremlin needs to fall. Gunfire has been heard near the government quarter of Kyiv, Associated Press reports. France’s finance minister Bruno Le Maire has said cutting Russia off from the Swift global interbank payments system was “a very last resort”, Reuters reports. The European Union and US chose not to cut Russia off from interbank messaging system, as part of toughened sanctions announced on Thursday in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Ahead of a meeting of eurozone finance ministers, Le Maire said: This is the very last resort, Swift, but this is one of the options that remains on the table. His German counterpart, Christian Lindner, said “all options are on the table” in addition to those already agreed. Lithuania’s prime minister Ingrida Šimonytė has said the discussion about excluding Russia from Swift is not closed: “we know who disagrees and we continue to negotiate with them.” The debate continues to rage, after Ukraine’s government said western allies would have “blood on their hands” if they did not cut Russia out of Swift. The head of the Bundestag’s foreign affairs committee, Norbert Röttgen, is urging Germany to think again on Swift. Along with France and Italy, Germany favours what more hawkish EU diplomats call an “incrementalist” approach to sanctions. A few dozen Ukraine supporters gathered outside Moscow’s de facto diplomatic presence in Taipei, Taiwan on Friday, the Guardian’s Helen Davidson reports from the city. There is a small eastern European community in Taipei, but Taiwanese people have also expressed solidarity with Ukraine as both are self governing democracies threatened by a much larger authoritarian neighbour. Anu Hesselbaek is an Estonian woman who has lived in Taiwan for two years (pictured on the right in red). She told Helen: It’s so important we stand with Ukraine. If this continues it’s like there will be no end to what superpowers can do. Also I think about what happens next. There is a line of Baltic countries which are very afraid right now. Asked about the parallels between Ukraine and Taiwan, she said: I feel sad. If it can happen in Ukraine, why not here? Estonia and Taiwan have exactly the same area. They could both be afternoon snacks. Russia is restricting the use of its airspace for all British flights, including transit, reports news wire Ria Novosti. The report comes after the UK government announced that Russia’s national carrier Aeroflot would be banned from British airspace in a sweeping package of sanctions announced on Thursday. As Russian forces advance on Kyiv, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has been working the phones, urging western countries to toughen up sanctions on Russia and increase military support. Explosions and gunfire have been heard in a northern district of Kyiv, as invading Russian forces closed in, AFP reports from the ground. Pedestrians ran for safety and small arms fire and explosions were heard in the Obolonskyi area. The larger blasts could be heard as far away as the city centre. Russian forces first arrived on the outskirts of Kyiv on Thursday when helicopter-borne troops assaulted an airfield just outside the city, close to Obolonskyi, AFP reports. As they arrived in Obolonskyi within the city, the Ministry of Defence’s Facebook page urged civilians to resist: We urge citizens to inform us of troop movements, to make Molotov cocktails, and neutralise the enemy. Queues of cars at the borders to leave Ukraine for Hungary and Poland now involve a wait of up to 15 hours, reports the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont in Lviv. However one of the consequences of yesterday’s general mobilisation order issued by the Ukrainian president, Voldomyr Zelenskiy, is that most men are not allowed to leave, with many dropping their families off at borders. That call-up of reservists has seen men up to the age of 60 summoned for duty. I heard of the case of one 52-year-old and his friends of similar age here in Lviv being called up yesterday to go to help with the defence of Mariupol. Also complicating the issue for those wanting to leave the country is that with internal flights suspended, and fuel in short supply, there is a 20- litre fuel restriction at six petrol stations and inevitable queues. People have been protesting against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine around the world. Here are some images from demonstrations in Madrid, Sydney and New York. Welcome to rolling updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. I’m Jennifer Rankin and here are the main developments of the past few hours. As dawn broke in Kyiv, air raid sirens were sounding across the Ukrainian capital amid warnings of an imminent Russian attack on the city. Ukraine expects a Russian tank attack later on Friday which could become the hardest day in the war, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister said. Anton Herashchenko said the defenders of Kyiv were ready with anti-tank missiles supplied by foreign allies. Earlier, Kyiv residents reported waking to the sound of explosions as reports circulated that Russia had launched a series of missile strikes on the city of just under 3 million people. Many civilians sought safety in bomb shelters and metro stations as reports of Russian tanks were moving closer to the city from all sides. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said it is the view of British intelligence that Russia intends to invade the whole of Ukraine but its army failed to deliver on the first day of its invasion. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said “all evidence suggests that Russia intends to encircle and threaten” the Ukrainian capital. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has confirmed multiple reports of Russian missile strikes in a national address early on Friday morning. Multiple explosions were heard in Kyiv on Friday morning as the Russian offensive entered its second day. Two buildings were on fire in the south east of the capital after a Russian plane was shot down and a border post in the south east was hit by a missile, causing casualties. Zelenskiy said 137 people have died and 316 had been wounded so far. In a video address late on Thursday, he lamented that Ukraine had been “left alone to defend our state”, but said he would stay on in the capital despite being Russia’s “target number one”. Ukraine has decreed a full military mobilisation and all men aged 18-60 have been forbidden from leaving Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be handing over this live blog to my colleagues in London. You can also reach me on Twitter to share your feedback and updates on the unfolding crisis in Ukraine. Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence, Hanna Malyar, said the Russian military seized two cars of the Ukrainian armed forces before changing into the uniform of the Ukrainian military and then driving to the centre of Kyiv from Obolonskyi. Ukrainian lieutenant general Valerii Zaluzhniy appeared to confirm reports in a statement on the website of Ukraine’s armed forces. The charred remains of a residential building in Kyiv has been shared by Ukrainian media today. Early on Friday morning, two residential buildings were seen on fire in south-east Kyiv after they were hit by falling debris from an aircraft that was shot down. The fire comes after reports emerged from a Ukrainian interior ministry official who earlier said Russian aircraft had been shot down in the Darnytskyi district of Kyiv. Myanmar has said it backs Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Brig. Gen Zaw Min Tun, spokesman for the junta in Myanmar, told The New York Times by telephone: In the case of Russia and Ukraine, Russia has done its part to maintain its sovereignty, and I think it is the right thing to do. Russia is also a big country among world powers and is showing that it also plays a main role in the balance sheet of maintaining world peace.” UK defence secretary has said it is the view of British intelligence that Russia intends to invade the whole of Ukraine but its army failed to deliver on the first day of its invasion. Ben Wallace said he estimated Russia has lost more than 450 personnel and the Russian army failed to deliver its major objectives on day one of its invasion. The UK’s ministry of defence earlier released an intelligence update on the developments in Ukraine. Russian forces have likely captured the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Workers have reportedly been detained by Russian troops. The Ukrainian Armed Forces have reportedly halted Russia’s advance towards Chernihiv. Fighting probably continues on the outskirts of the city. It is unlikely that Russia has achieved its planned day one military objectives. Ukrainian forces have presented fierce resistance across all axes of Russia’s advance.” Overnight, banking officials were also seeking to calm Russians about the effects of sanctions. Russian banks that landed on US, EU and UK sanctions lists have spent the night reassuring depositors that their money is safe, in efforts to maintain calm and prevent bank runs. VTB, Russia’s second-largest bank, said that the sanctions would not affect the ability of clients to withdraw money at any cash machine in Russia, and that the bank had not restricted foreign currency exchanges. Gazprombank, the country’s third-largest, assured customers that the sanctions against it were “not blocking (SDN) and do not affect the bank’s regular operations.” A Guardian correspondent on Monday observed tellers at Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, telling customers they had already exchanged all their reserves of foreign currency and that they would need to come back the next day. Sberbank gave similar assurances to customers, while saying it needed to review the conditions of the new restrictions under the US Treasury sanctions. US banks have until May 25 to finalise their dealings with Sberbank, VTB, Otkritie, Sovcombank, and VEB equities, the body said. Here is a report from the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth on the Kremlin’s messaging to Russians. Russian lawmakers have been busy trying to justify the country’s invasion of Ukraine, despite growing evidence of missile and rocket strikes on population centres. Valentina Matviyenko, the chairwoman of Russia’s Federation Council, said that the government had “no other choice” but to launch an attack that appears to be aimed at capturing major Ukrainian cities like Kyiv. “Russia has announced a special military operation to force Ukraine to peace, to stop its militarisation going on in the most active way,” she said in public remarks on Friday morning. Matviyenko, who was born in western Ukraine, added: “We were left with no other choice. Yes, it is not an easy choice, but it is the only way to stop the fratricidal war.” Vyacheslav Volodin, the chairman of the State Duma, repeated earlier remarks that the massive attack on their country was being carried out in the interests of Ukrainians. “Ukrainian citizens shouldn’t be afraid of the peacekeeping operation. It is solely aimed at demilitarization,” Volodin said during a visit to Nicaragua. He also repeated claims that the operation was aimed at de-Nazification: an indication that if the operation is successful, Russia may seek to carry out reprisals against Ukrainains. “Ukraine must become a free, independent, democratic and peaceful nation once it is free from the anti-popular regime with a Nazi ideology, and begin developing in the interests of its own citizens,” he said. Russian Rosgvardia troops with prisoner vans have been pictured entering Ukraine and US intelligence have warned that Russia has drawn up lists with the names of activists and others who it is planning to target. While that intelligence has not been confirmed, the US has correctly predicted the broader Russian invasion into Ukraine. And Putin has warned that he has planned to punish those guilty of violence against Russians. Photos of devastation across Ukraine have emerged from the nation’s state emergency service. A series of photos uploaded to the agency’s official Twitter account early on Friday say they show the aftermath of the shelling in Starobilsk, Luhansk, eastern Ukraine. Others show firefighting and rescue teams battling blazes from buildings. Some more powerful words from Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Addressing his country in a national address this morning, he aid: They say that civilian objects are not a target for them. It is a lie, they do not distinguish in which areas to operate.” Russian forces that entered Ukraine through Belarus are within kilometres of reaching Kyiv, according to US officials. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers on a phone call that Russian mechanised forces that entered from Belarus were about 20 miles (32km) from Kyiv, according to a person familiar with the call, the Associated Press reports. The call was said to have taken place about 6.30pm ET. The officials described another Russian element that entered Ukraine from Russia being a bit further away, but that both were headed toward Kyiv with the goal of encircling the city and potentially toppling the Ukrainian government, according to the lawmaker on the call. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier said the government had information that “subversive groups” were encroaching on the city, and US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Kyiv “could well be under siege”. Ukraine’s president has said his country has been left on its own to fight Russia after the Kremlin launched a large-scale invasion that killed more than 130 Ukrainians in the first day. In a video address to the nation just after midnight, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: We have been left alone to defend our state. Who is ready to fight alongside us? I don’t see anyone. Who is ready to give Ukraine a guarantee of Nato membership? Everyone is afraid. Zelenskiy said that 137 Ukrainians, both military personnel and civilians, had been killed since the start of the attack early Thursday. Another 316 had been wounded, he said. The president added that he and his family remained in Ukraine, despite Russia identifying him as “target number one”. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by taking down the head of state. I am staying in the government quarter together with others. The enemy has designated me as the target number one, and my family as the target number two”. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has asked eastern European Nato members for defence assistance. Zelenskiy spoke with Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda on Friday to seek defence assistance from eastern European members of Nato and help in bringing Russia to the negotiating table. We need effective international assistance. Discussed this with Andrzej Duda. Appealed to the Bucharest Nine for defence aid, sanctions, pressure on the aggressor. Together we have to put Russia at the negotiating table. We need anti-war coalition.” Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba earlier described the attack on Kyiv this morning as “horrific” likening the assault as akin to an attack from Nazi Germany. Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one. Stop Putin. Isolate Russia. Severe all ties. Kick Russia out of everywhere.” Ukraine expects a Russian tank attack on its capital, Kyiv, later on Friday which could become the hardest day in the war, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister said. Anton Herashchenko said the defenders of Kyiv were ready with anti-tank missiles supplied by foreign allies. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister also agreed with the assessment that Russian forces may enter areas just outside Kyiv today. The minister added that Ukrainian army units are defending positions on four fronts despite being outnumbered. A Ukrainian military official also said Ukrainian forces managed to repel Russian troops near Chernihiv. This coincides with a report from Ukraine’s defence ministry which earlier said airborne assault troops have blown up a bridge over the Teteriv River at Ivankiv, located about 50km (31 miles) north of Kyiv, in an effort to prevent a Russian column of forces from advancing toward the capital. The ministry said the Russian advance was stopped. The international criminal court says it is following developments in Ukraine with increasing concern, according to a statement seen by Reuters. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan on Friday expressed his concern over the Russian invasion of Ukraine and said his court may investigate possible war crimes in the country. I remind all sides conducting hostilities on the territory of Ukraine that my office may exercise its jurisdiction and investigate any act of genocide, crime against humanity or war crime committed within Ukraine.” The ICC prosecutors office will continue to closely monitor situation in Ukraine and may investigate any crime against humanity or war crime committed in Ukraine. Images of damaged buildings, residential towers and even classrooms are beginning to filter in after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed multiple reports of Russian missile strikes across Ukraine in a national address early on Friday morning. Zelenskiy said the strikes began at 4am local time on Friday, adding that Russian troops were stopped by Ukrainian forces from advancing in most directions. The Guardian’s Peter Beaumont in Ukraine’s western city of Lviv has given his report on the current crisis unfolding around Kyiv. On the second day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has become increasingly clear what the Kremlin’s military tactics are: which is very quickly to put pressure on the capital Kyiv. Kyiv is facing threats both from its eastern edges, from the west more generally since the capture of the Chernobyl nuclear plant site, and now, according to Ukrainian officials, from the threat of infiltration into the city. While it’s unclear whether the Russian military intends to capture the Ukrainian capital or force it’s capitulation, a combination of missile attacks, a rapid airborne advance using helicopters to the outskirts, and the continuing advance by Russian armour is putting Kyiv in an increasingly difficult position. The latest update from Ukraine’s General Staff claims that the key Hostomel air base, just outside Kyiv is controlled by Kyiv forces again, however heavy fighting is going on north west of the capital. There are also reports that the Ukrainian military has destroyed at least one bridge to slow the Russian advance, although we know that Russian forces have bridge laying companies. This morning, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the government had information that “subversive groups” were encroaching on the city, while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Kyiv “could well be under siege” in what U.S. officials believe is a brazen attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to dismantle the government and replace it with his own regime. While Zelinskiy said this morning that Russian troops had been halted in most places but even if that is the case, which seems to contradict his comments on encroachment, the situation is serious. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers on a phone call Thursday evening that Russian mechanised forces that entered from Belarus were about 20 miles from Kyiv. While there has been some focus on Russian losses inflicted by Ukrainian defenders – including helicopters, soldiers and armoured vehicles – it’s worth pointing out these are so far at the level the Russian military would have priced in for such a quick and aggressive advance and not evidence necessarily any sign so far that the Russian operation is struggling. We have more from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s national address this morning. Speaking to his citizens in a video address in both Ukrainian and Russian, Zelenskiy continued to make appeals to his neighbour for a ceasefire. Russia will have to talk to us sooner or later about how to end hostilities and stop this invasion. The sooner the conversation begins, the smaller Russia’s losses will be.” Zelenskiy added that world is continuing to observe what is going on in Ukraine from afar while new sanctions have not convinced Russia to withdraw from an attack. This morning we are defending our state alone. Like yesterday, the world’s most powerful forces are watching from afar. Was Russia convinced by yesterday’s sanctions? We hear in our sky and see on our earth that this was not enough.” He added that until the attacks stop, “we will be defending our country until then”. We are receiving multiple reports from journalists on the ground in Ukraine that air raid sirens are sounding in Kyiv this morning. Guardian reporter Emma Graham-Harrison is currently in Kyiv and tells us the sirens began sounding about three hours after loud explosions first woke the city around 4.30am. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has confirmed multiple reports of Russian missile strikes in a national address early on Friday morning, Zelenskiy said the strikes began at 4am local time on Friday, adding that Russian troops were stopped by Ukrainian forces from advancing in most directions. The president added that Russian strikes aimed at both military and civilian targets, Reuters reports. Meanwhile, sirens rang out in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv early on Friday, a Reuters witness said. Welcome to rolling updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and here are the main developments of the past few hours. As dawn breaks in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, air raid sirens are sounding across the capital. Earlier, residents reported waking to the sound of explosions as reports circulated that Russia had launched a series of missile strikes on the city of just under 3 million. Many civilians sought safety in bomb shelters and metro stations as reports of Russian tanks were moving closer to the city from all sides. Here’s what we know so far: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has confirmed multiple reports of Russian missile strikes in a national address early on Friday morning. Multiple explosions have been heard in Kyiv on Friday morning as the Russian offensive entered its second day. Two buildings were on fire in the south-east of the capital after a Russian plane was shot down and a border post in the south-east was hit by a missile, causing casualties. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said “all evidence suggests that Russia intends to encircle and threaten” the Ukrainian capital. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said 137 people have died and 316 had been wounded so far. In a video address late on Thursday, he lamented that Ukraine had been “left alone to defend our state”, but said he would stay on in the capital despite being Russia’s “target number one”. The UK said Ukrainian forces had provided “fierce resistance across all axes of Russia’s advance” and that is was unlikely Russia had achieved all its objectives for the first day of the invasion. Ukraine has decreed a full military mobilisation and all men aged 18-60 have been forbidden from leaving Ukraine. Thousands attempted to flee Kyiv, leading to large traffic queues. Meanwhile, pictures have emerged of Kyiv residents crowding into underground metro stations where they are taking shelter from further Russian attacks. Hundreds of people have been arrested in Russian cities after protests against the invasion. Police have held at least 1,702 people, according to the OVD-Info monitor, with most of the arrests made in Moscow and St Petersburg. Global leaders have decried Russia’s actions, with many announcing fresh sanctions. US president Joe Biden ordered broad new sanctions, and the UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced its “largest ever” curbs. However, there was concern that the EU was holding back from excluding Russia from the Swift international banking payments system. Officials in western capitals have expressed bewilderment about Vladimir Putin’s mindset and choice in going to war. One described him as “despotic” while Emmanuel Macron said that the Russian leader had been “duplicitous” in talks before the invasion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/16/edf-uk-profits-hit-by-fall-in-sterling-and-nuclear-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-16T17:58:16Z","webTitle":"EDF UK profits hit by fall in sterling and nuclear prices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/16/edf-uk-profits-hit-by-fall-in-sterling-and-nuclear-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/16/edf-uk-profits-hit-by-fall-in-sterling-and-nuclear-prices","fields":{"headline":"EDF UK profits hit by fall in sterling and nuclear prices","bodyText":"French state-owned energy firm EDF reported falling profits, including a downturn in the UK due to falling prices for nuclear power, improved energy efficiency among its household customers and the slide in the value of sterling since the Brexit vote. Profits in the UK division, which includes EDF Energy, slumped by a third to €1.035 (£920m) as sales dwindled by €579m to €8.68bn, partly because UK customers pay their bills in pounds but the company reports its results in euros. EDF said the decline of the pound against the euro had cost it €608m. The company has faced criticism over delays and the cost of its £20bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant. However, it has blamed a 12% fall in nuclear energy prices in the UK, where it is the market leader. Revenues were depressed by lower home energy consumption among customers, with usage falling 1.9% due to “milder weather and rising energy efficiency”. EDF, which is majority-owned by the French government, reported a 2.2% decline in overall revenues to €69.6bn, with profits down 16% to €13.7bn, excluding the impact of asset sales. It said group results had declined due to lower prices in almost all of the regions where it operates and an exodus of nearly 1 million customers. It was also affected by lower nuclear and hydroelectric output in its domestic market, where it is the dominant supplier with more than 85% market share. Last year the company had unplanned outages at some of its 58 French nuclear plants, where reactors had to be shut down for safety reasons. It lost 960,000 customers, shaving €341m off profits, blaming the exodus on heightened competition, including in the UK. Chief executive and chairman Jean-Bernard Levy said the group’s profitability in the face of a “difficult market context” was evidence of EDF’s financial strength, adding that he expects a “rebound” in 2018. He said the company would launch an “unprecedented” ramp-up of renewable energy this year, as France looks to reduce nuclear’s share of power generation from 75% to 50% by 2025."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2021/feb/18/australian-politics-facebook-google-media-bargaining-code-victoria-lockdown-melbourne-daniel-andrews-masks-scott-morrison-brittany-higgins-rape-allegations-linda-reynolds","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-02-18T08:04:08Z","webTitle":"Facebook says it did not intend to ban government pages – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/feb/18/australian-politics-facebook-google-media-bargaining-code-victoria-lockdown-melbourne-daniel-andrews-masks-scott-morrison-brittany-higgins-rape-allegations-linda-reynolds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2021/feb/18/australian-politics-facebook-google-media-bargaining-code-victoria-lockdown-melbourne-daniel-andrews-masks-scott-morrison-brittany-higgins-rape-allegations-linda-reynolds","fields":{"headline":"Facebook says it did not intend to ban government pages – as it happened","bodyText":"With that, I will leave you for the day. Here’s a recap of today’s news: Scott Morrison has slammed Facebook as “arrogant” and warned Australia “will not be intimated” after the tech giant banned Australians from seeing or posting news content on its site, weeks after it threatened such a move in response to the federal government’s proposed news media code. Morrison hit back at Facebook via a post on his Facebook page. Earlier, treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he spoke with Facebook head Mark Zuckerberg about the ban on Thursday morning. While major news outlets were Facebook’s intended target, the social media site has also banned pages belonging to the Bureau of Meteorology, state health departments, charities and Facebook itself. After the Western Australian opposition leader’s page was banned ahead of the upcoming state election next month, premier Mark McGowan likened Facebook to the North Korean regime. Brittany Higgins, the former Liberal staffer who alleges she was raped by a more senior colleague on a couch in Parliament House in 2019, has told Guardian Australia if there is unofficial government briefing going on against her or her loved ones – it needs to stop. Meanwhile, Liberal MPs have refused to acknowledge allegations the prime minister’s office is backgrounding journalists against Higgins, suggesting her now partner holds a gripe against the government. On Thursday afternoon, Australian federal police confirmed they had met with defence minister Linda Reynolds and her chief of staff in her office, 11 days after the alleged rape occurred in there. Earlier, Reynolds broke down in in the Senate after speaking about the rape allegations. Embattled casino operator Crown Resorts has plunged into the red as a result of Covid-19 lockdowns and its regulatory crisis, losing $120m over the past six months of 2020. This compares to a profit of $219m for the same period in 2019. Australia will begin its first coronavirus vaccinations from Monday in about 240 aged care homes across more than 190 locations around the country. The rollout will begin with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, with the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine due to join the rollout from early March. South Australia has reopened its border to regional Victoria. On Thursday, there were no cases of community transmission of coronavirus announced in Australia. Have a great evening, we’ll be back tomorrow. At 5.30am Australian east coast time, after months of threats and failed attempts to lobby the government over proposed new media laws, Facebook banned the sharing of news in Australia. The first to notice were morning news producers. The main page of the national broadcaster, ABC, was down. Guardian Australia’s page was also down. Australians trying to post links to news publishers on their personal Facebook pages received an error message. Australia’s media bargaining code, which will force tech giants Facebook and Google to broker deals with Australian publishers to pay for linking to news content, passed its first major parliamentary hurdle this week. Google responded by negotiating a reported $30m deal with Australia’s largest locally owned media company. Facebook pulled the plug. But Facebook’s snap ban did not just affect Australia’s news publishers. Read more: The Australian federal police has just released this statement, in relation to the Brittany Higgins rape allegations: A senior member of the Australian Federal Police met with Minister Linda Reynolds and her chief-of-staff on 4 April 2019 in relation to allegations of sexual assault in the Minister’s office on 23 March 2019. The AFP has engaged with the Department of Parliamentary Services and Presiding Officers a number of times. The matter is an open investigation and further commentary could be prejudicial. The AFP will not be making further comment on this matter. The pandemic has hit another major event in 2021: The foreign minister, Marise Payne, is expected to exchange views on climate policy with her American, Japanese and Indian counterparts tonight when they join the first “Quad” call since the Biden administration came to office. A big focus on the Quad call – which begins at 11pm AEDT – will be discussion of strategic developments in the Indo-Pacific region, as the Biden administration seeks to coordinate approaches to China. The Quad foreign ministers – including the new US secretary of state, Antony Blinken – will talk about ways to align their approaches to those strategic challenges. But the US state department’s spokesperson, Ned Price, has also made clear that the administration wants to use the Quad grouping to rise to “the defining challenges of our time, including coordinating our efforts on Covid-19 response as well as climate change”. Guardian Australia understands climate change is on the agenda for tonight’s call, with each foreign minister likely to explain their country’s approaches and perspectives on the issue. One question will be whether it is an issue countries can continue to work on together through the Quad format, or whether there were other forums in which to pursue it. The discussion point comes as the Biden administration tries to encourage all countries to raise their level of climate ambition in the lead-up to the Glasgow climate summit at the end of the year. The US and Japan have both pledged to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and Joe Biden has pledged to host his own climate summit in April. The Quad meeting is also expected to discuss regional economic recovery, health security, maritime security, the digital economy and countering disinformation. The call may also lay groundwork for a first-ever meeting of the Quad leaders, potentially this year, although the date is not locked in and Covid-19 presents an obvious challenge to an in-person gathering. Western Australia’s premier, Mark McGowan, has likened Facebook to the North Korean regime after the tech giant blocked the page of the WA opposition leader, Zak Kirkup, as part of its ban on news in Australia. While McGowan is still able to post to his page, the banning of Kirkup’s page has been criticised by both sides of politics, ahead of the state election on 13 March. McGowan, urging Facebook to restore Kirkup’s page, said: They’ve obviously spat the dummy. They’re behaving more like North Korea than an American company and I’d urge the American government to assist us here. Meanwhile, Kirkup has said the move was “very disappointing”. To have the leader of the opposition’s page switched off arbitrarily in the middle of an election campaign was very disappointing. It shows the vulnerability and fragility of our democracy, particularly when we rely on these massive social media giants who aren’t really accountable to anyone. Liberal MPs are avoiding commenting on reports the Morrison government is backgrounding journalists against Brittany Higgins, the former Liberal staffer who alleges she was raped by a more senior colleague on a couch in Parliament House in 2019. Earlier today, Higgins told Guardian Australia she was unaware of the backgrounding – allegedly that the prime minister’s office was deliberately backgrounding journalists to smear Higgins’ now partner suggesting he held a gripe against the government – but if it was happening, that it “silences people and I think it’s gross”. The tourism and trade minister, Dan Tehan, when repeatedly asked by the ABC’s Patricia Karvelas about the alleged backgrounding, said “this is a police matter” and “that’s where it should end”. The Liberal MP Russell Broadbent, who was also asked about the prime minister’s office allegedly backgrounding journalists, said “backgrounding is never appropriate and I don’t enter into it”. Scott Morrison has labelled Facebook’s decision to ban news in Australia as “actions to unfriend Australia” that “were as arrogant as they were disappointing”, noting the social media giant had also cut off essential health and emergency services information pages. Morrison said in a Facebook post: These actions will only confirm the concerns that an increasing number of countries are expressing about the behaviour of BigTech companies who think they are bigger than governments and that the rules should not apply to them. They may be changing the world, but that doesn’t mean they run it. We will not be intimidated by BigTech seeking to pressure our Parliament as it votes on our important News Media Bargaining Code. I encourage Facebook to constructively work with the Australian Government, as Google recently demonstrated in good faith. The tourism and trade minister, Dan Tehan, is “still very hopeful” that a two-way travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand can be established by the end of March or April. Tehan, speaking on ABC TV, also indicated travel bubbles may not have to rely on vaccination rates, but also low community transmission rates, and noted Vietnam and Japan as likely future bubbles. I don’t think it necessarily needs to be a certain percentage of the community that has to be vaccinated before that starts. So my hope is that we could get New Zealand up and running. I think it’s going to be incredibly important especially for our tourism sector that we can, and then we look to other countries like Vietnam, like Japan, and we’ll continue to monitor the vaccine rollout in those countries. Obviously how it’s going here, and whether we’ll still have that literally zero spread amongst the community, and therefore we can move to implement these bubbles. Tehan was also asked about ongoing support to the tourism sector when jobkeeper ends next month. While the sector has been calling for this for weeks now, Tehan said the government is still considering further support for the sector. Instead, he urged state governments to use lockdowns as a “last resort” and exhaust every other containment tactic before introducing the measure, because the associated border closures are “really killing confidence in people’s willingness or want to travel”. The tourism and trade minister, Dan Tehan, has described Facebook’s ban on news in Australia as a “pretty clumsy negotiating effort” that has “backfired on them”. Tehan, speaking to the ABC’s Patricia Karvelas, said: I’d say to Facebook, please, sit down in good faith and continue the discussions with the government and with the news providers here in Australia, and we can get an outcome that works for all parties. I think one of the things that has probably shocked many Australians is how they were dependent on Facebook for the news that they were receiving, and I think that that’s become very apparent to them overnight. I think potentially what we saw overnight was them (Facebook) trying to use a negotiating tactic which I think backfired on them, and so I think that’s how I would describe it, as a pretty clumsy negotiating effort that I think has not worked. Hopefully they’ve learned the lesson from that, and learned that constructive dialogue is the best way to proceed, and sitting down in good faith is the best way to achieve outcomes. Countries across the world are watching these discussions and are watching these negotiations. So I think it’s really important for Facebook that they behave in a manner that people will see that they’re acting with respect. The head of the Presbyterian church in Australia says its pastors will not be directed to obey the Victorian government’s new law banning gay conversion practices, calling the bill “a declaration of war on scripture”. In an interview with Guardian Australia on Thursday, the moderator general of the Presbyterian church in Australia, Rev Peter Barnes, called the bill – which passed Victoria’s parliament earlier this month – “authoritarian” and said the church would ignore it on the basis that church leaders “don’t get our instructions from parliament house”. “Civil authorities have a God-given right to govern, I’m not questioning that, but its authority is not open-ended,” he said. “If the government passes legislation I don’t think is wise, that’s one thing. You’re not going to please all people all the time. If I think they should lower taxes but they raise them, I still pay my taxes.” The bill, which passed the parliament in February, outlaws practices that seek to change or suppress a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Penalties for those found to have engaged in conversion practices resulting in serious injury face penalties of up to 10 years jail or up to $10,000 in fines.

If you see anything you think I should be aware of, you can get in touch with me via Twitter @EliasVisontay, via email at elias.visontay@theguardian.com, and Wickr at eliasvisontay. It has been quite the week, so I am going to take a slight early mark and hand you over to Elias Visontay to take you through the next couple of hours. Thank you to everyone who has followed along with me on Politics Live this week – it means a lot and we all truly appreciate it. I know I have said this all week, but I hope you are being gentle with yourselves. There has been a lot said this week, and not all of it sensitively, and that brings with it it’s own pellets. So, to all of you, take care of you. I’ll see you early Monday morning for the second sitting week of this session. These are some good points. We mentioned during question time that Nick Greiner, the former NSW Liberal premier and more recently federal president of the party, has been named as Australia’s next consul general in New York. It’s worth pointing out that Australia’s top diplomatic postings to the United States are increasingly being filled by Liberal party figures. The Australian ambassador to the US, Arthur Sinodinos, is a former NSW Liberal senator and senior federal minister. The former communications minister and Victorian Liberal senator, Mitch Fifield, was appointed as Australia’s ambassador to the United Nations, based in New York, in October 2019. Both Sinodinos and Fifield’s appointments opened up Senate casual vacancies that could be filled by the party. (They were replaced in the Senate by Jim Molan and Sarah Henderson, both of whom fell short in the 2019 election.) Meanwhile the consul general in Chicago, David Bushby, is a former Tasmanian Liberal senator. Here’s some more from how Mike Bowers saw the day: Mike Bowers was in the Senate for question time and saw Linda Reynolds after delivering her statement to the chamber. Both Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese pay tribute to Hannah Clarke and her children. Tomorrow is one year since their murder. Hannah used her last breaths to make sure police knew what happened. Her Brisbane community, like the rest of Australia, remember them. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister accept that he and his office have a human resources responsibility for all ministerial staff? Has the prime minister asked his principal private secretary whether he checked in on Brittany Higgins as Ms Higgins has clearly stated? Morrison: I have, Mr Speaker. I advised the House when my office knew about these matters in accordance with the advice I have received. Labor’s Anthony Chisholm asked Linda Reynolds - in her capacity representing the home affairs minister - whether Peter Dutton had disclosed his donation from the NRA before approving their grant. Reynolds, who cried after giving her personal explanation about Brittany Higgins, asked “on indulgence” to answer the question on Monday, then tried to take it on notice. Instead, Chisholm directed the question to Simon Birmingham, representing the prime minister. Birmingham defended Dutton’s conduct on the basis the grant was properly approved. He said: “I’m confident Mr Dutton will have met all disclosure requirements in relation to donations ... and the ministerial standards.” Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Yesterday, Brittany Higgins issued a statement which said, “A current senior staffer to the prime minister and Ms Higgins’s former chief-of-staff” - the same person “continually made me feel as if my ongoing employment would be jeopardised if I proceeded any further with the matter.” Has the prime minister raised Ms Higgins’s clear statement with his staff member? Morrison: There have been many conversations about this over the course of this week in relation to these issues and that is why I have asked the deputy secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to follow through on this process, to look at these matters and to provide me and the cabinet with advice on how we can ensure that in these horrendous situations that the best possible support can be provided, Mr Speaker, and that is what even in this situation was seeking to do in the best of faith. But, Mr Speaker, as we have stated ... Albanese: It can’t be a clearer question. The question just goes to whether the prime minister has asked his senior staff member about the declaration made by Ms Higgins about whether that is accurate, whether he’s raised it with the member of his on staff? Surely, we can get an answer to that. Ms Higgins deserves one. Morrison: Mr Speaker, perhaps the leader of the opposition didn’t understand me. What I am saying is I have had these conversations. I have these conversations with the member of staff. I said there has been many conversations. I am happy to indicate I have had conversations about the support provided by the member of my staff now. She was working as the chief of staff for the minister for defence industry at the time. I have discussed these matters with her and the support provided and she indeed has indicated to me some appreciation that was also provided to her at the time in the messages that were sent to her. Now, Mr Speaker, we all accept that Brittany no longer feels in any way that she felt supported particularly over the prolonged period of time, well beyond the initial incident where initially the advice was followed. I note that the Australian human rights exhibition says if an employer suspects that a criminal incident has occurred the individual should be advised to report the matter to the police and indeed that is what the minister did then and arranged for Brittany to have that meeting with the AFP and that occurred, Mr Speaker, on 1st April. That was followed up by a meeting between ministerial and the AFP assistant commissioner*. Everyone here tried to do the right thing. They took advice and followed the advice and they sought to provide that support and this is what the challenge here is for us. Even when that has been done, it hasn’t done the job because now Brittany clearly feels that way and that is not disputed. That is what we are seeking to apply our attention to ensure we learn from that and others are not in a position where they are faced with this again. That is simply what we are trying to do. That is simply what we are trying to do honestly and openly. *This is new information, I think Tanya Plibersek to Scott Morrison: Yesterday Brittany Higgins issued a statement in response to the prime minister’s remarks. In that statement Ms Higgins said: “The continued victim-blaming rhetoric by the prime minister is personally very distressing to many and to countless other survivors.” How does the prime minister respond to Ms Higgins’s statement from yesterday? Morrison: Mr Speaker, the last thing I would want to see is to add any further distress to what Brittany is already going through. I am doing everything to ensure that is the case and how we seek to handle these issues. I am very sorry she feels that way. She must be under tremendous stress during the course of this week. She as shown courage and bravery in speaking up. I have been listening to what she’s been saying and I am seeking to put in place arrangements, whether it is the support of staff who are here in this building here and now and will be feeling, I think, increasingly fragile or vulnerable because of the nature of these events that have arisen this week, and the best way to address the comments is to ensure that I am doing everything in my power to try and make that safer place. The minister representing women, Sussan Ley, has not been asked a dixer about what is being done to make women staff more comfortable in the parliament, or to detail those counselling plans, or the review or anything else that government dixers usually cover when it wants attention for certain programs or actions. But she is, of course, asked about the “shameful” actions of Facebook. Dolly give me strength. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Yesterday Peta Credlin says there is no way that a prime minister or his office wouldn’t know about an alleged sexual assault in a minister’s office. Ms Credlin says the claim that the prime minister and his office weren’t told doesn’t stack up and doesn’t smell right to me. Does the prime minister stand by his story? Morrison: Mr Speaker, I have answered these questions honestly and openly in this place and the statements that I have made to this House about all of these issues are as exactly as they are to my knowledge. I continue to stand by those statements and will because, as I said in this place, the advice that we had in dealing with this matter when it was a matter for the now minister for defence, but then minister for defence industry, the minister at the time arranged for Brittany to meet with the police. She respected her wishes, as they were expressed to her and at all times sought to provide support in the best way that we possibly could. As I said earlier this week, clearly over the passage of time Brittany has felt that that support was not sufficient. Mr Speaker, that is what we have to address. We have to learn from this. That is why the inquiry and process that has been set up across parties, all across this place, will be there to try and ensure that these supports pick up all of the lessons of this and other issues. But I would say this to members of this House, and in the other place - if there is any suggestion here that this is not an issue or if there is any suggestion that this issue is confined to any one party in this place. If there is a suggestion of that ... I think that is a false suggestion. I think we all understand that. We are working to put a process in place, the leader of the opposition and other leaders and the crossbenchers, to ensure that we can make sure as best as we are all able that this would not happen again. That is our goal. We share that goal. That is my goal and I believe that is what Brittany would like us to achieve as well. I am committed to that as well. Nick Greiner, the former NSW Liberal premier and more recently federal president of the party, has been named as Australia’s next consul general in New York. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, announced the political appointment in a statement a short time ago: “Mr Greiner has extensive and diverse experience, most recently serving as the federal president of the Liberal party of Australia. He has previously held senior roles in the private and public sectors, including as chairman of a number of leading Australian companies and as the premier of New South Wales and leader of the opposition for the New South Wales state government.” Greiner replaces the former consul general, Alastair Walton, who was posted to New York in 2017. There has not been a single dixer related to Brittany Higgins this week - nothing on the safety of staff, the review, things which are being put in place, or this should not have happened. No dixers. All the statements have come in response to questions from Labor MPs. But we have had about a million about Facebook blocking content. That apparently, is “reprehensible”, Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister, and I refer to the prime minister’s answers yesterday. In relation to the reported sexual assault, does the prime minister still maintain that his office didn’t know, even though in the same offices he said a member of his office did? Morrison: Mr Speaker, I do stand by the statements that I have made in this House all week and, Mr Speaker, as the leader of the opposition knows, the member of staff that he is referring to was formally the chief of staff to the minister for defence industry. That knowledge related to her time in that role. Not in her role in my office. He would be aware of that, Mr Speaker. Seeking to conflate those things, Mr Speaker, and to suggest that involves a knowledge of my office, then that would be misplaced and that would be inaccurate. I was asked about the knowledge of my office, the Prime Minister’s Office, being informed by other officers about these events and I have answered honestly about this. The last thing I have sought to do ... is to cause stress in this area and it is very important that we continue and I will continue, Mr Speaker, to address these issues as honestly and openly as possible. That is what I am doing. That is what the minister for defence is doing. That is what the minister for employment and skills is doing. Mr Speaker, we will continue to do that. Everyone should feel safe in their workplace and be safe in their workplace, Mr Speaker. I want to advise the House today that to ensure staff are supported at this time - and it has been a traumatic, I believe, time for staff over the course of this week as these events have become known to us all - that to the Department of Finance through the employment assistance program is increasing support to staff but also to members and senators as well and from Monday, 22nd February there councillors will be on site at Parliament House between 8:30 and 5:00pm. Councillors will also be available for telephone-based calls by the usual employment assistant hotline. We are keen to ensure as much support is put in place for the members and senators in this place and their staff. If there are any staff out there who need to reach out for that counselling and support at this time because of the traumatic events of this week, I would encourage them to do so or indeed if there are any members or senators wish to do that, that support and service is available to them. Scott Morrison turns a question on the NBN bonuses being awarded while jobkeeper is not being extended for industries like the arts, into an attack on Anthony Albanese. Tony Burke objects and Morrison replies: I seem to have deeply offended the sensitivities of the leader of the opposition. Over in the Senate, the Labor senator Jenny McAllister has asked Simon Birmingham about the allegations aired by Network Ten editor Peter van Onselen this morning about Scott Morrison’s office allegedly backgrounding against Brittany Higgins and her loved ones. Following these allegations, Higgins told me this morning that if this was happening, it was “gross” and part of a culture of silencing in Parliament House. The Guardian has not been privy to any negative briefing about Higgins or her associates. In response to McAllister’s questions, Birmingham says the intention of the government is to support Higgins after her “very distressing claims” and support remains the government’s intention. In terms of the alleged briefing: “I have no awareness of any such activity being undertaken”. McAllister wants to know if the prime minister will investigate, and whether there will be consequences if anything untoward is uncovered. Birmingham says: “I will take those matters up with the prime minister. I am certain he has no tolerance for such activities”. Birmingham says the government wants nothing more than for Higgins to make the decisions she chooses to make and the government will provide absolutely full cooperation with any investigations. It moves on to a dixer on the media bargaining code. But despite being almost two minutes after referencing Christine Holgate, something has floated through to Bob Katter’s frontal cortex and he leaps to his feet: Mr Speaker, if a person knows that a minister is lying, is it my duty to stand up and say he is lying. Christine Holgate never resigned. Don’t tell lies to the House. (Holgate did resign) He’s told he can’t use unparliamentary language. I withdraw the word “lie” and I said he told an untruth. The House moves on. Paul Fletcher: As was made clear in the way the government handled the Australia Post matter, there were significant concerns. It was referred to an investigation by the secretaries of the two departments, my department and the Department of Finance, supported by advice from an external law firm and that advice did indeed find there were significant concerns about compliance with the requirements of the public government’s performance and accountability act. What is also the case is that the former chief executive of Australia Post chose to resign. We acknowledge ... we acknowledge her performance during her time in that role but those are the facts. In terms of the NBN, I simply make this point: A large portion of the number quoted in the media today goes to a very large number of staff across NBN, under the terms of their employment there is base pay and there is at risk pay, arrangements which have been in place since Labor set up NBN as a government business enterprise, I remind the House. The proposition seems to be that, in some way, when the conditions for at-risk pay to be paid have been met, that in some way, the terms of employment should be retrospectively varied by the employer. You can imagine what Labor would say about that if any large corporate did that in Australia. I do make the point that the minister for finance has written to the chief executive of NBN, as he has to other government business enterprises, drawing his attention to a review of performance bonus arrangements for senior executives and equivalent employees, that was done before Christmas and NBN is fully aware of that. I mean, the only other time I have seen Scott Morrison as aggravated as he was over Christine Holgate was when needles were found in strawberries, but you know. Michelle Rowland to Scott Morrison: Given Christine Holgate lost her job over $20,000 worth of Cartier watches given as bonuses to executives, what are the consequences for NBN Co paying $78 million in taxpayer funded bonuses at the depths of the recession? Morrison gives it to Fletcher, who presumably will not have to check with the North Shore Mums on this one - if he does though, he can have a bit more time - Tony Burke is not happy Morrison has passed it on. Burke: It goes to the circumstances where the prime minister can refer to a minister. The purpose of that within the standing orders are within practice, it is whether the minister is in a unique position to provide further information. This question goes exactly to the treatment that the prime minister gave to Christine Holgate and contrasts it with what NBN Co have done and there is no additional information on that that can be invited from the relevant minister. Christian Porter: The question contains its own assertions as to figures and usually when Labor asks those sorts of questions, those assertions are wrong. That sort of ability is only going to be inside the knowledge of the minister. Tony Smith: I will just say to the manager of opposition business this is an area of practice, not standing orders, and under the practice - I mean, it’s a problematic area, I will certainly say it’s a problematic area and it may well be that that is the intent of the practice, that where a prime minister can, as often happens, answer part of the question, refer the rest to the relevant minister, or refer the entire answer to the minister. The manager of opposition business has made his point and that is one part of practice, sort of historically, so that if a minister had the detail that the prime minister didn’t, the House could be provided with the system of questions without notice directly rather than it automatically being taken on notice. I understand the point that the manager’s making. The other part of practice is it’s unqualified and that is the prime minister can choose to refer any question to any relevant minister and it is unqualified. I appreciate the point the manager’s making but nonetheless, that doesn’t prevent the prime minister from referring the question. Fletcher takes it - (paraphrasing) it’s Labor’s fault. Josh Frydenberg’s LinkedIn chip continues to malfunction, with the treasurer physically incapable of taking a dixer without referring to the backbencher’s resume. It’s sad and my heart goes out to him. He does manage to get in his Facebook lines though, without referring to how it was originally set up as a way of rating the hotness of women in college: What we saw today from Facebook – Facebook’s actions today – were unnecessary. They were heavy-handed. They were wrong. It was provocative and overreach. It will damage Facebook’s reputation here in Australia. There was no reason to block access to government sites, sites providing credible information about the pandemic, about emergency services, about mental health. It was unnecessary to do that. We say to Facebook that we will continue to work with them, hopefully to find a pathway forward but what their actions today have done is remind Australians about the importance of this code and it’s reaffirmed and strengthened the government’s resolve to implement it. Josh Frydenberg bats away Zali Steggall’s question on better paid parental leave with a non-answer. Former prime minister Kevin Rudd is in the gallery. [Continued from previous post] Linda Reynolds: I became aware incrementally over a period of days of Brittany’s story during private conversations with her and my then chief of staff and via reports from parliamentary authorities. On Tuesday March 26, my then chief of staff called Brittany and a male co-worker into separate meetings concerning what at that point appeared to be a security breach involving unauthorised access to my office. The following day the secretary of the Department of Parliamentary Services provided a report concerning the security breach. On Monday April 1, I met with Brittany and my then former chief of staff. During this meeting I made it clear to Brittany that she would have my full support in whatever course of action she decided to take and that she would have full access to counselling services. My chief of staff and I moved quickly that Brittany would have access to the police should she wish to make a complaint. In terms of the actions by my then chief of staff and by me in the days and weeks that followed Brittany’s alleged assault, we at all times followed the advice of the ministerial of parliamentary services and the Department of Finance, as was appropriate. I have full confidence that my then chief of staff and I at all times acted in what we believed were in the best interests of Brittany. Mr President, throughout this entire time, my sole desire has been to let Brittany herself determine how this matter would be dealt with. I fully appreciate, I fully appreciate that it is the proper duty of the Senate, of all of us in this chamber, to ask hard questions about how this incident was dealt with. But at the time this was a difficult, it was a complex and it was a highly sensitive matter. At all times to me Brittany’s welfare and her right to privacy were paramount to me. For my part, I’m deeply sorry that Brittany felt unsupported at the time of the incident and in the months that followed. And, in fact, the years that followed. I’m also deeply sorry that some of my actions and my handling of this matter added to Brittany’s distress. The prime minister has announced an independent review into the culture of Parliament House and the processes in place to deal with serious incidents such as these. It is a move I welcome. It is a move I think we can all agree that is long overdue. Mr president, it is now incumbent of all of us in this place to let the independent processes, now in train, consider these matters. Here is Linda Reynolds’ whole statement to the Senate: I refer to the serious matters relating to my former staff member Ms Brittany Higgins, who was employed in my ministerial office and I was the minister for Defence Industry. I take this opportunity to provide the Senate with a further statement. On Monday evening, we heard in Brittany’s own words the harrowing account of her alleged sexual assault in my ministerial office in 2019. Brittany’s story has occasioned a wider reckoning of how women are treated in this building. It has prompted a national conversation about how we ensure women are safe in their workplace, wherever that is, and how we support them when they need our care. As a woman who has spent much of her working life in politics, much of it in this very building, I welcome that conversation. And I welcome the reviews announced by the prime minister. My hope now is that we can address this very serious issue as a parliament, away from the politics. Mr President, I’ve been asked a series of questions surrounding the circumstances of Ms Higgins’s alleged sexual assault and the actions that were taken by myself and my then chief of staff as a consequence. I will do my best to answer them. [continued in next post] Michelle Rowland to Paul Fletcher: Given Australia is ranked 61st in the world for fixed line broadband, the cost of the NBN has broken out from $29-57 billion, up to 238,000 premises can’t access minimum NBN speeds, as required by law, how on earth were NBNCo executives management and staff given $78 million in taxpayer funded bonuses and how much would they have been paid if the NBN wasn’t behind schedule? Fletcher (and I am paraphrasing here): It’s Labor’s fault. Back in the House, and the alleged leader of the “party of positive contributions”, who can’t stop backbenchers from continually pushing against government policy, takes a dixer, prompting Ed Husic to yell something out (and get shut down by the Speaker). “He’s a repeat offender, says the alleged Nationals leader. “So are you,” Speaker Tony Smith says. “Just get on with the answer.” The defence minister, Linda Reynolds, has given a personal explanation to the Senate, that she “became aware incrementally over a period of days” from her then chief of staff and parliamentary authorities about the alleged rape in her office. The timeline she gave was: On Tuesday 26 March, 2019 her chief of staff spoke to Brittany Higgins and the coworker about what was then thought to be a security breach 27 March, 2019 the secretary of the DPS provided a report about the security breach 1 April, Reynolds met Brittany with her then chief of staff, and offered Brittany her “full support” including to have access to the police if she wished to make a complaint. Reynolds said: “We at all times followed advice of the department of parliamentary services and finance. At all times we acted in what we believed were the best interests of Brittany. My sole desire has been to let Brittany herself determine how it would be dealt with ... At the time, it was a difficult, complex and highly sensitive matter. At all times, Brittany’s welfare and right to privacy were paramount. “I am deeply sorry that she felt unsupported at the time of incident and years that followed. I’m sorry that some of my actions and handling of this matter added to Brittany’s distress.” Linda Reynolds is providing a statement to the Senate. I’ll have that for you soon. We are on the downhill slide to question time. It’s the last one for the week. It’s been that sort of decade And of course, we get to Facebook To recap what we have learned: The vaccine will begin being distributed from Monday across 240 towns and 190 hubs will be set up. Communities across all jurisdictions, including major hospitals, will begin getting the vaccine from next week. As reported, health and border workers on the frontline are the first to get the jab. Will vaccinations be mandatory for aged care workers, and why aren’t residents receiving it at the same time? Profesor Brendan Murphy: So, in terms of mandatory vaccination, that is something that AHPPC is considering on a regular basis. And we are waiting until we have data on the transmissibility of the virus in vaccinated people. If it is very effective, as we expect, at preventing transmission, once we have an opportunity for all of the workers to be vaccinated, that is something that will be reconsidered. That’s something that National Cabinet has asked to reconsider on a regular basis. At the moment, the plan is for aged care residents to get the Pfizer vaccine. We have enough Pfizer vaccine to roll that out to the maximum of our workforce over the next month or so. So, it’s a fairly short period of time. It will be getting that first dose out over the next three or four weeks. The staff will mostly get the AstraZeneca vaccine. That will be a separate workforce that will go in to facilities at different times. The evidence from overseas is vaccinating the staff and residents at the same time is not actually a very effective way to do it. The staff vaccination programs have a different logistic need and will have a different workforce to do that. So, we will have enough of the Pfizer vaccine to cover all of the aged care residents pretty quickly. And the AstraZeneca vaccine is coming online, we think, in early March and we’ll be able to get the staff vaccinated pretty quickly first. There will be about 200 towns included in the first stage of the rollout. Professor Brendan Murphy: There will be approximately 240 aged care facilities, if not more, that are vaccinated in Week 1. And we’re of the expectation that that will be at least 190 towns, and we’ll also have 16 Pfizer hubs. And those towns cover all of Australia, commencing in Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, or Farrer, or Tiwi in the Northern Territory. Here in the ACT, towns such as Weston and Narrabunda. We know that in Tasmania it could be in Burnie or in Somerset or in Wynyard. All of these are on the list, amongst others. We then go to New South Wales and across New South Wales, in the city areas such as Blacktown or Penrith, across the state, areas such as Gosford West and Orange will see facilities inoculated. If we turn to Queensland, we’ll have areas such as Aspley, Bundaberg, Cleveland, Mackay, and many others. And then, if we move to Victoria, Altona Meadows, Ballarat, Bendigo, Cranbourne, Dandenong, and a variety of others. And then in South Australia, what we’ll see is Encounter Bay, Heathfield, Mount Barker. Western Australia, areas such as Bunbury, or Emu Point, near Albany, Kingsly, Mirrabooka, and Rockingham, amongst many others. The point of that is that right across Australia, every state and territory, rural and regional and urban areas will be covered. It has to start somewhere and it has to finish somewhere, but this is the beginning of the process. We then, of course, have the Pfizer vaccination hubs, which include the Royal Prince Alfred hospital in New South Wales, the Monash Medical Centre in Victoria, the Gold Coast University hospital in Queensland. The Royal Adelaide hospital in South Australia. Perth Children’s hospital in Western Australia. The Royal Hobart hospital in Tasmania, the Canberra hospital here in the ACT, and the Royal Darwin. State and territory authorities will let you know if you are in the first phase of vaccinations. Once you receive your vaccination, it will be included in the Australian Immunisation Register. Professor Brendan Murphy is outlining the first round of vaccination strategy. It goes to frontline healthcare and border and quarantine workers. That includes those working in residential aged care and disability care, the clinical staff in emergency departments and ICUs, lab staff doing the Covid tests, paramedics and special GP respiratory clinics where testing is taking place. Looks like BOM and some of the government health pages are back up and running on FB. Save the Children Australia CEO Paul Ronalds has joined the list of actual organisations who use FB for good, talking about the platform’s content block’s impact: It’s really disappointing to be cut off from our 160,000 supporters who follow the Save the Children Australia Facebook page. Save the Children has come to rely on the platform to communicate with our supporters and members of the wider Australian community. We also use Facebook as an important fundraising tool to reach generous supporters who want to support the world’s most vulnerable children. Every minute that our page is down is another minute our message isn’t getting out about the needs of children. But guys, will someone please think of the North Shore Mums. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says tonight’s call among the foreign ministers of Australia, the US, Japan and India “will allow our nations to advance our shared interest in a secure and prosperous region”. Dfat has issued a statement confirming that Marise Payne would join the dialogue with the “Quad” foreign ministers – the first since the Biden administration took office – as mentioned here on the blog earlier today. “The Quad’s positive agenda will enable us to progress cooperation among four Indo-Pacific democracies across a range of areas, including to support the region recover from the economic and health impacts of Covid-19.” While stressing the importance of the Quad, the Dfat statement also sought to emphasise Australia’s links with south-east Asian nations: “The Quad is a key pillar of Australia’s international agenda and complements our other bilateral, regional and multilateral engagement, including with ASEAN. Quad partners are strong supporters of ASEAN centrality within a region in which all countries are sovereign, independent and resilient.” Brittany Higgins has spoken to Katharine Murphy after the Network Ten political editor, Peter van Onselen, alleged the prime minister’s office was deliberately backgrounding journalists to smear Higgins’ now partner on ABC RN radio this morning. From the story: The former Liberal staffer told Guardian Australia on Thursday she understood that telling her story would have consequences. ‘I knew personally that when I decided to put my name and face to this there would be repercussions for me,’ Higgins said. ‘But I think it’s unfair if they are starting to try and take this out on loved ones. ‘I think it speaks to the systematic problems of this place. ‘It silences people and I think it’s gross.’ Back to actual news now. Has Josh Frydenberg considered getting the woman who runs the North Shore Mums Facebook page on the phone to Zuckerberg? Because she’s apparently quite influential. What happened between Sunday and this morning? The bill went through the House, says Josh Frydenberg: Well, they saw the passage through the House of Representatives of the legislation yesterday. It hasn’t gone through the Senate. They saw the passage of the legislation through the House of Representatives. And they interpreted some of the provisions in a specific way. Now, they’ve clearly made public their concerns about the code as it stands. We will work through some of their issues, as we did over the weekend with the prime minister with Google. And we were able to provide some clarifications and some technical amendments which we moved through the parliament this morning with bipartisan support. So, let’s see where it goes. But Facebook is in no doubt that we’re committed to the code, but also we would like to see them here in Australia. But I think their actions today were unnecessary and wrong. Around half of First Nations Media Australia (FNMA) member organisations have had their Facebook pages blocked today. “We are outraged that access to First Nations voices has been limited in this way,” said Dot West, First Nations Media Australia chair. “Never has our media been more vital than during a global pandemic – especially on the cusp of vaccination rollouts. “First Nations media services are not the same as commercial outlets and should not be negatively impacted by an industry-wide response to corporate interests,” West said. First Nations Media Australia is the peak body for Indigenous community broadcasting, media and communications, representing hundreds of radio, TV and online outlets across the nation, which provide essential information – including language services – to cities, towns and remote communities. West said Facebook’s restrictions today were “hit and miss” and had affected health organisations, community media, First Nations media and other service providers in “inconsistent and problematic ways”. “We stand with our sister sectors across community media in asserting that addressing the financial interests of commercial enterprises should not come at the expense of independent publishers of information vital to community safety and democracy in this country,” West said. “The silencing of sovereign voices in this way is unacceptable and inconsistent with Facebook’s messaging in celebration of Black History Month and the platform’s mission to empower people to build community.” FNMA wants the government to seek an immediate resolution to its conflict with Facebook and to protect the First Nations media industry from further negative impacts. Josh Frydenberg was not given any notice from Facebook that this was happening. Despite having had chats with Mark Zuckerberg on Sunday. Well, we certainly weren’t given any notice by Facebook. You’re right, I spoke to him over the weekend, but I also spoke to him this morning. We had a pretty lengthy conversation, around half an hour, and it was constructive. I think there’s some differing interpretations as to how the code would work. And we talked through some of those elements. And we’re happy to help clarify some of those issues with Facebook. Because as Paul said, we want commercial agreements under the code, we want to implement and legislate the code, and we want the major players to stay here in Australia and to keep providing the services to Australians that Australians so enjoy. So, we are going to work through those issues with Facebook. If you were Josh Frydenberg, you would have to start taking this personally at this stage. While Josh Frydenberg spoke to Mark Zuckerberg for half an hour today, the communications minister was having an equally important conversation. Paul Fletcher: I have spoken this morning to the operator of North Shore Mums, which is a well-known Facebook page in my own electorate. Like a number of similar services around Australia, her page, her Facebook page, has been blocked, and that is of significant concern. So, we are very clear that we think this is the wrong action by Facebook. And, of course, we’re very clear on the proposition that we’re going to legislate the code. We have been talking to stakeholders all the way through, including Google and Facebook, and we’ll continue to do that. But that principle is very clear. I mean, government, charities, advocacy groups, health, emergency services and groups for domestic violence all lost their pages – but that’s nothing in comparison to what the North Shore Mums must be going through. Google is great though, says Josh Frydenberg: And we want to thank Google for the very constructive discussions that they have been having with stakeholders, and we recognise the announcement earlier today between Google and News Limited about their successful negotiations. It follows on from the announcement by Channel Seven and Google, and the reports of the successful negotiations between Channel Nine and Google. This digital code, this new media bargaining code, is very important microeconomic reform. It’s one that was initiated by the prime minister when he was then treasurer, and Paul [Fletcher] and I have been working closely on for some time, and I also want to note the hard work of Rod Sims and the ACCC in getting to the point now where we have these successful negotiations between Google and Australian news media businesses paying for content, but obviously we have the developments today with Facebook. I mean – the government can’t even control the Nationals, so these Facebook chats should go GREAT. Josh Frydenberg is pretending to hold a press conference about the unemployment numbers, but it’s really to talk Facebook: In respect to Facebook’s actions today, Facebook was wrong. Facebook’s actions were unnecessary, they were heavy-handed, and they will damage its reputation here in Australia. Their decision to block Australians’ access to government sites – be they about support through the pandemic, mental health, emergency services, the Bureau of Meteorology – were completely unrelated to the media code which is yet to pass through the Senate. But what today’s events do confirm for all Australians is the immense market power of these media digital giants. These digital giants loom very, very large in our economy and on the digital landscape. The Morrison government remains absolutely committed to legislating and implementing the code. Yes, there is also this. Here is Barnaby Joyce saying that if you give the Nationals more positions in cabinet, they will be less likely “to go off the reservation”. I mean, Joyce has made a career out of saying the quiet things out loud, but still. Here we are. The report into Victoria’s mental health system will be handed down next month. As AAP reports: The findings of a royal commission into Victoria’s “broken” mental health system are expected to be handed down on March 2. The report was due to be made public on February 4, but was delayed over a COVID-19 case in hotel quarantine and the imposition of tighter restrictions. Premier Daniel Andrews on Thursday announced the report would be tabled next month ahead of a joint “historic” sitting of parliament. Commission chair Penny Armytage, leading psychiatrist Patrick McGorry and a community member with experience of mental illness are expected to address the parliament upon the report’s release. The commission in November 2019 released an interim report describing the current system as “broken” and making nine recommendations, among them a substantial increase in funding. An estimated 105,000 Victorians with severe mental illness were not receiving specialist care and the cost of poor mental health to the state was about $14.2 billion a year, the interim report said. Mr Andrews commissioned the Australian-first inquiry following the 2018 state election. “The thousands of Victorians who have so bravely and so generously shared their personal stories deserve our full, undivided attention - and they deserve our help,” he said on Thursday. Foodbank has also been caught up in the ban News Corp Australasia executive chairman Michael Miller says the deal with Google has breathed “new confidence” into the local news industry in Australia and gives the business model of journalism a much-needed boost. “The future of commercial news organisations rests on their ability to establish workable business models in the digital era,” he said. “We will continue to invest in journalism and the skills needed to tell stories in new and evolving ways across our communities, and for a digital future.” Miller said Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and chief executive Robert Thomson’s long campaign to make tech accountable had paid off. “Thanks to [Thomson’s] leadership over the many years since the entire industry can now return to a sustainable model.” The WA department of fire and emergency services has responded to the Facebook ban: The Department of Fire and Emergency Services’ Facebook page has been impacted by this morning’s Facebook changes restricting news pages. We have been in contact with Facebook and they have assured us they will restore the page as a priority. In the meantime, information about incidents can still be accessed through Emergency WA (www.emergency.wa.gov.au) and 13 33 37 (13 DFES).” Fresh from destroying the family court, One Nation has a new target in sight: Facebook says the government’s definition of news content in the media bargaining code is to blame for the blanket ban on so many Facebook pages today. However, they are reversing any pages “that are inadvertently impacted”. Government pages should not be impacted by today’s announcement. The actions we’re taking are focused on restricting publishers and people in Australia from sharing or viewing Australian and international news content. As the law does not provide clear guidance on the definition of news content, we have taken a broad definition in order to respect the law as drafted. Facebook has only referred to government pages however, and it is not clear whether they will reverse all the other community and health pages too. Paul Karp has got a statement from the deputy prime minister on the CFEC amendments his members are making - without taking through the party room. It is important that consideration is given to the amendments that have been put forward. We have always said a diverse energy mix is needed to ensure the lowest possible power prices for Australian families and businesses. The Government is proudly supporting coal projects in Australia and has invested in a feasibility study into a HELE coal project in Queensland. This is in stark contrast to Labor which has walked away from the resources industry and the thousands of jobs the industry supports.” I know there is a lot going on today, but I just need to take you back to the what the ‘party of positive contributions’ is focussing on. Large sections of the country are still in drought. Fishers, particularly cray fishers, are in mass distress after the China tariffs. Farmers don’t have their usual labour supply to pick their crops. People in areas ravaged by bushfires are still living in temporary sheds and having to make hour return trips to take a shower. Climate change is happening and among the industries already suffering, is agriculture. There is a pandemic, which has caused Australia to shut its borders to the world and is causing lockdowns, separating regional communities. And the Nationals, have decided its “positive contribution” is to demand coal and nuclear be included in a clean energy finance fund. This is the same party which receives about 13% of the national vote (including the LNP votes) - just above the Greens - and yet gets to dictate policy in this country every time one of them has a tantrum. And their ‘leader’ just lets them do it. Another key point from that release: The youth unemployment rate remained at 13.9% (and increased by 1.8 pts over the year to January 2021) That’s seasonally adjusted for January 2021, the ABS reports Unemployment rate decreased to 6.4%. Participation rate decreased to 66.1%. Employment increased to 12,939,900. Employment to population ratio increased to 61.9%. Underemployment rate decreased to 8.1%. Monthly hours worked decreased by 86 million hours. Seems like some of the Nationals’ “positive contributors” are using the party website as a personal vision board. If you can see it, you can be it. The foreign ministers of Australia, Japan and India will speak tonight with the new US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in the first high-level call of Quad members since the Biden administration took office. Announcing the planned phone hookup, the US state department said it reflected the importance the new administration placed on alliances and partnerships. “This administration has made clear that the United States values our alliances and will work with our partners and friends around the world to pursue common interests across the globe,” the state department’s spokesperson, Ned Price, said at a press briefing overnight. “This discussion with the Quad foreign ministers is critical to advancing our shared goals of a free and open Indo-Pacific and rising to the defining challenges of our time, including coordinating our efforts on Covid-19 response as well as climate change.” The move comes amid efforts by Australia to navigate tensions with China, which views the Quad grouping warily. Beijing has previously described it as “an anti-China frontline” or “mini-Nato” which reflected America’s “cold war mentality”. While China has not ratcheted up trade actions against Australia since the flurry of steps taken last year, there appears to be a stalemate in Canberra’s push for high-level dialogue. Joe Biden has vowed to closely coordinate with allies in the region, including via the Quad. While the US president has signalled plans for a continued tough line against Beijing, he has also indicated there is room for cooperation with China on issues like climate change, health and weapons control. The Quad foreign ministers last met in person in Tokyo in October last year, when Mike Pompeo was the US secretary of state. There is increasing speculation that the Quad will be upgraded with a first-ever meeting of the leaders from the four countries. The Public Interest Journalism chair Professor Allan Fels (a former chair of the ACCC) has some thoughts on the Facebook content block: The Government has been aware of the possibility of a FB withdrawal or prevention of the sharing of news content, so this would not come as a complete surprise. It is not unusual for market participants to threaten withdrawal or restriction of services in the face of market regulation. However, we urge Facebook to be cautious. It is unconscionable for Facebook to limit access to Australian Government information, be it weather, health or bushfire information. This is not ‘news’, nor content envisaged under the Mandatory News Media Bargaining Code. The mandatory News Media Bargaining Code seeks to address a significant market power imbalance. That is the role of the ACCC and government, to ensure a level playing field. Currently, more than 80% of online advertising is directed to digital platforms, which have previously demonstrated a lack of willingness to negotiate with news organisations around the value of their content in the generation of this revenue. The costs of producing public interest journalism are high, but it is integral to the functioning of any working democracy. News media has supported the code, with its underlying principle to safeguard public interest journalism and level the playing field in this space. We also note that in we are living in an era of misinformation and disinformation, or should I say, ‘fake news’. We urge FB to sit at the table and negotiate in good faith, as Google appears to be doing. Also we note that the Australian Government has asked the digital industry to develop a code of practice on how they address disinformation. The Digital Industry Group Inc (DIGI) will be releasing that new code within weeks. FB’s announcement seems to run counter to community sentiment for tech giants to act in good faith and demonstrate their social license to operate.” South Australia has also opened its border to regional Victoria, which is wonderful news. I just love “positive contributions” that are announced in the media, not the party room, and totally contradict government policy. The Nationals Senate team, led by Bridget McKenzie and Matt Canavan, have this morning announced amendments to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation bill to allow it to invest in nuclear power and carbon capture and storage. It follows the Barnaby Joyce amendment to allow it to invest in coal-fired power. At a press conference in Canberra, McKenzie said the Senate team want to be “positive contributors” by putting forward the ideas, but deflected questions that noted the amendments didn’t go through the Nationals party room. McKenzie did say that deputy prime minister Michael McCormack was “well aware” they would present the amendments, and confirmed they’d also had discussions with energy minister, Angus Taylor. Asked if the amendments were official Nationals policy, McKenzie pointed to federal and state conference motions in favour of nuclear power and local branch support. She said “the Nationals party room are generally – I’m sure if you rung them all [you’d find] they’re very very keen to make a positive, progressive contribution to the energy and emissions debate”. Which is odd, because yesterday we asked the resources minister, Keith Pitt, what he thought of the Joyce amendment and he had no comment. We’ll try Pitt and McCormack again today, but it looks at the very least like the Nationals backbench are massively frontrunning the debate or openly defying the leadership, who are bound by cabinet solidarity to go for the (unamended) bill. NSW has reached 32 days of no locally transmitted Covid: It’s a double donut day in NSW. NSW recorded no new locally acquired and no overseas-acquired cases of COVID-19 in the 24 hours to 8pm last night, meaning the total number of cases in NSW since the beginning of the pandemic remains at 4,954. There were 20,906 tests reported to 8pm last night, compared with the previous day’s total of 23,463. It’s amazing that the same people who have been in charge of this country since 2013 are the same ones who keep offering the same tired options for energy reliability, despite their old-school solutions continuing to increase in price while taking decades – at least – to build, even if price wasn’t an issue, while ignoring cheap, plentiful power options which are literally staring them in the face right now. Like literally the face. The sun shines on them. The wind ruffles what is left of their hair. I assume some have even looked at the ocean in real life. But no. It must be COAL AND NUCLEAR at all costs. It’s like insisting on dragging around a Commodore 64 because you really like tetris instead of just downloading the app. *insert Will Smith look at this meme here* Victoria has recorded its second consecutive day of zero coronavirus cases, as the state emerges from its snap lockdown. There were 30,000 tests recorded yesterday, with Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley welcoming the high number of tests. “Another day of over 30,000 is fantastic and it shows the level of commitment that Victorians have displayed when we have asked them to come forward.” Foley also said that 15 of the 19 cases associated with the most recent outbreak have had their infection genomically sequenced and linked to the Holiday Inn, as authorities suspected, with the results for the remaining four due soon Testing Commander Jeroen Weimar confirmed that there are still 59 household and primary close contacts that authorities are still working with on this outbreak. “There are around 1,341 primary close contacts link to the various exposure sides that we spoke about over the last week or so and over 2000 others linked either to the Holiday Inn as workers.” Weimar also confirmed that authorities will continue supporting the 3,400 people still in quarantine. The state has emerged this morning out of lockdown, although some restrictions, such as mandatory masks where people cannot socially distance, only five visitors allowed at each household and density limits returning to pre-snap lockdown. The Minerals Council, the Nationals (some of them) and others are renewing the push for nuclear to be part of Australia’s energy mix. I spoke to Al Gore about this in June 2019 (the last time it was an issue) and he pointed to the cost The cost hasn’t become any less of an issue - but that hasn’t stopped the usual suspects from jumping on it as a solution to Australia’s energy issues. Anthony Albanese was asked about it today: I am not a supporter of nuclear energy in Australia because it doesn’t stack up. There have been numerous reports, occasionally you’ll get your opinion pieces in the pages of The Australian or other papers suggesting this, and no serious propositions have ever come forward on it. What we’re witnessing here is just a part of the chaos that is the Coalition when it comes to energy policy with their 22 energy policies. We had a debate in the Parliament on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation that’s adjourned. A Government that can’t debate its own legislation because it can’t agree with itself on what should happen with that legislation. It’s more chaos. Georgie Dent, from the advocacy group, the Parenthood, has spent the last few days in Canberra trying to get attention for universal childcare and better paid parental leave benefits. It relates to this report Anthony Albanese just held a press conference with Dent, to promote Labor’s universal childcare policy as a solution, but the issues of the day left early child education and PPL with not a lot of room One would hope that reversal will also mean women’s legal services, 1800-Respect and emergency services pages will also be immediately restored It seems Facebook did not mean to ban the non-news pages – like the weather – that have fallen prey to its blanket blocking of Australian news content. There is chaos on Facebook as unions, health and research pages have been wiped. Facebook says it was a mistake to block the Bureau of Meteorology, and is working to reverse the ban, according to US based CNET reporter Queenie Wong. This morning Linda Burney was out making sure people don’t forget the jobseeker rate is being cut from 31 March and people still don’t have any certainty over how much the unemployment payment will be: I met yesterday and the day before with a number of people who were on the jobseeker payment. Two clear messages came across. Firstly, that the stimulus payment, as a result of coronavirus, has changed the lives of people who find themselves, the 1.4 million people in Australia that find themselves on jobseeker. It has meant for the first time that they could actually have three meals a day. It’s meant for the first time in two or three years, they’ve been able to fill a script. It’s meant that they’ve been able to house, clothe their children and pay their rent so they had secure housing. That was the first message. The second message was one that I found incredibly disturbing and inconceivable, that the government does not know what it’s going to do in 42 days’ time, which is when jobseeker proposes to be finished. People on Jobseeker are incredibly anxious. They’re worried. They’re disturbed by the fact that they have no idea where their lives will be in 42 days’ time. They don’t know whether they’ll be thrown back into abject poverty. And, it’s not like it’s just Labor saying that there should be a permanent increase to jobseeker. It’s Philip Lowe, it’s Acoss, it’s the BCA [Business Council of Australia], it’s Barnaby Joyce, it’s John Howard. And the list goes on. I have met, as I said, directly with people who are on jobseeker, and they are the two strong messages that I took from my discussions. The Bureau of Meteorology has released a statement on the shutdown of its Facebook pages: The Bureau of Meteorology’s Facebook page has been impacted by the broader Facebook changes. The latest forecast and warning information is always available at www.bom.gov.au and on the BOM Weather app. The Bureau posts all weather and warnings information on Twitter @bom_au and Twitter accounts for each state and territory: @bom_qld @bom_nsw @bom_vic @bom_tas @bom_sa @bom_wa @bom_nt In other developments at James Packer’s Crown Resorts this morning, the Financial Review is reporting that WA police are taking a gander at possible links between $50m in allegedly dirty cash they’ve seized over the past six months from carriers they believe answer to international drug syndicates and Crown’s Perth casino. The AFR reports WA deputy police commissioner Col Blanch as saying: “The $50 million that we have seized in six months is difficult to get rid of for organised crime. “Any place that takes cash, large amounts of cash, is a haven for money launderers. “We are seeing large banks be fined by regulators for exactly the same thing in money laundering. “In my previous career, you actually do see criminals operating in the casino space, in the banking space.” (Blanch was previously at the Australian Crime Commission.) Nick Evershed is seeing what is and what isn’t possible with the content block: There seems to be no rhyme or reason to how this ban is being carried out. Facebook has also banned advocacy pages like Stop Adani, as well as the (formerly known as Adani) Bravus page. Some government pages are OK, some are not. And it seems some politicians can have their pages, and others can’t. During an election. This is a thing which has happened. The government, however, did say it was working through the issues and was very close to an agreement. Embattled casino operator Crown Resorts has plunged into the red as a result of Covid-19 lockdowns and its regulatory crisis, losing $120m over the last six months of 2020. This compares to a profit of $219m for the same period in 2019. The company also has current liabilities – things that need to be paid in the next 12 months – that are $430m more than current assets – things it could reasonably turn into cash in the same period. This is generally a bad thing, but the company says it’s still a going concern because the hit to its operations was largely due to the coronavirus crisis, which is (hopefully for all of us) a one-off. But there’s good news for chair Helen Coonan, who has been tasked with the difficult job of cleaning up Crown after a scathing report tabled in NSW parliament last week that found the company facilitated money laundering and that junket operators who brought in high-rollers were linked to organised crime. She’s to get a $1.8m a year pay rise for taking on extra duties by becoming executive chair, bringing her total pay to $2.5m. Meanwhile, Crown’s general counsel and company secretary, Mary Manos, who in 2019 warned the board against an ad blitz pushing back against media allegations about wrongdoing at Crown, has stepped down, effective immediately. The two jobs are to be split apart and chief financial officer Alan McGregor will act as company secretary for the time being. Revenue plunged 62.1% to $581m, due largely to the forced closure of Crown’s Melbourne and Perth casinos by state governments, Crown said. It said it also took a $25m hit after stopping junket operations. This is because it has had a look through its books and decided that it could no longer collect on some debts from gamblers. Unsurprisingly, the company isn’t paying a dividend. Crown is speaking to some media (but not Guardian Australia) this morning. The Facebook ban on news content in Australia has led to several official government pages being blocked from posting content. WA’s fire and emergency services department, the Bureau of Meterology, the Queensland Department of Health, and a number of ACT government pages have all had their content removed as a result of Facebook’s ban this morning. Facebook has not yet responded to questions about other non-news sites being banned as a result of the action taken by the company in response to the federal government’s news media code. It appears the block also affects a number of news-adjacent sites, like academic journals, charity sites, and even news satire sites like Betoota Advocate, Chaser, and Shaun Micallef’s Mad As Hell. Facebook has deplatformed Facebook. Anthony Albanese has also spoken on the Facebook ban, in the context that government, community and advocacy sites have also been banned: What is its solution to this? The government has said that it was all good and they were negotiating and they – they bragged about the phone calls that were being made. It’s very clear that this is a problem that the government needs to address. It’s literally just Aunt Karen, Uncle Steve and jet skis left. If there is a world ranking of awkward chats, I would like to know where this one sits – neither Josh Frydenberg or Mark Zuckerberg are known for their easy charm. Josh Frydenberg says he talked to Mark Zuckerberg for half an hour this morning about the Facebook ban and they are trying to “work the issues through”. But government remains committed to making them pay for Australian original journalism. Then there is this: The government’s own commissioned report can’t find evidence the cashless debit card conclusively leads to better outcomes for communities, as Luke Henriques-Gomes reports: A government-commissioned evaluation of the cashless debit card has failed to find conclusive evidence the scheme reduces social harm, despite some positive short-term improvements in the trial sites. The $2m report by the University of Adelaide was released on Wednesday some three months after final drafts were handed to the government and about nine weeks after the trial was extended for two years. It paints a mixed picture of the controversial scheme, which quarantines up to 80% of welfare recipients’ payment – across four sites – onto a debit card that cannot withdraw cash or be used to purchase alcohol. Introduced in 2016, the scheme was touted as a way to reduce social harms in areas with large numbers of welfare recipients. It operates in Ceduna, South Australia, the East Kimberley and Goldfields regions of Western Australia, and Bundaberg and Hervey Bay in Queensland. Gen X, seizing their moment Jim Chalmers says Josh Frydenberg was celebrating too early: This is a mess of the government’s making. It is up to the government to tell us what has gone on here and what they are doing to fix it and what it means for real people trying to access news. This will have consequences for people who are trying to access health news during a pandemic. It will have consequences for all of those people who rely on Facebook to get their news, credible news from credible sources. We don’t want to see people denied access to the news that they need, particularly when it comes to health news during a pandemic. This exposes the big gap between announcement and delivery in the Morrison government. Not 24 hours ago, the treasurer stood right here, or near here, and said that this was a historic moment and he declared victory over the tech platforms. Now we know that this is just as much of a mess, if not more so, today than it was yesterday. The treasurer said it was an historic moment, in many ways he is right. He shouldn’t have declared premature victory here when there are still lots of questions to be answered, still lots of mess to be cleaned up in the interests of people who just want to access a quality news via Facebook. Labor’s shadow communications minister, Michelle Rowland, says the Facebook decision is the fault of the government: Make no mistake, the impact of the decision by Facebook today, which has been effective immediately, is profound, it is profound for Australian consumers, businesses and also media outlets. It is incumbent on the Government to explain clearly, precisely and urgently what is going on and what the impact will be. Not only that, what it intends to do about it. Labor has been consistent that the objective of this exercise initiated by the ACCC, in bringing in a workable media code to ensure that we have a thriving public interest journalism sector in Australia and a sustainable media industry needs to be upheld. We need a workable code. This government only circulated amendments two nights ago, the night before it was actually brought into the parliament and shared those with Labor, we only knew about the impact of them at such a late stage. Yet the way the government was explaining it, you would have thought that this was a set of amendments that was going to deliver a workable code. Clearly, in the mind of Facebook, that is not the case. I have been in touch with Facebook Australian representatives today and it is clear that their decision is based on the uncertainty that they perceive with this code. In that event, this is not a workable code that has been landed by this government. Labor will attempt to make Linda Reynolds deliver an explanation to the Senate today: And it’s not just government departments. So it seems Facebook is banning anything that isn’t your uncle’s weird memes and your high school friend’s pyramid schemes. It’s not just news content – it’s also that of government departments. Mark Dreyfus spoke about the legislation that passed overnight, abolishing the family court: It’s a terrible decision, which goes against the advice of more than 150 people and organisations who work in the family court of Australia, who have told the government for years now that this is a terrible proposal. The government has ignored the advice of women’s legal services, it’s ignored the advice of community legal centres, it’s ignored the advice of family violence experts. And the government must know, if it had listened at all to their advice, that this decision to abolish the expert standalone family court will not do anything for those thousands of vulnerable Australians. The government has not waited for the current inquiry of the joint select committee of this parliament into the family law system to go ahead with this terrible legislation. The government has ignored the recommendations of the inquiry that it set up by the Australian Law Reform Commission, which conducted the largest ever review of the Family Law Act and the family law system in Australia. We haven’t even had a response from the part time attorney general to that report of the Law Reform Commission. Worst of all, the government has proceeded as if it were not the government of Australia. It’s provided additional resources to one state. Resources which it should be providing on an increased level to every state and territory of Australia. This is no way to proceed. It’s an extraordinarily bad decision. It’s a very sad day for Australia. The ABC has responded to the Facebook news: ABC News is Australia’s number one digital news service and the nation’s most trusted news outlet. The ABC’s digital news services will always remain free and accessible to all Australians on the ABC website and via the ABC News app, providing independent and reliable news, information and analysis. Despite key issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic having ongoing effects on all Australians, Facebook has today removed important and credible news and information sources from its Australian platform. We will continue our discussions with Facebook today following this development. Sarah Hanson-Young has some more thoughts on Facebook: Facebook has proved this morning they have become far too big, reinforcing the need to regulate this corporate bully. Instead of coming to the negotiating table in good faith and to pay the journalists that create their content, they pulled a major component of their service. Facebook constantly makes excuses for why it allows fake news to be spread on their platform yet overnight has blocked real news. The platform profits off the spread of hate speech, dangerous conspiracy theories and fake news and has now restricted any possibility of balancing that with the truth. Mark Zuckerberg allowed Trump’s dangerous rhetoric to fester on his platform and now all he will be left with in Australia is the likes of Craig Kelly and an increase in the spread of misinformation. Facebook needs to grow up. Australia’s democracy isn’t a college dorm room, and playing with public interest journalism isn’t a game. Nine Entertainment, publisher of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, has warned of the misinformation that will spread now that news has been banned on Facebook. Nine has signed a $30m deal with Google for news but has not come to an agreement with Facebook. It said: It is unfortunate Facebook have taken this position and it will indeed inhibit us from sharing our quality news and information with Australians. Nobody benefits from this decision as Facebook will now be a platform for misinformation to rapidly spread without balance. This action proves again their monopoly position and unreasonable behaviour. Some good news for Victorians to celebrate now they are out and about: Meanwhile, Bridget McKenzie has announced a Nationals Senate team press conference for 10.30. It’s on the Clean Energy Finance Corporation bill. Barnaby Joyce’s amendments to have coal considered were rejected Josh Frydenberg. But Joyce has friends in the Senate. Including a former resources minister, who loves the coal industry like I love Haigh’s chocolate. And there is nothing to stop amendments being added to bills as they enter the Senate. So keep a watch on that. Josh Frydenberg has spoken to Mark Zuckerberg this morning after Facebook made its announcement. Paul Fletcher told the ABC the social media giant needs to think of its reputation (I mean – I don’t know if Fletcher uses Facebook but, given what is allowed on there, I don’t think reputation is its driving force, but anyways). Fletcher: Facebook needs to think very carefully about what this means for its reputation and standing. They’re effectively saying, on our platform, there will not be any information from organisations which employ paid journalists, which have fact checking processes, editorial policies. They’re effectively saying any information that is available on our site does not come from these reliable sources. I would imagine that on quite sober reflection, they will start to become quite troubled about what that would mean for how their platform is perceived. There is things they have said throughout the process about the value of news. Objective observers would be sceptical of some of their claims. This is about a competition policy issue, particularly in the digital advertising market and our competition regulator has advised that we take this action. It is also about a media policy issue, about having a diverse, well-resourced media sector in Australia. That’s an important part of our democratic process. It may not seem so important in Silicon Valley but it is very important to the Australian government and Australian people. That is why we have gone through this careful, measured three-year process now, based upon the ACCC’s extensive inquiry, the digital platforms inquiry. That is why we are where we are with the code. We will continue to legislate it but we continue to talk to all parties, as we have consistently throughout the process. Rebekha Sharkie was asked about Facebook’s decision while speaking to ABC News Breakfast this morning: I guess we’re a small market in Australia and I guess Facebook feels that they can flex their muscles. Ultimately, I think they would have to be very careful that they don’t become irrelevant. We can all only look at so many funny cat videos. People mainly get their news content from Facebook or other services and I think people will perhaps look at other platforms if Facebook aren’t willing to share. That might underestimate people’s willingness to change. Anyone who has reported abuse knows just how hard it is to have the comments removed. Meanwhile, while the government absolutely tore apart the Australia Post executive Christine Holgate for awarding executives Cartier watches as bonuses (Holgate resigned after Scott Morrison called the combined $20,000 bonus “disgraceful” in a parliament), executives at NBN Co received $78m in personal bonuses in the second half of last year. During a pandemic. Paul Fletcher effectively told ABC radio he didn’t have a problem with it, as the NBN was critical in keeping Australia running during lockdowns. (One could argue the same for Australia Post, but anyway.) Fletcher said Labor had set the NBN Co up as a government business enterprise and the board can assess the performance of the company and make its own decisions. Australia Post is also a government business enterprise. Essentially, what that means is that it operates as a business but with Australian taxpayers as the shareholder. The Holgate decision was different, Fletcher says, because a report (that the government didn’t want released) found Holgate did not receive approval from the Australia Post board to award the watches. She was cleared of wrongdoing but the bonuses were found to be “inconsistent” with public expectations. I’m not sure how $78m in bonuses in the back end of a pandemic year is going to go down if $20,000 in watches was too much, but that’s something for estimates. The Australia Institute has reponded to Facebook’s news. Peter Lewis, director of the institute’s Centre for Responsible Technology, says it might time for people to close their accounts: Facebook’s decision to prevent users viewing for sharing public interest journalism will make it a weaker social network. The social network is destroying its social license to operate. Facebook actions mean the company’s failures in privacy, disinformation, and data protection will require a bigger push for stronger government regulation. Without fact-based news to anchor it, Facebook will become little more than cute cats and conspiracy theories. At a time when the importance of facts in dealing with a global health crisis are critical, Facebook’s decision is arrogant, reckless, and dangerous. For years Facebook has been holding back against valuing facts and taking accountability for what their network promotes. It has honed advertising models that excite, enrage, and divide its users and fails to recognise the benefits of anchoring its network in ethically-curated news content. If Facebook determines to treat Australians with such contempt, Australians should respond by ending alternate ways to connect online. It is not just traditional news Facebook has banned: And it looks as though users are unable to share links through messenger, as well. Communications minister Paul Fletcher says the government will be pushing ahead with its media bargaining code, despite Facebook’s stance. News Corp has announced it has struck a deal with Google for use of its content. It’s the last sitting day of the week and it’s all gone a little pear-shaped for the government. After announcing that everything seemed hunky dory and deals were being made, and issues had been pushed through after a very busy weekend of talks with the heads of Facebook and Google, Mark Zuckerberg and co had an announcement this morning. Facebook is banning all Australian news content from its platform. Not just in Australia, but across the world. That doesn’t seem like the smartest move for a company trying to prove it is not in the business of fake news, but it does seem to be the actions of a company that doesn’t want the media bargaining code going anywhere else. So while Google was making the most noise about pulling out its search engine, Google has come to the table and made a few deals (and is in negotiations with others). Facebook though, is out. At least for now. Meanwhile, the government decided this was the week to push ahead with its plans to abolish the family court, cheered along by Pauline Hanson. Abolishing the family court was one of the One Nation leader’s main goals in returning to parliament. It was one of the platforms she ran on, and was heavily supported by men’s rights activists. Last night, after making a deal with Rex Patrick, the government was able to shut down the debate and take it to vote, despite almost the entire legal community speaking about what a bad idea it is. Under the bill, the family court is merged with the federal court. What on earth could go wrong. And Scott Morrison, who did not do any media yesterday, responded to the Labor and later, the crossbench, call for the review of the Parliament House workplace culture and complaints process to be conducted independently. That came after Brittany Higgins released a statement accusing the prime minister of using “victim blaming rhetoric” and said the government had its own questions to answer about its conduct. We’ll cover everything as the day unfolds. A special good morning to Victorians who are officially out of lockdown and, I hope, having a coffee at their favourite place today. You have Amy Remeikis with you today, with Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Daniel Hurst along for the ride. I’m going to get my third coffee, and then we can jump right in."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/dec/28/fears-of-another-fukushima-as-tepco-plans-to-restart-worlds-biggest-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-28T02:00:33Z","webTitle":"Fears of another Fukushima as Tepco plans to restart world's biggest nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/28/fears-of-another-fukushima-as-tepco-plans-to-restart-worlds-biggest-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/dec/28/fears-of-another-fukushima-as-tepco-plans-to-restart-worlds-biggest-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"Fears of another Fukushima as Tepco plans to restart world's biggest nuclear plant","bodyText":"If a single structure can define a community, for the 90,000 residents of Kashiwazaki town and the neighbouring village of Kariwa, it is the sprawling nuclear power plant that has dominated the coastal landscape for more than 40 years. When all seven of its reactors are in operation, Kashiwazaki-kariwa generates 8.2m kilowatts of electricity – enough to power 16m households. Occupying 4.2 sq km of land along the Japan Sea coast, it is the biggest nuclear power plant in the world. But today, the reactors at Kashiwazaki-kariwa are idle. The plant in Niigata prefecture, about 140 miles (225km) north-west of the capital, is the nuclear industry’s highest-profile casualty of the nationwide atomic shutdown that followed the March 2011 triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi. The company at the centre of the disaster has encountered anger over its failure to prevent the catastrophe, its treatment of tens of thousands of evacuated residents and its haphazard attempts to clean up its atomic mess. Now, the same utility, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], is attempting to banish its Fukushima demons with a push to restart two reactors at Kashiwazaki-kariwa, one of its three nuclear plants. Only then, it says, can it generate the profits it needs to fund the decommissioning of Fukushima Daiichi and win back the public trust it lost in the wake of the meltdown. This week, Japan’s nuclear regulation authority gave its formal approval for Tepco to restart the Kashiwazaki-kariwa’s No. 6 and 7 reactors – the same type of boiling-water reactors that suffered meltdowns at Fukushima Daiichi. After a month of public hearings, the nuclear regulation authority concluded that Tepco was fit to run a nuclear power plant and said the two reactors met the stricter safety standards introduced after the 2011 disaster. Just before that decision, Tepco gave the Guardian an exclusive tour of what it claims will be the safest nuclear plant in the world. Now, as on the day of the triple disaster that brought widespread destruction to Japan’s northeast coast, Kashiwazaki-kariwa has the look of a working nuclear plant. Just over 1,000 Tepco staff and 5,000-6,000 contract workers provide the manpower behind a post-Fukushima safety retrofit that is projected to cost 680 billion yen ($6.1bn). They have built a 15-metre-high seawall that, according to Tepco, can withstand the biggest tsunami waves. In the event of a meltdown, special vents would keep 99.9% of released radioactive particles out of the atmosphere, and corium shields would block molten fuel from breaching the reactors’ primary containment vessels. Autocatalytic recombiners have been installed to prevent a repeat of the hydrogen explosions that rocked four of Fukushima Daiichi’s reactors. Other parts of the sprawling complex are home to fleets of emergency vehicles, water cannon, back-up power generators, and a hilltop reservoir whose 20,000 tonnes of water will be drawn to cool reactors in the event of a catastrophic meltdown. “As the operator responsible for the Fukushima accident, we’re committed to learning lessons, revisiting what went wrong and implementing what we learned here at Kashiwazaki-kariwa, says the plant’s chief, Chikashi Shitara. “We are always looking at ways to improve safety. “Because of our experience at Fukushima, we’re committed to not making the same mistakes again – to make the safety regime even stronger. That’s what we have to explain to members of the public.” ‘This is no place for a nuclear power plant’ The public, however, is far from convinced. Last year, the people of Niigata prefecture registered their opposition to the utility’s plans by electing Ryuichi Yoneyama, an anti-nuclear candidate, as governor. Exit polls showed that 73% of voters opposed restarting the plant, with just 27% in favour. Yoneyama has said that he won’t make a decision on the restarts, scheduled for spring 2019, until a newly formed committee has completed its report into the causes and consequences of the Fukushima disaster - a process that could take at least three years. For many residents, the plant’s location renders expensive safety improvements irrelevant. “Geologically speaking, this is no place for a nuclear power plant,” says Kazuyuki Takemoto, a retired local councillor and a lifelong anti-nuclear activist. Takemoto cites instability caused by the presence of underground oil and gas deposits in the area, and evidence that the ground on which Tepco’s seawall stands is prone to liquefaction in the event of a major earthquake. Local critics have pointed to the chaos that could result from attempting to evacuate the 420,000 people who live within a 30km radius of Kashiwazaki-kariwa. “That’s more people than lived near Fukushima, plus we get very heavy snowfall here, which would make evacuating everyone impossible,” Takemoto adds. “The situation would be far worse than it was in Fukushima.” Adding to their concerns are the presence of seismic faults in and around the site, which sustained minor damage during a magnitude-6.6 offshore earthquake in 2007. Two active faults – defined by nuclear regulators as one that has moved any time within the last 400,000 years – run beneath reactor No. 1. But for Tepco, a return to nuclear power generation is a matter of financial necessity, with the utility standing to gain up to ¥200 billion in annual profits by restarting the two reactors at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa. The bill for decommissioning Fukushima Daiichi, decontaminating neighbourhoods and compensating residents affected by the meltdown could reach 21.5tr yen [$191bn], according to government estimates. That is on top of the money the firm is spending on importing expensive fossil fuels to fill the vacuum left by the nuclear shutdown. Earlier this year, the Japan Centre for Economic Research said the total cost of the four-decade Fukushima cleanup – including the disposal of radioactive waste from the plant’s three damaged reactors – could soar to between 50-70tr yen. “As Tepco’s president and our general business plan have made clear, restarting the reactors here is very important to us as a company,” says Shitara. Much is at stake, too, for Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who has put an ambitious return to nuclear power generation at the centre of his energy policy. His government wants nuclear to provide about 20 percent Japan’s electricity by 2030 – a move that would require the restart of about 30 reactors. Of the country’s 48 operable reactors, only four are currently online. Several others have passed stringent new safety tests introduced in the wake of Fukushima, but restarts have encountered strong local opposition. As part of the restart process, people across Japan were recently invited to submit their opinions on the Kashiwazaki-kariwa restart and Tepco’s suitability as a nuclear operator. Kiyoto Ishikawa, from the plant’s public relations department, insists Tepco has learned the lessons of Fukushima. “Before 3-11 we were arrogant and had stopped improving safety,” he said. “The earthquake was a wake-up call. We now know that improving safety is a continuous process.” The firm’s assurances were dismissed by Yukiko Kondo, a Kariwa resident, who said the loss of state subsidies if the plant were to remain permanently idle was a sacrifice worth making if it meant giving local people peace of mind. “Tepco caused the 2011 accident, so there is no way I would ever support restarting nuclear reactors here,” she said. “They kept telling us that Fukushima Daiichi was perfectly safe – and look what happened.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/12/gulf-stream-green-brexit-and-punk-haired-turtles-green-news-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T10:17:46Z","webTitle":"Gulf Stream, green Brexit and punk-haired turtles – green news roundup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/12/gulf-stream-green-brexit-and-punk-haired-turtles-green-news-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/12/gulf-stream-green-brexit-and-punk-haired-turtles-green-news-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Gulf Stream, green Brexit and punk-haired turtles – green news roundup","bodyText":"Environment news Gulf Stream current at its weakest in 1,600 years, studies show Green Brexit unlikely despite government claims, report concludes ‘Day zero’ water crises: Spain, Morocco, India and Iraq at risk as reservoirs shrink Drug waste clogs rivers around the world, scientists say Waitrose to remove all disposable coffee cups from shops this year Six Virunga park rangers killed in DRC wildlife sanctuary British butterflies suffered seventh worst year on record in 2017 EU will seek ‘non-regression’ clause to tie UK to environmental standards Iceland to be first UK supermarket to cut palm oil from own-brand products UK could create 5,000 jobs by moving to sustainable fishing, says report BBC Radio 4 broke accuracy rules in Nigel Lawson climate change interview Farming groups take steps to stop slaughter of male dairy calves Heathrow third runway noise would affect 2.2m people, analysis finds Plans for Welsh nuclear power plant delayed by concerns over seabirds In depth Abandoned collieries could hold key to heating UK homes Caught in the crossfire: little dodo nears extinction The edible solutions to the plastic-packaging crisis ‘Our territory is our life’: one struggle against mining in Ecuador Multimedia Unforgettable underwater photography - in pictures And finally ...

We have moved our liveblog across to the page below where you can follow all the latest developments. Shortly, we will launch a new liveblog to continue our coverage on the war in Ukraine. But before we do here is a comprehensive rundown of where things currently stand: Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the new package of western sanctions against Russia is “not enough” and without more painful measures and supply of weapons, Russia will view the actions as permission to launch a new bloody attack. In his daily address on Thursday, he called for the democratic world to reject Russian oil and completely block Russian banks from the international finance system. Zelenskiy said the west’s hesitation to agree on an oil embargo is costing Ukrainian lives. Russia’s export of oil as “one of the foundations of Russia’s aggression” that allows it to not take peace negotiations seriously, he added. The US, UK and EU unveiled new sanctions against Moscow. US sanctions target Russian banks and elites, and include a ban on any American from investing in Russia as well as sanctions on Putin’s adult daughters. The UK will impose an asset freeze on Russia’s largest bank, place sanctions on eight more oligarchs and end imports of oil and coal by next year, foreign secretary Liz Truss said. The EU announced a wide-ranging package of sanctions, including import bans on coal and transaction bans on banks. Nato’s foreign ministers will meet in Brussels on Thursday for two days of talks on bringing an end to the war. The UN General Assembly will vote today on whether to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council. Hungary’s right-wing, Putin-allied prime minister Viktor Orbán gave a press conference in which he said he had offered to broker talks with Russia. He offered to work towards a ceasefire, while stopping short of agreeing to extend EU sanctions against Russia’s oil and gas shipments. Zelenskiy said Kremlin forces were trying to cover up evidence of atrocities. “We have information that the Russian military has changed its tactics and is trying to remove people who have been killed from streets and basements ... this is just an attempt to hide the evidence and nothing more,” he said Thursday, but did not provide evidence. US prosecutors are working with their European and Ukrainian counterparts to help collect evidence of possible Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Russia’s military has now shifted its focus to the east of the Ukraine, with Ukraine authorities in Luhansk and Donetsk warning that civilians should leave “while the opportunity still exists” before a massive Russian military assault that it expects in the coming days. It comes as western officials say Russia’s retreat from around Kyiv and the north east of the country is now “largely complete” and that it will take “at least a week” before reconstituted units could go to Donbas and perhaps longer. Russia is hiding ‘thousands’ killed in Mariupol, Zelenskiy said. Russian forces are blocking humanitarian access to the besieged port city of Mariupol because it wants to hide evidence of “thousands” of people killed there, the president said. More than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed in Mariupol since the start of Russia’s invasion, the mayor of the besieged city said. Vadym Boichenko said 90% of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed and Russian forces have targeted a hospital where 50 people were burned to death. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to access the city, about 1,000 people made it out of Mariupol in a convoy of buses and private cars organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). They are now at the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia. A total of 4,892 people were evacuated from Ukraine on Wednesday using humanitarian corridors, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, compared with 3,846 who were evacuated on Tuesday. Ukrainian soldiers are being trained in the US to operate deadly Switchblade drones that Washington is supplying to Kyiv, the Pentagon said Wednesday. Defence department spokesman John Kirby said it was a “very small” number of Ukrainian troops who were already in the US before Russia invaded their country. Britain is drawing up plans to send armoured vehicles to Ukraine, according to The Times. Options include sending a protected patrol vehicle, such as the Mastiff, or a vehicle like the Jackal, which can be used as a reconnaissance or long-range patrol vehicle, a ministry of defence report said. Sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine should give China a “good understanding” of the consequences it could face if it provides material support to Moscow, US deputy secretary of state said. The Pentagon has said Ukraine could “absolutely” win the war against Russia, even as US officials speak of the risk of a protracted conflict. “Of course they can win this,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing. “The proof is literally in the outcomes that you’re seeing everyday ... absolutely they can win.” Here are some of the latest images to come from Ukraine today. In Bucha, two young girls walks hand-in-hand past destroyed Russian military machinery littering the main town street. A child’s teddy bear hangs from a tree in front of a building bombed by the Russian army in Borodyanka while a damaged playground is seen next to a heavily damaged apartment building in Hostomel. Italy will “follow the decisions of the European Union” on new sanctions against Russia, including a possible gas embargo, prime minister Mario Draghi has said. The growing number of “massacres” in Ukraine “is prompting us to adopt even tougher sanctions,” he told reporters after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. All the allied countries are wondering what can be done to stop Russia... We are following what the European Union decides. If we are offered a gas embargo, we will follow the EU down this path, we want the most effective instrument to achieve peace.” While a gas embargo is “not a possibility being discussed at the moment” the situation is “constantly evolving” Draghi added. Italy is highly dependent on Russian gas, importing 95% of the gas it consumes, of which around 40% comes from Russia. “Today the gas embargo is not yet... on the table,” Draghi said. The UN General Assembly will vote today on whether to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council. The move was initiated by the United States in response to the discovery of hundreds of bodies after Russian troops withdrew from towns near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, sparking calls for its forces to be tried for war crimes. US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield made the call for Russia to be stripped of its seat on the 47-member council in the wake of videos and photos of streets in the town of Bucha strewn with corpses of what appeared to be civilians. “We believe that the members of the Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine, and we believe that Russia needs to be held accountable,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce.” While the Human Rights Council is based in Geneva, its members are elected by the 193-nation General Assembly for three-year terms. The March 2006 resolution that established the Human Rights Council states that the assembly may suspend membership rights of a country “that commits gross and systematic violations of human rights.” To be approved, the resolution requires a two-thirds majority of assembly members that vote “yes” or “no.” Abstentions don’t count. The Pentagon has said Ukraine could “absolutely” win the war against Russia, even as US officials speak of the risk of a protracted conflict. “Of course they can win this,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing. “The proof is literally in the outcomes that you’re seeing everyday ... absolutely they can win.” Of course, they can win this. And if you look at what they’ve been able to do just thus far, Mr. Putin has achieved exactly zero of his strategic objectives inside Ukraine. He didn’t take Kyiv. He didn’t topple the government. He didn’t remove Ukraine as a nation state. And he’s really only taken control of a small number of population centres. And even they weren’t the ones that he was really going after. So, you know, Mariupol is still not taken. He’s moved his forces out of Kyiv. He’s moved his forces out of Cherniniv. They haven’t taken Kharkiv. They haven’t taken Mykolayiv in the south. So, I think the proof is literally in the outcomes that you’re seeing every day. The Ukrainians are bravely fighting for their country. And they have denied Mr. Putin so many of his strategic objectives. So absolutely, they can win.” Sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine should give China a “good understanding” of the consequences it could face if it provides material support to Moscow, US deputy secretary of state has said. Wendy Sherman, while speaking at a House of Representatives foreign affairs committee hearing on Wednesday, said the “range of sanctions” and export controls coordinated among US allies and partners against Russian President Vladimir Putin, the country’s economy, and oligarchs, should serve as an example for China’s leader Xi Jinping. It gives President Xi, I think, a pretty good understanding of what might come his way should he, in fact, support Putin in any material fashion.” She said Beijing should “take away the right lessons” from the coordinated western response over Ukraine that any moves by China to take the democratically governed island of Taiwan by force would not be acceptable. “We hope that the PRC understands that any such action would see a response from the international community, not just from the United States,” she said, referring to the People’s Republic of China. China has refused to condemn Russia’s action in Ukraine or call it an invasion and has criticised Western sanctions on Moscow, although a senior Chinese diplomat said last week that Beijing is not deliberately circumventing those sanctions. Zelenskiy maintained that alleged atrocities committed by Russian forces in Bucha would be repeated in other cities, this time with Russia hiding the evidence of any crimes. We have information that the Russian troops have changed their tactics and are trying to remove the killed people from the streets and basements of the occupied territory. Killed Ukrainians. This is just an attempt to hide the evidence and nothing more. However, the president remained optimistic that they would not succeed. “Responsibility cannot be avoided,” he added. We already know about thousands of missing people. We already know about thousands of people who could be either deported to Russia or killed. There are no other options for their fate. The situation now is that thanks to an objective investigation, thanks to witnesses, thanks to satellite surveillance of events on earth, thanks to other tools that help establish the truth we will find out all the circumstances regarding the majority of our missing citizens. Regarding most of Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine.” “The search for truth can no longer be stopped,” he added. Zelenskiy described Russia’s export of oil as “one of the foundations of Russia’s aggression” that allows it to not take peace negotiations seriously. Some politicians are still unable to decide how to limit the flow of dollars and euros to Russia from the oil trade, so as not to jeopardise their own economies... The embargo on Russian oil supplies will be applied anyway. The format will be found. The only question is how many more Ukrainian men and women the Russian military will have time to kill, so that you, some politicians - and we know you, can borrow a little determination somewhere.” Zelenskiy said Ukraine will also continue to insist on a complete blockade of the Russian banking system from international finance. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the new package of western sanctions against Russia is “not enough” and without more painful measures and supply of weapons, Russia will view the actions as permission to launch a new bloody attack. New investments in Russia are blocked, restrictions are applied against several systemic banks in Russia, personal sanctions are added, as well as other restrictions. This package has a spectacular look. But this is not enough.” In his signature nightly national address the Ukrainian president added: If there is no really painful package of sanctions against Russia and if there is no supply of weapons we really need and have applied for many times, it will be considered by Russia as a permission. A permission to go further. A permission to attack. A permission to start a new bloody wave in Donbas.” However, Zelenskiy remained optimistic saying “it is still possible to prevent this”. It is still possible to impose such sanctions, which Ukraine insists on, our people insist on. It is still possible to give us weapons that will really stop this aggression. The west can do it. Just as it could have applied preventive sanctions last year to prevent this invasion. If the mistake is made again, if there is no preventive action again, it will be a historic mistake for the whole western world.” Britain is drawing up plans to send armoured vehicles to Ukraine, according to The Times. Options under consideration include sending a protected patrol vehicle, such as the Mastiff, or a vehicle like the Jackal, which can be used as a reconnaissance or long-range patrol vehicle, a ministry of defence report said. The vehicles would be stripped of sensitive equipment and British troops would be sent to a country neighbouring Ukraine to carry out training, the newspaper reported, citing a defence source. Further support, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, would be announced by Britain in the coming days, the report said. Ukrainian soldiers are being trained in the United States to operate the deadly Switchblade drones that Washington is supplying to Kyiv, a Pentagon official said Wednesday. Defence department spokesman John Kirby said it was a “very small” number of Ukrainian troops who were already present in the US before Russia invaded their country. Speaking at a brief briefing on Wednesday, Kirby said the weapons were not a system that the Ukrainians typically use. So, there is going to need to be a little bit of training. It is not a very complex system. It doesn’t require a lot of training ... We took the opportunity to - having them still in the country, to give them a couple of days’ worth of training on the Switchblade. So that they can go back ... back home to train others in the Ukrainian military. And we’ll look at - that doesn’t have to be the end all of it. I mean, we’ll look at other suitable opportunities, if needed to provide more training on the Switchblades if it’s necessary, but that’s what they were referring to yesterday.” Kirby said the 100 drones, which are essentially remotely controlled flying bombs which are crashed into targets where they explode, have been sent to Ukraine to bolster the military’s fight against Russian troops. “They arrived over there earlier this week. So they’ll be getting into Ukraine quickly if they aren’t already there,” Kirby said, adding that the number of Ukrainian trainees was less than a dozen. President Joe Biden announced on 16 March that, among other weaponry and munitions Washington was shipping to the Ukrainians, it would start sending the Switchblades. Named for the way their wings unfold when launched, Switchblades are called loitering munitions, because they can be flown to target areas and held there until the right moment when a target is identified. The operator then flies them into the target where they explode. The original version, small enough to carry in a backpack, was used by US forces in Afghanistan. A larger version, with enough explosives to take out armoured vehicles, has also been developed. But the Pentagon would not say which one has been sent to Ukraine, if not both. Meanwhile the United States announced Tuesday it was releasing another $100 million worth of military aid to Ukraine. Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine was clearly a miscalculation, and will shorten his time in office, a top ally of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny has said. “Very clearly, Putin has shortened his term,” Leonid Volkov told AFP in an interview. With his decision to invade Ukraine, “Putin has dramatically decreased the probability of a scenario where he just stays in the Kremlin until he dies ... as he planned.” Speaking on the sidelines of the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy, Navalny’s right-hand man said it was becoming increasingly obvious that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine six weeks ago was “miscalculated” and doomed to failure. Volkov acknowledged that Putin so far was “doing OK in selling his propaganda narrative” justifying the invasion to those in the Russian public who receive all news about the war from state-controlled television. But he stressed that elites were “very unhappy with the economic devastation, the casualties and restrictions and sanctions”. “They will start thinking of regime change, or changing systems.” Russia is blocking humanitarian access to the besieged port city of Mariupol because it wants to hide evidence of “thousands” of people killed there, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. In an interview with Turkey’s Haberturk TV, he said: I think Russia is afraid that [if] we successfully send humanitarian aid to Mariupol, then the whole world will see what’s going on here. Russia doesn’t want anything to be seen until they take control of the city until they clean it all up. Mariupol is hell right now. Thousands have either been killed or injured. The number of those killed and injured is increasing day by day ... we do not have clear information on the number of those who lost their lives. They are trying to cover up the situation. In this case, they are trying to prevent the humanitarian supply. They will not be able to cover up everything. They will not be able to bury or hide thousands of people. The world has seen the real situation. It has seen what has been done to a Ukrainian city.” Zelenskiy said that Russia had already attempted to conceal evidence of crimes in the town of Bucha outside of Kyiv and several nearby communities, where Ukrainian officials have accused Moscow of carrying out widespread killings of civilians. “They burned families. Families. Yesterday we found again a new family: father, mother, two children. Little, little children, two. One was a little hand, you know,” Zelensky said. “That’s why I said ‘they are Nazis’.” US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said Russia should be expelled from the Group of 20 major economies forum, and the United States will boycott “a number of G20 meetings” if Russian officials show up. Her comments at a US House Financial Services Committee hearing raised questions about the G20’s future role in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Yellen told lawmakers that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the killings of civilians in Bucha “are reprehensible, represent an unacceptable affront to the rules-based global order, and will have enormous economic repercussions in Ukraine and beyond”. The United States and its key allies have placed greater emphasis in recent months on the G7 grouping of industrial democracies, whose interests are more aligned, using G7 meetings to coordinate their response to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Yellen said that the Biden administration wants to push Russia out of active participation in major international institutions, but acknowledged that it was unlikely that Russia could be expelled from the International Monetary Fund given its rules. “President Biden’s made it clear, and I certainly agree with him, that it cannot be business as usual for Russia in any of the financial institutions,” Yellen said in response to a question. “He’s asked that Russia be removed from the G20, and I’ve made clear to my colleagues in Indonesia that we will not be participating in a number of meetings if the Russians are there,” Yellen said. The US has disrupted a global “botnet” controlled by Russia’s military intelligence agency, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced on Wednesday. A botnet is a network of hijacked computers used to carry out cyberattacks. “The Russian government has recently used similar infrastructure to attack Ukrainian targets,” Garland told reporters at the justice department. “Fortunately, we were able to disrupt this botnet before it could be used. Thanks to our close work with international partners, we were able to detect the infection of thousands of network hardware devices. “We were then able to disable the GRU’s [the military intelligence agency] control over those devices before the botnet could be weaponised.” The attorney general also announced charges against Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev for sanctions violations. He said the billionaire had been previously identified as a source of financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea and providing support for the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic in eastern Ukraine. “After being sanctioned by the United States, Malofeyev attempted to evade the sanctions by using co-conspirators to surreptitiously acquire and run media outlets across Europe,” Garland said. The indictment is the first of a Russian oligarch in the US since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In a related move, a federal court in the southern district of New York unsealed a criminal indictment against TV producer John Hanick, 71, a US citizen charged with violations of sanctions and false statements because of his work for Malofeyev over several years.

US sanctions target Russian banks and elites, and include a ban on any American from investing in Russia as well as sanctions on Putin’s adult daughters. The UK is collaborating with the US on asset freezes against Russian banks and banning all new outward investment to Russia. And the EU announced a wide-ranging package of sanctions, including import bans on coal and transaction bans on banks. Hungary’s right-wing, Putin-allied prime minister Viktor Orbán gave a press conference in which he said he had offered to broker talks with Russia. He offered to work towards a ceasefire, while stopping short of agreeing to extend EU sanctions against Russia’s oil and gas shipments. Russia’s military has now shifted its focus to the east of the Ukraine, with authorities in Luhansk and Donetsk warning that civilians should leave as quickly as possible. There were reports of burning buildings in Luhansk following Russian shelling, with casualties unknown; while five were killed in Donetsk, according to the governor; and Ukrainian railways reported rocket fire on a railway station in the east of the country, which resulted in casualties, though gave no further detail on the location or number of victims. Western officials said Russia’s retreat from around Kyiv and the north east of the country is now “largely complete” and that it will take “at least a week” before reconstituted units could move to Donbas. Kyiv reported 89 deaths since the start of the conflict. More than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed in Mariupol since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to the mayor of the besieged city. Mayor Vadym Boichenko said 90% of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed and Russian forces have targeted a hospital where 50 were burned to death. Russian attacks on the port city have obstructed access to food and supplies and Red Cross humanitarian convoy has been unsuccessful in getting in. Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an impassioned speech to Ireland’s parliament, in which he urged the country to pile extra pressure on EU nations to introduce tougher sanctions, accusing European countries of worrying excessively about the economic consequences. – Rachel Hall, Guardian staff Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said that international experts need to work with Ukraine to “ensure that sanctions are sufficiently destructive” to Russia. “The war continues. Everyone saw the horrors that took place in the city of Bucha. And that means sanctions are not enough to stop Russia,” he said. “Therefore, all of us and our partners need to work to ensure that sanctions are sufficiently destructive.” Rostyslav Shurma, the deputy head of office, also said that Russia should be internationally recognized as a “sponsor of terrorism” and included in the blacklist of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental group designed to combat money laundering, to restrict trade, according to the Ukrainian president’s office. Ukrainian officials have been meeting with international experts – including former US ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul – to discuss sanctions and actions against Russia. Russia is inching closer to a default on its debts. Reuters reports: Russia edged closer to a potential default on its international debt on Wednesday as it set aside roubles to pay holders of international bonds that need to be repaid in dollars and said it would continue to do so as long as its foreign exchange reserves are blocked by sanctions. The United States on Monday stopped Russia from paying holders of its sovereign debt more than $600 million from frozen reserves held at U.S. banks, saying Moscow had to choose between draining its dollar reserves at home and default. Russia has not defaulted on its external debt since reneging on payments due after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, but its bonds have remerged as a flashpoint in the diplomatic crisis and sanctions tit-for-tat between Moscow and western capitals. “This speeds up the timeline around when Russia runs out of space on willingness and ability to pay,” one fund manager holding one of the bonds due for payment on Monday said. The Kremlin said it would continue to pay its dues. “Russia has all necessary resources to service its debts... If this blockade continues and payments aimed for servicing debts are blocked, it (future payment) could be made in roubles,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Moscow has managed to make a number of foreign exchange coupon payments on some of its 15 international bonds with a face value of around $40 billion outstanding before the United States stopped such transactions. While sanctions have frozen roughly half of $640 billion in Russia’s gold and foreign currency reserves, the country still receives billions of dollars from exporting crude and gas. The identities of Putin’s daughters have never been confirmed by him or the Kremlin and no photographs of them as adults have ever been officially released. Even the number of children Putin has fathered is subject to intense speculation. Officially, Putin has two children, Maria and Katerina, from his marriage to Lyudmila Putina, a former Aeroflot steward whom he divorced in 2013, becoming the first Russian leader to divorce since Peter the Great in 1698. Putin, who has very rarely spoken publicly about his children, responded to questions at his annual press conference in 2015, saying his daughters had not fled the country, as had been speculated. “They live in Russia. They have never been educated anywhere except Russia. I am proud of them; they continue to study and are working,” he said. “My daughters speak three European languages fluently. I never discuss my family with anyone. “They have never been ‘star’ children, they have never got pleasure from the spotlight being directed on them. They just live their own lives.” Putin said his daughters were “taking the first steps in their careers”, and were “not involved in business or politics”. However, both daughters have since launched business ventures. Read more: As the war in Ukraine enters a new phase, Nato countries have been gradually stepping up their supply of weapons to Kyiv. In doing so, western nations are quietly crossing the defensive-only threshold set by leaders at the start of the crisis. But the question remains whether the gradual escalation in arms deliveries can avoid a Russian retaliation and turn the tide on the battlefield, where Moscow is seeking to wage a more conventional military-on-military war in the eastern Donbas. “The issue will be how much the west shifts to offensive weaponry,” said Phil Osborn, a former UK chief of defence intelligence, “and the absolute criticality of ensuring that the supply of critical military kit is maintained and increased.” Ukraine’s military spent the first six weeks of the war trying to pick off invading Russian armoured columns with light infantry using anti-tank bazookas. Poor Russian tactics and Ukrainian determination successfully forced the overstretched attackers to abandon their attacks on Kyiv, and Chernihiv and Sumy in the north-east. But Ukraine now has to deal with Russian forces in the east and south that have made more defensible gains and are better dug in. In the past 24 hours it has emerged that the Czech Republic has sent a dozen Soviet designed T-72 tanks, plus howitzer artillery pieces and BMP-1 armoured vehicles, a significant shift in the direction of supplying “offensive weapons” that western politicians had insisted they were not prepared to do. That by itself is not enough to make more than a dent in the 94 tanks that Ukraine is estimated by researchers at Oryx to have lost in the fighting so far – but there is persistent speculation Poland could spare 100 more, now it has reached a separate agreement on Tuesday to buy 250 US Abrams tanks for $4.75bn. The next phase of the war – which could yet be decisive – is expected to unfold in the Donbas in the next month as Russian forces seek to capture Mariupol, create a land bridge to Crimea, expand the area of occupation in the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk – and perhaps encircle Ukraine’s main fighting force ranged against it. Read more: In France, president Emmanuel Macron is defending his diplomatic efforts with Vladimir Putin, as he faces a challenge from the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. Le Pen, who is gaining in polls ahead of the the first round of voting in France’s election on Sunday, and who had previously expressed admiration for Putin and lobbied for the EU to drop sanctions against Russia after the annexation of Crimea, has sought to distance herself from Moscow ahead of the elections. Macron, responding to Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawieck’s criticisms of his meetings with Putin, accused Morawieck of seeking to bolster Le Pen. AFP reports: Morawiecki on Monday slammed Macron’s hours of phone calls with Putin, whom he likened to Hitler, and suggested they had achieved nothing. “These statements are both baseless and scandalous,” Macron told TF1 on Wednesday evening when asked about the remarks which threaten to undermine EU unity during the bloc’s face-off with Moscow over Ukraine. He said the Polish leader was from a “far-right party” and was “supporting” his rival Marine Le Pen in France’s presidential election this month. “I take full responsibility for having spoken to the president of Russia, in the name of France, to avoid the war and to build a new architecture for peace in Europe several years ago,” he added. “I did it from the beginning of my term in office,” he said adding: “I was never naive, unlike others. I was never complicit, unlike others.” Macron has sought to target Le Pen’s links to Russia, stressing repeatedly how she had taken a loan from a Russian bank which her National Rally party is still repaying. Jessica Elgot and Jasper Jolly report: The Russian billionaire Moshe Kantor, who was sanctioned by the UK government on Wednesday, has long cultivated deep ties with British politicians and establishment figures, including Tony Blair and Prince Charles. With an estimated net worth of £3.48bn, Kantor is the largest shareholder in the fertiliser company Acron, which the Foreign Office said had vital strategic significance for the Russian government. But in Europe Kantor is best known as the holder of one of the Jewish community’s most high-profile roles, president of the European Jewish Congress (EJC), as well as his multitude of interests in Jewish charities, education and events. Born in Moscow and now a British citizen, Kantor, 68, has maintained close ties to Vladimir Putin, and has brought a number of delegations to meet the Russian president, according to Haaretz. In 2017, Putin bestowed Kantor with the Order of Honour “in recognition of his professional achievements and longstanding fair work”. The Kantor Centre, which the billionaire founded in Israel, has condemned Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. In 2015, Kantor appointed Tony Blair to a role tackling antisemitism as chairman of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation, an organisation funded and founded by Kantor. Blair is still listed as a chair of the organisation, along with the former Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz. Kantor is vice president of the Jewish Leadership Council and honorary life president of a school in Ilford, east London, Kantor King Solomon, jointly with The Apprentice tycoon Lord Alan Sugar. He also organised the World Holocaust Forum, which marked the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp, attended in Jerusalem by Prince Charles, Macron, then US vice-president Mike Pence and Putin. The Kantor Centre, which he founded at Tel Aviv University, issued a statement condemning the war in Ukraine as an “unprovoked invasion … and the cowardly war crimes committed under the directives of Vladimir Putin”. It said the Russian invasion was “fascist-style aggression” and added: “Putin has the blood of thousands of victims, including children, on his hands. His policies pose an existential threat to world democracy, peace and security.” The EJC said it was “deeply shocked and appalled by the decision” to impose sanctions on Kantor, adding: “Dr Kantor has been granted the most prestigious awards and honours from many European heads of state and government. We call for this decision to be reversed as soon as possible.” Read more: Here’s more context on how additional sanctions targeting the daughter of Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, will affect her, from the Washington Post’s Paul Sonne: Lavrov’s daughter, who was sanctioned by Treasury today, was born in the US, went to school at the private Dwight School in New York and graduated from Barnard. This will have a substantive impact on her life. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said today that the US will impose additional sanctions against the adult children of Russian president and other Russian officials, as well as their relatives. From Blinken’s Twitter account: We are implementing sanctions on two of the largest Russian financial institutions, designating the adult children of President Putin, the wife and adult child of Foreign Minister Lavrov, and 21 members of Russia’s National Security Council, including former President Medvedev. An update on the convoy of civilians leaving the besieged city of Mariupol: an International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) team has led a bus of more than 1,000 people to Zaporizhzhia. Earlier reports from today said the convoy was escorting more than 500 citizens, but a new report from Reuters updated the figure to over 1,000 people. A small number of Ukrainian soldiers received drone training in the US, said the Pentagon today, reported AFP. A small group of Ukrainian soldiers who were already in the United States before Russia’s invasion of their country are being trained to use the deadly Switchblade drones Washington is supplying to Kyiv, a Pentagon official said Wednesday. “A very small number of Ukrainians... were already here in the United States going through some professional military education,” the senior defense official said, requesting anonymity. “We took advantage of the opportunity to pull them aside for a couple of days and provide them some training, particularly on the Switchblade (drones) that is a system that is not organic to the Ukrainian military,” he said. The group, made up of “less than a dozen” people, “will be heading back into Ukraine relatively soon” as originally planned, he added... A total of 4,892 people have been evacuated from Ukraine today using humanitarian corridors, reports Reuters. In an online post, Ukraine deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that a total of 4,982 people had escaped from multiple Ukrainian cities, compared with 3,846 who were evacuated on Tuesday. The mayor of Mariupol said today that over 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, have been killed since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, reports the Associated Press. Today, Mariupol mayor Vadym Boichenko confirmed the amount of Mariupol civilians that have died since the start of Russia’s occupation. Boichenko noted that Russian forces bombed hospitals, including one where 50 people burned to death. Boichenko also said that more than 90% of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed due to Russian bombardments. The Russian military has besieged the port city, cutting off access to food, water and energy supplies while continually dropping artillery and air raids on the town. Read AP’s full story here. Shells and rockets were landing at regular intervals in the eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk today, reports AFP. According to AFP journalists who observed the bombardment, one building caught on fire during the bombing. Civilians who were outside quickly ran for cover as the shelling continued. “We have nowhere to go, it’s been like this for days,” said Volodymyr, 38, to AFP. Volodymyr was on the opposite side of the road to a burning building. Today, amid increased fighting, Ukraine warned civilians in the eastern parts of the country to leave the area “while the opportunity still exists”, citing a massive Russian military assault expected in the coming days. Ukraine deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said: It has to be done now, because later people will be under fire and face the threat of death. There is nothing they will be able to do about it ... It is necessary to evacuate as long as this possibility exists. For now, it still exists. US treasury secretary Janet Yellen said today that sanctions imposing a full ban on Russian oil would probably cause “skyrocketing” prices felt globally, reports Reuters. US treasury secretary Janet Yellen said on Wednesday that sanctions imposing a full ban on Russian oil exports would likely result in “skyrocketing” global prices that would hurt the United States and its democratic allies. Yellen told the US House financial services committee she hopes oil companies in the United States and elsewhere can ramp up production in the next six moths, enticed by higher prices, which may allow for tougher restrictions on Russian oil. French president Emmanuel Macron said today that the killings in the Ukrainian city of Bucha were “very probably a war crime” that deserved justice, Reuters has reported. During remarks today, Macron condemned the killings in Bucha, saying: It was very probably a war crime that was committed there. Macron also said that he was in favor of additional sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine and several western countries have accused Russian forces of killing hundreds of civilians in the town of Bucha during its occupation, an allegation that Russia denies. Ukraine cannot help evacuate residents in the eastern town of Izyum, which is currently under Russia control, reports Reuters. Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Sinegubov said today that Ukraine officials could not help people evacuate Izyum or send humanitarian aid to the town because it was completely under Russian control. Fighting in the eastern regions of Ukraine has escalated after Russia withdrew troops from around Kyiv, Reuters further reported. The parents of Trevor Reed, a US ex-marine who is jailed in Russia, said today that they are concerned “something terrible” has happened to their son, reports Reuters. Reed’s parents say that they have not received any updates on him in the past five days, despite his “rapidly declining health.” A statement from Reed’s parents read, in part: It has now been five days without any updates at all on Trevor’s rapidly declining health and with each passing hour, we are more and more worried that something terrible has happened. On Monday, Russian news agencies reported that Reed had ended a hunger strike that he had begun to protest against being put in solitary confinement and not receiving proper treatment for a possible tuberculosis diagnosis. Russian media also reported that Reed was being treated at the prison’s medical facility. Today, Reed’s parents said that they had not been able to confirm if Reed was actually taken to the medical facility or even ended his hunger strike. They said further that they had no confirmation that Reed was receiving “any real medical care as Russian officials have claimed”. The FBI said today that it had stopped a cyber-attack conducted by Russian military hackers, reports Reuters. The FBI said that it had seized control of thousands of firewalls and routers that were hijacked by Russian hackers taking over the same infrastructure that Russian spies were using to communicate with the stolen devices. Reuters further reported: An unsealed redacted affidavit described the unusual operation as a pre-emptive move to stop Russian hackers from mobilizing the compromised devices into a “botnet,” a network of hacked computers that can bombard other servers with rogue traffic. “Fortunately, we were able to disrupt this botnet before it could be used,” U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said. The British politician George Galloway has threatened legal action against Twitter after the social media website flagged his account as “Russia state-affiliated media”. He had been regular fixture on the Russia Today news channel for many years. He wrote: Dear @TwitterSupport I am not “Russian State Affiliated media”. I work for NO #Russian media. I have 400,000 followers. I’m the leader of a British political party and spent nearly 30 years in the British parliament. If you do not remove this designation I will take legal action. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. My colleague Gloria Oladipo will be along shortly to take over from me. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed that a Ukrainian fuel storage base was destroyed by Russian missiles in the Kharkiv region, the RIA news agency quoted it as saying. The Russian forces also destroyed some Ukrainian military equipment and foreign weapons at a railway station in the same region, RIA reported, citing the ministry. Poland has arrested two citizens of Belarus on charges of spying for Minsk, which could carry a 10-year prison sentence if they are found guilty, a regional prosecutor’s office said on Wednesday. Tensions have been running high between the neighbours over a migrant crisis that the European Union and Poland say was engineered by Belarus, a charge Minsk denies. The EU also accuses Minsk of supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported. “...the suspects heard charges of espionage on behalf of the Belarus intelligence services,” a regional prosecutor’s office in Poznan, west Poland, said in a statement “They are suspected, among others, of conducting reconnaissance of military and civilian facilities of critical importance for the defense of the Republic of Poland,” the statement also said. Both were arrested for three months and are facing up to 10 years in prison. Russian artillery fire killed at least four people and wounded four others at a humanitarian aid distribution point on Wednesday as Moscow’s forces bombarded towns, cities and rail infrastructure in eastern Ukraine, local officials said. Authorities in the eastern region of Luhansk urged civilians to evacuate “while it is safe”, warning that Russian bombardments could cut off escape routes, Reuters reported. Later, Ukrainian Railways reported there were a number of casualties after three rockets hit an unspecified rail station in the east, without giving further details. Ukraine says Russian troops that invaded on Feb. 24 are regrouping and preparing for a new offensive in the Donbas area, which includes both the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Donetsk Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko shared online photos from the town of Vuhledar, where he said Russian artillery fire had struck a humanitarian aid distribution point. The photos showed two women stretched out on the ground. Another person had a serious leg wound and a fourth was shown with a bloodied leg, being helped into a rescue vehicle. “The enemy cynically fired on civilians from Vuhledar, who had come to receive humanitarian aid. As a result of the shelling there are 4 dead and 4 wounded,” Kyrylenko wrote in a later post, updating the death toll from an earlier estimate of two killed. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has said he plans to appeal to his counterparts from G7 and Nato nations to fulfil Ukraine’s request for sufficient weapons to counter Russian forces. Speaking in a video address, Kuleba said he was meeting the other foreign ministers on Thursday, Reuters reported. “The main topic of my discussion in Brussels will be the supply of all necessary weapons to Ukraine,” he said. It’s been a big day for fresh sanctions on Russia, as countries responded to harrowing reports and images of civilian killings in Bucha earlier in the week, and sought to cripple Vladimir Putin’s economy. The US unveiled sanctions which target Russian banks and elites, and include a ban on any American from investing in Russia as well as sanctions on Putin’s adult daughters. The UK also announced fresh sanctions, including collaborating with the US on asset freezes against Russian banks and banning all new outward investment to Russia. In the morning, the EU also announced a wide-ranging package of sanctions, including import bans on coal and transaction bans on banks. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán gave a press conference in which he said he had offered to broker talks with Putin aimed at leading towards a ceasefire, while stopping short of agreeing to extend EU sanctions against Russia’s oil and gas shipments. Russia’s military has now shifted its focus to the east of the Ukraine, with authorities in Luhansk and Donetsk warning that civilians should leave as quickly as possible. There were reports of burning buildings in Luhansk following Russian shelling, with casualties unknown; while five were killed in Donetsk, according to the governor; and Ukrainian railways reported rocket fire on a railway station in the east of the country, which resulted in casualties, though gave no further detail on the location or number of victims. Kyiv reported 89 deaths since the start of the conflict. Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an impassioned speech to Ireland’s parliament, in which he urged the country to pile extra pressure on EU nations to introduce tougher sanctions, accusing European countries of worrying excessively about the economic consequences. Western officials said Russia’s retreat from around Kyiv and the north east of the country is now “largely complete” and that it will take “at least a week” before reconstituted units could move to Donbas. Thanks for tuning in today, I’m handing over to my colleague Tom Ambrose who will keep you updated on any further developments. State-owned Ukrainian Railways has said there have been a number of casualties after three rockets hit a rail station in eastern Ukraine, damaging buildings, tracks and rail stock. The statement provides no further detail on the number of victims or the location of the attack. The governor of Donetsk has said at least five people were killed by shelling today, as Russia shifts it focus to the east of Ukraine. Lithuanian Olympian Rūta Meilutytė has swum through a red blood-like pond located in front of the Russian embassy in Vilnius in protest at the conflict. The pond, which was temporarily coloured with eco-friendly dye, is intended to symbolise Russia’s responsibility for committing war crimes against Ukrainians, while the act of swimming communicates the need for continuous effort to fight through. US prosecutors are working with their European and Ukrainian counterparts to help collect evidence of possible Russian war crimes in Ukraine. US attorney general Merrick Garland said that justice department officials met with their counterparts at Europol and Eurojust this week to develop a plan to work together and are separately helping a top Ukrainian prosecutor with evidence collection as well. “Today, we are assisting international efforts to identify and hold accountable those responsible for atrocities in Ukraine,” Garland added. “And we will continue to do so.” Meanwhile, a US defence official has said that the killings in Bucha appear to be “deliberate and premeditated”. Here’s some insight from western officials obtained by the Guardian’s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh: Western officials believe that Russia’s retreat from around Kyiv and the north east of the country is now “largely complete” and that it will take “at least a week” before reconstituted units could go to Donbas and perhaps longer given how many losses they have suffered in the war so far. The officials believe that the Kremlin wants to see some kind of victory in the eastern Donbas region in time for Russia’s traditional Victory Day parade on 9 May, an important date in the country’s military calendar. One official said that Putin will want to have an “announceable success” by then, which could create “some tension” with Russian commanders as to “what they want to do in the military terms”. This means that exhausted Russian forces are likely to be thrown into battle fairly soon in an attempt to gain ground in the east. The belief is that Russia will prioritise capturing the entirety of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, or seek to create a land bridge to Crimea or both, with Russia “reshaping its narrative” so it can redefine its idea of victory. Ukraine’s military, however, have so far been unable to reinforce their own forces in the Donbas either “partly because they’re still trying to secure those areas from which they’ve sort of repulsed Russian forces” in the north and north east - and also because they need to defend against any surprise Russian re-offensive against Kyiv, one official said. Revised estimates suggest that 29 of Russia’s battalion tactical groups, the smallest operating unit of its forces, are now “combat ineffective” from an invading force that is estimated at some 125 battalions, around 75% of Russia’s total army. There is also growing western concern about “genocidal propaganda” emerging from Moscow following a recent RIA Novesti Kremlin news agency article that called for Ukrainian society to be “cleansed of Nazi elements” and statements from former president Dmitri Medvedev who said that Ukrainian activists had been “praying to the Third Reich”. A Western official said “those sorts of comments are really creating an even more toxic information environment” and could “absolutely contribute” to Russian soldiers committing more war crimes in Ukraine. “Responsibility for this, of course lies with the perpetrators of the acts, but it also lies with the Russian leadership,” the official added. Here’s the Guardian’s full report on the new sanctions imposed by the US and its allies on Moscow over civilian killings in Ukraine, as the west makes a fresh attempt to strangle Vladimir Putin’s economy and war effort. The UK is co-ordinating with the US on asset freezes against Sberbank and Credit Bank of Moscow, and has banned all new outward investment to Russia and committed to end all imports of Russian coal and oil by the end of the year, with gas to follow as soon as possible. Imports of Russian iron and steel products will be banned and a further eight oligarchs have also been added to the sanctions list. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said the package was “some of our toughest sanctions yet”. She added: Our latest wave of measures will bring an end to the UK’s imports of Russian energy and sanction yet more individuals and businesses, decimating Putin’s war machine. Together with our allies, we are showing the Russian elite that they cannot wash their hands of the atrocities committed on Putin’s orders. We will not rest until Ukraine prevails. Russian largest lender Sberbank has responded to the latest wave of US sanctions, stating that it would not significantly affect the bank’s operations. A statement read: The sanctions will not have a significant impact on the bank’s operations and will not affect service to Russians as the system has already adapted to the previous restrictions. Joe Biden has spelled out in a tweet that the latest US sanctions are linked to atrocities in Bucha. The US is imposing sanctions on Putin’s daughters and Russia’s Sberbank as part of a new package of measures announced today. The measures target Russian banks and elites, and include a ban on any American from investing in Russia. Reuters reports: The new sanctions will put full blocking sanctions in Russia’s Sberbank, which holds one-third of Russia’s total banking assets, and Alfabank, a senior US official told reporters. Energy transactions were blocked from these sanctions, the official said. The United States was also imposing sanctions on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin’s adult daughters, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov’s wife and daughter, and members of Russia’s security council, the official said. Americans were banned from investing in Russia, the official said, including through venture capital or mergers. The US was “dramatically escalating” the financial shock on Russia by cutting off that country’s largest banks, the official said. Russians might be forced back into Soviet-style living standards from the 1980s, the official said. Ukraine’s human rights ombudswoman has said that more than 400 residents are missing in the town of Hostomel after a 35-day occupation by Russian forces, and she quoted witnesses as saying some of them had been killed. Ombudswoman Lyudmyla Denisova did not say how many people may have been killed in Hostomel, near the capital Kyiv, and cited no direct evidence for her assertion. She did not say who the witnesses were or provide any other details. Russian forces seized Hostomel, which is close to an airfield, soon after invading Ukraine on 24 February. The Guardian’s Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin, has a report from Viktor Orbán’s press conference: Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has said his country would have “no difficulty” in paying for Russian gas in roubles and will do so if Moscow asks. The statement undermines EU unity on Russia, after Germany and Italy, other big EU consumers of Russian gas, refused Vladimir Putin’s request to pay for gas shipments in roubles. Germany found a workaround that would allow it to pay for gas in euros, which would then be converted into roubles by Russia’s Gazprombank. Orbán was speaking at a press conference, days after a resounding victory in an election that independent monitors said was characterised by media bias, a blurring between party and state and opaque campaign finance. Orbán also said he had invited Putin for peace talks in Hungary to be attended by the leaders of Ukraine, France and Germany. The Russian president was one of the first leaders to congratulate Orbán on his victory, which was also welcomed by the far-right leaders Marine Le Pen, Matteo Salvini and the former US president Donald Trump. Hungary’s government did not refer to Putin in a list of leaders said to have congratulated Orbán published on an international website on Wednesday. Budapest has supported EU sanctions and condemned Russia’s war, but Hungary’s refusal to aid Ukraine with weapons, as well as virulent anti-Ukrainian rhetoric in state-controlled media, has angered allies. On Wednesday Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, announced that he was summoning Ukraine’s ambassador, a move that usually indicates a diplomatic dressing down. “It’s time for Ukrainian leaders to stop insulting Hungary and to take note of the will of the Hungarian people,” said Szijjártó, who was awarded a medal of friendship from Vladimir Putin. In recent weeks Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused Orbán of siding with the Kremlin and ignoring the humanitarian catastrophe being suffered by residents of Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities. Helena Smith, the Guardian’s Athens correspondent, reports on the reaction to the Greek government decision to expel Russian diplomats: The Russian embassy has reacted with fury to the Greek government’s decision to expel 12 of its diplomats after declaring them “personae non-gratae”. Joining the growing list of EU capitals to eject Russian embassy personnel, Athens invoked the Vienna convention on diplomatic and consular relations as it announced the move earlier today. In a statement, the Russian embassy described the decision as a step that would further undermine bilateral relations between the two Orthodox Christian nations. “We have strongly protested against this unjustified and hostile step which aims to further destroy our bilateral relations,” it said, noting that the Russian ambassador to Greece, Andrey Maslov, had been summoned to Athens’ foreign ministry to be informed of the decision. “We have made clear that this action will not be without consequences.” Greek-Russian ties have been jolted as never before by the war over Ukraine with the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, not only making clear that Athens has sided wholeheartedly with Kyiv but declaring that this is no time for neutrality. “There can be no neutrality,” he told Greek MPs recently, “either one favours international law or one is against.” Greece’s centre-right administration has dispatched humanitarian and military assistance to Ukraine despite the majority of Greeks telling pollsters they believe Athens should stay out of the conflict. Ukraine is home to a large ethnic Greek community with the diaspora numbering around 150,000 people in the besieged city of Mariupol alone. Mitsotakis, like his foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, has said that protection of the community and Greece’s obligations as an EU member state will take precedence over diplomatic ties with a regime in Moscow that has so flagrantly violated international law by invading Ukraine. There’s more detail on Reuters about Viktor Orbán’s press conference, including that he asked Vladimir Putin to announce an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine. Orbán, a conservative nationalist and one of the few European leaders to have good relations with Putin, said he was called by Putin, and proposed talks in Budapest around an immediate ceasefire, as peace talks would take a longer time. He said: The response was positive but the Russian president said this had conditions. I cannot negotiate to meet those conditions - it should be him and the Ukrainian president agreeing on those.” “This is a war that the Russians started, they attacked Ukraine, and it’s aggression, this is the joint stance of the European Union and Hungary shares that stance.” However, Orbán, under whom Hungary has cultivated close business ties with Putin’s Russia, has opposed any EU sanctions on Russian oil and gas or Western arms shipments through Hungarian territory to Ukraine. A spokesperson for Russia’s foreign ministry has accused Ukraine of using images of dead bodies strewn across the Ukrainian town of Bucha, which Russia says were staged, to justify more sanctions against Moscow and derail peace talks with Kyiv. Ukraine has accused the Russian military of massacring residents of Bucha, an area outside the capital Kyiv which Russian troops had occupied for several weeks before withdrawing. Western countries have called for those responsible for the murder of civilians to be punished. Reuters is carrying a little extra detail from Viktor Orbán’s press conference here which could be significant for the future. The Hungarian prime minister, fresh from winning his fourth consecutive election, told reporters Hungary must strengthen its alliance with Poland as it is a strategic alliance within the European Union. Crucially, in response to a question about a disciplinary procedure flagged by the European Commission yesterday, Orban said Hungary would wait to see the EU’s letter, but “will not give in” to pressure to support an expansion of sanctions against Russia to oil and gas shipments, as that was a “red line” for Hungary. The European Commission said yesterday is was launching a rule-of-law disciplinary procedure against Hungary. First of all, this war must end now, and President Putin end it by withdrawing its troops and forces, and under stop attacking independent sovereign countries like Ukraine and sit down in in good faith and to find a political solution. But at the same time, we have to be realistic and and realise that this may last for a long time, for many months, or even years. I also believe that, regardless of when the war ends, this has long term implications for our security. Because we have seen the brutality. We have seen the willingness by President Putin to use military force to reach his objectives. The invasion of Ukraine was a wake up call. But that happened in 2014. So we have actually, since 2014, implemented the biggest reinforcements of our collective defence. So, Nato was actually quite well prepared when Russia invaded Ukraine for the second time, and on the day of the invasion, we activated our defence plans and deployed thousands of additional troops in the eastern part of the alliance. Our graphics team have produced this updated map of the latest situation on the ground in Ukraine. One of the topics of the Nato meeting is a “New Strategic Concept”. Secretary general of Nato Jens Stoltenberg explained that it would “address the new security reality we are faced with.” He told reporters: The strategic concept will be the roadmap for Nato. How to address a more dangerous world, and how to make sure that we continue to protect and defend all Nato allies. In the strategic concept, we need to address the security consequences of Russia’s aggressive actions, the shifting global balance of power, the security consequences of a much stronger China, and the challenges Russia and China are imposing together to a rules based international order of democratic values. We will set out the strategy for how to deal with cyber, hybrid, and terrorism, and also the security consequences of climate change. A quick summary of what secretary general of Nato Jens Stoltenberg has had to say so far. He told reporters that Nato had supported Ukraine over many months, with both training and equipment, which has been making a real difference on the ground. He said: Since the invasion, Allies have stepped up their support. I also expected ministers, when they meet today and tomorrow, will discuss how we can further support Ukraine. Allies are providing both anti-tank, anti-air or air defence systems, but also different kinds of advanced weapon systems. and also both light and heavier weapon systems to Ukraine. He went on to say that he did not want to detail “exactly what kind of weapons equipment Allies are providing”, but that “the totality is significant.” Secretary general Jens Stoltenberg is making a statement before Nato’s meeting today. There is a live stream available at the top of the blog. You may need to refresh the page and then press play for it to start. Sir Mark Lyall Grant, former UK national security adviser and former UK permanent representative to the UN, said he expected “pledges of more military support” to come. PA Media quotes him telling BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme that there was a “balance” to be struck between military support for Ukraine which helps them in the fight against this Russian invasion and not giving Putin an excuse to escalate the conflict even further.” “I think we will see pledges of more military support of the sort of anti-tank weapons, perhaps also some anti-ship missiles, which haven’t so far reached the theatre, and also surface-to-air missiles. “When it comes to tanks and fighter aircraft ... Nato has so far been very reticent, but now that the Czech Republic appears to be deciding to send Russian-made tanks into the theatre, there may be some other Nato members who will press to do that as well.” Nato member the Netherlands has sent four F-35 warplanes to Nato ally Bulgaria to help with its air-policing tasks. but not directly to Ukraine. [see 13:31] Lyall Grant added “Certainly, the evidence of war crimes and human rights abuses that have been uncovered in recent days has raised the level of outrage in the West and definitely increased the willingness to consider further supplies of weapons. “If Ukraine is now going to go on the offensive to try and take back territory that’s being occupied by Russia in the east of the country, they are going to need slightly different type of weapons.” This is Martin Belam in London, taking over the blog for the next half-hour or so. The 193-member UN general assembly will vote on Thursday whether to suspend Russia from the Geneva-based UN human rights council. Reuters reports that diplomats have said that the US is pushing for the vote. A two-thirds majority of voting general assembly members in New York can suspend a country for committing gross and systematic violations of human rights. Russia is in its second year of a three-year term on the 47-member human rights council. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, says he has talked with Vladimir Putin at length and asked him to apply a ceasefire in Ukraine. Orbán told a news conference that earlier on Wednesday he had invited Putin for peace talks in Hungary, to be held with the Ukrainian and French presidents as well as the German chancellor. He said that Putin’s response was “positive” but that the Russian president said this would have conditions. The Netherlands has sent four F-35 warplanes to Nato ally Bulgaria to help with its air-policing tasks amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the defence ministry has said. Reuters reports: The Dutch warplanes, along with Bulgarian MiG-29 fighter jets, will help protect the airspace of the Black Sea country until 31 May, in line with Nato’s integrated plan for air and anti-missile defence. They will replace four Spanish fighter jets that have been supporting airspace surveillance of Bulgaria since the middle of February. Bulgaria, on Nato’s eastern flank, is also setting up a battlegroup of up to 1,000 troops in close cooperation with the alliance. Germany can only supply arms to Ukraine that the country’s army will know how to use, German chancellor Olaf Scholz has said. He told lawmakers in the Bundestag lower house of parliament: These are very old inventories that were used by the NVA [the army of former communist East Germany], which have the advantage that they can be used particularly well in Ukraine because they have experience with this equipment. We have to supply equipment that can be used. The governor of the eastern region of Luhansk has said that 10 high-rise buildings are on fire in the town of Sievierodonetsk after Russian shelling, with no information yet on casualties. This morning, authorities in eastern Ukraine urged civilians to evacuate, warning that Russian bombardments could cut off escape routes as forces increase attacks on the Donbas area. Sievierodonetsk is the temporary headquarters of the regional authorities as Luhansk city has been controlled by Russia-backed separatists since 2014. The US Department of Justice is set to outline new enforcement actions “to disrupt and prosecute criminal Russian activity” later today. Top justice officials, including the attorney general, Merrick Garland, and the FBI director, Christopher Wray, would discuss the action at 10am (1500 BST), the department said in a statement. New sanctions were announced earlier today by the United States and its allies against Russian banks and officials. They also planned a ban on new investment in Russia, the White House said, after officials in Washington and Kyiv accused Moscow of committing war crimes in the Ukrainian town of Bucha. The European Union has given €35bn (£29.1bn) to Vladimir Putin for energy supplies since the start of his war and €1bn to fund Ukraine’s defence, the union’s top diplomat said. Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said: We have to continue arming Ukraine. We need less rounds of applause and more assistance. The EU has pledged €1bn in military aid for Ukraine, he said, which “might seem a lot” but “€1bn is what we pay Putin every day for the energy he provides us. Since the beginning of the war we have given him €35bn. Compare that to the €1bn we have given to Ukraine in arms and weapons.” Here’s a roundup on all the key events from day 42 of the Russian invasion from reporters Samantha Lock and Martin Belam: Eighty-nine people, including four children, have been killed in Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, according to the city council. In a statement, the council said a further 398 people had been wounded and 167 residential buildings damaged by Russian strikes. The statement read: It has become safer in Kyiv, but the threat of airstrikes remains. Russia denies targeting civilians. The sight of tied bodies shot at close range in the Ukrainian streets of Bucha do not “look far short of genocide”, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has said. The deaths in Bucha, outside Kyiv, have triggered a global outcry and pledges of further sanctions against Russia from the west. Johnson told reporters: I’m afraid when you look at what’s happening in Bucha, the revelations that we are seeing from what Putin has done in Ukraine, which doesn’t look far short of genocide to me, it is no wonder that people are responding in the way that they are. And I have no doubt that the international community - Britain very much in the front rank - will be moving again in lockstep to impose more sanctions and more penalties on Vladimir Putin’s regime. Norway has expelled three Russian diplomats, the Norwegian foreign ministry says. An International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) team has led a convoy of buses and private cars carrying more than 500 people to Zaporizhzhia after the civilians fled the besieged Ukrainian town of Mariupol on their own. “This convoy’s arrival to Zaporizhzhia is a huge relief for hundreds of people who have suffered immensely and are now in a safer location. It’s clear, though, that thousands more civilians trapped inside Mariupol need safe passage out and aid to come in,” Pascal Hundt, the ICRC’s head of delegation in Ukraine, said in a statement. The convoy that the ICRC led left Berdiansk on Tuesday and reached Zaporizhzhia on Wednesday. The ICRC team had tried over the course of five days and four nights to reach Mariupol, and came within 20 kilometres of the city, but security conditions on the ground made it impossible to enter. The ICRC will continue facilitate the safe passage of civilians from Mariupol and other cities, provided there are security guarantees and conditions. Here’s a summary of the new sanctions announced by the European Union this morning: An import ban on coal from Russia, worth €4bn a year, intended to cut an important revenue source for Russia. A full transaction ban on four key Russian banks, among them VTB, the second largest Russian bank, intended to weaken Russia’s financial system. The four banks will be totally cut off from the markets and represent 23% of the Russian banking sector. A ban on Russian vessels and Russian-operated vessels from accessing EU ports and on Russian and Belarusian road transport operators, limiting options for Russia to obtain key goods. There are exemptions for essentials, such as agricultural and food products, humanitarian aid as well as energy. Targeted export bans, worth €10bn, in areas in which Russia is vulnerable such as quantum computers, advanced semiconductors, sensitive machinery and transportation equipment. This is intended to degrade Russia’s technological base and industrial capacity. Specific new import bans, worth €5.5bn, to cut access to funds for Russia and its oligarchs, on products from wood to cement, from seafood to liquor. Several targeted measures, such as an EU-wide ban on Russian companies obtaining contracts through public procurement and an exclusion of all financial support to Russian public bodies. Sanctions against key high-profile individuals. The EU is working on possible additional sanctions, including on oil imports, taxes or specific payment channels such as an escrow account. The Kremlin has said that peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv are not progressing as rapidly or energetically as it would like. Speaking to reporters on a conference call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said work on setting up a new round of talks was under way but that there remained a long road ahead to achieve any progress. He added that Russia has all the resources needed to service its debt and there are no grounds to default. Ukraine’s state emergency services has shared images of a woman who was rescued from debris after a military strike in the town of Rubizhne, in Luhansk region this morning. In his address to the Irish parliament, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ireland has not remained neutral over the disaster Russia has inflicted on his country. He said: You did not doubt starting helping us, you began doing this right away and, although you are a neutral country, you have not remained neutral to the disaster and to the mishaps that Russia has brought to Ukraine.” He said he is grateful to every citizen of Ireland and for the country’s support of sanctions against Russia, and urged Ireland’s political leaders to use their influence to convince other EU nations to introduce even tougher sanctions to halt the Russian war machine. Zelensky went on to say that he cannot tolerate indecisiveness in sanctions against Russia. Today, when the whole world knows about the crimes against our people, we still have to convince even some of the European companies to abandon Russian markets, we still have to convince Russia of foreign politicians that we need to cut any ties of global banks of Russian banks with the global financial system. We still have to convince Europe that Russian oil cannot feed Russian military machinery with new sources of funding.” Zelensky told those gathered that Russia is using hunger as a weapon in its war against his country. They are destroying things that are sustaining livelihoods to people. They also have blocked all of our sea ports, together with the vessels that had already agricultural cargos for exports. “Ukraine is one of the leading food-supplying country in the world with exports. This is not just about the deficit and the threat of hunger. “There will be a shortage of food and the prices will go up, and this is reality for the millions of people who are hungry, and it will be more difficult for them to feed their families.” Zelensky also said that Russia needs to be held responsible for everything it has done in Ukraine. He said that in 42 days of war at least 167 children have been killed. They were targeting even churches and shelters that they knew for sure that there is nobody but women and children, and this is a fact. “The country which is doing this is not doesn’t deserve to be in the circle of the civil countries.” Speaking after the historic address, Irish premier Micheal Martin said he is certain that Ukraine will prevail in its war with Russia. We are a militarily neutral country. However, we are not politically neutral in the face of war crimes. Quite the opposite. “Our position is informed by the principles that drive our foreign policy - support for international human rights, for humanitarian law and for a rules-based international order. We are not neutral when Russia disregards all of these principles. We are with Ukraine. “Ukraine’s political, economic and humanitarian needs are now manifold and pressing. “Our efforts, as a friend and as a partner of Ukraine, are aimed at using all the levers at our disposal to bring a just end to this war; applying international pressure on Russia; pursuing accountability for violations of international law; and meeting the humanitarian needs of those caught now in the midst of this terrible and immoral war.” Rachel Hall here taking over the blog for the day. Please send over anything ideas for coverage, or things we’ve missed, to rachel.hall@theguardian.com. The governor of Ukraine’s Donetsk region said at least two civilians were killed and five wounded today when Russian artillery fire struck a humanitarian aid distribution point in the town of Vuhledar. The governor of Russia’s Kursk region has claimed that border guards were fired on from Ukraine yesterday. Ukraine’s military has claimed to have no knowledge of the alleged incident. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said that eleven humanitarian corridors have been agreed in total for Wednesday. Luhansk region governor Serhiy Gaidai told civilians to “evacuate while it is safe”. Russian soldiers have committed sexual violence against Ukrainian women and men, children and elderly people,” Ukraine’s prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova has alleged. Pope Francis has condemned what he called “the massacre of Bucha” and held up a Ukrainian flag sent from the town at his weekly audience in the Vatican’s auditorium. He described the war on Ukraine as “cruelty that is increasingly horrendous”. The United States and its allies are preparing to impose new sanctions on Moscow over civilian killings in Ukraine as the west makes a fresh attempt to cripple Vladimir Putin’s economy and war effort. Ukraine’s minister for foreign affairs, Dmytro Kuleba, has commented on the latest tranche of EU sanctions on Russia, saying that he appreciates the strengthening of the package. However, he called on his European neighbours to go further. saying “difficult times require difficult decisions”. Putin ally Dmitry Medvedev has said Russia will fight Western attempts to expropriate Russian property overseas with lawsuits. Hungary’s foreign ministry has summoned Ukraine’s ambassador over what it called his offensive statements on Hungary’s stance regarding the war. The European Council president, Charles Michel, has said European Union countries should think about ways to offer asylum to Russian soldiers willing to desert Ukraine battlefields. The UK’s foreign secretary Liz Truss has announced the country is to donate some NHS ambulances to Ukraine. A driver has died after ramming his car into the gate of the Russian embassy in Bucharest early on Wednesday, police in the Romanian capital said in a statement. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. Rachel Hall will be with you shortly.

The governor of Ukraine’s Donetsk region said at least two civilians were killed and five wounded today when Russian artillery fire struck a humanitarian aid distribution point in the town of Vuhledar. Reuters report Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko shared graphic photos online of the aftermath of the alleged attack. Russia continues to deny targeting civilians. The European Council president, Charles Michel, has said European Union countries should think about ways to offer asylum to Russian soldiers willing to desert Ukraine battlefields. During an address to the the European parliament, Michel expressed his “outrage at crimes against humanity, against innocent civilians in Bucha and in many other cities”, then called on Russian soldiers to disobey orders. Associated Press quotes him saying: “If you want no part in killing your Ukrainian brothers and sisters, if you don’t want to be a criminal, drop your arms, stop fighting, leave the battlefield.” Endorsing an idea previously circulated by some EU lawmakers, Michel added that granting asylum to Russian deserters is “a valuable idea that should be pursued”. US authorities are allowing Ukrainian refugees to enter the country at its border with Mexico in Tijuana, with permission to remain in the country on humanitarian parole for one year. Here are some photographs taken yesterday of the refugees who are there, and the makeshift encampment they are waiting in. Two new lines on European diplomacy here, via Reuters. Firstly, Greece has announced it is joining the growing list of European countries who have expelled Russian diplomats. The Greek foreign ministry’s general secretary has informed the Russian ambassador that 12 diplomats have been declared “personae non-gratae” because the host nation says they were not acting in accordance with international rules. At the same time, the Russian deputy foreign minister Alexander Grushko has insisted that Russia wants to maintain diplomatic relations with western countries despite the series of expulsions. The Interfax news agency cites him saying European countries disrupting the work of Russian diplomats were damaging their own interests. Pope Francis has condemned what he called “the massacre of Bucha” and held up a Ukrainian flag sent from the town at his weekly audience in the Vatican’s auditorium. Reuters quotes him saying: Recent news from the war in Ukraine, instead of bringing relief and hope, brought new atrocities, such as the massacre of Bucha. Cruelty that is increasingly horrendous, even against civilians, defenceless women and children. They are victims whose innocent blood cries out up to heaven and implores: ‘Stop this war! Let the weapons fall silent! Stop sowing death and destruction’. Yesterday, precisely from Bucha, they brought me this flag. It comes from the war, precisely from that martyred city, Bucha The Pope then distributed some chocolate Easter Eggs to children who had fled Ukraine, saying “These children had to flee in order to arrive in a safe land. This is the fruit of war. Let’s not forget them and let’s not forget the Ukrainian people.” Russia has repeatedly denied that any massacre took place in Bucha, offering various different explanations for the images and video that has emerged, describing them as a staged “provocation”. We reported earlier an accusation that Russian border guards had been fired upon in the Kursk region on the border with Ukraine. The area is to the north-east of Sumy. [see 7.32am] Reuters is carrying a little more detail of the alleged incident now, with a quote from Kursk’s governor, Roman Starovoit. He said “Yesterday, on 5 April, they tried to fire mortars at the position of our border guards in the Sudzhansky district. Russian border guards returned fire... There were no casualties or damage on our side.” Starovoit said regional officials were in touch with the defence ministry and urged citizens to remain calm. In separate comments to the RIA news agency, he said the mortars fired at the Sudzha border crossing did not reach Russian territory. Ukraine’s military told Reuters “We do not have such information.” Neither Russia or Ukraine’s claims have been independently verified. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has added a little to its earlier analysis of the latest situation on the ground in Ukraine. They say that heavy fighting and Russian airstrikes have continued in the encircled city of Mariupol, adding: The humanitarian situation in the city is worsening. Most of the 160,000 remaining residents have no light, communication, medicine, heat or water. Russian forces have prevented humanitarian access, likely to pressure defenders to surrender. We’ve recieved some images from the area around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which at one point was occupied by Russian forces. The area is now once again under Ukrainian control, and these photographs were taken yesterday. The UK’s foreign secretary Liz Truss has just announced that the UK is to donate some NHS ambulances to Ukraine. A joint statement from the foreign office and the department of health in the UK says: The donation of around 20 NHS ambulances will help bring vital lifesaving care to Ukrainians remaining in towns and cities under attack from Russian bombardments. This donation will help replace those Ukrainian ambulances lost to Russian attacks, bolstering the existing fleet’s resilience as the barbaric war goes on. Truss is quoted as saying “The UK has been among the biggest aid donors, providing food, medicines and generators to help those affected. These world class NHS ambulances will now help bring lifesaving care directly to those injured in the conflict.” In the statement, health secretary Sajid Javid adds “The invasion has damaged key medical infrastructure and the generous donation of four ambulances by South Central Ambulance Service will ensure people in Ukraine can receive urgent care. It marks the first of many ambulances the UK government and the NHS is donating to Ukraine in the coming days.” Following on from that theme of some sections of the US political media using Kremlin propaganda lines, the actor Sean Penn has been very vocal about the situation in Ukraine and was in the country filming earlier this year, and met Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy before the Russian invasion. Last night in the US he was on MSNBC talking about the war, a clip of which has gone viral on social media Penn had two main points – firstly about his certainty that Ukraine will win out in the war, in part because of national unity. He said: To be in Ukraine, and to feel despite many political differences, you know, just like anywhere ugly positions on things, but not on this. Not on being able to determine their own dreams. They look at each other and they say we’re together. It’s a horrible moment in so many ways, but it’s an exciting moment in history, to follow the lead of the Ukrainians, because they are proof of theory. They’re going to win this thing because they’re together. And what they’re gonna win is otherwise impossible to win. And it’s a certainty. He also said that the feeling from the people he experienced in Ukraine gave him pause to reflect on the disunity among Americans, and he had a challenge for the US political class, which was: When we look back on it, what role will we have played in diminishing the death, the maiming, the rapes, the destruction of this country that’s going to have so many demands of reconstruction? This is in my lifetime … what I would say … they are offering us the greatest opportunity we’ve ever had to be the America we’ve always wanted to be. And we’ve got to figure out what we’re going to do to support them in doing that. False and conspiratorial narratives pushed by some American conservative politicians and media figures about Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine have bolstered and created synergies with the Kremlin’s legendary disinformation machine, experts on information manipulation say. Led by Tucker Carlson at Fox News, a few Republican rightwingers in Congress, and some key conservative activists, a spate of comments that have disparaged Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and echoed other Russian war disinformation have been recycled by Moscow, say experts. A feedback loop between the Kremlin and parts of the American right has been palpable since the war’s start in February. The influential figure of Carlson has pushed several false narratives to millions of Fox News viewers that have been eagerly embraced and recycled by Moscow and parts of the American right. Last month, for example, Carlson touted rightwing conspiracies that attempted to link Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, to a discredited allegation that the US financed bioweapons labs in Ukraine. On a separate front, two Republican congressional conservatives, Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene, delighted Moscow last month by condemning Zelenskiy without evidence in conspiracy-ridden terms that sparked some bipartisan criticism. Cawthorn called Zelenskiy a “thug” and his government “incredibly corrupt”, while Greene similarly charged that Zelenskiy was “corrupt”. Read more of Peter Stone’s piece here: US right wing in step with Kremlin over Ukraine disinformation, experts say Also on the topic of “humanitarian corridors”, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said that eleven have been agreed in total for Wednesday, according to a report from Reuters. She said, however, that those seeking to leave Mariupol will have to use their own vehicles. Earlier this week an agreed International Committee of the Red Cross mission to evacuate people from Mariupol was halted and turned back by Russian forces. Authorities in the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk hope to evacuate civilians through five “humanitarian corridors” on Wednesday and urged residents to get out “while it is safe.” Ukraine has said Russian troops are regrouping and preparing for a new offensive in the Donbas area, which includes Luhansk. “We will take everyone out if the Russians allow us to get to the meeting places (for evacuation). Because, as you can see, they don’t always observe ceasefires,” the Luhansk region governor, Serhiy Gaidai, wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “I appeal to every resident of the Luhansk region - evacuate while it is safe ... While there are buses and trains - take this opportunity. “ Reuters reports Gaidai said rail connections in the Donetsk region of Donbas had been damaged this week and took several hours to repair. “This is another alarm bell,” he said. Gaidai said separately in a video address that Russian forces had not managed to break through Ukrainian defences in his region but were destroying “everything in their path” and would “stop at nothing.” Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians, although the mayor of Kyiv yesterday claimed that he had been informed that at least 5,000 civilians had been killed in the southern city of Mariupol. A few little inter-linked pieces of news have just broken. The Dutch government has said it is currently preventing 14 yachts from leaving the country due to sanctions on Russia, including 12 that were under construction for Russian owners. Reuters reports that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the statement in a letter to parliament, updating lawmakers on the enforcement of sanctions. At the same time, long-term ally of Vladimir Putin and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has been talking. Medvedev has said that Russia will fight Western attempts to expropriate Russian property overseas with lawsuits. He likened attempts to seize Russian business assets abroad to thievery, and said they would be fought in courts in the US and Europe. Those quotes broke on the wires while Peter Kyle, the UK opposition spokesperson on Northern Ireland for the Labour party, was being interviewed on Sky News. Put to him, he said “They can try what they want” but that Medvedev’s words were “an admission that sanctions against them are working. Our sanctions have been wide and far, far reaching, and the Labour party wants the sanctions to go further.” The Wall Street Journal is carrying a report that a new tranche of European Union sanctions will target the daughters of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Laurence Norman and Ann M. Simmons write: The European Union has proposed sanctioning two daughters of President Vladimir Putin, according to diplomats familiar with the plan, a move that would add the Russian leader’s closest family members to a growing list of individuals sanctioned in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Putin doesn’t speak publicly about his family. He has two daughters with his former wife, Lyudmila Putina, according to the Kremlin. It isn’t known if Putin has other children, and it couldn’t be learned if the daughters being targeted in the EU sanctions were those he has publicly acknowledged. Richard Dannatt, who was Chief of the General Staff in the British army from 2006 to 2009, has been appearing on Sky News in the UK. On the images that have emerged from Ukraine, he said “I think the war crimes are stacking up to the point that it looks like a concerted effort to reduce the Ukrainian population. That is getting very close to the definition of genocide. It is absolutely right and proper that all these war crimes are being chronicled, evidence is been gathered.” Citing his own experience of testifying at a war crimes trial he said “If you think back to the early dark days of the Bosnian Civil War, it seemed inconceivable that Milosevic, Karadzic and Mladic would find their way into court. But they did. This is looking to me increasingly like genocide that is plotted from the top and the top therefore must bear responsibility.” On the Donetsk region he said “this is a difficult one” and a “huge dilemma” for Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In pushing for a peace deal, Dannatt asked “Is he going to insist that every square kilometre of Ukrainian soil remains Ukrainian soil? Or is he going to have to accept reality on the ground?” He felt Odesa was more straightforward, and that Ukraine must retain their major port. He suggested in the longer term that a third peacekeeping force might be required in Ukraine – although not a Nato-badged one as that would be unacceptable to the Russians. Russia’s state-owned domestic news agency RIA Novosti is reporting claims that Russian border guards have been fired on in the Kursk region bordering Ukraine. The region is to the north-east of Ukraine’s Sumy region. The Guardian has not independently verified the claims. The UK’s health secretary Sajid Javid has been appearing on Sky News in the UK. Asked about the images coming out of Ukraine he said: I think it strengthens the resolve of all of us. What we’re seeing unfolding now in Ukraine is absolutely appalling. These atrocities we now sadly seen almost daily on our TV screens, and the image you just talked of [a child with her mothers’s contact details written on her back], when I first saw that image, I think yesterday, it could have been my daughter. It could be anyone’s daughter, their son. Just to think that’s what parents are having to do in Ukraine right now because of the choice that Putin has made. And we should never forget this as a choice. This was not a a war for any other reason, it is something that Vladimir Putin has just chosen to do. And we will continue to help Ukraine in every way that we can, whether that’s military support, or sanctions on Russia, and humanitarian support. Javid did not go as far as to suggest that the UK would be pursuing regime change in Russia. He said it “is ultimately up to the Russian people about the leadership of their country.” Hungary’s foreign ministry has summoned Ukraine’s ambassador over what it called his offensive statements on Hungary’s stance regarding the war, foreign minister Peter Szijjarto has said. Reuters quotes a statement saying “It is time for Ukrainian leaders to stop their insults directed at Hungary and acknowledge the will of the Hungarian people.” At the weekend Viktor Orbán won his fourth consecutive election in Hungary, and then included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the list of enemies he said he had “over-powered”. Orbán dismissed Zelenskiy as “an actor who uses and works with the knowledge he has acquired”, and said he would not comply with any demands that would lead to “our sons dying in someone else’s war” and the “ruination” of Hungary’s economy. Zelenskiy has not called for western forces to enter the ground war. However, he responded to Orbán’s words by suggesting that the Hungarian leader would have to choose between Moscow and the “other world”, and that the Hungarian leader feared Russian influence. This is Martin Belam taking over the blog in London now from Samantha Lock. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine today can be seen in the gallery below. Burned buildings marked with bullets holes and shrapnel fragments show the evidence of a brutal battle that occurred in Borodyanka, a town near Kyiv. A man walks past a disarmed missile in the street while abandoned weapons lie discarded just outside town. A driver has died after ramming his car into the gate of the Russian embassy in Bucharest early on Wednesday, police in the Romanian capital said in a statement. A video recorded before firefighters arrived showed the front of the car in flames as it remained wedged in the gate, Reuters is reporting. It was unclear whether the crash was an accident or deliberate. During recent weeks, several Russian embassies elsewhere in Europe have been targeted by protesters angered by the invasion of Ukraine. Police said they were investigating and did not release the identity of the driver. Romania said on Tuesday it would expel 10 Russian diplomats who are not acting in accordance with international rules, joining other European countries to have done so in recent days. Zelenskiy questioned the ability of the UN Security Council to provide security, undermining the very functions for which it was created during his Tuesday night national address. The UN Security Council exists, and security in the world doesn’t. For anyone. This definitely means that the United Nations is currently unable to carry out the functions for which it was created. And only one state is to blame for this - Russia, which discredits the UN and all other international institutions where it still participates. Well, not exactly participates... Tries to block everything constructive and use global architecture in order to spread lies and justify the evil it does. I’m sure the world sees it. I hope the world will draw conclusions. Otherwise there will be only one institution left in the world to guarantee the security of states. Namely - weapons. In an interview with Ukrainian media, Zelenskiy said it is necessary to ensure his nation is able to defend itself from Russia in the years ahead and spoke of the importance of concrete security guarantees. Even if we sign the most powerful agreement, we understand that in two years Russia may return. And if you and I accept this, then we act accordingly,” he said. Referring to concrete security guarantees, Zelenskiy said everything would depend on the guarantor countries to ensure implementation. All this is being discussed at the level of advisers and leaders with France, the United States, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, Israel, and there are many friends who want to join. So far, we have not received a specific list of guarantees and a list of countries that are ready to join us 100%. We do not need to have 40 countries of the world that are ready to join and fight for Ukraine under the agreement. We need serious players who are ready for anything. We need a circle of states that are ready to provide any weapons within 24 hours. We need individual countries on which sanctions policy really depends, so that these sanctions are deeply elaborated in advance. So that in the first second when we feel the threat from the Russian Federation, these states will unite and within three days introduce everything at once, block everything.” Speaking of Nato, he added: If we are offered to join Nato tomorrow, if they don’t play with our lives again, but seriously offer, we will join. But this will not happen, unfortunately, and did not happen. That is why we will build those security guarantees that can protect us, protect people’s lives.” Twitter earlier announced it is introducing new measures against Russian government accounts to reduce the impact of official propaganda on the social network. The official accounts will no longer be “recommended” to Twitter users across all categories of the app, including in searches, the platform said in a statement. The California company, like its rival Meta, parent company of Facebook and Instagram, had already blocked the accounts of the Russian state-run media RT and Sputnik in the European Union. Moscow responded by restricting access to Twitter in the country, and blocking Facebook and Instagram. We will not amplify or recommend government accounts belonging to states that limit access to free information and are engaged in armed interstate conflict - whether Twitter is blocked in that country or not,” Twitter said in a statement. When a government blocks or limits access to online services within their state, undercutting the public’s voice and ability to freely access information, but continues to use online services for their own communications, a severe information imbalance is created.” Britain is to send surplus NHS ambulances to Ukraine to replace vehicles destroyed in Russian attacks, the government has said. The foreign office said NHS trusts are expected to donate around 20 ambulances, with the first vehicles due to arrive in the country this week, according to a report from PA Media. They include four ambulances being provided by the South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust. Foreign secretary Liz Truss said: “The UK has been among the biggest aid donors, providing food, medicines and generators to help those affected. “These world class NHS ambulances will now help bring lifesaving care directly to those injured in the conflict.” Earlier, prime minister Boris Johnson urged Russian citizens not to fall for Vladimir Putin’s propaganda, and to circumvent tough internet censorship rules by installing technology to discover the full extent of war crimes committed during the invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is set to make an historic address to the Irish Parliament later today. Addressing nations’ representatives, including those from Russia, he accused Vladimir Putin’s forces of creating “mass starvation” and shooting and raping civilians. Irish foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney said he expects Zelenskiy to “emphasise the brutality” of the conflict when he addresses the Dail and Seanad in a joint sitting on Wednesday, PA Media reports. “Certainly, my conversation with the Ukrainian foreign minister earlier this week was a very sobering and difficult conversation,” he said. Coveney also said that the government would keep further expulsions of Russian officials from Ireland under consideration, but added that keeping diplomatic efforts open was “important”. Zelenskiy has addressed a number of national parliaments, including the House of Commons last month, as well as the US Congress, and last week spoke virtually at the Grammy Awards. While Russian forces have been advancing further into the centre of the city of Mariupol, Ukrainian forces are still in control of some areas and have forced Russian troops out of towns in the north. The United States and its allies are preparing to impose new sanctions on Moscow over civilian killings in Ukraine as the west makes a fresh attempt to cripple Vladimir Putin’s economy and war effort. Western sanctions on Russia over its nearly six-week invasion of its neighbour gained new impetus this week after bodies of civilians shot at close range were discovered in the town of Bucha, after a retreat by Russian forces. The White House said sanctions to be unveiled on Wednesday were in part a response to Bucha. The measures, coordinated between Washington, G7 economies and the European Union, will target Russian banks and officials and ban new investment in Russia. “The goal is to force them to make a choice,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. “The biggest part of our objective here is to deplete the resources that Putin has to continue his war against Ukraine.” Proposed EU sanctions, which the bloc’s 27 member states must approve, would ban buying Russian coal and prevent Russian ships from entering EU ports. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said the bloc was also working on banning oil imports. Europe, which obtains about a third of its natural gas from Russia, has been wary of the economic impact a total ban on Russian energy would bring. But signalling strengthening EU resolve, Germany’s foreign minister said the coal ban was the first step toward an embargo on all Russian fossil fuel imports. Renewed pressure from the west comes after Zelenskiy gave the UN security council a harrowing account of atrocities in his country and demanded that Russian leaders be “brought to justice for war crimes”. The Wall Street Journal is also reporting that Washington is considering additional sanctions against Putin’s two daughters and Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank. The United States will provide an additional $100 million in security assistance to Ukraine, including anti-armour systems, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday. Russian soldiers have committed sexual violence against Ukrainian women and men, children and elderly people,” Ukraine’s prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova alleged in a seperate statement. But the victims are silent about it. It’s their choice. And it’s clear: fear, pain, despair, total disbelief to all,” she added. Specifically, Venediktova referenced reported atrocities committed in Bucha. “Bucha was released from the occupiers, but the consequences of their atrocities will have to be recovered for a long time: civilians were killed in the streets, cars were shot, torturers in basements,” she said. Venediktova said prosecutors are currently investigating the “horrifying fact of torturing, killing and attempting burning of bodies of six civilians in Bucha,” she added to Twitter on Tuesday. “The occupiers tried to burn the bodies of six tortured and killed civilians in Bucha,” she said, adding that prosecutors together with Kyiv Region police officers found a torture chamber in the town of Bucha in the basement of a children’s sanatorium. Ukraine’s prosecutor’s office said in a statement on Tuesday: During the occupation of the city of Bucha, soldiers of the Russian Federation armed forces, violating international humanitarian law standards, killed civilians and set fire to their bodies in order to hide the crime. During the investigation, it was found that the bodies of the dead have traces of violent death and torture. The prosecutors of the Bucha district and Kyiv region prosecutor’s office work on the site together with police employees. Measures are being taken to determine all circumstances of the crime. The pre-trial investigation is underway.” The Buchanian District Prosecutor’s Office has initiated criminal proceedings, the office confirmed. In the basement of one of the children’s sanatoriums, law enforcement officers discovered the bodies of five men with their hands tied. Soldiers of the Russian Federation armed forces tortured unarmed civilians and then killed them. Prosecutors and police officers work at the scene of the crime. All measures are taken to determine the circumstances of every war crime and person involved in the Russian aggression in order to bring them to justice.” All over the Kyiv region, investigative and operative groups are investigating crime scenes across various districts, Venediktova said. “More than 50 national police staff and prosecutors are now involved to conduct first-ever investigations in the territory of Buchansky district alone,” she said in a statement earlier this week. Similar work is also reportedly being developed in all liberated towns in the Kyiv and Chernihiv region, with investigators collaborating with the local population to talk with witnesses, victims and gather photos and video evidence, Venediktova added, “It takes time and a professional approach to record everything correctly and not lose any chance to find and punish the guilty,” she said. Ukrainian prosecutors say they are investigating 4,684 alleged Russian war crimes after the horror of recent atrocities committed in the Ukrainian town of Bucha came to light, prompting global revulsion and a raft of crippling new sanctions against Russia. According to figures released by the prosecutors office, a total of 4,468 potential war crimes were listed as under investigation as of Tuesday with the figure growing by hundreds every day. An estimated 167 children have also died as a consequence of Russia’s invasion, the agency added. Ukraine’s prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova described the recently liberated towns surrounding Kyiv as a “tortured region from hell” and vowed to “punish the inhumans who set it up on our land” at a press briefing held from Bucha on Tuesday. “Russia will be responsible for Bucha in The Hague,” she added in a statement published later in the day. “Prosecutors and investigators are already examining the area [Kyiv region] and documenting crimes, so that every perpetrator of these atrocities are brought to justice both in national and international courts,” she said. Ukraine’s prosecutors office has said pre-trial investigations have begun across the country, including in the regions of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv, Donetsk and Luhansk. “We are collecting evidence for the national courts and the International Criminal Court in the Hague. Evidence is no longer just war crimes, but crimes against humanity. And we will prove every fact to punish those who tortured, mocked and destroyed Ukrainians,” Venediktova said. The latest UK ministry of defence intelligence report is in, claiming that heavy fighting and air strikes continue in the encircled city of Mariupol. “The humanitarian situation is worsening,” the ministry added. Most of the 16,000 remaining residents have no light, communication, medicine, heat or water. Russian forces have prevented humanitarian access, likely to pressure defenders to surrender.” In an earlier report, the ministry said the bodies of Ukrainian civilians lay on a street in Bucha for at least ten days before the town was reclaimed from Russian forces. Citing an analysis of satellite imagery dated 21 March 2022, the ministry said at least 8 bodies were identified lying in a street in Bucha, about 30km north-west of the capital Kyiv. Bucha was occupied by the Russian armed forces until 31 March 2022. It’s Samantha Lock back with you as we continue to cover the unfolding atrocities occurring in Ukraine. Some content may be sensitive or disturbing for readers so we advise some caution in following our live blog today. Here is where the crisis currently stands: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has given the UN security council a harrowing account of atrocities in his country and demanded Russian leaders “be brought to justice for war crimes”. Zelenskiy called for an international tribunal similar to the Nuremberg trials of Nazis after the second world war, speaking of Russian forces: “There is not a single crime that they would not commit there.” Atrocities in the Ukrainian town of Bucha are “only one of many examples of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for the past 41 days,” Zelenskiy said, adding that there were many more that the world had yet to learn the full truth about. “Russia wants to turn Ukraine into silent slaves,” he said. Ukrainian prosecutors say they are investigating nearly 5,000 alleged Russian war crimes after the horror of recent atrocities committed in the Ukrainian town of Bucha came to light, prompting global revulsion and a raft of crippling new sanctions against Russia. According to figures released by the prosecutors office, a total of 4,468 potential war crimes were listed as under investigation as of Tuesday with the figure growing by hundreds every day. An estimated 165 children have also died as a consequence of Russia’s invasion, the agency added. The Ukraine president also questioned the ability of the UN security council to provide security. “The UN Security Council exists, and security in the world doesn’t. For anyone,” he said in his nightly address. “Now Kyiv is the capital of global democracy, the capital of the struggle for freedom for all on the European continent.” The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said he will “never forget the horrifying images of civilians killed” in Bucha. Speaking at the UN security council in New York, he said the war in Ukraine is “one of the greatest challenges ever” to the “international order”. The UN undersecretary general for political and peacebuilding affairs, Rosemary DiCarlo, said allegations of sexual violence perpetrated by Russian forces include “gang-rape and rapes in front of children”. The Ukrainian human rights ombudswoman, Lyudmyla Denisova, said between 150 and 300 bodies may be in a mass grave by a church in the town of Bucha. She did not say how the authorities had reached the estimate. Satellite imagery of one Bucha street published by Maxar Technologies from 19 and 21 March appears to show several bodies in exactly the same position as in video footage and photos taken this weekend in the same street.The UK’s ministry of defence said eight bodies had lain on the street for at least ten days before the town was reclaimed from Russian forces. Displaced residents of Bucha should not yet return to their homes because there are still mines in the area after Russian troops withdrew from the town, its mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said. Fedoruk said about 3,700 civilians had stayed in Bucha, which had a pre-war population of about 37,000, throughout the Russian occupation. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the evidence from Bucha shows “a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities” by Russian forces. “The reports are more than credible. The evidence is there for the world to see,” he told reporters. The UN human rights office spokesperson, Liz Throssell, said all the signs from Bucha pointed towards civilians having been directly targeted and killed. At the UN security council, India condemned the killing of civilians in the Bucha and called for an independent investigation. Israel also condemned Russia’s “war crimes” in Ukraine in a statement. The Kremlin said allegations that Russian forces committed war crimes by executing civilians in Bucha were a “monstrous forgery” aimed at “denigrating” the Russian army. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that remarks by US president Joe Biden calling for Russian president Vladimir Putin to be tried for war crimes were unacceptable and unworthy of a US leader. On a visit to Trostianets, a town close to the Russian border, the Guardian found evidence of summary executions, torture and systematic looting during the month of occupation. Yuriy Bova, the mayor of Trostianets, said it was too early to give a reliable estimate of how many civilians the Russians had killed, saying it was: “definitely more than 50, but probably not hundreds”. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Nato and G7 foreign ministers meeting on Wednesday and Thursday will discuss the delivery of advanced weapons to Ukraine. Ammunition, medical supplies and “high-end” weapons systems would also be discussed, he added. The US and its allies are planning more sanctions on Russia with the objective to “deplete the resources that Putin has to continue his war against Ukraine,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. The new penalties will include a ban on all new investment in Russia and greater sanctions on its financial institutions and state-owned enterprises. Separately, the US Treasury Department moved to block any Russian government debt payments with US dollars from accounts at US financial institutions, making it harder for Russia to meet its financial obligations. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, announced that the EU is also proposing new sanctions against Russia, including an import ban on coal worth €4bn (£3.3bn) per year. The package will include a full transaction ban on four key Russian banks, a ban on Russian vessels and Russian-operated vessels accessing EU ports, as well as targeted export and import bans. US Army Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the United States should look at the development of more bases in eastern Europe to protect against Russian aggression, but rotate forces through them rather than make permanent deployments. Milley suggested the conflict would extend beyond Ukraine and continue for “at least” years. The United States will provide an additional $100 million in security assistance to Ukraine, including anti-armour systems, secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Tuesday. The US is also providing Ukraine with life-saving protective equipment that could be deployed if Russia were to use chemical and biological weapons, a Biden administration official added. The Czech Republic also joined other nations in directly supplying Ukraine with offensive weapons, reportedly becoming the first EU country to do so since Russia invaded in February. Almost two hundred Russian diplomatic staff have been expelled from European countries this week in a direct expression of governments’ outrage at the killings of Ukrainian civilians. In what amounts to one of the biggest diplomatic breakdowns of recent years, 206 Russian diplomats and embassy staff have been told since Monday they are no longer welcome to stay by governments in Italy, France, Germany and elsewhere. British prime minister Boris Johnson urged Russian citizens not to fall for Putin’s propaganda, and to circumvent tough internet censorship rules by installing technology to discover the full extent of war crimes committed during the invasion of Ukraine. Twitter announced it is introducing new measures against Russian government accounts to reduce the impact of official propaganda on the social network."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-should-the-18bn-nuclear-power-station-be-built","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-28T13:45:50Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C: should the £18bn nuclear power station be built?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-should-the-18bn-nuclear-power-station-be-built","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-should-the-18bn-nuclear-power-station-be-built","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C: should the £18bn nuclear power station be built?","bodyText":"If EDF decides to go ahead with the construction of an £18bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset it would be controversial. A debate has raged about the merits of the project for a decade, with the following some of the key arguments for and against. For Britain needs to keep the lights on Hinkley Point C will be the first nuclear power station to be built in Britain for a generation. It will provide 7% of the country’s electricity for almost 60 years, helping to ensure that the UK produces enough energy to meet its needs. A better option than fossil fuels The government wants to phase out polluting coal by 2025, with nuclear offering a lower-carbon option that produces enough electricity to fill the gap created by closing existing plants. Construction is privately funded The £18bn cost of Hinkley Point C is being borne by EDF, which is 85% owned by the French government, and China General Nuclear Power Corporation, which has agreed to take a 33% stake in the project. Furthermore, the project is expected to create 25,000 jobs in the UK. Against Cost to consumers Although EDF and China are funding construction, UK households will subsidise their work through the price they pay for electricity. The government has agreed a strike price - a guaranteed price for the electricity generated by Hinkley Point - of £92.50 per megawatt hour. This is significantly above wholesale electricity prices and most renewable energy sources, where costs are falling thanks to new technology. Safety and environmental impact The 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster led to Japan and Germany announcing that they would shut down all of their nuclear reactors. Japan has subsequently restarted some, but Germany still plans to close all its plants permanently by 2022. Concerns remain about how to deal with nuclear waste, and France’s nuclear safety authority has found weaknesses in a reactor EDF is building in Flamanville, which is the same design as Hinkley Point C. Delays and cost overruns In 2007, EDF’s chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz, said Britons would be cooking its Christmas turkeys on new nuclear power by 2017. Hinkley Point C, however, is now not expected to be completed before 2025. Even that deadline and the £18bn budget could be optimistic. EDF’s project in Flamanville is more than three times over budget and years behind schedule. EDF’s workers in France have campaigned for Hinkley Point C to be delayed or scrapped amid fears it could ruin the company’s finances."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/feb/07/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-07T12:18:16Z","webTitle":"Green New Deal: Ocasio-Cortez unveils bold plan to fight climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/07/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/feb/07/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-plan","fields":{"headline":"Green New Deal: Ocasio-Cortez unveils bold plan to fight climate change","bodyText":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is releasing a broad outline of a vision for the Green New Deal, a plan to battle economic and racial injustice while also fighting climate change. The new congresswoman’s blueprint, co-introduced by Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey, aims to develop a carbon-neutral economy in 10 years, which would require huge strides in reducing the US’s reliance on oil, gas and coal. It does not set a date for ending the use of fossil fuels. Specifically, the resolution says it is the duty of the federal government to craft a Green New Deal “to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions”. That includes getting all power from “clean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources”. The document also endorses universal healthcare, a jobs guarantee and free higher education – a huge shift in messaging from nearly a decade ago, when Democrats were advocating for a cap-and-trade system to limit greenhouse gases by allotting industry permits for pollution. Sixty members of the House and nine senators are co-sponsoring the resolution, including several presidential candidates, according to a fact sheet from congressional aides that did not include a list of supporters. However, any legislation would be dead-on-arrival with Republicans in control of the Senate and the White House, and would be difficult for Democrats to implement even if they controlled government. In supporting documents staffer acknowledge the investment required would be “massive”. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said a select committee on climate change, which she has announced the members of, will not be tasked with writing a specific bill and called the Green New Deal a “suggestion”. “It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive,” Pelosi said in an interview with Politico. “The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they’re for it right?” Discussions on what shape the plan would take also involved major environment, justice and labor organizations, as well as the youth-run Sunrise Movement. Backers hope the six-page resolution will push Democrats vying for the White House in 2020 not just to sign on to the general idea, but to lay out specific legislative goals. Some environmental groups, including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, said they were encouraged by the movement on climate change but that the resolution does not do enough to confront fossil fuels. The Sierra Club, however, welcomed the document. Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist from New York who has been in Congress for just over a month, centered her campaign on climate change and a Green New Deal. But the resolution itself focuses on the tenets of a progressive policy platform as much as it does on climate change. It is both a framework for a cleaner-energy future and a plan for a large-scale mobilization that would rival in scale and scope the progressive New Deal policies ushered in under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in response to the Great Depression. One of its goals is “to promote justice and equity by stopping current, preventing future, and repairing historic oppression of indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth”. The resolution says significant portions of the American population are suffering from declining life expectancy, exposure to pollution, and lacking access to healthy food, healthcare, housing, transportation and education. It spotlights wage stagnation, lacking socio-economic mobility, income inequality, a racial wealth divide, a gender pay gap and weakened bargaining power for workers. The resolution text comes as Donald Trump frequently questions the science that shows humans burning fossil fuels are causing temperatures to rise and exacerbate extreme weather. He did not mention climate change in his annual address to Congress this week, despite increasing warnings from scientists. Democrats, who hold a majority in the House, are trying to raise awareness of climate change as an impending crisis, with two committees holding hearings this week and a third to follow next week. But Republican lawmakers remain resistant to any legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Republicans in dual climate change hearings called by House Democrats yesterday attacked the as-yet unwritten Green New Deal, charging that it would be far too expensive and would worsen poverty. Ocasio-Cortez and her supporters say the strategy is designed to do the opposite – to create jobs in a green economy. Meanwhile, Trump’s agencies continue to roll back climate regulations enacted by the Obama administration. US carbon emissions increased last year, according to analysis by the economic firm Rhodium Group. Ocasio-Cortez elevated the Green New Deal when she joined activists at a protest outside the then minority leader Nancy Pelosi’s office last year. The activists are planning to protest at Democratic debates in an effort to ensure the proposal, which was until now largely a liberal rallying cry for action on climate change, is a prominent issue for the 2020 election. Before the text was released, several presidential candidates had already embraced the notion of a Green New Deal, including senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand. The former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro committed to the plan during his campaign announcement. The Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, who is the co-chair of the House progressive caucus and a sponsor of the legislation, said the resolution defined the scale and scope of what must be done to combat global warming. “We really need an urgent and comprehensive approach,” said Jayapal. Such legislation has little chance of becoming law as long as Republicans control the Senate and Trump is president. But Jayapal said Democrats would continue to lay the groundwork for a Green New Deal while pushing more incremental legislation. “This is a moment for us to push a comprehensive view of the challenge before us,” she said, “and therefore to offer the solution that we need to address that challenge.” The world has already warmed about 1C since the industrialization in the 19th century and is barreling toward exceeding a 1.5C increase, which climate scientists say will significantly worsen the risks of extreme heat, drought, floods and poverty. Already, the process for drafting the brief documents has outlined the fights ahead, even among progressives who want climate action. A background summary prepared by staffers said the plan “sets a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, at the end of this 10-year plan because we aren’t sure that we will be able to fully get rid of, for example, emissions from cows or air travel before then”. But climate justice advocates who represent the communities seeing the worst of environmental damages and pollution already want to quickly phase out all fossil fuels. Many also oppose nuclear power that uses mined uranium but represents a huge portion of the US’s zero-carbon energy. Angela Adrar, the executive director of the Climate Justice Alliance, a coalition of communities dealing with environmental problems, said her group supported the vision of the Green New Deal, even though members were concerned about what they saw as loopholes to allow some fossil fuels use."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2019/sep/04/trump-news-live-latest-updates-today-republicans-democrats-2020","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-05T04:13:55Z","webTitle":"'Fighting for the survival of planet Earth': Democrats tackle climate crisis in town hall – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/sep/04/trump-news-live-latest-updates-today-republicans-democrats-2020","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2019/sep/04/trump-news-live-latest-updates-today-republicans-democrats-2020","fields":{"headline":"'Fighting for the survival of planet Earth': Democrats tackle climate crisis in town hall – as it happened","bodyText":"Emily Holden’s wrap of the main developments at the town hall is now live here Thanks, everyone, for tuning in to our live coverage of the 2020 presidential candidate town hall on climate change. The Guardian’s Emily Holden will have a story coming shortly analyzing the major candidate’s performance and summarizing their views and policies. In other US politics news: The Carolinas are bracing for intense flooding as Hurricane Dorian slowly makes its way up the east coast. A watchdog report confirmed widely held suspicions that migrant children who were separated from their parents as part of Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy faced severe psychological repercussions. Trump is facing questions over whether he used a Sharpie to alter a map of Dorian’s projected path to include Alabama after the president falsely claimed the state would be “hit (much) harder than anticipated” in a Sunday tweet. House speaker Nancy Pelosi released a statement asserting that “Trump properties are a cesspool of corruption” and accusing the president of profiting off the presidency. Aaaaaand, that’s a wrap! Some memorable moments: Joe Biden, confronted about his plans to attend a fundraiser hosted by the founder of a natural gas company, argued the host is “not a fossil fuel executive.” Bernie Sanders, asked about his tweet calling Trump an idiot, said his wife disapproved but defended his words. He said Trump’s stance is “idiotic” and “dangerous”. Asked if he would reinstate light bulb standards Trump is scrapping, Sanders responded with: “DUUUHHHH”. Elizabeth Warren, who was also asked about whether the government should decide what light bulbs people use, exclaimed, “Oh come on, give me a break!” She said industries are more responsible for climate change than individuals and that systemic change is needed. Kamala Harris, asked about reducing meat consumption, professed her love: To be perfectly honest with you, I love cheeseburgers from time to time. I do. In contrast to fellow senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker supported the use of nuclear power. But he said, “absolutely, yes”, he would ban offshore drilling. “When they drill, they spill.” He also said he’d ban fracking on public lands, and, goaded on by a viewer shouting, “Do it, do it!” Booker said he’d phase out the export of fossil fuels. Here are all the 2020 democratic candidates who’ve participated in the town hall, once again: New Jersey senator Cory Booker Former Vice President Joe Biden South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar Former Texas representative Beto O’Rourke Vermont senator Bernie Sanders Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren Businessman Andrew Yang California senator Kamala Harris Former Housing and Urban Development secretary Julián Castro And Cory Booker is the 10th, and final, candidate to take the CNN town halls stage tonight! It’s all about “resiliency, resiliency, resiliency,” he said. Of course, Booker, who is vegan was asked about burgers. “Oh my gosh,” he said. “I hear about this all the time -- ‘Booker wants to take away your hamburger.’” He transitioned to talking about industrial farms, and practices that harm animals and people. He pointed to the example of farms that spray hog refuse over fields as fertilizer. “I watched how the stuff fell on the fields and then misted into the black communities” that live nearby, he said. “Let’s talk about healthy food systems and the toxins that are in our community... we need to especially be looking at communities that are low income and vulnerable” Like many of the candidates before him, O’Rourke was asked about meat consumption. Which means the debate questions can, more or less, be summed up as such: Oh my! It’s Beto O’Rourke’s time to shine. Asked about the hurricane in Puerto Rico, and the Trump administration’s response, he said: “It makes me angry... Fellow Americans were left in harm’s way.” He criticized Trump’s attempts to redirect money from FEMA to building a border wall. His plan would be to fund disaster mitigation grants, and “make sure that the people of Puerto Rico can determine their future”, he said. “Whether that’s independence, whether they want to remain a territory, or whether that is statehood.” He also addressed the issue retreat and rebuilding in areas — including in his state, Texas — that are prone to flooding. Americans should “rebuild where we can”, and “move where we must”, with government support, he said. O’Rourke also said he supports taking in more climate refugees from the Bahamas, Guatemala and elsewhere. “It’s the right thing to do,” he said. Bernie Sanders’ response to a question about curbing population growth has raised eyebrows. Sanders was asked if he would be “courageous enough to discuss curbing population growth” as a feature of his climate plan. He responded “Yes”, before quickly pivoting to women’s rights and access to birth control. “Especially in poor countries around the world where women do not necessarily want to have large numbers of babies”, he said, he supports access to family planning services. But Sanders stopped short of discouraging people to have babies if they want children. Buttigieg also addressed the issue of his own air travel and use of private planes. “I took the subway today,” he said. “Sometimes I fly, because this is a very big country and I’m running to be president of the whole country.” Air travel will always be necessary, he noted, but a solution might be to improve train systems. “I’m not even asking for Japanese level trains. I’m happy with Italian level trains,” he said, drawing a chuckle from the audience. And Pete Buttigieg has taken the stage. He said that tackling climate change “is the hardest thing we will have done in my life time as a country... on par with winning World War II.” “We have to unify the country,” around the issue, he said. “This is going to require action at every level of government and beyond government.” Fielding a question about environmental injustice, he brought up his Douglass plan for dealing with systemic racism. And asked what question he might pose to Donald Trump about climate change, Buttigieg initially responded, “Wow.” Trump is “completely in a different reality,” Buttigieg said, coming out strongly against climate change denial. But he added that to convince conservatives and Republicans to get on board, he’d use faith to frame the issue. “If you believe that God is watching as poison is being belched into the air,” he said. “What do you think God thinks of that. I bet he thinks, that’s messed up.” Back to the lightbulb question. “Do you think the government should be in the business of telling you what kind of lightbulb you can have,” asked CNN’s Chris Cuomo, noting that the less-efficient “candle-shaped” bulbs are a popular favorite. Warren’s response: “Oh come on, give me a break!” “There are a lot of ways that we try to change our energy consumption and our pollution,” she said. “Some of it is with lightbulbs, some of it is on straws, some of it -- dang -- is on cheeseburgers.” She pointed out that individual decisions to forgo incandescent lightbulbs or straws have a limited impact because industries, not individuals, are responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions contributing to global heating. Elizabeth Warren — asked what she would say if Trump called the Green New Deal a “dream” — quipped that what the president is doing now “is a nightmare.” In a high-energy interview, she questioned how the crisis has escalated for this long despite repeated warning from scientists, blaming government corruption. “We have a Washington that works great for the wealthy and well connected,” she said. “A Washington that is working great for giant oil companies who want to drill everywhere.” Washington is not working, however, for Americans, she said. Sanders reiterated climate change would be one of his first priorities. “I don’t know how any sane person cannot put it at the very top of the list,” he said. “We are fighting for the survival of planet earth.” He slammed Donald Trump, calling it “idiotic” and “dangerous” for Trump to deny climate change and refuse to act. He said his recent tweets called Trump an idiot were “maybe harsh,” but said, “he’s called me worse.” Hitting the third rail of climate policy, Sanders said he would make population growth —and a woman’s access to birth control — a key part of his climate plan. He also wants to spend tens of billions of dollars helping workers in the transition away from fossil fuels. He would guarantee them an income for five years, as well as job training. In a rather muscular opening salvo, Bernie Sanders has raised the specter of an uninhabitable planet if the US doesn’t move rapidly to address the climate crisis. “The damage to the world will be irreparable,” the Vermont senator said, adding that he was proposing “the largest, most comprehensive climate plan presented by any presidential candidate in the history of the United States.” Preempting questions on how he would pay for his $16 trillion climate plan, Sanders said he’d scrap tax breaks for fossil fuel companies and slash military spending. “Am I going to guarantee Jeff Bezos will pay no more in taxes?” he asked rhetorically. “No, I won’t.” Sanders said his plan, to radically ramp up renewable energy, would create 20 million jobs over a 15-year period. “We are dealing with an existential threat to this planet, we must respond aggressively,” he said. Bernie Sanders is now in the hot seat. When asked by CNN’s Anderson Cooper whether he’d reinstate the energy-saving lightbulb requirements that the Trump administration is rolling back, Sanders responded, “Duuuuhhhh.” Joe Biden said he’ll reconsider his fundraiser scheduled for tomorrow after being confronted with its host’s ties to the fossil fuel industry during the CNN town hall. Andrew Goldman is a co-founder of a natural gas company and has worked as an adviser for Biden in the past. “I didn’t realize he does that,” Biden said during the town hall. “I’m going to look at what you just told me and find out if that’s accurate.” Biden senior advisor Symone Sanders disputed Goldman’s characterization as a fossil fuel executive, tweeting: “Andrew Goldman isn’t a fossil fuel executive. He’s not involved in the day to day operation. He’s not on the board of the company, nor the board of the portfolio company.” Susan Davis will be stepping down from Congress after nearly two decades. Davis is the fourth democratic member of congress who has decided to either resign or run for a different office, joining 15 republican members who are leaving. In a letter to constituents, she wrote: “My decision today represents a desire to live and work “at home” in San Diego. I will continue to give my all for the next sixteen months and will work as earnestly and as enthusiastically as I have always tried to do.” Davis’ departure is unlikely to affect the balance of congress, even as the party scrambles to find a candidate to fill her seat. Her district leans heavily democratic. At the CNN climate change town hall, Joe Biden’s pitch appears to be that he’s got the experience to haul other countries into line on climate change — notably Brazil — while reestablishing US leadership in climate negotiations. “We should be organizing the world, demanding change, we need a diplomat-in-chief,” the former vice president said. “Look what’s happening now in the Amazon, what’s going on? Nothing.” Asked about the Green New Deal, the goal set out by progressive Democrats to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, Biden hedged slightly. The Green New Deal deserves “an enormous amount of credit” in bringing urgency to the climate crisis but lacks specifics, Biden said. “My plan brings more detail, it’s based on the science,” he said. Biden then reiterates his determination to prod other countries to do more. Meanwhile, #Sharpie is still trending: Biden was also asked about his plans tomorrow to attend a fundraiser hosted by a founder of a fossil fuel company. The Intercept has more background on Andrew Goldman and his natural gas production company Western LNG: Western’s major project is a floating production facility off the northern coast of British Columbia designed to provide Canadian gas to markets in northeast Asia. Goldman and Biden have deep ties: Goldman served as an adviser to Biden while he was in the Senate and was the northeast director of finance for Biden’s 2008 campaign. He’s also an executive at the investment banking firm Hildred Capital Partners. He and his partner at the firm, David Solomon, along with their wives Renee and Sarah, will host a private fundraiser for Biden at the Solomon house, CNBC reported. Goldman also co-founded De Cordova Goldman Capital Management, which invested in “natural resources and energy.” Back to the CNN town tall, where Joe Biden has taken the stage. Biden introduced the first Senate bill on climate change. But now, he’s facing tough questions about his policies. The first question for Biden centered on whether his plan is aggressive enough. He aims for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and spending of $1.7 trillion. Bernie Sanders, by comparison, would eliminate carbon emissions by 2050 and spend $16.3 trillion. Elizabeth Warren aims for a faster timeline and $10 trillion. Biden defended his proposal, saying it has received good marks from environmental organizations. (He has a B+ from Greenpeace.) But he said he would love to move faster if possible. He reminded that the US produces 15% of global emissions and that the rest of the world would need to follow suit, and he said he would push other nations to act. “The first thing I’d do as president of the United States is call a meeting of all the nations that signed onto the [Paris] accord in Washington, DC, to up the ante,” he said. House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office has released a statement alleging that Trump is violating the constitution by using his position to promote resorts and properties. The president is violating the emoluments clause of the constitution by encouraging foreign officials to stay at his properties, the statement says. And Trump is lining his own pockets with taxpayer money by insisting that he and other US officials stay at Trump properties, calling out Mike Pence’s choice to stay at Trump’s Irish golf club, despite the property being an hour-long flight to and from the vice president’s meetings in Dublin. Pelosi has so far resisted impeaching Trump despite mounting pressure from her fellow democrats. But her assertion that “Trump is violating the Constitution by making money off of his lavish, ritzy resort properties” is one of her strongest condemnations of the president yet. Klobuchar defended taking the gray wolf off the endangered species list, arguing that once a species’ numbers bounce back, “then you should allow them to be delisted. Otherwise, it doesn’t make sense.” In this thinking, she sides with Republicans who have been advocating for the gray wolf to be delisted. Populations dwindled to about 1,000 in the lower 48 states before receiving protection under the Endangered Species Act in 1975. Since then, wolves have rebounded to more than 5,000. The Obama administration also proposed removing the wolves’ endangered status, but federal courts blocked the move. The wolves have drawn ire from ranchers concerned with protecting their cattle and sheep, and from hunters who say the wolves have decimated game. But conservationists say the wolves are still vulnerable and serve an important purpose in keeping elk and other populations in check. “Let me get very clear, I am strongly in favor of the Endangered Species Act,” Klobuchar said — separating herself from Trump and other republicans who want to dismantle it altogether. Amy Klobuchar got questions on some of her controversial and less progressive climate proposals: allowing fracking for natural gas, supporting “safe” nuclear power and backing “cleaner” coal technology. The senator has doubted the feasibility of quickly phasing fossil fuels out of the economy. Tonight, she again avoided committing to a timeline for the US to function without them. In her written climate plan says she would aim for carbon-neutrality by 2050, but it’s unclear how she would get there based on her answers. Next up, we head into primetime interviews with Joe Biden at 8 EST, Bernie Sanders at 8:40 and Elizabeth Warren at 9:20. The Trump campaign is already using clips of Kamala Harris saying that plastic straws should be banned to promote their candidate... and to sell branded straws. More analysis from the CNN town hall, from The Guardian’s Emily Holden: Kamala Harris insisted the US can tackle climate change without forcing Americans to make major sacrifices — a claim likely to come under attack from conservatives. “Just to be perfectly honest with you, I love cheeseburgers from time to time. I do,” she said. She did, however, agree that nutritional guidelines for meat should consider impacts on the environment. Harris leaned on her record as a prosecutor, noting that she has sued ExxonMobil as the former attorney general of California. She also told a victim of the wildfire in Paradise, California — which destroyed his home — that he is a “real, living testament” of the devastation reaped by climate change. Harris would spend $10 trillion ongoing carbon neutral by 2045, putting her plan among the most aggressive. But Harris dodged a question about whether she agreed with Bernie Sanders that nuclear power--which is about half of carbon-free electricity in the US--should be phased out. Interviewer Erin Burnett, asked much broader questions than the first host, Wolf Blitzer. She also did not interrupt Harris’ answers or ask as many detailed follow-up questions. Candidate Andrew Yang, one of the few in politics who has discussed the idea of managed retreat defended his plan to move Americans living in low lying areas to higher ground during the CNN town hall. “There are already climate refugees in the United States of America, people that we relocated from an island that was essentially becoming uninhabitable in Louisiana and we moved those people,” he said. Yang drew criticism previously for talking about retreat in the context of humans being “too late” to stop climate change. Yang is perhaps the only candidate to include managed retreat, which experts say might be a necessary part of adapting to global heating, as part of his official policy. The Trump administration has announced new rules to roll back Bush-era requirements for energy-saving lightbulbs. From the New York Times: The Energy Department’s filing in the Federal Register will prevent new efficiency standards from going into effect on Jan. 1 under a law passed in 2007. The changes are likely to be challenged in court. “We will explore all options, including litigation, to stop this completely misguided and unlawful action,” said Noah Horowitz, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency Standards at the Natural Resources Defense Council, last week in anticipation of the move. The gradual shift toward more efficient light bulbs is one of the largely unsung success stories in the fight to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. “U.S. household energy consumption is down 6 percent since 2010, and this is due in part to the increase in the use of energy-efficient lighting,” said Lucas Davis, a professor in the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. ... Congress passed legislation to phase out inefficient incandescent and halogen bulbs in 2007, during the administration of President George W. Bush. The subpoena is related to Trump’s attempts to pardon officials at the border that violate the law in order to enforce his immigration policies. Trump denies that he’s made any such offer, but the House judiciary committee cites news reports, including one from the New York Times that Trump urged the current acting DHS secretary, Kevin McAleenan, to close the US-Mexico border regardless of legal challenges, and one from the Washington Post that Trump offered to pardon officials who disregarded environmental rules and laws against seizing private property to construct a border fence. “The dangling of pardons by the president to encourage government officials to violate federal law would constitute another reported example of the president’s disregard for the rule of law,” said the House judiciary committee leader, Jerrod Nadler, in a statement. The Democratic town hall on the climate crisis is off to a strong start, with questions from voters for Julian Castro on flooding risks, threats to the next generation and commitments to phase out fossil fuels. Castro received applause for his pitch for new civil rights legislation to address environmental injustice. Interviewer Wolf Blitzer has been pushing Castro to expand on his answers, a tactic that will be key to an engaging and probing discussion in the absence of an official debate. The Democratic National Committee has refused to allow that kind of single-issue debate. Here’s the full schedule: Julián Castro – 5pm, interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Andrew Yang – 5:40pm, interview with Blitzer Kamala Harris – 6:20pm, interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett Amy Klobuchar – 7pm, interview with Burnett Joe Biden – 8pm, interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper Bernie Sanders – 8:40pm, interview with Cooper Elizabeth Warren – 9:20pm, interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo Pete Buttigieg – 10pm, interview with Cuomo Beto O’Rourke – 10:40pm, interview with CNN’s Don Lemon Cory Booker – 11:20pm, interview with Lemon. The marathon, seven-hour CNN climate town hall has begun. First up, Julian Castro, who started with a shout out to the former candidate Jay Inslee “who did a fantastic job of bringing this issue to the forefront of this campaign”, Castro said. Stay tuned for updates and analysis from the town hall throughout the afternoon and evening. That’s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will be taking over the blog for the next few hours. Here’s where the day stands so far: The Carolinas are bracing for intense flooding as Hurricane Dorian slowly makes its way up the east coast. Follow our live coverage of the storm’s progress. Trump is facing questions over whether he used a Sharpie to alter a map of Dorian’s projected path to include Alabama after the president falsely claimed the state would be “hit (much) harder than anticipated” in a Sunday tweet. Britain’s Parliament passed a bill meant to avoid a no-deal Brexit, marking another significant loss for Boris Johnson. The prime minister also seems to have failed in his effort to call snap elections, as our UK politics live blog reports. A watchdog report confirmed widely held suspicions that migrant children who were separated from their parents as part of Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy faced severe psychological repercussions. More Democratic presidential candidates released their plans to confront the climate crisis in advance of tonight’s climate-focused town hall, which is starting now on CNN. The Guardian will be covering the climate town hall, and Maanvi will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is redirecting questions about the altered Hurricane Dorian map to the White House. But the White House seems to be avoiding the issue. The map, which appeared to be altered with a Sharpie to include Alabama in Dorian’s projected path, was shown by Trump during a hurricane briefing in the Oval Office. When asked later whether the map had been altered, Trump deflected the question and insisted that Alabama was a part of the forecast when he first tweeted his concern for the state on Sunday. As many fact checks have confirmed, that is not true. The AP reports: In fact, forecasts from overnight last Friday showed a small sliver of Alabama at the edge of the five-day cone of uncertainty. But by Saturday morning — more than 24 hours before Trump’s warning about Alabama — the storm was predicted to pose no threat to the state. Trump was getting multiple daily briefings about the storm. A list has emerged of the military construction projects that will be defunded to pay for Trump’s border wall. The list includes planned projects in 23 states and three territories. The defense secretary, Mark Esper, said in a letter to Congress that the $3.6 billion in diverted funding would be used to build 11 wall projects along the US-Mexico border. Justifying the funding change, Esper cited the national emergency Trump declared at the border in February. Democrats have unsurprisingly slammed the move as Trump’s blatantly political attempt to fulfill a key campaign promise at the cost of US service members. But more surprisingly, some Republican lawmakers have also voiced criticism of the plan, complaining that the diversion of funds would prevent their states from pursuing vitally important projects. Trump once again appeared noncommittal about tackling gun violence when lawmakers return to Capitol Hill next week. During a White House event on the opioid crisis, Trump said he was considering “many different concepts and many different things including mental health” to reduce gun violence. He went on to specifically voice support for building more mental institutions to “get these people off the streets.” But the American Psychological Statement said after last month’s shootings in Dayton and El Paso that blaming the mentally ill for gun violence is “unfounded and stigmatizing.” Mitch McConnell told radio host Hugh Hewitt yesterday that he would not take up any gun bill in the Senate without Trump’s explicit endorsement. With the president being so vague on his opinion, that seems unlikely. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign said the Democratic presidential candidate fully supports a national fracking ban, even though her newly released climate plan did not specify that. The comments from the Warren campaign came after Bernie Sanders issued a statement challenging all of his fellow presidential contenders to back a ban. All of the participants in tonight’s climate-focused CNN town hall will likely be asked about a potential fracking ban. The town hall begins in just under an hour, at 5 p.m. E.T., and the blog will be covering the event. Trump said he did not know if a Hurricane Dorian map he showed in the Oval Office had been altered with a Sharpie. While receiving a hurricane briefing this afternoon, Trump presented a map of the storm’s projected path, but the map appeared to be edited with a Sharpie to include Alabama. Trump falsely claimed this weekend that Alabama was at risk of being hit by Dorian, and he repeated the assertion even after it was refuted by the National Weather Service. But the president seems unwilling to let go of the false information. Greg Craig, a former White House counsel to Barack Obama, was acquitted on a felony false-statement charge in a case that grew out of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. The Wall Street Journal has more: The jury acquitted Mr. Craig, who served as a top counselor to two Democratic presidents and a secretary of state, after a day of closed-door deliberations at a courthouse in downtown Washington, D.C. The acquittal lifts a pall over Mr. Craig’s otherwise distinguished career at the upper echelons of law and politics, and represents a major setback for the Justice Department, which sought to make an example of Mr. Craig as it ramped up its enforcement of the laws governing work on behalf of foreign governments. The charge against Mr. Craig stemmed from legal work Mr. Craig performed for the government of Ukraine in 2012. He and his then-law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP were hired to write an independent report for the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice evaluating the fairness of the trial of an opposition politician. ... The investigation into Mr. Craig grew out of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and was referred to federal prosecutors in Washington. Trump claimed he had “no involvement” with Mike Pence choosing to stay at his Irish golf club, despite the property being an hour-long flight to and from the vice president’s meetings in Dublin. “Well, I had no involvement other than it’s a great place,” Trump said. “People like my product. What can I tell you?” But Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, previously said that president had made a “suggestion” that the vice president stay at the Doonbeg club. The comment immediately sparked concerns that the president was trying to profit off the official trip. The British House of Commons has passed a bill meant to prevent a no-deal Brexit, marking another significant loss for Boris Johnson. But Johnson reiterated his commitment to leaving the European Union by Oct. 31, calling for elections to be held on Oct. 15. “I think it’s very sad that MPs have voted like this,” Johnson said. “I think it’s a great dereliction of their duty.” For the latest on the debate, follow the Guardian’s UK politics live blog. A new Wisconsin poll found that Trump was either trailing or tied with all of the Democratic front-runners in hypothetical match-ups. According to the well-respected Marquette Law School poll, Joe Biden leads Trump by nine points in the crucial battleground state. Bernie Sanders bests Trump by four points, while Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris are tied with the president. The poll could ring alarm bells in Trump’s camp. The president’s 2016 victory was charged by his strength in the Midwest and he is counting on a repeat showing to secure re-election. Given that Trump beat Hillary Clinton there by just one point in 2016, it would only take a sliver of his supporters defecting to make Wisconsin blue again. Ahead of tonight’s climate-focused CNN town hall, Bernie Sanders has put out a statement calling on his fellow Democratic presidential candidates to commit to a fracking ban. “Any proposal to avert the climate crisis must include a full fracking ban on public and private lands,” Sanders said in a statement. “Fracking is a danger to our water supply. It’s a danger to the air we breathe. “It causes earthquakes. It’s highly explosive. Safe fracking is, like clean coal, pure fiction. But, most importantly, methane from natural gas contributes to climate change and is setting us on a path to disaster. When we are in the White House, we will end the era of fossil fuels, and that includes fracking.” Sanders has previously gone after his opponents, namely Joe Biden, for not proposing more sweeping plans to combat the climate crisis. The Vermont senator has called for spending $16 trillion to eliminate carbon emissions by 2050. Mike Pence is also still facing questions about his decision to stay at the president’s golf course in Ireland, despite the property requiring an hour-long flight to and from the vice president’s meetings in Dublin. Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, initially said Trump had made a “suggestion” that the vice president stay at his golf club, which immediately sparked concerns that the president was trying to profit off the official government trip. Pence tried to clear that up by claiming that the property was best suited for his large security detail, given that Trump has stayed there before. But the White House denied Trump had made the suggestion at all, leading Short to blame the incident on “misreporting.” Reminder: the reporting was based on his comments to journalists. Now CNN is reporting that Trump was irritated that he was ensnared in the ethical quagmire: Trump had been irked that he was being blamed for the fallout for Pence’s accommodations, sources told CNN, and Pence -- who keeps a close eye on his media coverage -- was also exasperated by the negative attention. Trump has suggested before that Cabinet officials and advisers stay at his properties while they are traveling. ... In the past, however, aides have typically ignored the recommendations, knowing it would result in a firestorm of ethics questions. On Tuesday and Wednesday, multiple White House officials expressed disbelief that Pence’s office thought spending two nights at the Trump International Golf Links &amp; Hotel was good idea. The president and the vice president appear to be on very different pages when it comes to Brexit. Mike Pence, who is traveling to London this week and plans to meet with Boris Johnson, emphasized the complexity of the issue, while Trump stressed his personal rapport with the prime minister. During his visit to Ireland yesterday, Pence ruffled some feathers by urging the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, to work toward a deal that “respects the United Kingdom’s sovereignty and minimises the disruption to commerce.” While speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump also expressed confidence in Britain’s embattled prime minister, Boris Johnson. “He’s a friend of mine, and he’s going at it, there’s no question about it,” Trump said. “Boris knows how to win. Don’t worry about him.” But the prime minister is facing a crucial test of his government less than two months into his tenure. After losing his first key Brexit vote in Parliament, Johnson is now calling for snap elections. (Follow Andrew Sparrow’s live blog to get the latest from London.) Trump was briefed by the acting DHS secretary, Kevin McAleenan, and FEMA’s acting administrator, Peter Gaynor, on the progress of Hurricane Dorian. The president said Florida was in “fantastic shape,” despite initial concerns that the state would suffer a “direct hit” from Dorian, and he reassured Americans that the government was “very well-prepared” for the storm. Still, McAleenan warned that the storm could still cause major damage along the east coast. “The hurricane remains a category 2 — a very powerful, very large storm. We are worried about significant impacts to South Carolina,” McAleenan said. Trump added that the US government would assist with the recovery efforts in the Bahamas, but he somewhat oddly compared the devastation there to other past major storms that have struck the US. “I must tell you, over the years there have been some hurricanes that were bigger and stronger and more powerful that hit us very hard also,” Trump said. Here’s where the day stands so far: A government watchdog report confirmed long-held suspicions that the migrant children who were separated from their families due to Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy experienced “heightened feelings of anxiety and loss.” More Democratic presidential candidates, including Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris, have released their climate plans in advance of tonight’s CNN town hall. Another House Republican, Bill Flores of Texas, announced he would not seek re-election next year, continuing a trend of GOP retirements in recent weeks. Hurricane Dorian is moving northward toward Georgia and the Carolinas, where it could unleash intense rainfall and flooding. The blog is still covering storm preparations and the lead-up to tonight’s town hall, so stay tuned. Bernie Sanders dismissed concerns that there was not enough room in the Democratic presidential primary for both him and Elizabeth Warren, given that the two progressive senators espouse similar ideals. “Elizabeth is a friend of mine. She and I have known each other well over 20 years. She’s going to run her campaign and I will run my campaign,” Sanders told ABC’s “The View.” Despite common assumptions that Warren and Sanders’ supporters are quite similar, data indicates the two groups are actually rather distinct. Our colleague David Smith reported last week: Imagined as a Venn diagram, there is common ground between Warren and Sanders voters but each has their own distinct base. A survey by the Pew Research Center this month found that about seven in 10 of Warren’s supporters are white, compared to about half of Sanders’ backers. Warren’s supporters are substantially more likely to have a college degree compared with supporters of [Joe] Biden and Sanders. John Zogby, a pollster and author, said: ‘Because of progressive ideology there is some sort of overlap, but they are different. Warren picks up support among women that ordinarily Sanders would not get, including former Clinton supporters who regard her as the bearer of the torch to get a woman elected.’ Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson sent (and deleted) a tweet implying that the path of Hurricane Dorian could be altered with “the power of the mind.” The self-help author has attracted fascination with her campaign promises to “harness love for political purposes” and spark a “moral and spiritual awakening” in the country. But the idea that those in Hurricane Dorian’s path can think away the storm’s effects might be a step too far for most people ⁠— particularly given the devastation Dorian unleashed in the Bahamas. Williamson later appeared to replace the original tweet with one simply offering prayers to those affected by the hurricane. House Democrats’ campaign arm took a victory lap after representative Bill Flores, a Republican of Texas, announced he would not seek re-election next year. “Congressman Flores is now the fifth Texas Republican to retire as the DCCC’s early and aggressive investment in Texas’s swing districts lays the groundwork for victory in 2020,” DCCC Chair Cheri Bustos said in a statement. She added: “As more and more of their colleagues consider leaving Washington early, it’s become increasingly clear that the Texodus will continue.” Democrats are unlikely to flip Flores’ seat, given that he won re-election by 16 points last year. But the growing trend of Republican departures could signal trouble for the GOP ⁠— which is perhaps why Republican strategists expressed surprise at Flores’ announcement, as a Texas Tribune reporter noted. Beto O’Rourke said the report on separated migrant children confirmed the expected psychological toll from their experiences. The Democratic presidential candidate, who previously represented El Paso in the House, has repeatedly drawn upon his exposure to the southern border to bolster his credibility. O’Rourke has also said that, if Trump manages to get his border wall constructed, he would take it down as president. A separate report released today by the Health and Human Services inspector general found that migrant detention facilities were woefully substandard. Specifically, many case managers did not meet the minimum education requirements for the Office of Refugee Resettlement. “Specifically, of the 194 case managers included in our review, 67 individuals across 31 facilities did not meet the education requirement,” the report reads. “Most of these case managers did have a bachelor’s degree, but in a field of study other than those specified by ORR.” The facilities also had difficulties training and retaining employees. The report said, “At the time of our visits in August and September 2018, 28 of the 45 facilities reported current staffing shortages for mental health clinicians or case managers.” The Health and Human Services inspector general also noted in its report on separated migrant children how the emotional toll of the experience triggered health complaints. “Physical symptoms felt by separated children are manifestations of their psychological pain,” one doctor said. “You get a lot of ‘my chest hurts,’ even though everything is fine [medically]. Children describe symptoms, ‘Every heartbeat hurts,’ ‘I can’t feel my heart,’ of emotional pain.” Children also feared for the well-being of their parents after they were separated from each other at the US-Mexico border. “A 7- or 8-year-old boy was separated from his father, without any explanation as to why the separation occurred,” one program director is quoted in the report as saying. “The child was under the delusion that his father had been killed and believed that he would also be killed. This child ultimately required emergency psychiatric care to address his mental health distress.” The Youth Climate Strike Coalition, a group of youth organizations, released a set of policy demands in advance of tonight’s climate-focused CNN town hall. The demands include implementing a Green New Deal, respecting indigenous lands and investing in sustainable agriculture. The groups are also planning a week of climate action, beginning with a strike on September 20th. “CNN’s town hall is not just a conversation about the future of America, it is a conversation about the future of our planet,” Nadia Nazar, of the climate group Zero Hour, said in a statement. “In the Climate Strike policy demands, we chart out a future for elected leaders to choose children rather than profit.” Our climate correspondent, Emily Holden, has also written this helpful piece on comparing the 2020 Democrats’ climate plans. In preparation for tonight’s climate-focused CNN town hall, more Democratic presidential candidates are releasing their plans on confronting the climate crisis. Elizabeth Warren has embraced the ideas of her former opponent, Jay Inslee, and proposed spending $3tn to transition to a clean, green economy. (Inslee dropped out of the race last month but has also aided at least one other presidential candidate, Julián Castro, in crafting his climate plan.) Pete Buttigieg has similarly committed to a 2050 timeline for the economy becoming carbon neutral and called for spending billions to develop greener technology and aid farmers impacted by the meteorological effects of the climate crisis. Under Kamala Harris’ plan, half of all new cars sold would be zero-emission by 2030, with a push to reach 100% by 2035. She also envisioned a “new and improved ‘cash for clunkers’ program” to incentivize that shift. All three of these candidates, along with seven others, will get the chance to discuss their plans tonight during the seven-hour (yes, seven-hour) CNN town hall, which begins at 5pm ET. A report from the Health and Human Services inspector general concluded that children affected by the Trump administration’s family separation policy experienced “heightened feelings of anxiety and loss.” “According to program directors and mental health clinicians, separated children exhibited more fear, feelings of abandonment, and post-traumatic stress than did children who were not separated,” the report reads. It adds: “For example, one program director noted that separated children could not distinguish facility staff from the immigration agents who separated them from their parents: ‘Every single separated kid has been terrified. We’re [seen as] the enemy.’” The practice of separating families who attempted to cross the US-Mexico border was part of Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy. But the practice was quickly abandoned last June amid outcry over devastating reports of migrant children begging for their parents. Another House Republican, Bill Flores of Texas, has announced he will not run for re-election next year, the latest in a string of GOP departures. Flores said in a statement that he was leaving office to spend “much more time with my family” and “resume business activities in the private sector.” Given that he won re-election by 16 points last year, the seat is likely to remain in Republican hands. All of that makes his announcement seemingly unremarkable. But it does underscore a widening trend of exits among the House GOP caucus. Flores is the fifth Texas Republican and fifteenth House Republican overall to announce he would retire or seek higher office. Having been first elected during the Tea Party wave of 2010, Flores has never experienced life in the House minority — until this session. His decision to leave, along with about a dozen of his colleagues’ similar moves, could indicate that they don’t expect the House to swing back to Republican control next year. And they’d rather not spend another two years under Democrats’ thumb."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/01/chances-for-progress-towards-a-nuclear-free-world","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-01T17:17:31Z","webTitle":"Chances for progress towards a nuclear-free world | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/01/chances-for-progress-towards-a-nuclear-free-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/01/chances-for-progress-towards-a-nuclear-free-world","fields":{"headline":"Chances for progress towards a nuclear-free world","bodyText":"Can Owen Jones (Corbyn has to lead on nuclear weapons, 29 March) really mean that Labour party policy can’t be changed? The only argument for Trident, and any successor, is a false sense of national prestige. Can’t some major trade unions think of anything else to make than weapons of mass destruction? Far from our nuclear weapons being independent, without the regular loan of US missiles we would have nothing on which to put our warheads. They are no answer anyway to suicidal groups or to nuclear accidents. It was Robert McNamara, at the end of a life devoted to nuclear planning, who said that we were only saved by “good luck”. If we have over £205bn to spend, it makes much more sense to spend those billions on the NHS, housing and poverty at home and abroad. The 1968 NPT obliges us to work for the elimination of nuclear weapons “in good faith”. A replacement of Trident does not sound like good faith to me. Bruce Kent Vice-president, CND • Trying to explain support for civil nuclear energy through links to the defence industry fails for two key reasons (Why is the UK government so infatuated with nuclear power?, theguardian.com, 29 March). Firstly there are strong arguments for a new generation of nuclear power stations. They are a low-carbon source of electricity which should remain an important part of our future energy mix alongside renewables. Unlike renewables, they provide fully predictable, always-on power which will always be needed as part of our energy mix. Batteries may help bridge this gap, but they are an as yet unproven technology, unlike nuclear which has been supplying electricity in the UK since the 1950s. Secondly, if a new generation of nuclear power stations was really essential for the defence industry, unions like mine, which represent members in both the nuclear and defence industries would not be shy about talking about this. Nuclear-powered submarines are deployed by the UK with both conventional and nuclear weapons, both of which command widespread support from the public in an increasingly uncertain world. If we want to meet our climate change obligations and keep our energy supply secure, Britain needs a debate about our future energy policy based on facts not speculation. Mike Clancy General secretary, Prospect union • Owen Jones’s complacency regarding the position of the Labour party and some leading unions in support of nuclear weapons is shocking. He makes no mention of the 2017 UN treaty banning nuclear weapons, endorsed by 122 countries and ignored by the UK, despite government claims to support multilateral disarmament. Here is the political opportunity for action; this act removes the ability to claim that unilateralism is “unpopular” and that nuclear weapons cannot be debated. As for union support, let us follow the Scottish model: in 2015 a report was published by the Scottish TUC and Scottish CND showing how the skills in Trident-related work could be transferred to alternative economic development. We may have jobs designed for a future and not for mass destruction. Linda Rogers Beaumaris, Gwynedd • The prospective meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-un (North Korea is still in the doghouse over its nuclear posturing. Now Xi is asserting himself, 29 March) could be a disaster, or a real breakthrough in the quest for a nuclear weapon-free world. The rest of the world, including the UK, can help to achieve the latter. Kim’s visit to China is a start. The UN general assembly high-level conference on nuclear disarmament, in New York in May, would a good place and time for the meeting, putting the specific issues of the confrontation in south-east Asia in the context of the worldwide nuclear arms race, with experts on call, plus political pressure from the majority non-nuclear states. The UK government should take a lead, in accordance with its professed commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons, achieved by multilateral negotiations, by attending this conference and urging the other nuclear weapon powers to do likewise. A modest, but well-worthwhile aim, as a first step, would be a no-first-use declaration, by both the US and North Korea. De-alerting of missiles currently on hair-trigger alert, as called for by Owen Jones, would make the whole world safer. Labour is not (yet) in government, so its influence internationally is limited. What it can and should do is continue to pressure the UK government to fulfil its obligations to work for nuclear abolition, including the measures proposed here, which I believe are not even very controversial. Frank Jackson Former co-chair, World Disarmament Campaign • In his timely article, Owen Jones rightly highlights the Trident obsession by ministers and many Labour MPs. But the exhortation in the headline is misplaced. Corbyn consistently does just what it wants, but his words do not get reported. For example, in a debate in parliament on Monday evening (26 March) on National security and Russia, he stressed: “We should not be about to mark the 50th anniversary of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty this June while its two key signatories, Russia and the United States, are behaving as though it no longer applies to them. It was a Labour government who, in 1968, promoted the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). We urgently need the other signatories to that treaty, including the United Kingdom, to take a lead in insisting that Russia, the US and all other nuclear powers return to the negotiating table and to the principles that underpinned that very important treaty in 1968.” Corbyn’s history is accurate: on 27 June 1968, the then Labour government presented to parliament the final text of the NPT (as Cmnd 3,683), which Labour ministers had helped negotiate. Papers available in the National Archives show that earlier that year, on 23 January 1968, Fred (later Lord) Mulley, as the Labour government’s disarmament minister, told the UN committee on disarmament why nations should sign up to the newly negotiated NPT: “It is our desire that these [nuclear disarmament] negotiations should begin as soon as possible and should produce speedy and successful results. There is no excuse now for allowing a long delay to follow the signing of this treaty.” But ministers only ambiguously share this atomic aspiration. Lib Dem peer, Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer, was told by Foreign Office minister Lord Ahmad on 22 March: “As a responsible nuclear weapons state, the UK is committed to the long-term goal of a world without nuclear weapons … However, we do not believe the UN high level conference in May 2018 will lead to effective progress on nuclear disarmament. It will not address the serious threats to international peace and security posed by nuclear proliferation nor will it take account of the international security environment.” Dr David Lowry Former director, European Proliferation Information Centre • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/mar/11/morning-mail-ethiopian-air-crash-labor-poll-boost-berejiklians-image-problem","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-03-10T20:03:50Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Ethiopian air crash, Labor poll boost, Berejiklian's image problem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/11/morning-mail-ethiopian-air-crash-labor-poll-boost-berejiklians-image-problem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/mar/11/morning-mail-ethiopian-air-crash-labor-poll-boost-berejiklians-image-problem","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Ethiopian air crash, Labor poll boost, Berejiklian's image problem","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 11 March. Top stories An Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 passenger jet bound for Nairobi has crashed, killing all 149 passengers and eight crew members onboard. “There are no survivors onboard the flight, which carried passengers from at least 35 countries,” a spokesman for the airline said. The largest number of the victims were Kenyans. The flight left Bole airport in Addis Ababa for Nairobi at 8.38am local time. The control tower lost contact with aircraft a few minutes later at 8.44am. The aircraft was a new 737 MAX 8, the same model that crashed four months ago in Indonesia, killing 189 people. The Australian embassy in Addis Ababa is urgently seeking information as to whether any Australians are among the dead, the ABC reports. Labor has pulled ahead of the Coalition after a week of rebellions and recriminations within the government, leading 54% to 46% on the two-party-preferred measure. The latest Newspoll, which is the 50th straight loss for the Coalition in the survey, has the Coalition’s primary vote on 36% and Labor’s on 39%. The poor result for the government follows a week where Queensland Nationals sideswiped Michael McCormack, and Barnaby Joyce made it known he wanted to return to the top job; Tony Abbott backflipped on his position to withdraw from the Paris accord, and was blasted by Malcolm Turnbull; and Julie Bishop declared she would have beaten Bill Shorten had her moderate colleagues backed her for the leadership last year. It also follows the release of data showing the economy grew by just 0.2% for the December quarter – short of the Reserve Bank forecast of 0.6% and market expectations. Zali Steggall, the independent taking on Tony Abbott in Warringah at the federal election, has vowed to push for reform of political advertising laws after a rightwing group falsely linked her to Labor’s franking credits policy. Advance Australia, billed as a rightwing version of GetUp, has been pushing paid video ads into the feeds of Facebook users aiming to undermine Steggall’s campaign to take Warringah from the Liberals. Electoral law only prohibits misleading or deceiving a voter on how to mark their ballot paper. There is no requirement for political advertising to be factual. Steggall is advocating for minimum standards for truth in political advertising to prevent blatantly false claims, with her first major policy announcement to be a suite of integrity reforms.

But instead she is behind in the polls. Why is that? For a start, Berejiklian is battling an interesting problem: she comes across as too diligent, too hardworking, too serious. So in her introductory video screened before she took the stage at the Liberals’ state campaign launch at Penrith on Sunday, it was the glimpses of a spontaneous, laughing, mistake-making Gladys that got star billing.” “The new Democratic majority in Congress is unraveling the many ways that Donald Trump’s administration has been beholden to Saudi Arabia since its earliest days,” writes Mohamad Bazzi. “In a report last month that got lost in the crush of other news, House Democrats detailed how top Trump administration officials, including Michael Flynn and Jared Kushner, pushed to provide the Saudi government with technology to build nuclear power plants.

Thinking time: Consider the stress ball In 1988 a TV writer called Alex Carswell threw a pen at a photo of his mother after a stressful phone call with his boss. It gave him an idea. It was the “Age of Stress” – the Daily Mirror (among other newspapers) had identified it as “a killer” – and so the perfect time for Carswell to launch his “stress ball”. In 2017, that repeated action led to fidget spinners becoming one of the most popular items bought on Amazon. They were not simply triangles of plastic; they were a stress-relief toy, a treatment for ADHD, a modern rosary – and the cause of moral panic, as teachers confiscated them as contraband. They were the stars of a growing anxiety economy. Alongside products designed purely as medical aids, such as meditation apps, there is a thriving offshoot of lifestyle goods marketed through their anxiety-relieving qualities. Product innovation oriented around anxiety spans nearly 30 different categories, including chocolate, yogurt, air fresheners and skincare.

The announcement from the justice department’s national security division on Thursday comes after Dutch officials said they had disrupted a Russian cyberattack on the global chemical weapons watchdog. Four of the officers were charged with targeting the watchdog. All seven of the officers were indicted on cyber-hacking charges linked to the leaking of Olympic athletes’ drug test data, in an alleged attempt to undermine efforts to tackle Russian doping. Russia’s GRU military intelligence was blamed for the failed operation in the Netherlands, which allegedly targeted the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and was thwarted by Dutch military intelligence with the help of the UK. The international organization was investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria and the poisoning of former GRU officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in the English city of Salisbury in March. Officials said the Russians had made unsuccessful attempts to carry out a remote attack on the Porton Down chemical weapons facility in April and on the UK foreign office in March. According to US officials, the Russians also targeted a nuclear power company based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that supplied nuclear fuel to Ukraine. “It is evident from the allegations in today’s indictment that the defendants believed that they could use their perceived anonymity to act with impunity,” John Demers, the US assistant attorney general for national security, said at a press conference announcing the charges. “In their own countries and on territories of other sovereign nations, to undermine international institutions and to distract from their government’s own wrongdoing.” “They were wrong. Working together with our partners in nations that share our values, we can expose the truth for the world to see.” A grand jury in the western district of Pennsylvania indicted seven defendants, all officers in the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), a military intelligence agency of the general staff of the armed forces of the Russian Federation, for computer hacking, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and money laundering. The indictments were not directly related to the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the US election, US officials said, but encompassed many of the same tactics that earlier this year led to charges against more than a dozen Russian nationals for penetrating Democratic party emails in 2016. “They evince some of the same methods of computer intrusion and the same overarching Russian strategic goal: to pursue its interests through illegal influence and disinformation operations aimed at muddying or altering perceptions of the truth,” Demers said. Addressing reporters in Washington, justice department officials described how the Russians targeted athletes and anti-doping agencies as retaliation for Russia being banned from the 2018 Winter Olympics over its state-sponsored athlete doping program. Russian agents attempted to breach the personal information of approximately 250 athletes from 30 countries who supported the ban on Russian athletes or condemned the country’s doping program, US attorney Scott Brady said, as well as the systems of US and international anti-doping agencies. The defendants – all Russian nationals and residents – made efforts to remotely hack the desired networks, according to the indictment. When those efforts failed, the defendants and others from GRU’s technical unit traveled to where the targets were physically located. With the help of sophisticated equipment, the hackers were able to penetrate computer networks through wifi networks and transfer that access to conspirators in Russia. Top Russian officials dismissed the allegations as part of a coordinate effort to smear Moscow. Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of Russian parliament, said the hacking claims were false and designed to “delegitimize Russia”. . Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, denounced the accusations as “fantasies”. The Dutch government expelled four Russian agents while detailing how its authorities worked with counterparts in the UK to thwart the attempted cyber-attack on the OPCW, the chemical weapons watchdog based in The Hague. In a joint statement, the British prime minister, Theresa May, and her Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, said: “This attempt to access the secure systems of an international organisation working to rid the world of chemical weapons demonstrates the GRU’s disregard for the global values and rules than keep us all safe. “Our action today reinforces the clear message from the international community: we will uphold the rules-based international system, and defend international institutions from those that seek to do them harm.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2019/feb/02/north-south-division-brexit-britain-delusion","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-02T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"North to south, the seeds of division in Brexit Britain were sown long ago | Ian Jack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/02/north-south-division-brexit-britain-delusion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/02/north-south-division-brexit-britain-delusion","fields":{"headline":"North to south, the seeds of division in Brexit Britain were sown long ago","bodyText":"The Australian writer and academic Donald Horne is best remembered in Britain for his vivid summation of one of its largest divisions – that between the north and the south. Writing in 1969, Horne decided that the Britain of what he called the northern metaphor was “pragmatic, empirical, calculating, Puritan, bourgeois, enterprising, adventurous, scientific, serious and believes in struggle”; while in the southern metaphor the same country was “romantic, illogical, muddled, divinely lucky, Anglican, aristocratic, traditional, frivolous, and believes in order and tradition”. The north’s great sin was “a ruthless avarice” rationalised in the belief that humanity’s prime impulse was “a calculating economic self-interest”; the south matched it with “a ruthless pride” that believed “men are born to serve”. Horne included Scotland with northern England as “the north”; and, if he’d thought about it, he might well have included Wales too, because what he considered to be northern qualities had matured in the places most affected by the industrial revolution. But it was not as though Horne believed these attitudes were strictly defined by geography, as though the traveller left the village ponds of Sussex in fuzzy Technicolor and arrived at Manchester’s mills in stark black and white. The two ideas quarrelled with each other in every bit of the country. Both of them concluded that “Britain is best” – but, to quote Horne, “in the contest as to what Britain was best at [his italics] it was, on the whole, the southern metaphor that won”. Fifty years later, the qualifying “on the whole” is no longer necessary: the southern idea of what the country represents has won hands down, though that country is now England rather than Britain and avarice has moved south from its original headquarters – or so the cliche about muck and brass suggests – in the villas of the northern industrialists. Like many people, I first came across Horne’s metaphors in a book by the American historian Martin J Wiener titled English Culture and the Decline of the Industrial Spirit, 1850-1980. Prof Wiener’s book appeared at a propitious time, just as Margaret Thatcher’s policies began to make serious inroads into manufacturing industry, and it became celebrated for its cultural explanation of Britain’s industrial failure: basically, that the country’s moneymakers and technical pioneers wanted to be landed aristocrats more than they wanted to continue as industrialists, and had little sustained appetite for manufacturing. England was among the most densely populated, urbanised and polluted countries in the world. The factory owner’s ambition was to become a hunting-pink member of an older, more rural regime, a pose that reflected a popular ambivalence towards the grimy and unhealthy processes that had made the country rich. Britain’s downward slide – relative to competitor nations such as the United States and Germany – had begun long before the 19th century was over. Horne’s metaphors suited this argument, but that was all I knew of them until a few weeks ago when a generous reader of this column sent me a copy of Horne’s book God is an Englishman, where they originally appeared. God is an Englishman is long out of print – any copies to be found online date from 1970 and have been buried (metaphorically) by references to a novel of the same title by RF Delderfield that appeared soon after. Perhaps Delderfield’s novel confused the market; perhaps Penguin didn’t put enough effort into selling copies of a book that it imported from Australia: for whatever reason, a clever and prescient analysis of Britain never got the public attention it deserved. The Britain Horne describes is the country I came of age in: the world’s third nuclear power, the greatest owner of overseas assets after the US, the financier of a third of world trade and (how incredible this now seems) the world’s second biggest exporter. Compared with nations of roughly equal population, it was twice as prosperous as Italy and eight times as prosperous as Nigeria, and outdid or rivalled another island nation, Japan, in most indicators of wellbeing. But were the people happy? To be third in the league table of synthetic rubber production, Horne wrote, didn’t “cheer up” a nation that had got used to the idea, often fallacious, of being first in anything it turned its hand to. In his judgment, “The British have not been taught to be thankful for their great mercies … They have not yet learned to talk in a new way about their past, their present, and their future.” Out of this inarticulacy had come the muddle that Horne thought was symptomatic of the southern metaphor. There was pride in both bigness and smallness: “The British could not – and still cannot – imagine what size they are.” As for “the long 20th century twilight of the northern metaphor”, Horne chose to illustrate it with a brilliant examination of the word “provincial”, with all its implications of the dowdy and the second rate. In contrast to other countries, the definition wasn’t dictated by geography. “The English do not see rural villages as provincial, or ancient cathedral towns that happen to be in the provinces. Things that are rural or ancient are at the very heart of southern English snobberies, even if they occur in the north.” He then offered a definition that’s persuasively exact: “Provincialism is to live in or near an industrial town to which the industrial revolution gave its significant modern form.” Most people in England, in fact in the whole United KingdomK, lived like that when Horne published his book; the biggest change in the intervening years is that most of the towns have ceased to be industrial. Meanwhile what he described as the “indestructible vanity” of London has increased, as the management of money became more important to the British economy than any other enterprise. In this way, to read Horne’s book now is to see a country being planted with the seeds of division and delusion, the crop ready for harvest in 2016. Today, many people and several newspapers still believe that British institutions are “a paradigm of what political and judicial things should be”, while retaining “a feeling that [similar] institutions ‘abroad’ are in reality gimcrack”. I read that sentence this week on the same day the European parliament debated the British government’s new proposal. In 2014, it is worth remembering, Ukip had 24 of the 73 MEPs elected by the UK. Thanks to splits, defections and fisticuffs, only seven of them retain the party label, but the rest remain as independents, the whole rackety ensemble drawing their £7,000 a month salaries and generous expenses, and shouting boorishly at speeches made by other members. Mairead McGuinness, the Irish MEP chairing Wednesday’s session, had to chide them: “This is not the House of Commons, colleagues, this is the European parliament.” Who other than a dimwit xenophobe could see and hear this and not feel shame? Towards the end of his book, Horne warns that if the old ways of British thought and behaviour persist they may begin to seem absurd, and if that happens “everything may become folly … In such a state things will change, but perhaps disastrously.” • Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2018/jul/13/joe-dunthorne-books-that-made-me","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-13T09:00:11Z","webTitle":"Joe Dunthorne: ‘On the Road takes longer to read than it did to write’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/13/joe-dunthorne-books-that-made-me","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jul/13/joe-dunthorne-books-that-made-me","fields":{"headline":"Joe Dunthorne: ‘On the Road takes longer to read than it did to write’","bodyText":"The book I am currently reading Pond by Claire-Louise Bennett.

Until I read this, I didn’t know it was possible to fall in love with someone who doesn’t exist. It made me a reader. The book I wish I’d written White Noise by Don DeLillo. For my taste, it’s the perfect balance of humour, plot and ideas. The book that influenced my writing See last answer. My new novel, The Adulterants, has a central set piece that is a homage to the “Airborne Toxic Event” chapter in White Noise. I wanted to write a chapter that starts small – at a picnic, in my version – and keeps building and building until the world is in flames. The book that is most overrated On the Road by Jack Kerouac. How can you trust a novel that takes longer to read than it took to write? The book that is most underrated Two Serious Ladies by Jane Bowles. It’s a weird and witty masterpiece about two women rejecting bourgeois comfort in pursuit of joyous – even righteous – dissolution. The last book that made me cry Chernobyl Prayer by Svetlana Alexievich. An incredible book of interviews with those directly affected by the explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Intimate, unsentimental and absolutely crushing. The last book that made me laugh I recently read, for the second time, The Ask by Sam Lipsyte. I can’t think of a funnier, more enjoyable modern novel. The book I couldn’t finish I give up on books all the time. In only the last few months, I’ve given up on The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann, At Swim-Two-Birds by Flann O’Brien and Ripley’s Game by Patricia Highsmith. I just put them down and never think about them again. It’s exhilarating. The book I give as a gift I have written a poem about always giving Rings of Saturn by WG Sebald as a gift. But, in truth, the book I most often give is Two Serious Ladies. The book I’d most like to be remembered for I think I’d like to be remembered for my poems. Novels always, inevitably feel imperfect – there are so many words to get wrong! – but when writing poems there are occasional moments when I think every letter is in the right place. My earliest reading memory Age six or so, I remember loving the jokes in a rapidly disintegrating copy of The Ha Ha Bonk Book by Janet and Allan Ahlberg, then passing them off as my own.

Six years on from the triple meltdown at Fukushima, the industry faces concerted opposition from residents and some officials due to lingering concerns about safety. In an illustration of the damage to the industry’s reputation after the Fukushima disaster, just three of Japan’s 42 usable reactors are running at present, according to the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum. That number is to rise after the Osaka high court on Tuesday backed a restart of reactors 3 and 4 at the Takahama power plant north of Kyoto. In doing so, it overturned an earlier ruling that Greenpeace had hailed as the first known case in Japanese history of a judge ordering the shutdown of an operating nuclear reactor. The challenge had been brought by a group of residents in neighbouring Shiga prefecture, who were concerned about the risk of contamination of water supplies at Lake Biwa. The operator, Kansai Electric Power (Kepco), said the shutdown imposed in March last year was not based on objective science and had cost it more than ¥200m (£1.4m) a day. Kendra Ulrich, a senior global energy campaigner for Greenpeace Japan, said the injunction’s cancellation was “not wholly unexpected in the notoriously nuclear-friendly Japanese legal system”. “It clears the way for Kepco to restart reactors that have serious unresolved safety issues,” she said. The Takahama reactors would restart within about a month, local media reports said. The president of Kepco, Shigeki Iwane, told reporters the utility would “make safety our top priority”. Two weeks ago a district court near Tokyo ruled that negligence by the state contributed to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011 and awarded significant damages to evacuees. The government has said it supports restarting reactors where it is safe to do so, and has set a target of obtaining between 20% and 22% of the country’s power from nuclear sources by 2030. Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), which operated the Fukushima Daiichi plant, is pushing to restart two of the reactors at another of its stations in Niigata prefecture. The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant was previously the world’s largest such facility but has been offline for years. The Nuclear Regulation Authority last month ordered Tepco to resubmit safety documents after the company revealed previously secret analysis that a key building on the site could not withstand a severe earthquake. At the wrecked Fukushima site, meanwhile, Tepco is still trying to work out how to remove fuel debris as part of an expensive decommissioning operation that is expected to take decades. It has lost several robots sent in to investigate the damage from the earthquake and tsunami-triggered meltdowns."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jun/04/the-latest-weak-attacks-on-evs-and-solar-panels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T10:00:14Z","webTitle":"The latest weak attacks on EVs and solar panels | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jun/04/the-latest-weak-attacks-on-evs-and-solar-panels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jun/04/the-latest-weak-attacks-on-evs-and-solar-panels","fields":{"headline":"The latest weak attacks on EVs and solar panels","bodyText":"Over the past two weeks, media attacks on solar panels and electric vehicles have been followed by Trump administration policies aimed at boosting their fossil fueled rivals. Efforts to undermine solar power The first salvo came via a Forbes article written by Michael Shellenberger, who’s running a doomed campaign for California governor and really loves nuclear power. Shellenberger’s critique focused on the problem of potential waste at the end of a solar panel lifespan when the modules must be disposed or recycled. It’s a somewhat ironic concern from a proponent of nuclear power, which has a rather bigger toxic waste problem. About 80% of a solar panel module can be recycled, but some portions cannot, and create potentially hazardous waste due to the presence of metals like cadmium and lead. The Electric Power Research Institute notes that long-term storage of used panels until recycling technologies become available may be the best option for dealing with this waste stream. Ultimately, it’s an issue that will need to be addressed as solar panels become more widespread and reach the end of their 25-plus year lifespan, much like the issue of nuclear waste. But it’s an issue that we should be able to resolve with smart policies and technologies. It’s also not a big near-term concern, unlike the urgent need to deploy low-carbon energy, or an immediate pollution problem like for example the environmental crises that result when oil rigs fail or coal barges sink into rivers. Shellenberger also raised concerns about the possibility “that cadmium can be washed out of solar modules by rainwater.” But that’s only a problem for broken panels, which are relatively rare except perhaps in the wake a natural disaster like a hurricane or earthquake. In a disaster area, leaching of metals from some broken solar panels is the least of a city’s problems. In short, it’s valid to note that end-of-life solar panel recycling and disposal is an issue that we’ll have to address smartly, but unlike climate change, it’s not a big or urgent concern. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is planning to order grid operators to buy electricity from struggling coal power plants to extend their lives. This is the latest in the administration’s misguided campaign to save the dying coal industry, which can no longer compete in the free market against cheaper, cleaner alternatives. As a result, coal power plants have continued to shut down at a rapid rate. Those coal plants pose a much greater threat of pollution, including from heavy metals. Denying the imminent transition to EVs In the New York Times, conservative opinion columnist Bret Stephens devoted an editorial last week to attacking Tesla specifically, and electric cars in general. There are valid reasons to criticize Tesla – the company regularly falls short of its ambitious production goals – but Stephens’ piece went far beyond what’s fair. For example, it called the Tesla Model 3 “a lemon” because Consumer Reports initially did not recommend the vehicle due primarily to issues with braking distance during its tests. Within about a week, Tesla issued a software update to correct the braking problem, and the Model 3 earned its Consumer Reports recommendation. Worse yet, Stephens declared that gasoline is the fuel of the future: The terrible idea is that electric cars are the wave of the future, at least for the mass market. Gasoline has advantages in energy density, cost, infrastructure and transportability that electricity doesn’t and won’t for decades. That’s equivalentt to saying in 1910 that horses have advantages over automobiles, and will continue to dominate the transportation market. The experts disagree. The International Energy Agency estimated that global electric vehicle ownership increased 54% from 2016 to 2017, to 3.1 million EVs, and projects that number will increase 40-fold to 125 million by 2030. Virtually every major automaker is developing electric cars. GM plans to launch 20 new all-electric models by 2023 and the company “believes in an all-electric future.” Nissan plans to launch 8 new all-electric models by 2020 and hopes to sell 1 million EVs per year by that date. As for the infrastructure disadvantage, California, New York, and New Jersey are spending a combined $1.3bn on EV charging to address that problem. But more than 80% of EV charging happens at home. The Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt have 150- and 200-mile ranges, respectively, and the average American only drives 30 miles per day. An MIT study in 2016 found that EVs with a 74-mile range could meet 87% of American car owners’ needs with only overnight charging at home; Nissan and GM have doubled and nearly tripled that range. Infrastructure is no longer a big obstacle to EV adoption for many people. Costs are difficult to compare; while electric cars receive federal and state rebates, fossil fuels receive tremendous subsidies, particularly in the form of deferred climate change costs. Recent research suggests that the ‘social cost of carbon’ is around $200 per ton, which equates to an effective subsidy of close to $2 per gallon of gasoline. Doing an apples-to-apples comparison by either accounting for current fuel prices and federal tax EV credits, or excluding tax credits but adding $2 per gallon to fuel costs, electric vehicles already have similar lifetime costs to comparable gasoline-powered sedans. And due to improving battery technology, the price per mile of EV range is falling rapidly. The Trump administration is working on behalf of the fossil fuel industry to stall the transition to electric cars, advancing regulations that will freeze fuel efficiency requirements. However, California will be taking the Trump and Pruitt EPA to court in order to preserve the state’s ability to set its own vehicle pollution standards. In a world where leaders in every country outside America accept the reality of dangerous human-caused climate change, these clean technologies are the future. Working to undermine their progress in the US will just allow competing countries like China to gain a bigger advantage in the growing green economy of the future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jul/31/tuesday-briefing-brexit-a-drive-into-the-unknown","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-31T05:25:35Z","webTitle":"Tuesday briefing: Brexit a drive into the unknown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/31/tuesday-briefing-brexit-a-drive-into-the-unknown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/31/tuesday-briefing-brexit-a-drive-into-the-unknown","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday briefing: Brexit a drive into the unknown","bodyText":"Top story: ‘We need a deal’ say carmakers Hello on a Tuesday morning. I’m Warren Murray – let’s get you clued up. Britain’s carmakers are being left unprepared for Brexit, their trade body has said. “We need a deal. If we have no deal, there is no transition, there is no implementation period, that would kick in less than eight months away,” said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Asked if there were any potential Brexit benefits for the £82bn British automotive industry and its 186,000 employees, Hawes said: “Not that we can see.” Britain exports most of the cars it makes, with more than half of those going to the EU. But British buyers also get 69% of their new cars from the continent. Hawes said this highlighted the inter-dependency: “We now look to negotiators on both sides to recognise the needs of the whole European automotive industry … any disruption risks undermining one of our most valuable economic assets.” Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn could face a challenge to his Brexit policy as more than 150 constituency Labour parties, and some unions, line up to support a second referendum on the final deal. “There’s been a very definite shift internally over the last few weeks in support of a public vote,” said one shadow cabinet member. * * * Aid abuse response damned – MPs have blasted charities for “complacency verging on complicity” in dealing with sexual abuse across the sector. The international development committee (IDC) says the UN has also failed to show sustained leadership on an issue that was known about in 2002. Pauline Latham, a Tory member of the committee, said it heard evidence of “rape, sex for food, calling people prostitutes when they’re actually desperate women who need to feed their families, or young girls who are trafficked”. Stephen Twigg, the Labour chair of the committee, said: “This is 16 years of failure by the entire international system of governments, the UN and the aid sector.” * * * Navy brought bomber to UK – The Manchester Arena bomber, Salman Abedi, had been rescued by the Royal Navy from the civil war in Libya three years earlier, it has emerged. Abedi – who killed 22 people at an Ariana Grande pop concert in May 2017 – was 19 when he boarded the HMS Enterprise in Tripoli in August 2014 as one of more than 100 stranded British citizens. Abedi was being monitored by security services when he travelled to Libya, but his case was closed a month before his rescue. * * * Going to the wall – Donald Trump has again threatened to shut down the US government if Congress will not fund his border wall. “I would certainly be willing to close it [the government] down to get it done,” said the president, at a White House press conference with the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte. Trump also offered an olive branch to Iran despite recent fighting words: “I would meet with Iran if they wanted to meet … No preconditions.” His secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, then reeled off a list of preconditions. * * * Guardians raise pen for Gunn – The stars of Guardians on the Galaxy have signed an open letter calling for the reinstatement of director James Gunn, who was fired by Disney over offensive tweets from his past. Zoe Saldana, Vin Diesel, Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper and others wrote: “We’ve been encouraged by the outpouring of support from fans and members of the media who wish to see James reinstated as director of Volume 3 as well as discouraged by those so easily duped into believing the many outlandish conspiracy theories surrounding him. “We hope Americans from across the political spectrum can ease up on the character assassinations and stop weaponising mob mentality.” Gunn’s sacking, after rightwing conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich circulated the tweets, has drawn criticism across the entertainment industry. * * * Big waste of energy – Nuclear waste could be permanently buried under national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty under government plans backed by a committee of MPs. Fifty years of nuclear power in the UK has generated 750,000 cubic metres of waste but the nation has still not developed a permanent disposal solution. The MPs argue that finding the safest site is paramount and national parks should not be excluded. The Green party MP Caroline Lucas called the idea “outrageous”, saying the quandary of what to do with radioactive waste showed Britain should stop building nuclear power stations. * * * Pulled into line – New Zealand’s roads department will update its signage from “Linemen” to “Line Crew” after receiving a letter from a Zoe Carew, 7, who pointed out that “women can be line-workers too”. Roads boss Fergus Gammie wrote back to Zoe congratulating her for taking action. “Line Crew” would be used in future, he said – her suggestion of “Line-workers” was too long to fit. Lunchtime read: ‘No one spoke about this case’ Earlier this year the remains of a teenage girl were found near Hotel House – a crumbling building largely occupied by recent immigrants in Porto Recanati, a small seaside town on Italy’s Adriatic coast. Many Italians regard Hotel House as a den of drugs and violence: when officers found the bones of Bangladesh-born Cameyi Mossamet, they were actually searching for stashes of drugs and money. It had been eight years since she went missing. Did prejudice hamper the search for her killer? Sport Swaths of empty seats could prove a troubling backdrop during the opening exchanges of England’s first Test against India, with Edgbaston reporting low ticket sales for what is meant to be the highlight of the cricketing summer. Geraint Thomas has been hailed “Le Prince de Galles” and “Le cyclist next door” by French papers after winning his first Tour de France. But, as the 32-year-old arrived back in Britain following a heavy night of celebrations, there were growing calls for Team Sky’s dominance to be curbed. Eddie Jones has been warned by the Rugby Football Union that England are expected to reverse their recent slump by delivering a successful campaign in November’s autumn internationals. Negotiations for Tyson Fury to challenge the WBC heavyweight champion, Deontay Wilder, in December have begun, according to the British boxer, with the fight possibly taking place in the US. And Stradivarius is widely expected to take one more step towards a £1m bonus when he runs in today’s Goodwood Cup, the highlight race on the opening day of Glorious Goodwood. Business Growth in China’s huge manufacturing sector has slowed in the past month, giving the first concrete evidence that the world’s second-largest economy is feeling the impact of the embryonic trade war with the US. In Japan the central bank stopped short of rowing back from its policy of ultra-low rates, giving a boost to the Nikkei. In the UK, the FTSE100 is expected to open flat and the pound is till under huge pressure – it’s buying $1.312 and €1.121. The papers “Aid charities failing to tackle endemic sexual abuse, say MPs” is the Guardian’s splash today. The Telegraph’s front-page headline is “Rail boss: our trains are the envy of Europe”. The Mirror has “Fortnite made me a suicidal drug addict” while the Mail reports on a “Sickening act of betrayal” – the Manchester suicide bomber had been rescued by the navy from Libya three years before his attack. The Sun reports “Police protect sick pic yob gang” – it’s about teenagers accused of an attack on a vulnerable woman getting police protection for fear of vigilantes. Several papers have Brexit on their fronts, including the Times (“UK warns Brussels of tit-for-tat over Brexit”), the FT (“Barnier warms to May’s Brexit plan after clarification over City”) and the Express (“How dare he insult 17m Brexit voters” – a story about Lord Mandelson accusing some Brexiters of hating foreigners).

The International Energy Agency said the decline is set to continue into 2018, threatening energy security, climate change and air pollution goals. Fossil fuels increased their share of energy supply investment for the first time since 2014, to $790bn, and will play a significant role for years on current trends, the IEA said. Investment in coal power dropped sharply but was offset by an uptick in oil and gas spending, the World Energy Investment report found. Dr Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said of the renewables fall: “We are seeing a decrease, which is disappointing. And more disappointing is we see the signs this decline may continue this year – this is a worrying trend.” Fossil fuels’ share of energy investment needs to drop to 40% by 2030 to meet climate targets but instead rose fractionally to 59% in 2017. World leaders’ warm words on renewables and energy efficiency needed to be matched with action, Birol said, urging governments to create less investment uncertainty for green energy. “I was myself worried to see there is a contradiction between a) the statements the governments make and b) what the world needs today vis-a-vis the investment numbers, where we see a decline,” he said. Globally, energy investment fell 2% to $1.8tn in 2017, with electricity taking a bigger share than oil and gas for the second year in a row. The decline in renewable power generation spending was mostly down to falls in wind power and hydro but solar hit record levels despite becoming cheaper to install. While coal investment fell to its lowest level in 10 years, spending on gas-fired power stations rose 40%. Nuclear power fell sharply to the lowest level of investment in five years. In the oil and gas industry, rising prices have helped investment in production rise 4% last year and is expected to grow 5% this year. The US’s shale boom will drive much of the growth, and frackers are on track to achieve positive free cashflow this year, for the first time. The US is not expected to pump enough extra crude to bring down oil prices, though. Birol said: “US shale growth is very welcome growth for badly needed additions but this growth alone will not be enough to balance out the markets.” Outside the US, investment in conventional oil and gas projects remains subdued and Birol said the world faced “major difficulties” if investment was not stepped up. Motorists spent $43bn on fully electric cars and plug-in hybrids last year, accounting for half of global growth in car sales. However, the battery-powered cars are not seriously denting oil demand yet, the IEA said. Governments are increasing investment in energy markets, either directly through state-owned firms or indirectly via investments policies and regulation, which Birol said was a surprising development."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jul/15/not-welcome-finnish-protesters-criticise-trump-putin-summit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-15T15:21:03Z","webTitle":"'Not welcome': Finnish protesters criticise Trump-Putin summit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/15/not-welcome-finnish-protesters-criticise-trump-putin-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/15/not-welcome-finnish-protesters-criticise-trump-putin-summit","fields":{"headline":"'Not welcome': Finnish protesters criticise Trump-Putin summit","bodyText":"The Finns are proud of hosting some of the cold war’s most historic summits. But many in the country will tell you: don’t call Helsinki “neutral ground”. Protesters came out on Sunday to attack both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin before the controversial summit between the two leaders in the Finnish capital. “Not welcome,” read one sign, held by Hemmo Siponen, showing a cartoon of Trump and Putin embracing. “Fuck you both,” read another carried by two young women. “It doesn’t feel good to have them here,” said Anna Bruun, a civil servant who said she was opposed to “great power politics” playing out in her home city. The country’s largest newspaper has put up English- and Russian-language street adverts saying: “Mr President, welcome to the land of free press.” Helsinki often served as a crucial bridge between the Soviet Union and the US during the cold war. The city was the venue for the 1975 Helsinki accords in which Gerald Ford and Leonid Brezhnev signed a 35-state declaration that called for respect of sovereign territory and human rights. Other notable summits included George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990, and Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin in 1997. “If the result is something in the tradition of those agreements, then it could be very positive, but if it’s something that becomes Munich-Yalta-Helsinki, then that would be catastrophic,” Laura Saarikoski, the US correspondent for the Finland daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, said, referring to talks synonymous with appeasement. Saarikoski and a colleague published an open letter in the newspaper on Sunday that praised the “spirit of Helsinki” as a summer setting conducive to talks, but showed that the hosts would also have their say. “Hopefully everyone will nevertheless understand that European matters can no longer be agreed on over the heads of Europeans,” the letter read. Many here recall the forced Soviet-era neutrality, a policy called Finlandisation, as a dark period in the country’s history. Finland has established its western credentials in the years since the fall of the Soviet Union, with EU membership and an enhanced partnership with Nato. “Finns don’t view themselves as being neutral between east and west,” said Mika Aaltola of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. “Since the end of the cold war, the policy has been that Finland is part of the west. We have built a society that is very solid and unified, world class in terms of many rankings, as a way of getting out of the geographical bind we found ourselves in.” Russia still maintains some strong ties with Finland. Putin has met regularly with the country’s last two prime ministers, and a close associate, Boris Rotenberg, holds Finnish citizenship and business interests in the country. Russia is also the source of important energy projects in the region, including a nuclear power plant and gas pipeline. “I support open dialogue,” said Hemmo Siponen, a protester. “But that should be done in the open. I don’t want backdoor talks to be held here.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2019/oct/16/how-communist-europe-was-swept-by-a-tide-of-change-archive-1989","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2019-10-16T11:25:39Z","webTitle":"How communist Europe was swept by a tide of change - archive, 1989","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2019/oct/16/how-communist-europe-was-swept-by-a-tide-of-change-archive-1989","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2019/oct/16/how-communist-europe-was-swept-by-a-tide-of-change-archive-1989","fields":{"headline":"How communist Europe was swept by a tide of change - archive, 1989","bodyText":"70,000 march in Leipzig to demand changes by Michael Simmons in Berlin 10 October 1989 Up to 70,000 people marched through Leipzig last night demanding reforms. A huge police and paramilitary deployment watched, but did not intervene. Before the march, officials of the Leipzig Communist Party leadership promised publicly they would push for a free exchange of ideas between citizens and the government, Lutheran church sources said. ‘Several thousand’ demonstrators had also gathered in front of an East Berlin church, West German radio reported. Protesters marched through Leipzig shouting: ‘We need freedom’, ‘Democracy’, and ‘No violence’, said witnesses. A number of paramilitary troopers who had been called in chatted with protesters. Mr Christoph Wonneberger, pastor for the Lukas church in Leipzig, said there were ‘at least’ 70,000 demonstrators and he was surprised by the apparent restraint of police and paramilitary troops. Some demonstrators ‘began conversations with paramilitary troops’ after the crowd started dispersing by mid-evening, Mr Wonneberger said. The Leipzig party statement said: ‘We all need a free exchange of ideas about how we should continue Socialism in our nation.’ The message was read over the state-controlled Leipzig radio, during prayer services in four city churches, and over loudspeakers during the demonstration, witnesses said. Last night in East Berlin’s Gethsemane Church, where thousands of protesters have gathered and taken refuge in recent weeks, Bishop Gottfried Forck urged a crowd of 3,000 people to speak their minds, but warned against taking part in ‘unauthorised street demonstrations’. He also implored the Communist leadership to take steps towards a democratic future. Many of the hundreds of demonstrators arrested over the weekend have already been sentenced to up to six months’ imprisonment. Frontier guards at the Checkpoint Charlie and Friedrichstrasse crossing points into East Berlin yesterday physically barred the way to journalists and to many would-be tourists to prevent them even reaching passport control desks. In Dresden, after a weekend of violence, church leaders are seeking a dialogue with the civic authorities. This could make or break the career of the supposed reformist, Mr Hans Modrow, the city’s Communist Party secretary. East German commentators, giving way to the defensive tendencies associated with the leadership, yesterday labelled demonstrators ‘marauding mobs of troublemakers’. However, evidence accumulates that the opposition is growing. Details were released yesterday of the inaugural meeting of a Social Democratic Party. This will anger the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED), since it is itself the result of an amalgamation of the old Communist Party and the then Social Democrats. The SDP meeting was attended by delegates from all over East Germany and appointed a 15-man executive, to be led by a 35-year-old historian, Mr Ibrahim Bohme, who used to be in the SED. The New Forum yesterday called on all East Germans to take steps to replace the country’s leadership. Several hundred trade unionists at the old-established Berlin engineering works, Bergmann-Borsig, have called on the country’s trade union leader, Mr Harry Tisch, to open a dialogue on changes they say are ‘urgently necessary’ in all areas of society. The most radical change in the East bloc since the second world war: Hungarian Communist Party says its farewells to the old Stalinist dogmas by Ian Traynor in Budapest 11 October 1989 The leadership elections for Hungary‘s new Socialist Party ranked as a victory for the moderate middle ground of the party leader, Mr Rezso Nyers, against the more radical reformist wing in personal power terms, but in political philosophy terms the party’s ditching of Communism as its guiding ideology is arguably the most radical statement from the ruling class in Eastern Europe since Stalin stamped his will on the region after the second world war. The new programme, rule book, and historical statement overwhelmingly endorsed by the emergency party congress that ended in the small hours of yesterday morning waved a not too fond farewell to the central dogmas, honed in Moscow, that have governed the region for the past 40 years. No more dictatorship of the proletariat, no more dictatorship of the Politburo either. The latter, formally known as democratic centralism, is replaced by a commitment to freedom of opinion and expression within the new party. Mr Gorbachev has gone this far, too, with his advocacy of ‘socialist pluralism’, but the key difference is that the Hungarians have abjured any right to a ‘leading role’ and committed themselves to a multi-party political system. This is an edited extract. Read the article in full. Commentary: Shivers down the spine of Europe by John Palmer 11 October 1989 The speed and unpredictability of events in eastern Europe are causing almost as many hairs to grey in Brussels as in Berlin or Prague. At both Nato and the European Commission there is no mistaking the misgivings and the growing concern about the pace of change in the East and there is significantly less euphoria than earlier this summer. Of course there are those who revel in the ideological defeat sustained by the ‘Communist’ world and who openly proclaim the West’s final ‘victory’ over the East as a fitting culmination to the 40-year-old confrontation which began with the onset of Cold War in 1948. But this is not the language employed by the more perceptive strategists at NATO headquarters; the talk is more about the danger that the Warsaw Pact may disintegrate before the West has decided what its response should be. To some extent this simply reflects apprehension that if the Warsaw Pact breaks up, the last remaining rationale for Nato’s own existence disappears as well. This partly explains why its secretary general, Mr Manfred Woerner, has tried to make out a case for Nato’s future role being to ‘contain’ even a post-Communist and heavily disarmed Russia which, nonetheless, would remain a significant geo-political power. Of course the Cold War Tweedledum has always depended on the continued existence of Tweedledee. Hence the extravagance of some western ‘Soviet threat’ theorists who are now reduced to basing their case for continued western military preparedness on the danger that an unduly rapid break-up of the Soviet Union itself might destabilise the alliance by encouraging similarly centripetal tendencies in the West. No one in their right mind can dispute the obvious dangers that accompany the traumas in East Germany, Hungary, Poland and parts of the Soviet Union. The threat that a frightened bureaucracy might unleash a European ‘Tiananmen Square’ existed long before Mr Honecker’s thinly veiled warning this week to the democracy movement in the GDR. Quite apart from the risk of an eventual lurch back to violent repression, no one should underestimate the growing economic and social tensions which are to be found as much in those east European countries which have embarked on the road of market liberalisation as in those still clinging to the decaying remnants of a Stalinist command economy. That is why Mr Lech Walesa’s recent warning of the possibility of civil war sent so many shivers down the spine of European Community governments. The Solidarity chief was complaining about the accelerating rate of price increases in Poland – something which goes to the heart of the liberalising strategy being urged on the east Europeans by the West. However the involvement of the European Commission in the economic reform programmes of the authorities in Budapest and Warsaw already goes far beyond the proffering of food aid and economic advice. The Commission, also acting on behalf not just of the west Europeans but of the 24 OECD western industrialised nations, is also helping the Polish and Hungarian governments prepare the wholesale restructuring of their agriculture and industry, using resources created in part by the sale at market prices of surplus EC foodstocks to carry this through. If this strategy goes wrong or if it leads to confrontation with Polish or Hungarian workers in the months and years ahead, the political blame may fall as much on the European Community as on the authorities in Budapest or Prague. But whatever their doubts about economic restructuring, all the signs are that the Hungarians and the Poles want to move politically closer to the European Community. And they are unlikely to be alone in this ambition. The secession-minded Slovene in Yugoslavia have hinted that they would love to march hand in hand with their Austrian neighbours into the EC, while similar noises off are coming from the Baltic states which are, at the same time, planning to cut their economies adrift from the Soviet Union. Meanwhile influential socialist opposition thinkers, such as Boris Kagarlitsky in the Soviet Union and some leaders of the Polish Socialist Party, increasingly talk of a ‘third camp’ strategy between Stalinism and free market capitalism. But they envisage this in terms of democratic planning of the ecology and the environment at a pan-European rather than a purely national level. The Commission’s President, Mr Jacques Delors, does not disguise his alarm at the pace of these developments. Quite apart from the nightmare proportions of the economic and political problems the aspirant east European member states would bring with them to Brussels, he knows that other west European EFTA countries (notably Austria and Norway) are also edging closer to the 12. The conventional wisdom in Brussels is that a new enlargement to absorb the admittedly rich and relatively successful EFTA countries could kill the Community’s own integration plans stone dead. Officials find unthinkable the prospect of also having to integrate east European economies which are bound to remain crisis ridden for years to come. The belief that enlargement is the enemy of European integration is, on the historical evidence, suspect. It is true that the original six EC member states were far more homogeneous economically and politically than the present 12. But the admission of Britain, Denmark and Ireland did force the development of more serious regional and social policies in the EC. The accession of the three Mediterranean countries since then helped trigger the long overdue reform of the Common Agricultural Policy – and directly stimulated the Single European Act and its modest reforms of the Community’s decision making processes. The simple fact is that any further enlargement of the Community – even one involving relatively unproblematic west European countries such as Norway – would make further reform of the EC institutions imperative. And such a reform could only really be in the direction of greater ‘federalism’ given the supranational character of the economic, political and social challenges facing Europe. It is not so much that the EC would extend its authority into areas which are presently the unchallenged preserve of national and (in some countries) regional government. But an enlarged Community would still have to be given greater authority where developments in the real world are continuing to overtake the scope of national states. Mr Delors recognises that if the European Community itself is not the best instrument for a wider and increasing pan-European grouping, some other body will have to be created for just this purpose. But until now no one has dared even sketch out what such a pan-European framework might look like and whether it would subsume interested east Europeans as well as the EC and the six EFTA states. Neither has anyone dared speculate about how far this body would need to have some supranational authority to be of any use. Until the present explosion of opposition to the regime in the GDR, it was just possible to imagine that there was time enough to work out some long-term and gradualist goals for a wider European reunification. What is now happening on the streets of Dresden, Leipzig and East Berlin is dramatically foreshortening that time. East Germans oust Honecker 19 October 1989 by Anna Tomforde in Bonn East Germany yesterday moved to put an end to the most traumatic and agonising crisis in its recent history by replacing Mr Erich Honecker, the country’s ageing leader, with Mr Egon Krenz, the youngest member of the Politburo. But Mr Krenz, aged 52, who was one of the first to applaud the crushing of the democracy movement in China, and even went to Beijing to offer his congratulations, has a reputation as a hardliner. Bulgarian dissidents win temporary green light by Denise Searle and Mike Power in Sofia 23 October 1989 A breath of political fresh air is blowing through the Bulgarian capital as the opposition has won a green light to pursue its activities for the first time in 40 years. Under the protection of a large contingent of foreign diplomats and journalists here for an East-West environmental conference, Bulgaria’s fledgling dissident movement has organised mass meetings and open-air rallies, held press conferences and issued policy statements. Such activities are still small compared with protests in other East European countries, but their scale has taken the authorities and even the dissidents themselves by surprise. Bulgaria’s greens, Ecoglasnost, had by last night collected more than 5,000 signatures after nine consecutive days of campaigning on the streets of central Sofia. A leading member of Ecoglasnost, Beyan Kiurianov, said: ‘It seems we are being tolerated .. while journalists and diplomats from 35 countries are in Sofia. We must speak out while we have the chance.’ Ecoglasnost is protesting against the siting of a nuclear power station on the Danube island of Belene which they say is on an earthquake zone, and also against a project to divert the Mesta River which flows into northern Greece. Reform closes in on Prague By Ian Traynor in Prague 9 November 1989 The Czechoslovak leadership has hoped against hope these past couple of years that President Gorbachev would not last. Now it finds the East Berlin-Prague axis, linking Eastern Europe’s two strongest economies against perestroika, is suddenly in shreds. A deepening and less than splendid isolation is settling over the country. Its fundamentalist leaders are pursuing an unrelenting campaign of repression against their critics while radical changes are afoot all around. The Czechs and Slovaks could watch the cataclysmic events of the past six months in Poland and Hungary with no real inclination to emulate their poverty-stricken neighbours. ‘East Germany is different, unlike Poland, where the motive for change was empty shelves,’ says Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the head of the editorial board of the main underground newspaper. ‘People here regard the GDR with a certain respect and events there now show that the people can overthrow the leadership. The East Berlin-Prague axis is now lost. The leaders here cannot make an axis with Ceausescu or Tirana. These are completely different political cultures.’ E Berlin breaks with 40 years of history by Michael Simmons 9 November 1989 Forty years of history were dramatically swept aside yesterday with the announcement that the ruling East German Communist Party is apparently willing to contest free elections. The fact that the party is now looking at defeat as a distinct possibility represents the most emphatic break yet with the whole trajectory of the country’s post-war history. It had kept power with the help of a ubiquitous state security network, and it was apparently unwilling to take serious notice of the rising tide of popular discontent inside the country or of the meteorological changes outside the country, where reform and change were being swept along by the prevailing wind. Mr Honecker’s closest allies in his last few months were the most notable ‘conservatives’ of the Warsaw Pact - the Czechoslovak leader, Mr Milos Jakes, and the Romanian leader, President Nicolae Ceausescu. The Soviet Union under President Gorbachev, backed up by Hungary and Poland, has ditched the Brezhnev era ‘of stagnation’ once and for all. The East German population who know this all too well from their daily consumption of the West German media have needed no telling that the old men at the top of the GDR belonged very much to that era, if not to the era of Stalin that had gone before. Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Romania are still in the Brezhnev era and will, overtly or covertly, feel that much more isolated as East Germany, until so recently a dependable friend who more or less spoke their language, has moved into a new and palpably different phase. But even in Bulgaria, as the past two weeks have shown, and in Czechoslovakia, there is the sort of underlying discontent, surfacing from time to time in street demonstrations, which Mr Honecker and company chose to ignore. The winds are beginning to be felt in Prague and Sofia as well. This is an edited extract.

Bartley and Berry were strong favourites throughout the campaign to choose the party’s leadership in England and Wales, and won almost 75% of the votes cast. They take over from the previous pairing of Bartley and Caroline Lucas. The Greens have been badly squeezed in recent years, seeing their vote share more than halve between the 2015 and 2017 elections, something put down in part to Corbyn’s approach with Labour. But the new leaders told the Guardian they wanted to counter the idea that Corbyn had moved into their territory, with Berry highlighting what she said was Labour’s equivocation over areas such as Brexit and migration. “It’s not tame – it’s a betrayal. They’ve utterly fudged those issues,” she said. Bartley said: “There’s handwringing over Brexit. They’ve fudged Heathrow and airport expansion, Hinckley and nuclear power. They aren’t committed to proportional representation. The Labour manifesto had no real wealth redistribution in there. There was income redistribution, but they’re not tackling the elephant in the room of wealth distribution. “There’s still this commitment to credit-fuelled growth across the every sector of the economy. There’s subsidies for fossil fuels, subsidies for the commercial arms trade. This is a social democratic party. It’s not the radical alternative the country needs.” In May, Lucas said she would not stand again with the aim of “making space for other people”, while pledging to remain a Green MP. Bartley, leader of the Green opposition on Lambeth council in south London, then joined forces with Berry, also a London councillor, in Camden, and a member of the London assembly. The other two candidates were both standing alone: Shahrar Ali, an academic and former deputy leader; and Leslie Rowe, who stood for parliament for the Greens in Richmond, Yorkshire, in 2005, 2010 and 2015. The party elects its full leadership team every two years. Lucas, the Greens’ sole MP and best-known figure, spent two years as joint leader with Bartley. Berry and Bartley say they hope to raise the profile of Green politicians across the country, such as the new Green lord mayors of Sheffield and Bristol, Magid Magid and Cleo Lake, and councillors newly elected in May’s local polls. Berry said: “In the last couple of years we’ve really demonstrated the role we have in being that voice for communities, of opposition.” The parallel vote for deputy leader saw the incumbent, Amelia Womack, voted in again. Among Womack’s opponents was Aimee Challenor, a 20-year-old activist from Coventry who served as the Greens’ equality spokeswoman, and was seeking to become the first trans person to take the role. However, Challenor quit the race and has since left the party following the conviction last month of her father, David – who was also her election agent – for torturing and raping a child at the family home. One of the most pressing tasks facing Bartley and Berry is to oversee an independent inquiry into safeguarding lessons from the case, notably why the party took no action against David Challenor for 18 months after he was charged with the offences, for which he was jailed for 22 years. His first court appearance over the allegations took place in November 2016. But before the trial, which began in August this year, he acted twice as his daughter’s election agent, at the 2017 general election and in May’s local polls. During this period he was allowed to remain active in the party, even though the Coventry Pride charity, for which he had volunteered, barred him after the first court appearance. As well as the inquiry into the case, due to report in November, the new leaders are awaiting the result of a previously-established review into the Greens’ organisational structures. Bartley said: “Our platform was very clear when we stood – that we want to professionalise the party.” Bartley and Berry must also seek to reinvigorate it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2017/may/19/crossrail-hs2-hinkley-point-infrastructure-measuring-success-megaprojects","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-19T06:09:48Z","webTitle":"How to measure success in the world of megaprojects | Jane Dudman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2017/may/19/crossrail-hs2-hinkley-point-infrastructure-measuring-success-megaprojects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2017/may/19/crossrail-hs2-hinkley-point-infrastructure-measuring-success-megaprojects","fields":{"headline":"Why size matters: measuring success in the world of megaprojects","bodyText":"Crossrail, HS2, Hinkley Point C nuclear power station: three massive infrastructure projects, costing billions of taxpayers’ money, and all subject to controversial and time-consuming debate before getting the go-ahead. But were these megaprojects in fact easier to get politicians to approve than other, smaller investments in UK infrastructure and transport? That is the intriguing notion put forward by Isabel Dedring, global transport leader at Arup and London’s former deputy mayor for transport. At a recent seminar on whether bigger infrastructure projects really are better, Dedring told the audience this is often the case, politically, at least. Why should this be so? Bridget Rosewell, a commissioner at the National Infrastructure Commission and one of the other panellists at the seminar hosted by the Institute for Government thinktank, pointed out that there’s plenty of analysis to show that smaller, more incremental infrastructure and transport projects work better, because it is easier to gauge their impact. Dedring also demolished the notion of the “glory project” – the idea that politicians approve big projects so they get to cut the ribbon on, say, a power station. As she noted, the one certainty on any really big project is that someone else will take that moment of glory, because by the time it gets built, the politician who approved it will have long moved on. The counter argument is that since all infrastructure projects produce protest, politicians might as well put all their eggs in a single basket. “The noise politically generated by small projects is much greater in relation to their size,” noted Dedring, in part because it’s easier to get people together to mobilise against smaller projects. “And politicians understand that.” What’s more, once the ball does finally get rolling on a megaproject, it’s then pretty hard to stop. It may move on to the back burner for a while, Crossrail being one example, but big projects, noted Rosewell, get that advantage of “continuing, rolling time”. And if your favoured project isn’t already huge, make it an indispensable part of a megaproject. That was the tip from Ed Hoffman, the former chief knowledge officer at Nasa, who is now a strategic adviser at US-based non-profit project management specialist PMI. Hoffman said when he was at Nasa, smart project leaders running small projects used to protect themselves by demonstrating their tremendous value to a key mission, preferably one with international interest. “The ones that get threatened are those that go over-budget and are not part of a key mission and have no international collaboration,” he said. “Once you have an international project, it’s harder to kill.” One obvious example is Hinkley Point C, which is being built by French nuclear contractor EDF and its Chinese partners. The contract for the new power station was signed in September 2016 by UK business secretary Greg Clark, alongside Jean-Bernard Lévy, the chair of EDF, and He Yu, chair of China General Nuclear, who said the programme was a “triple win for China, Britain, and France” and the culmination of years of cooperation between the three countries. Many people might think the biggest risk with megaprojects is the financial risk, but that is manageable, according to these experts. Far harder to manage is the social and political risk, not to mention the challenge of bringing together hundreds of experts in different fields and getting them to collaborate, as is the case at Nasa, for instance. The danger, pointed out Hoffman, was each of those experts focusing on their own subject, and leaving everyone else to do theirs. But to achieve real results, he said, everyone has to collaborate and communicate. Rosewell agreed – getting different experts in a room collaborating was, she said, “most exciting”. Managing that process, agreed Dedring, is the key skill in running megaprojects.

The influential Commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee said that any gap between the UK leaving a European atomic power treaty and entering into secure alternative deals would “severely inhibit nuclear trade and research and threaten power supplies”. The cross-party group of MPs said it shared the nuclear industry’s concern that it would take more than two years to hammer out a new deal for regulating nuclear power stations and trade. It urged the government to delay exit from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) or set up transitional arrangements, which may need to be longer than the three years proposed by the European parliament. In a stark warning, Iain Wright, the committee’s chair, said: “The impact of Brexit on Euratom has not been thought through. The government has failed to consider the potentially severe ramifications of its Brexit objectives for the nuclear industry. Ministers must act as urgently as possible. The repercussions of failing to do so are huge. The continued operations of the UK nuclear industry are at risk.” The committee’s report echoed a warning from nuclear energy lawyers that leaving Euratom without a new deal would see the trade in nuclear fuel grind to a halt and could ultimately force Britain’s reactors to switch off. A former government adviser had told the committee that the UK nuclear industry would be “crippled” if new nuclear cooperation deals are not agreed within two years. The Euratom treaty promotes uniform safety standards, cooperation and research into nuclear power. Justin Bowden, national officer of the GMB union, said the committee’s warning “yet again emphasises our government’s lack of anything that could be called a coherent energy policy. “In a world outside of the European Union, energy self-sufficiency is common sense and nuclear, alongside gas, will be fundamental in that reliable mix,” he said. “Decisive action must take place now. The electorate will not forgive politicians of any political party who fail in their duty to maintain the electricity supply.” Wright said: “The prime minister has made it politically unfeasible to remain in Euratom long term. The government now has a responsibility to end the uncertainty hanging over the industry and ensure robust and stable arrangements to protect trade, boost research and development, and ensure safeguarding of the highest level.” The government argues that the UK must leave Euratom following Theresa May’s triggering of article 50 on 29 March, but the committee notes that legal opinion is divided. MPs are concerned that in the long run, the UK will become a “rule taker” – complying with but unable to influence European rules and standards. The committee warns that if UK standards diverge too far from those in the EU, Britain could become a dumping ground for energy-inefficient products. MPs are also worried that Brexit could distract the government from achieving emissions reduction targets, enshrined in domestic law. The committee’s report recommends maintaining access to the internal energy market and retaining membership of the emissions trading system until 2020 at least. Alternatives include retaining unrestricted energy trade between the UK and the EU, or seeking third party access to the market. The University of Cambridge suggested that energy cooperation could be reframed as an issue of security rather than trade, and an energy security treaty could be established with neighbouring countries. “We believe that membership of the internal energy market has been beneficial to UK and EU consumers and has helped provide flexibility and certainty to the supply of energy,” MPs said. “We therefore agree with the government’s intention to retain as free as possible access to this market and the intention to remain an influential player on energy in the EU. “While there are undoubtedly weaknesses in the operation of some EU policies on energy and climate change, notably the EU emissions trading system, the secretary of state, Greg Clark, acknowledged that cooperation with EU partners was generally mutually beneficial. The UK has consistently been a driver of high standards and ambitious climate change targets.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2019/may/10/australian-election-2019-full-list-of-micro-parties-standing-in-the-senate","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-10T01:49:17Z","webTitle":"Australian election 2019: how to avoid voting for a terrible micro party in the Senate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/10/australian-election-2019-full-list-of-micro-parties-standing-in-the-senate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2019/may/10/australian-election-2019-full-list-of-micro-parties-standing-in-the-senate","fields":{"headline":"Australian election 2019: how to avoid voting for a terrible micro party in the Senate","bodyText":"Unlike Malcolm Turnbull’s 2016 double dissolution gamble, the upcoming federal poll is only a half-Senate election. While neither major party is likely to gain a majority in the upper house, it is unlikely the Senate will be as diverse as the 45th parliament because successful candidates will need a larger quota to be elected. There are, however, still dozens of minor and micro parties standing for election on 18 May.

Thirteen children have been born missing hands, forearms or arms in three rural areas of France between 2007 and 2017. The public health authorities had initially said the incidences of abnormality were “probably down to chance”. But doctors at a research organisation said the likelihood of it being coincidental was “more than infinitesimal” and demanded a full investigation. They believe the clusters may be linked to the use of pesticides and described the French authorities’ lack of action as a “health scandal”. Emmanuelle Amar, an epidemiologist and director of the group Remera told the Guardian it would be scientifically remiss not to continue research. “These malformations are very rare, but also very specific. There is something, some product, that is cutting the limbs at the time the embryo is developing. We must search for it. We must ask ourselves, what could be capable of halting this development and find it.” Amar said the most likely cause of the anomalies was “environmental or medical”, but warned against making presumptions. “We have to have a social conscience. These are future children, future generations we are talking about, but they are also individual human dramas,” she added. The phenomenon was first reported near the village of Druillat in the Ain department of eastern France, where seven babies were born without arms, forearms or hands between 2009 and 2014. All lived within a 10.5-mile (17km) radius of the village in an area where maize or sunflowers were cultivated. Three years later, three children were reported to have been born with similar birth defects between 2007 and 2008 in the town of Mouzeil in the Loire-Atlantique department of western France. In 2015, it was reported a further three children had been born with the same problems in the town of Guidel in Brittany between 2011 and 2013. The public health authority Santé Publique France said about 150 babies a year in total were born with similar disfigurements in France. The authority said the situation was “tragic” for the families concerned, but it declared the number of cases in the Ain department to be within the national average. However, it said the Loire-Atlantique and Brittany cases suggested an unusual cluster. François Bourdillon, the authority’s director, said the families involved had been spoken to. “We have listened to their parents and their grandparents and visited their homes. No environmental factor – pesticides, for example – can be blamed,” he said. “We have not identified a common exposure to the occurrence of these malformations.” In a statement, Santé Publique France said it had closed its investigation into the cases. “The absence of a hypothesis of a possible common cause does not make it possible to hold further investigations,” it said. Amar said the authority’s conclusion was not acceptable and that the number of babies born with similar disfigurements in the Ain department was “58 times higher than what we would normally expect”. “We’re saying to families that they’ll have to live with questions and that it’s just bad luck,” she said. Remera said it had carried out its own investigation into the cases in the Ain, speaking to the mothers concerned to establish if there were any common factors. They have ruled out genetic causes as well as links to medication, food or alcohol consumed during pregnancies. They found no pattern of behaviour among the mothers. “We interviewed all the mothers with a very extensive questionnaire on their lifestyle. The only thing they have in common is that they all live in a very rural area.” Possible links to agriculture have been bolstered by reports that several calves were born missing tails and ribs at Chalamont, another village in the Ain department, at the time the cluster of disfigured babies occurred. “It is believed that this revolves around agriculture,” Amar said, adding that it was vital for national health officials to launch a full investigation. She said Remera was facing funding cuts and could not continue looking into the clusters on its own. Céline Figueiredo, whose four-year-old son Sacha was born in the Ain without a hand, said: “I am outraged that no investigation has yet been launched. We have the means in France to investigate the causes of these malformations. They must try to give us answers rather than cover up the cases.” Yannick Jadot, a former Green party presidential candidate and member of the European parliament, said he was “absolutely scandalised”. “What we seem to be ignoring is that it’s very likely these malformations are linked to pesticides,” he told RTL radio. “We have never wanted to know in France; we don’t want to do epidemiology studies around [waste] incinerators, around nuclear power stations, or on pesticides, because, once again, we don’t want to know.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/apr/22/edf-delays-hinkley-point-c-project-until-summer","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-22T22:04:55Z","webTitle":"EDF delays Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/22/edf-delays-hinkley-point-c-project-until-summer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/apr/22/edf-delays-hinkley-point-c-project-until-summer","fields":{"headline":"EDF delays Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant","bodyText":"The Hinkley Point C nuclear plant, at the heart of government energy plans, has been hit by fresh delays in another blow to confidence surrounding an already troubled project. EDF, the French energy company promoting the £18bn reactor scheme, admitted there would be no final investment decision at least till the summer, leading the environmental group Greenpeace to claim the project is “coming to a grinding halt”. The latest setback comes less than a week after the French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, told the BBC that the project would be given the go-ahead in the “coming week or month”. EDF was itself aiming to be able to give the green light at the company’s annual general meeting on 12 May but has bowed to pressure from employees to consult an internal union-management council. The company said in a statement after a board meeting: “The board has decided to undertake a formal, non-binding consultation process with the comité central d’enterprise. This is [a] well understood statutory process of 60 days and the company will work with the CCE to define the detailed steps to reach a conclusion this summer.” The scheme to build new reactors in Somerset has been dogged by delays and disputes since a formal signing in front of David Cameron last October, when work was said to be ready to begin within days. But alarm has grown inside EDF, which is 85% owned by the French government, about the scale of its future financial commitments and debts at a time of plunging power prices and difficulties with other projects. Hinkley has attracted criticism in Britain from a range of sources including the City for being seen as an overly-expensive project. The government has promised to pay £92.50 per megawatt hour for the power over 35 years - double the current cost. Ministers say the scheme, which could provide 7% of UK electricity, represents value for money in the longterm and can help lower UK carbon emissions. Thomas Piquemal, EDF’s finance director, resigned last month after the company refused to agree to postpone investment till solutions were found to a series of issues. There have been warnings from senior engineers about whether the new design of European pressurised reactors (EPRs) planned for Hinkley will be successful amid delays and cost overruns at a similar project, Flamanville, in France. Meanwhile the French unions, which have representatives on the board of the company, have been campaigning internally and externally for the project to be postponed until EDF’s financial stability is assured. Jean-Bernard Lévy, the EDF chief executive, earlier tried to allay fears by promising there would be no go-ahead for Hinkley without the French government first giving financial help to the company. On Friday it indicated it had got this, saying in a statement: “Confirmation of the significant recapitalisation of EDF agreed by the board makes it possible for EDF to proceed with its strategic investment programme – including Hinkley Point C.” It added: “Today’s announcement underlines EDF’s solid commitment to its CAP 2030 [investment] strategy including the Hinkley Point C project and has provided it with a solid financial footing notwithstanding the challenges of current market conditions.” But John Sauven, the Greenpeace director, said the latest delay showed that EDF was in an “utter mess.” He added: “Delays to EDF making a decision about whether to invest in Hinkley are nothing new. So much so that it’s been 14 months since it was first said that the decision would be coming imminently. But this latest delay from EDF is different. President Hollande, the French economy minister and EDF’s CEO have all very publicly promised the UK government a final decision before 12 May. “Backtracking on this pledge now is symbolic of the utter mess that EDF is in. But even if they could agree a finance package it could be declared illegal state aid by the European commission. This may now be the sign that the entire project is coming to a grinding halt and the UK government urgently needs to back renewable energy as a more reliable alternative.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/sep/22/snape-maltings-benjamin-britten-footsreps-suffolk-walk-to-aldeburgh","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-09-22T08:00:18Z","webTitle":"Walking in Benjamin Britten's footsteps, Suffolk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/sep/22/snape-maltings-benjamin-britten-footsreps-suffolk-walk-to-aldeburgh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/sep/22/snape-maltings-benjamin-britten-footsreps-suffolk-walk-to-aldeburgh","fields":{"headline":"Walking in Benjamin Britten's footsteps, Suffolk","bodyText":"Just a few yards separate the doors of Snape Maltings from the Alde marshes. They pass from modern concert hall to utter serenity. Music and place do not always make happy partners, but the music of Benjamin Britten is infused with this Suffolk coast. I once heard the high-pitched chords of his Sea Interludes drift out of a rehearsal and settle among the reeds rustling in the water, in perfect harmony with nature. The walk from Snape to the seashore at Aldeburgh is a walk through sound. The old malting barns were used for drying beer barley until 1965, when Britten realised they would make an excellent concert venue. Despite their going up in flames on the opening night in 1969, they have become an enclave for the study and performance of music. They sit isolated on the Alde estuary, surrounded by salt marshes, reed beds, heather heath and wide Suffolk skies. For scenery, I normally prefer the restless contours of western Britain, but here is East Anglia’s response. As Graham Swift says in his 1983 novel, Waterland, it is a landscape which “of all landscapes most approximates to nothing”. It is not a place of dramatic hills and vistas, rather the slow accumulation of sensory enchantment. The view towards the sea from the Maltings terrace is of a river delta, meandering between reeds and tidal mud banks. The walk should start with a wander along the paths directly in front of the concert hall, where the grasses whisper and the curlews call. On rising land to the south, the only sign of habitation is Iken church tower, standing on its promontory as it has since the middle ages. The six-mile path along the estuary to Aldeburgh is named the Sailors’ Path, from the route taken by mariners between Snape village and the beach at Aldeburgh. It starts over the bridge next to the Maltings, initially along the river’s northern bank, which would have been Britten’s “walk to work”. Now in the care of the RSPB, this is a land of water birds, of redshank, avocet, lapwing, snipe and, overhead, the occasional marsh harrier. But it is the cry of the curlew that most evokes Britten’s ear, inspiration for his mystic oratorio, Curlew River. His strings, which can often seem thin and cold in the concert hall, here seem the ideal accompaniment to scenery. The path detours round the edge of Snape Warren nature reserve, with views back to the Maltings. In an early mist their distinctive chimneys float like clipper ships, with gulls curving round their topsails. The warren itself is a wilderness of heather and scrub oak, giving into carefully rewilded woodland. We rejoin the Sailors’ Path and plunge into Black Heath wood, predominantly silver birch and part of an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, continuing until we reach the road into Aldeburgh. A detour north by the golf course leads into the town by way of the Red House, Britten’s home with his partner Peter Pears for the last 20 years of their life together. It is open to the public, with a small library and exhibition space (open March to October, £5.50, under 16s free). Aldeburgh church contains one of John Piper’s finest windows, in memory of Britten. The church is a venue for concerts in the Aldeburgh festival, which he and Pears founded. Unlike the bucket-and-spade resorts of England’s south and west coast, East Anglia’s settlements are places apart. They seem to be still wrestling a living from an unyielding sea and blasted by an east wind. Aldeburgh had no harbour, just the steep slope of its shingle, guarding the old high street from the sea like a defensive rampart. This beach runs over a mile from the outlet of the Alde north to the smart resort of Thorpeness and is itself a classic maritime walk. In the far distance lurks the indelicate outline of Sizewell nuclear power station. A few remaining fishermen’s boats are still dragged up on to the shingle, where storage huts maintain a dogged presence. They bring us back to Britten. His opera, Peter Grimes, was set in part on this beach, and in 2013 was even performed here. At dusk we can imagine the lonely, angry Grimes, accused of murder by the townspeople, stamping across the stones, torn between the scorn of “the borough” and the tempestuous sea. Britten’s surging music echoes the ebb and flow of waves on the shingle. It forms a disturbing contrast to the soft cadences of the Alde marshes behind us. • The 2019 Aldeburgh festival is on 7-23 June, snapemaltings.co.uk Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Ministers have ordered an inquiry headed by the former boss of National Grid to find out why the procurement process was so flawed. Labour said the payout showed “dramatic levels of incompetence”. The government body tasked with decommissioning old reactors will also terminate the contract it awarded for cleaning up a dozen of the UK’s old nuclear sites nine years early. In a written statement, Greg Clark, business secretary, said: “This was a defective procurement, with significant financial consequences, and I am determined that the reasons for it should be exposed and understood; that those responsible should properly be held to account; and that it should never happen again.” The debacle dates back to a 2012-2014 tender process by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) for dismantling 12 sites. They include old reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk, Dungeness in Kent and Hinkley Point in Somerset, where the UK is building the first new nuclear power station in two decades. A 14-year deal was awarded to international consortium Cavendish Fluor Partnership in 2014, but the bidders who lost out immediately launched a legal challenge. On Monday, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it had settled with US-headquartered engineering companies Energy Solutions and Bechtel, for £85m and £12.5m respectively. Had their litigation cases gone to trial, Clark said the “very substantial costs” had the potential to rise much further. Energy Solutions had claimed a scoring mechanism had changed at a late stage in the tender process and that there was inconsistency in the way bids were evaluated, among other failings. Former National Grid chief executive Steve Holliday has been appointed to lead an independent inquiry into what went wrong. The inquiry will look at how the mistakes were made and by who, how the litigation was handled, and the relationship between the NDA and the government departments. Holliday will report to Clark, with an interim report due to published in October. The government now has the daunting task of starting a new tendering process for the 12 sites, as the deal with Cavendish Fluor Partnership will end early, in September 2019 instead of 2028. Clark said he wanted to stress the deal was “no reflection” on the performance of the consortium, which will continue clean-up work over the next two years. The contract is being terminated early because the NDA underestimated the scale of the decommissioning required to clean up the Magnox sites, which form part of the UK’s first generation of nuclear power stations. The share price of Babcock International Group, which has a stake in the Cavendish Fluor Partnership, has fallen by more than 3% since the government announcement. Rebecca Long-Bailey, shadow energy secretary, said: “By cancelling just two years into a 14-year contact the government has shown dramatic levels of incompetence in the procurement process of this deal. “British tax payers who stand to lose nearly £100m should be asking themselves not just whether they are willing to put up such ineptitude but also whether the government actually has a well thought out and long term nuclear decommissioning strategy.” Unions said they were concerned at any potential job losses as a result of the contract ending early. Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect, said: “This is an extraordinary situation given the scale and importance of the Magnox contract to the UK nuclear industry. “The public, and our members, will want reassurance that the termination process and uncertainty over the future of decommissioning will not lead to standards deteriorating or the loss of UK expertise.” The Unite union said the financial mess involved in awarding the contract showed the clean-up project should be taken into public ownership. Stephen Thomas, emeritus professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, branded the NDA’s handling of the contract “an immense screw-up.” He added that there would be a further hit to the taxpayer because of the cost of a new tender. The NDA has an annual budget of £3.1bn, two thirds of which is spent on Sellafield in Cumbria, which stores most of Britain’s nuclear waste."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/sep/17/coal-comeback-could-drive-up-annual-uk-energy-emissions-report","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-09-17T15:54:53Z","webTitle":"Coal comeback could drive up UK energy emissions – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/17/coal-comeback-could-drive-up-annual-uk-energy-emissions-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/sep/17/coal-comeback-could-drive-up-annual-uk-energy-emissions-report","fields":{"headline":"Coal comeback could drive up UK energy emissions – report","bodyText":"Britain’s ability to meet its emissions targets is being challenged by a comeback for coal power stations that threatens to drive up the energy sector’s carbon emissions for the first time in six years. Coal plants have become more economic to run than their gas counterparts in the past month because wholesale gas prices have hit 10-year highs. A report by Imperial College London said the extra coal-burning had increased emissions by 15% in September, equivalent to an extra 1,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per hour. If the trend continues in the coming months, the sector’s emissions would rise by as much as 1.2 million tonnes this year, according to researchers at the university. The energy sector is the UK’s second biggest emitter after transport. However, it has been the economy’s standout success for cutting emissions in recent years because of the rapid growth in renewables and the phaseout of coal. A reversal of that success, even if only temporary, could pose a dilemma for ministers, who have to meet legally-binding carbon targets. The UK’s carbon budgets, set by the Committee on Climate Change in order to meet the long-term goal of an 80% cut in emissions by 2050, dictate how much the country can emit over five-year periods. The UK is due to easily meet its third carbon budget, which runs from 2018-2023, but any prolonged rise in energy emissions would make future budgets harder to hit. Dr Iain Staffell, the author of the Imperial College London report, said: “If the only thing that has done well starts to backslide, I think that’s going to be a real problem in meeting these [carbon] targets because they’re just ratcheting up and getting more and more difficult.” The recent increase in coal-burning is likely to continue this year because gas prices are usually higher in winter because of increased demand for heating. Analysts expect gas prices will stay high this winter. “I think there’s a pretty good worry that we’re looking at up to six months of coal being the cheapest source,” Staffell said. Consumers are unlikely to benefit from coal being cheaper but coal operators would see their profits boosted this year, he said. The resurgence represents mixed news for EDF Energy, RWE and SSE as they all operate both coal and gas plants. However it will be good news for Germany’s Uniper, which operates the Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal power plant in Nottinghamshire, and the energy group Drax, which commissioned the research by Imperial College London. While four of Drax’s six units have converted to biomass, two still burn coal. The market intelligence firm ICIS said that it expected coal would account for 10.5% of electricity generation this winter, up from 10% last year. However, it warned that figure could go up significantly if there was a repeat of last winter’s ”Beast from the east” cold spell, or further outages at French nuclear power stations, which the UK relies on via links across the English Channel. “If similar capacity issues or a cold snap were to be seen again this winter, we could expect the forecast 10.5% share of coal to increase significantly,” the group told the Guardian. Coal’s comeback off high gas prices comes despite two coal power stations shutting later this month and EU carbon prices at 10-year highs. The UK has yet to say whether it will stay within the EU emissions trading system (ETS) when it leaves the EU but the energy industry has lobbied the government to stay in the scheme, which is the world’s biggest carbon market. Even if the UK leaves the ETS, coal operators would still have to pay the UK’s tax on dirty energy generators, called the carbon price floor, which has been frozen until 2025. The last time coal enjoyed the highs of recent weeks was the short-lived windfall for coal plant owners during the “Beast from the East” in February and March. During the cold snap, sudden and high demand for heating caused gas prices to surge, making coal power stations competitive against gas ones. However, coal remains on the way out in the UK. The government is committed to phasing out coal power by 2025 to meet its climate goals and the viability of most of the remaining plants rests on securing government subsidies to provide backup power at times of need."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/aug/28/french-environment-minister-quits-live-on-radio-with-anti-macron-broadside","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-28T12:13:24Z","webTitle":"French environment minister quits live on radio with anti-Macron broadside","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/28/french-environment-minister-quits-live-on-radio-with-anti-macron-broadside","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/aug/28/french-environment-minister-quits-live-on-radio-with-anti-macron-broadside","fields":{"headline":"French environment minister quits live on radio with anti-Macron broadside","bodyText":"Emmanuel Macron’s climate commitment to “make this planet great again” has come under attack after his environment minister dramatically quit, saying the French president was not doing enough to meet environmental goals. Nicolas Hulot, a celebrity environmentalist and former TV presenter, announced on a radio breakfast show that he was leaving the government over “an accumulation of disappointments” with its measures to tackle climate change, defend biodiversity and address other environmental threats. Hulot’s departure is a major blow to Macron and calls into question the president’s credibility on the environment. Though he did not make environmental issues a major part of his election manifesto last year, he subsequently attempted to push them to the forefront as a symbol of progressive politics and to counter Donald Trump’s decision to take the US out of the Paris climate accord. Hulot, who was one of the most popular ministers in government, told French radio the “mini steps” taken by France and other nations to slow global warming and avert a collapse of biodiversity were inadequate. “I don’t want to create the illusion that we’re facing up to it,” he said. “I can’t lie to myself any more.” Emmanuel Macron responded by claiming that his government had “done more than any other on this subject”, saying people must be patient. “It’s a fight that isn’t won from one day to the next,” Macron said. Hulot announced his departure after the government said it would relax hunting laws, a measure aimed at boosting Macron’s appeal in rural areas, but seen by environmentalists as caving in to the powerful hunting lobby. Under the changes, hunting licences would be cheaper and more species could be shot, sparking outrage among campaigners for the protection of birds. Hulot said lobbies had too much power over the French government. Hulot’s differences with the government had been exposed in recent months. He had been disappointed when the government backtracked on a target to reduce reliance on nuclear power to 50% of the country’s energy mix by 2025. He had also sought a legal ban on the controversial weedkiller glyphosate but was overruled by the agriculture ministry, which preferred negotiating directly with farmers and industry. The government was taken by surprise by Hulot’s announcement live on radio. Macron, who was beginning a visit to Denmark, was not informed beforehand. The Elysée, asked about Hulot’s concern over the influence of lobbyists, said the government listened to people but made decisions in the general interest. The departure of Hulot, seen as a major figure on the left, threatens to upset Macron’s delicate political balancing act, trying to style himself as a centrist who can appeal to both left and right in France. He has lost support on the left in recent weeks and his approval ratings have dipped as he struggles to shake off the label “president of the rich”. Over the summer, he faced the first major political scandal of his presidency when a senior security aide was filmed violently assaulting a young man and woman at the edge of a Paris demonstration. “The most basic of courtesies would have been to warn the president of the republic and the prime minister,” government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told the BFM news channel after Hulot quit. Richard Ferrand, the head of the parliamentary group of Macron’s party, La République En Marche, said politicians and the government had worked hard with Hulot to meet climate challenges. “We’ll keep going with the same determination,” he added. Hulot was formerly the star presenter of the hit environmental TV programme Ushuaïa and had turned down offers to enter government by previous French presidents. In February, he denied a magazine report of a historic allegation of sexual assault made against him by a woman in the 1990s. After the anti-nuclear Hulot quit, shares in French state power company EDF rose more than 2% in early trading. Hulot had repeatedly said EDF must close up to a third of its 58 reactors to reduce the share of nuclear energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/nov/24/nissan-crisis-new-light-japan-inc-awkward-secrets-carlos-ghosn","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-24T16:00:43Z","webTitle":"Nissan crisis sheds new light on Japan Inc’s awkward secrets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/24/nissan-crisis-new-light-japan-inc-awkward-secrets-carlos-ghosn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/nov/24/nissan-crisis-new-light-japan-inc-awkward-secrets-carlos-ghosn","fields":{"headline":"Nissan crisis sheds new light on Japan Inc’s awkward secrets","bodyText":"Even as Carlos Ghosn sits alone in a tiny cell, with just 30 minutes of daily exercise to break the monotony of detention, Japan has found it hard to muster a shred of sympathy for a man hailed as a colossus of the global car industry until his rapid downfall just five days ago. But however badly the affair reflects on the former chairman of Nissan as a business leader, his arrest last week over allegations of “significant financial misconduct” raises equally serious questions about the health of Japan’s corporate culture. Critics have attributed the scandal to the executive’s imperious personality and the lure of personal enrichment, after prosecutors arrested Ghosn on allegations of understating his income in financial statements by ¥5bn (£35m) over a five-year period. But that is only part of the story, according to Sarah Parsons, managing director of Japan In Perspective, a business consultancy supporting Japanese firms in the UK. “While corporate governance scandals are not unique to Japan, there are certainly unique cultural factors that mean bad business behaviour is allowed to fester in Japan,” she says. Parsons blames poor corporate oversight and the dominance on Japanese boards of company “insiders” – almost always middle-aged men who have formed impenetrable networks during careers spent working for the same company. Instead of exercising vigilance against potential wrongdoing, employees – even those at senior level – are expected to maintain harmony and avoid gaining a reputation as a troublemaker. “Given the strict hierarchies in Japanese society, expecting individuals to blow the whistle on their peers – or, even worse, their seniors – is a cultural no-no,” Parsons says. “The consensus-driven and long-winded nature of Japanese decision making has in some cases led to a lack of willingness to be accountable and a tendency to avoid the consequences until forced.” Michael Woodford understands that better than most. Seven years ago he was lauded by some as a champion of corporate transparency when, soon after becoming the first foreign chief executive of Olympus, he exposed systematic accounting fraud at the Japanese medical imaging company. His colleagues, however, viewed him with contempt – a pariah who in his role as chief whistleblower had breached Japan Inc’s code of silence. As it turned out, the Olympus scandal was a mere foretaste of what was to come. Four years later, Toshiba, which makes items ranging from laptops to nuclear power plants, revealed that it had hugely overstated its operating profits, ultimately by almost $1.2bn (£940m). Last year the car parts maker Takata filed for bankruptcy protection after deadly faults in its airbags triggered the industry’s biggest-ever safety recall. More recently, Kobe Steel admitted falsifying data about the strength and durability of its aluminium and copper products, which are used in the transport and defence industries. And last month, KYB, a Tokyo-based hydraulics firm, admitted falsifying inspection data for equipment used to protect hundreds of buildings from major earthquakes, including venues for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. There is much that differentiates the Ghosn case from other Japanese business scandals. The evidence against him was reportedly built around information from a Nissan whistleblower – proof, according to some observers, that western-style post-Olympus checks of power are beginning to take hold in Japan. In addition, the allegations centre on an individual rather than a company-wide attempt to cover up wrongdoing. But despite Nissan’s attempts to contain the fallout from their former chairman’s disgrace, questions were being asked about its internal governance, even as its chief executive, Hiroto Saikawa, portrayed the firm as a victim of “the dark side of the Ghosn era”. “Corporate governance was clearly dysfunctional in Nissan when Ghosn was almighty,” says Koichi Nakano, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo. “The board members were not acting responsibly when the alleged offences were committed, and they are still not acting responsibly now by placing all the blame on Ghosn.” After digesting the tumultuous events of the previous few days, Japanese newspapers were united in their disgust at the Ghosn allegations, but hurled similar invective in the direction of the Nissan executives who have now turned on their former chairman. The Asahi Shimbun urged Nissan to fully disclose the results of its internal investigation into Ghosn and Greg Kelly, an American representative director who has also been arrested over the affair. “The company is in danger of falling into dysfunction unless it does its best to disclose whatever it can to its shareholders and comes up with measures to deal with the current crisis,” the newspaper said. Attempts by Japan’s prime minister, Shinzō Abe, to introduce measures designed to improve corporate governance and shore up Japan’s reputation among overseas investors have had mixed results. Since he began revamping the corporate code in 2014 – the “third arrow” of his Abenomics growth strategy – there are signs that firms are being more responsive to long-ignored activist shareholders, and there are more outsiders sitting on company boards. But the changes have done little to address either the culture of secrecy or the strict hierarchical management structures that encourage misconduct, says Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University in Tokyo. “Corporate governance in Japan remains elusive because corporate culture here remains parochial and dominated by insiders,” he says. “Boards provide spotty oversight because they embrace an averted-eyes approach to their duties in the ‘get along, go along’ ways of Japan Inc. “It’s laughable to imagine that Abe’s hesitant small steps towards improved corporate governance are what brought Ghosn down. “Ghosn’s hubris, his hogging of the limelight, and his massive compensation angered other Nissan executives, who waited for the right time to take their revenge.” As the appetite wanes for heaping scorn on Ghosn for his personal shortcomings and his disdain for the “Japanese qualities” of modesty, restraint, teamwork and egalitarianism, the focus is expected to shift to the criminal investigation and what, if anything, Japan’s corporate world is doing to salvage its battered reputation. Part of the solution, says Parsons, lies in making Japanese company boards more diverse. “Any real movement to change the corporate culture so more women can operate at a board level with equal levels of authority would certainly create a seismic shift in the way Japan does business,” she says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/11/trump-diplomacy-kim-jong-un-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T10:57:48Z","webTitle":"Trump’s vulgarity could be the one diplomatic style Kim Jong-un understands | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/11/trump-diplomacy-kim-jong-un-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/11/trump-diplomacy-kim-jong-un-north-korea","fields":{"headline":"Trump’s vulgarity could be the one diplomatic style Kim Jong-un understands","bodyText":"A battered phoenix is struggling to rise from the ashes of the G7 fiasco. It is diplomacy, Trump-style. The American president in Singapore today appears determined, against all odds, to cut some sort of deal to denuclearise North Korea. To him, the G7 summit in Canada was a pointless gathering of political toffs. North Korea is different. He has made it his own. Having proposed a deal, then cancelled it, then proposed it again, failure would be glaring. Donald Trump’s diplomacy would be fascinating were it not so dangerous. Dealings between modern states are about rules and courtesies for a good reason. They are better than war. Trump left Québec insulting his host as “dishonest” and a back-stabber, and scattering blood-curdling threats of trade sanctions at his closest allies. What he was really doing was calling their bluff. To him, G7’s cosy chats are a waste of time, not least because the two powers that really matter, Russia and China, are not there. The Korea stand-off has long been a blot on the face of diplomacy, resulting in the emergence of the world’s most alarming nuclear power. Whether it “threatens” the US may be moot, but it is unfinished business, and America’s (and China’s) responsibility. Traditional diplomacy has failed for half a century to curb the world’s most vainglorious tyranny. Why not try Trump diplomacy? Kim Jong-un is reportedly desperate to relieve his country of economic strangulation, with his Chinese backers turning against him. He has won as much global attention as he needs with nuclear weapons. They are plainly unusable. Meanwhile his citizens are fed up with seeing their cousins in the south prospering. It can’t go on. Kim’s people might love him all the more if he brought them peace and prosperity. Can Trump pander to this man’s vanity, while understanding that success will pander to his own? It cannot be beyond the bounds of negotiation to sequence North Korea’s nuclear disarmament, dismantling and verification against America’s sanctions relaxation, troop withdrawal and aid. In the middle stands a key figure – South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in – with a massive interest in peace. It should be doable, and the old methods have not done it. The one virtue of Trump’s diplomatic style is blatancy. It turns its back on politesse. It is loud, personal, real and leaves little scope for misunderstanding. Just conceivably it could be the one diplomacy that Kim understands. If not, Trump will have failed, and his G7 vulgarities will have been re-emphasised by naivety. But if he pulls it off, he will have secured a real coup. He could justly claim that his methods have made the world a safer place. It will be back to the drawing board for traditional diplomacy. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian staff columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2019/jan/13/suspending-article-50-will-prolong-uncertainty-but-it-beats-a-bad-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-01-13T09:00:09Z","webTitle":"UK manufacturers can afford to wait on an EU deal, but not to crash out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/13/suspending-article-50-will-prolong-uncertainty-but-it-beats-a-bad-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2019/jan/13/suspending-article-50-will-prolong-uncertainty-but-it-beats-a-bad-brexit","fields":{"headline":"UK manufacturers can afford to wait on an EU deal, but not to crash out","bodyText":"One of Downing Street’s many arguments in favour of Theresa May’s Brexit deal is that further delay will persuade many of the UK’s biggest companies to stop procrastinating about their investment plans and move some or all of their activities abroad. Bosses have spent long enough watching and waiting to see what kind of Brexit unfolds. Another six months, while parliament moves in the direction of a general election or a referendum on the current deal with the European Union, would break their resolve, say May’s supporters. Businesses have certainly delayed investment decisions. The latest figures show that business investment fell by 1.1% to £47bn between the second and third quarters last year. Worse, this was the third consecutive quarter-on-quarter fall in business investment and the first time since the recession of 2008-09 that such a prolonged squeeze on investment has occurred. Manufacturers are among the worst hit. They have not only squeezed investment: they have suffered a serious dent in output. GDP figures last week covering November appeared at first glance to spread a little cheer. The monthly measure of Britain’s income and expenditure showed a small increase from 0.1% in October to 0.2%. However, a deeper dive into the data revealed that almost all that boost came from shopping on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and that most of these gains are likely to be revised away once the Office for National Statistics applies its seasonal adjustment methods. That leaves the glaring and declining trajectory of manufacturing output, which fell for a fifth straight month, something that has also not happened since the 2008-09 recession. Across a broader swath of Britain’s industrial sector, which draws together energy production, water supply, and mining and quarrying alongside the manufacturing sector, there were declines in November across all four industries for the first time since 2012. The car industry was especially badly affected, making a difficult period – following declines in demand for cars from China and the diesel emissions crisis – even worse. On just one day last week Jaguar Land Rover and Ford announced thousands of job cuts, while figures from China revealed the first drop in car sales for almost 30 years. Nobody would want such a dire situation to drag on any longer than necessary. Everyone can see that the cost of negotiating an exit has proved to be high in lost investment and output. All the studies, even those of the arch Brexiter Patrick Minford – the Cardiff academic whose Panglossian optimism meant he came bottom in a league of economic forecasters for 2018 – show the UK’s metal-bashers will be the most badly affected by leaving the EU’s customs union and single market. It means that the north-west, the Midlands (east and west) and Wales, which have disproportionate numbers of well-paid residents working in manufacturing, have the most to lose. Manufacturing accounts for 10% of the economy and keeping it at that level in recent years has required considerable investment from companies such as Nissan, Jaguar Land Rover and Airbus. So remaining inside the EU, or at the very least, getting the best possible Brexit deal, is hugely important to the areas in which these companies are based and the manufacturing industry more generally. If a delay to article 50 is needed to decide on the best route forward, or even a general election – this newspaper’s preferred option is a referendum – then investment decisions can wait a little longer. It will hurt, of that there is no doubt. But a bad Brexit will hurt much more. The nuclear revival is failing. Ministers must think green To have one nuclear power project collapse looked like bad luck for the UK government. But to allow two to fail in as many months would be careless and could prove fatal to ambitions for a nuclear revival. Toshiba pulled the plug on a Cumbrian plant in November and now Hitachi is poised to cancel its plans for a power station in Wales. The withdrawal of the two Japanese players leaves a pair of state-owned firms, EDF of France and CGN of China, as the only serious contenders. Both face huge challenges. The backlash in some countries against the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei shows the risks CGN could face if authorities raise concerns over a Chinese state company putting its technology at the heart of the UK energy system. EDF’s challenge is more prosaic – it has a mountain to climb to raise the finance needed for a second plant after Hinkley Point C in Somerset, even if it is able to cut the project’s costs as it claims. The former MP Tim Yeo, a supporter of nuclear, has warned that if Hitachi walked away it could spell the end for the nuclear reboot. Well, that is now coming to pass. Despite the government tilting the playing field, projects are just not progressing as ministers had hoped. There is no doubt that nuclear is good for achieving climate goals and augmenting the variable nature of renewables. But not at any price. If and when Hitachi’s Wylfa project is scrapped, the government must do more than just reiterate its support for new nuclear. It must launch a major review of the future of low-carbon energy in the UK. There is still time to pivot to alternatives to new nuclear as old reactors are retired over the next decade. Affordability, climate targets and energy security matter more than the loss of face from a change of mind on nuclear energy. Debenhams can still fend off Mike Ashley’s advances Last week, controversial sportswear tycoon Mike Ashley rolled another grenade into the Debenhams boardroom, deftly using his near-30% shareholding in the company to oust the chairman and chief executive from the board at its annual meeting. So what now for the struggling department store, which has seen its share price drop 86% in the last year? Erstwhile chairman Sir Ian Cheshire has quit but chief executive Sergio Bucher, a former Amazon executive, is apparently hanging on despite losing his seat on the board. Ashley insists it is not in his interests for Debenhams to fail – his Sports Direct has already lost more than £100m on its investment in the company’s shares. But then why pull the rug out from under the management team? It looks like Ashley is trying to win control of the business on the cheap. Given that there was such a threat at their door, investors and the board were caught napping. Less than 70% of shareholders bothered to cast the votes that could have saved Cheshire and Bucher from humiliation. Interim chairman Terry Duddy, a retail veteran whose last job was running the now-defunct Home Retail Group, which owned Argos and Homebase, now takes on the Herculean task of stabilising Debenhams’ finances. It’s a big job, with debts of nearly £300m to be refinanced and a need for a fresh injection of funds to complete its turnaround plans. Some argue shutting a number of its 165 department stores is the answer, via an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement, but that is a hard trick for a quoted company that is not at death’s door to pull off. Debenhams is still profitable, for the time being anyway. No one wants Debenhams – which employs 20,000 staff across the country – to become another high street statistic, but Duddy and co need to convince its lenders, suppliers and shoppers that it has a raison d’etre – and outsmart Ashley."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jul/04/board-game-review-karuba-the-card-game-and-micropolis-are-brainy-family-fun","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-04T13:13:54Z","webTitle":"Board game review: Karuba The Card Game and Micropolis are brainy family fun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/04/board-game-review-karuba-the-card-game-and-micropolis-are-brainy-family-fun","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/04/board-game-review-karuba-the-card-game-and-micropolis-are-brainy-family-fun","fields":{"headline":"Board game review: Karuba The Card Game and Micropolis are brainy family fun","bodyText":"Karuba: The Card Game 2 - 6 players, 15 minutes, ages 8+, £13.99 Designer: Rüdiger Dorn This brain-teasing game of jungle adventure casts you and your friends as intrepid explorers in a dense and treacherous rainforest. On each round you’ll play cards from your hand showing a variety of forest trails, aiming to create routes to ancient lost temples. Getting it right leads to riches and glory, but it’s dangerously easy to place the wrong cards in the wrong places, cutting off paths and leaving yourself hopelessly lost. A reworked version of a 2015 tile-laying game, this is a faster, simpler approach to jungle-delving. But it loses none of the puzzlish appeal of its big sibling; in fact, it adds some elements to the mix. Where the original Karuba featured little interaction between players, this new game comes with a subtle antagonistic streak. With some careful observation and a little bit of luck you’ll be able to force opponents to discard cards from their hands, removing valuable scoring opportunities and leaving them scrambling to adjust their plans. It can feel a touch vicious, but the game elegantly distributes the pain between players, leading to some tight and brain-teasing contests where a single decision can make the difference between victory and defeat. It also supports larger groups than the its predecessor and it does it all with a lightning-fast play time and in a tiny box that makes it perfect for playing on-the-go. Micropolis 2 - 6 players, 30 minutes, ages 8+, £24.99 Designers: Bruno Cathala &amp; Charles Chevallier Veteran video game fans may recall that Micropolis was the original working title for SimCity, the classic game of civic administration that kept players up all night tweaking tax rates and building schools next to nuclear power stations. This new board game has nothing to do with the long-running urban-planning series, but it still sees players competing to build environments and support their growing populations. The big difference, though? Those populations are made up of ants. You and your opponents will battle to build thriving colonies, adding new sections to your nests with each passing turn. Each addition to your hive comes with its own advantages: some swell your population of workers or boost your ranks of soldier ants, other provide different varieties of food or come with queens to oversee your growing insectoid empire. All give you different ways to score points and a big part of the game’s challenge lies in finding the most effective ways to ramp up your score, claiming the best hive segments before your opponents have the chance to. To claim new tiles for your nest you’ll need to deploy soldier ants, making the best possible use of your limited supply of troops – a setup that will feel familiar to anyone who has played SmallWorld or Majesty: For the Realm. But while Micropolis might not be a breathtakingly original design, it introduces some tactical tweaks, and it combines family friendly simplicity with a lightly cerebral edge.

One concerns the future trading status of a small, rich country, and is marked by febrile debate, political histrionics and inflated egos. The other sees the rest of the world trying to control climate change. The differences between the two shows could not be starker. The UN summit in Katowice, Poland, is a challenge for civilisation, for the benefit of the common good, an existential thriller for 7.5 billion people and all of nature which is being played out in relative calm. In contrast, in Westminster we are witnessing the culmination of a long-running political schism that is of much less consequence to the planet. Major studies have in the past few weeks made it clearer than ever that we are facing, in David Attenborough’s words at the opening of the summit last week, “a manmade disaster of global scale … our greatest threat in thousands of years”. First came a UN climate change special report, which showed how we may have only 12 or so years left for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which the risks of floods, drought and extreme heat will increase, and food shortages and poverty are likely for hundreds of millions of people. Then came a Global Carbon Budget study, which showed that, at current trends, the world is heading towards a catastrophic 3C of warming by 2100. To add gloom to the pessimism, some of the world’s biggest investors issued a stark warning to governments at the Katowice summit that failure to act urgently would result in financial catastrophe. And the UN’s World Meteorological Organization has provisionally confirmed that the past four years have been the hottest on record, and that extreme weather caused by manmade climate change now affects all continents. Taken together, these reports show conclusively that we are on the edge of climate breakdown, and that governments are failing to prevent it. Factor in the dramatic but linked decline in biodiversity, and the potential for collapsed ecosystems and mass extinctions, and we can see we are at an existential crossroads, heading inexorably towards a fatally denuded Earth. Some leaders, such as the US president, Donald Trump, and the incoming president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, say in wilful ignorance that all this science is wrong and that nothing needs to change – indeed forests must be felled and fossil fuels be further subsidised and promoted as “clean coal”. Others, such as the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, do not deny the science but coldly calculate how much they would lose and try to water down commitments. In the middle at Katowice are the 10,000 government negotiators and NGOs trying to make rich countries reduce emissions and help poor countries adapt to inevitable climate change. But these UN climate talks depend on the consensus of all countries, so the progress appears incremental, even glacial. And because they do not involve adversarial politicians, they are considered unimportant by most of the world’s media. Beyond Katowice, though, are many millions of people who expect their leaders to act in the interests of all, and who are increasingly dismayed that the global economic system threatens everyone’s future. We are now in a race against time to address climate change. We have started late, the signs are not good, and the gap between high-level rhetoric and action to reduce emissions is widening. Fury is now building against governments, with the Extinction Rebellion climate protest group taking non-violent direct action, which has spread to 35 countries in just a few weeks. There are, however, lots of reasons to believe we can meet the challenge. This year, Trump’s decision to pull the world’s second-biggest carbon emitter out of the Paris agreement to cut emissions has backfired. Not only did US emissions fall in 2018, many US states, cities and businesses said they intended to fulfil their Paris obligations. The transition to a less carbon-intensive energy system is also gathering pace. The share of renewables in meeting global energy demand is expected to grow by at least one-fifth in the next five years . By 2020 it should be cheaper to build new renewable energy plants in most countries than to keep coal or fossil fuels burning. Countries can already save money by retiring coal plants and substituting wind and solar. Soon only subsidies worth around £5tn a year will keep coal alive in many countries. Even more optimistically, the world’s largest developing countries are now in the forefront of the transition to lower emissions. India and China, with nearly a third of the world’s people, are at the forefront of the next solar revolution and, like Europe, are firmly on the path to decarbonisation. An unseen revolution is taking place in the way we power the world. From denial and inaction just two decades ago, countries now dare to think big. China is to build a giant solar park in the Gobi desert big enough to power 1 million homes; a single project in India will be even larger, covering 10,000 acres of Rajasthan, and one in the desert near Aswan in Egypt should deliver as much power as two nuclear power stations. The world is full now of major initiatives. Spurred by the commitments made at the Paris climate meeting in 2015, many countries, for example, are furiously planting trees; carbon capture and storage to take the emissions of fossil fuels is becoming a reality; millions of rice farmers have adopted the system of rice intensification which halves the water needed and reduces methane emissions from rice cultivation by up to 50%. These and many others are, so far, only incremental initiatives, coming far too slowly to even brake the warming. These are the seeds of change, lifting ambition, inspiring hope and showing the potential for change on a planetary scale. They also help politicians and bankers understand that getting to net zero emissions in just 40 years is technically and financially possible, and the best investment any country can ever make. By the end of the week, Britain may have weathered another political storm and people may be able to see a little clearer what is happening. Perhaps then our politicians will lift their heads and turn to address the greatest challenge any generation is ever likely to face. They will see that people are up for the challenge. If they then don’t respond with urgency, we are not just metaphorically in the soup, we may literally be cooked. • John Vidal is a former Guardian environment editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2019/jul/24/peter-dutton-misses-deadline-to-hand-over-manus-paladin-document-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-24T07:48:33Z","webTitle":"Repealing medevac would be 'a wicked thing', Centre Alliance says – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/jul/24/peter-dutton-misses-deadline-to-hand-over-manus-paladin-document-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2019/jul/24/peter-dutton-misses-deadline-to-hand-over-manus-paladin-document-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Repealing medevac would be 'a wicked thing', Centre Alliance says – as it happened","bodyText":"As the first speeches roll on, we’ll call it a night. But we’ll be back tomorrow morning, because we like being paid. And also, spending time with all of you. (But also being paid) Expect more of the same for tomorrow. Ensuring integrity will get a run, because it missed out on one today. There will be more national security stuff as we turn to the Senate. And a splash of medevac repeal, because that is just where we are at. Thank you to everyone who followed along today. You make all the difference. We’ll be back bright and early. In the mean time - take care of you. A little of how Mike Bowers saw the day: Katharine Murphy has written about Andrew Bragg’s speech here - along with the context of what it means for the debate, within the Liberal party room. Andrew Bragg finishes with a message for some of his colleagues: A First Nations voice would not be a third chamber. It will not have the standing, scope or power of the Senate or the House of Representatives. Further, the campaign that “race has no place” in the constitution may sound good but it is a campaign that should have been run in the 1890s, as we crossed that Rubicon in 1901. Yes, our present constitution already contains race in several places. It has a history which has been both good and bad. Today, the races power provides the constitutional authority for the Native Title Act. Although some would extend Native Title rights and others would wind them back, everyone agrees this parliament should retain this authority and power. The issue of proper recognition in the constitution will not go away. It shouldn’t. If recognition fails, more radical concepts could be proposed such as reserved seats as already exist in New Zealand and the US state of Maine for first peoples. Or we could face a bill of rights, which would be a terrible transfer of power from elected persons to unelected judges. We want all Australians to be proud of our great nation. All Australians will always be equal but we cannot have Indigenous people feel estranged in the land of their ancestors. Almost every comparable nation has landed some form of legal recognition of first peoples. We should not wait any longer. The Liberal party is used to opening the batting on difficult issues. That’s why we made the first moves to abolish White Australia, opened trade with Japan in 1957 and delivered the Indigenous referendum of 1967. We are the party of Senator Neville Bonner. We Liberals are good at big changes because we take the Forgotten People or Quiet Australians on the journey. As one of my political heroes John Howard said: Australian liberalism has always been evolving and developing. It always will be. We are constantly relating liberalism’s enduring values to the circumstances of our own time. Enduring values such as the commitment to enhance freedom, choice and competition, to encourage personal achievement, and to promote fairness and genuine sense of community in Australian society. I look forward to writing the next chapter in the rich history of Australian liberalism. Andrew Bragg continues: But I would not support constitutional recognition at any price. I offer five principles if we are to succeed. Any proposal must: 1. Capture broad support of the Indigenous community 2. Focus on community level improvements 3. Maintain the supremacy of parliament 4. Maintain the value of equality 5. Strengthen national unity I know my colleagues share strong feelings about this. Mr President, constitutional recognition is both desirable and achievable if the design work reflects these principles. A workable framework was outlined by John Howard’s chief justice Murray Gleeson in a recent address for Uphold &amp; Recognise – the brainchild of the brilliant Damien Freeman and my colleague Julian Leeser MP. In Gleeson’s words: ‘What is proposed is a voice to parliament, not a voice in parliament ... It has the merit that it is substantive, and not merely ornamental.’ Mr President, recognition should also be a bottom-up process. As the governor general said in the opening of this parliament, we should ‘develop ground-up governance models for enhanced, inclusive and local decision-making on issues impacting the lives of Indigenous Australians.’ This must be a unifying project because the Australian constitution belongs to all Australians. It must also be a bipartisan project and I acknowledge the critical role Indigenous senators will play in the years ahead. The first Indigenous person to serve as minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said a few weeks ago: ‘Indigenous Australians [want] to be recognised on the birth certificate of our nation because we weren’t there when it was written but we were ensconced in it in two sections, 51-26 and 127.’ Mr President, I will walk with Indigenous Australians on this journey. The former deputy director of the federal Liberal party, Andrew Bragg, is delivering his first speech in the Senate. He comes out very strongly in support of constitutional Indigenous recognition and a voice to parliament: Mr President, I am worried our country has not been able to reconcile with Indigenous Australians. As Noel Pearson has reminded me, “Andrew, this is my country too”. It is time for us all to complete this task. Pearson offers a way of thinking about Australia that I love. His Declaration of Recognition presents Australia as a unified nation drawing on three great heritages: the Indigenous as first peoples, the British as creators of institutions which underpin the nation, and the multicultural gift that has enriched us all. The constitution does a great job of securing these institutions. That’s why I am constitutional conservative. I regard the constitution as an incredibly successful document. But I am also a supporter of constitutional recognition. The latest chapter in this long journey is the Uluru Statement. It offers a challenge to our country. The Uluru Statement says: “we seek constitutional reforms to empower our people and take a rightful place in our own country.” It imagines a constitution where Indigenous Australians are guaranteed a say on laws made under the races and territories powers which affect them. Uluru asks legislators to consult Indigenous people on the laws which are relevant to them. This is a good idea. This is a fair idea. Plus, also, there are the actual numbers of unemployed people versus the number of job ads. Plus, the definition of employed in this country, according to the ABS, is anyone who performed one hour of work or more for pay or profit (or in kind remuneration). Worked an hour and got paid? You’re employed! Asked about wage theft, in the wake of the George Calombaris ruling, James McGrath says the government has a “full legislative agenda” but it is something he would like to look into at some point. Ed Husic still has some words saved up though: Do you know what the agenda is? It was we need to vote on tax cuts today for tax cuts in the future. We need to vote on drought relief today that won’t be delivered for a year. We need to vote on national security laws. But wage theft does not get a mention because there is another political priority, trying to basically beat up unions instead of looking at the employers who are ripping off workers, ordinary workers who deserve to have their wages paid properly, and that is not being, based on the senator’s response, you can see the government has a full agenda because they don’t think this is something that should be high on the agenda but all the politicking is. Once again, it is not as easy as just packing up and moving towns to find a job. Moving costs money. The reason everyone from church leaders to the business council are talking about raising Newstart, is because those who are on the payment do not have money. In so many cases they don’t have enough money to properly job hunt. Because guess what? That too costs money! Every politician sitting in this place gets more travel allowance each day they are in Canberra than someone on Newstart gets in a week. That’s just the travel allowance. That is not their salary. On Newstart, James McGrath had this to say to Patricia Karvelas: I’m one of those people who think that the best thing the government should do in relation to Newstart is to create jobs, and the government is creating an environment for businesses to employ people. I do not think Newstart is something that can be increased at the moment. We all acknowledge that it is not easy being on Newstart but it is not a long-term solution to long-term unemployment but the best thing you can do for people who are unemployed is to create an environment to get a job. Should it ever be on the agenda? No, I think that the best thing generally is that the government can create an environment to create jobs to employ people. So should people just move, like Michael McCormack says? Look around Australia, there are jobs available in regional Australia. The reason why we have the Pacific Islander program, which I support one million per cent, is because we cannot get people to pick fruit up in Queensland. Sometimes you may have to move to find a job, but the best thing a government can do is create an environment, whether in the city or country, for businesses to grow and also that means employ people. Remember how I said Ed Husic had more words saved up? He just let some of them loose on ABC TV: I think the government very much has stuffed the process up [on] national security and as I’ve said elsewhere, Peter Dutton cannot be trusted on the process. He has taken four years to put this together and there are problems with how it has been put forward, very sloppy in terms of this. There are other pieces of legislation that will be debated in the House of Reps shortly, where the security agencies, detention and in regards to warrants and how they are held, they have said we need to reform and the government has done nothing. Peter Dutton has been more interested in doing the numbers for himself last year and during that period of time failed to get these type of things done right, and more and more the focus will come on the sloppiness and incompetence of Peter Dutton, as it should be. The government themselves play politics with national security. This should not happen at all and they are breaking the trust as to whether or not they can be trusted on the safety of Australians because they keep playing politics with national security. James McGrath, who is on the same panel, comes to his defence: I need to go back to what Ed Husic just said in terms of Peter Dutton. Peter has probably been the best minister we have had in this area in terms of border security so I strongly disagree with his analysis, if you want to call it that, in terms of Peter Dutton’s tenure as home affairs minister and before that immigration minister. I’m very comfortable with the minister, someone who was elected to parliament to make these decisions. I’m particularly happy and comfortable it is Peter Dutton, an ex-Queensland copper. On medevac, Rex Patrick said Centre Alliance and Jacqui Lambie (they have a loose alliance) met with Peter Dutton today to discuss the temporary exclusion orders, but they have not discussed the medevac repeal as yet. Lambie is the swing vote. Rex Patrick: I sat down with Jacqui and Peter Dutton today to discuss the foreign fighters bill and that is because we have some common ground. In other situations where there is no common ground Jacqui will go off and negotiate and discuss with the minister on her own as we do. ... It [the medevac repeal] has not arrived. It is not on the radar. ... We understand the bill very well. If there were some difficulties that the government had, in terms of people who have been repatriated for that medical attention, we would be happy to discuss that with Peter Dutton and happy to do that with Jacqui. If there are problems with the bill we would happily tweak it. But our understanding is that I think it is something like 21 or 22 people have been back to Australia for medical attention and then sent back to Papua New Guinea. On the ensuring integrity bill, Rex Patrick says there are political elements to the bill it can’t support: The aim was to deal with misconduct and there is no question that has been in the union movement. I have seen the fairly significant sheet of judicial rulings against some of the unions and in some instances we have some very conservative, considered judicial officers stating things like this union is simply using the fines, treating the fines, as the cost of business. We cannot have that situation, so we must have a bill that deals with that sort of egregious behaviour and it must also be fair and you cannot have misconduct in the corporate sector and we saw a lot of that was revealed in the royal commission, and do without it the same time. We are asking the government to make sure that whatever is in the bill is consistent with the corporate world. An example: under the current union bill, ensuring integrity bill, the minister can make a referral to make a deregistration. That does not happen in the corporate world. There is a political element today that we are uncomfortable with – and [we] would like to see it removed. But if the legislation applies to all, then Centre Alliance will support it. If the government doesn’t amend it, it will weigh up its options then. Rex Patrick is speaking to Patricia Karvelas on Afternoon Briefing and says while Centre Alliance supports the intent of the temporary exclusion order bill, it will abstain from voting for it, because it can’t support it in its current form. Labor will be passing it, although it has raised its own concerns. Rachel Siewert has had a win in the Senate. It’s just a motion, but it further indicates that half the parliament is now officially on board with raising the Newstart rate: This is a historic moment. I am very pleased that the Senate has agreed that Newstart is too low. I’ve introduced countless motions to increase Newstart over the years that have been voted down, time and again. Just like with marriage equality, just like with the banking royal commission, the Greens have continued to campaign, in partnership with the community, to achieve change. I will continue to introduce bills and motions to our parliament until we get an increase to Newstart. The evidence is well and truly in, we know we need an urgent increase by at least $75 a week. The government is out of step with community expectations and there is no excuse not to increase the rate of Newstart right now. Question time finally ended. There is a God. Meanwhile, it has been pointed out to me that Peter Dutton, when talking to Sky earlier today, blamed people lying on their departure cards as one of the reasons the government doesn’t know where foreign fighters ended up: Just noting that departure cards were abolished by the government, under Dutton, in 2017. Breaking – the PAPERS ARE STACKED. This is almost over, people. Ted O’Brien invites Peter Dutton back up for another HOW SAFE ARE YOU segment. This latest episode comes with a side of WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON. Michael McCormack is now confusing the electorates of Rankin and Moreton. The paper is still not being shuffled on the prime minister’s desk. McCormack is talking about “record amounts of money” and “busting congestion”. I will pay all the money I have in the world to stop this now. For the third time this week, someone didn’t jump for their question. It looks like it was supposed to be the independent’s question again (that is what happened yesterday). But the next MP on the government dixer roster should have jumped up. And they didn’t. For the third time this week. So Graham Perrett gets in another question for Labor: It’s on infrastructure again, which means it is Michael McCormack again, but he still can’t tell you when that infrastructure will start. But he can tell you what Labor promised to do. Cool. Michael McCormack is back up, and is now talking like a chipmunk, if it had fallen out of a tree and could speak English. As was just pointed out by a press gallery colleague – we haven’t seen the prime minister welcome Boris Johnson as prime minister. There have been some member statements, but nothing from Scott Morrison in the House. (There was a tweet, I think.) Meryl Swanson to Michael McCormack. Why is only 3% of the funding to extend the M1 to Raymond Terrace available in the next four years? 3%. WB: It is better than some of the funding that Labor gave to some of the electorates when it was in. As I said in my previous answer ... That is a responsible way to rollout infrastructure. Not like, and the Member for Patterson, I appreciate, is in a regional electorate, and when Labor were last in government, regional spend was $404m. That was for the electorate of Patterson and other regional electorates. We have doubled and tripled, spending our past two terms and we will now spend six times that amount over the next three years ... It keeps going, but I cannot. Nick Champion is out until 3.12pm tomorrow. Lucky. In news that does not bode well for any of us, Scott Morrison is making no moves to shuffle his papers. That’s what he does when he is getting ready to call time on QT. But the papers remain unshuffled. Which means there are more dixers to sit through. Tony Smith: The question is the Member for Wakefield to be suspended from the service of the House? All those who say aye? The ayes have it – division required. Ring the bells for four minutes. BUT – we pause – because Nick Champion is no longer the Member for Wakefield. He’s now the Member for Spence. So we stop the bells. Christian Porter moves the motion for the Member for Spence and the House divides. The independents side with the government, because Champion disrepected the Speaker. So Ed Husic will sit alone for a full 24 hours. Now he knows how the cheese feels. It’s been a while since this has happened – but it’s also the first time Christian Porter has had to do this and well, third time’s the charm. I move the member be suspended for the remainder of the proceedings. (No) I recommend ... that he be removed from the service of the House. (No) I move the member be suspended from the service of the House. (There we go) Nick Champion, the member for Spence goes TOO FAR. He backchatted Tony Smith, and Smith is in NO MOOD – so he is named. That means he is out for 24 hours. Can’t vote on bills, can’t speak, until the suspension is lifted. Smith: I won’t debate issues on 94 with any member. Especially the Member for Wakefield, if he interjects, he will resume his seat. I have made this very clear. This is about the dignity of the House. The Member for Wakefield, knows by now if he interjects and I ask to cease, if he interjects immediately I will ask to remove himself from the House. I won’t have him backchat the chair when I represent the House. I am now naming the Member for Wakefield. Naming the Member for Wakefield. Libby Coker (new member for Corangamite) to Michael McCormack. It is official. I died and this is my hell. Why won’t work on the south Geelong rail upgrade be commenced before July 2024? McCormack: Mr Speaker, all infrastructure has to be over a phased period. You cannot build it all at once. When you are spending a record $100bn on infrastructure, you can’t spend it all in the one year. He continues. Blah, blah,blah, congestion, road, rail, money, building, billions, whiteness, time, beige, beige, beige. There’s been a lot of talk about the revolving door between politics and business. Christopher Pyne’s new job with EY, helping it grow its defence business, and Julie Bishop’s new job with the foreign aid contractor Palladium have caused a fresh round of controversy about post-ministerial employment and lax enforcement of ministerial standards. But Australia’s revolving door goes well beyond Pyne, Bishop, and ex-cabinet ministers. New and ongoing ANU research has found 56% of registered lobbyists previously held roles within government. That could include public servants, political staffers, and backbenchers, as well as ministers. Speaking about his as-yet unpublished research, Prof Darren Halpin said it was “crucial” that cooling-off periods for politicians were properly enforced. “Rightly, there are measures to enforce cooling-off periods that limit such movements,” Halpin said. “If these are set, it is crucial that they are noted, monitored and enforced. The trickle of media ‘scandals’ in this regard is arguably one dynamic undermining trust in the motives of public officials in their career choices.” Brian Mitchell to Michael McCormack: My question is to the deputy prime minister. When will work began on the new Bridgewater bridge? McCormack: The Bridgewater bridge is something that we have said we would fund and we will, Mr Speaker. It is quite as simple as that. We are getting on with the job. We are working with the Tasmanian government, the Hodgman government. When I go to Tasmania, the difference between what we saw before the Hodgman government taking over the reins in Tasmania and what we see now is writ large, Mr Speaker. The factors that is infrastructure such the Bridgewater bridge which we look forward to building with the Tasmanian government. There are projects such as a Scottsdale irrigation scheme, and during the election campaign, it was delightful to go to. He says it in his usual cadence of having. to. stop. after. every. word. with. an. un. necessary. pause. because. he. needs. to. think. about. his. next. word. I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again. It’s like someone taught a loaf of white bread to talk. Labor asks WHEN. It is interesting, Mr Speaker, to get questions from those opposite because when they were in power between 2007 and 13, the only thing they built were their egos. We are going to get on and build the Bridgewater bridge. The fact is there are issues that the infrastructure Australia has identified with that particular project, there are some unresolved engineering issues, there are some cost factors. When we get those issues resolved, and we will, because we are a government that does things, we are a government which builds things, we will get on with that project, just like we will get on with other projects right throughout Tasmania. We are building ... WHEN WHEN WHEN yells Labor. Tony Smith says if Labor was listening they would have heard he is answering the question. McCormack: “They’re just rude, Mr Speaker.” Smith: “No, don’t ... Don’t try and help, please don’t try and help.” Timeless. Statement. It’s time for JUST HOW SAFE ARE YOU with Peter Dutton. Today it’s the UNION’S ARE BAD edition. It’s almost like the government has a bill targeting unions it is trying to get support for. Sharon Claydon to Josh Frydenberg: [In the Senate the government] ruled out changing the timetable for legislated increases to the superannuation guarantee to 12%. Will you, the treasurer, now do the same? Frydenberg: Yes. That’s the whole answer. It’s also the first time the government has ruled it out that definitively. So those backbenchers who have been calling for it just got their answer. Anyone who has ever wished to slow down time should just sit through a question time for the 46th parliament. Tony Burke to Angus Taylor: My question as to the minister for energy, and as last answer he said his interest in Jam Land had been declared in accordance with the rules. Given the last published register makes no reference to the company, does the minister stand by the claim he just made to the parliament was that claim misleading?” Taylor: As I said in my last answer, my indirect interest in Jam Land through my family company has been reported in the media and was declared in accordance with the rules, declared in accordance with the rules through my family company. As I have also said in the previous question, I have no association with the compliance action, that has been the subject of these questions. I have never made a representation, in relation to it. I tell you what I have made representations about, the farmers in my electorate. Because I care about them and I stand up for them. Tony Burke gets up for a point of order, but Taylor has finished. Christian Porter is taking a dixer on the ensuring integrity bill, and honestly, we should all think of ourselves as well as Christian Porter thinks of Christian Porter. Labor’s leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, began question time with fresh questions about the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor. She asks Simon Birmingham about some responses he gave to questions on notice on Tuesday. Those questions related to meetings Taylor had with environment officials and Josh Frydenberg’s office about endangered grasslands that were at the centre of an investigation into a company – Jam Land Pty Ltd – that he part-owns. Taylor holds shares in Jam Land via his family investment company Gufee. Wong reads from a letter from Birmingham and asks if he stands by this statement: “Minister Taylor has always declared his interest as required under the House register of interests and the ministerial code of conduct.” Birmingham says to the best of his knowledge Taylor “has always declared his interest”. Wong is now asking why Taylor’s register of interests fail to declare his interest in Jam Land. Birmingham says he will take that on notice and that he won’t take Wong’s word for it. Wong tables Asic documents that show Taylor is a director of Gufee Pty Ltd, which is a shareholder in Jam Land. “Given these extracts clearly show Minister Taylor’s interest in Jam Land Pty Ltd, will Senator Birmingham correct the record and apologise for misleading the Senate,” she asks. Birmingham is sticking to his earlier position and takes the question on notice. Taylor’s latest declaration of interests does not mention shares in Jam Land Pty Ltd, but it does list his shares in Gufee. Guardian Australia has checked the Asic records and Gufee is named as a shareholder in Jam Land. Tony Smith, speaking for all of us, when he tells Greg Hunt to be quiet and stop interjecting (for the second time). “If it helps him, I don’t actually hear what he says, I just hear noise.” Timeless statement. Angus Taylor: My indirect interest in Jam Land has been widely reported in the media and was declared in accordance with the rules. I have no association with the compliance action, I have never made a representation in relation to it. This is confirmed at Senate estimates by the secretary of my department in April this year. Mr Speaker, I make no apology for seeking and receiving a briefing on policies that seriously impact the farmers in my electorate, it is what the people of Hume expect of me as their local member. In fact, Mr Speaker, the people of Eden-Monaro should be asking why their representative didn’t do the same. Half of the affected grasslands are in his electorate. I stand up for the farmers in my electorate. He goes on about the drought fund. Mike Kelly to Angus Taylor: Why did the minister say in question time yesterday that he has, and I quote, “no association with Jam Land Propriety Limited” when it shows he does have an interest in the company? Christian Porter is straight up onto his feet. According to standing order 100B. That question has been asked and fully answered. Labor goes nuts and Tony Smith tells them to be quiet so he can hear the point of order. Porter: Yesterday the member for Griffith asked a question, it was a compound question, it had two parts. The first part was that the, the first part sought confirmation that the minister had an interest in a company. The second part sought confirmation that there was … some departmental investigation. The minister answered the second part first. He said he had no association, clearly meaning with the departmental investigation. And then he noted that he remained at arm’s length from the company that was the subject of the question. There has never been any dispute that the minister has a relationship with the company, and that is on the members’ listed interests. Tony Burke is back up: Mr Speaker, first of all, the question being asked is asking him to reconcile statements yesterday with Asic documents, that question has been asked for the first time. In terms of what his answer was yesterday, the sentence that appears in Hansard is, I quote, ‘I have no association and have remained at arm’s length from the company.’ Given that was the statement, I’m sorry, the words in the investigation had been added in the point of order taken by the leader of the House. That was not part of the quote the question asks. Tony Smith rules: There are two issues here, whether a question is being fully answered. It’s not really for the chair to judge that, except unless it’s an identical question. I take the point that the leader of the House is making, which is it is a very similar question. Certainly the rules on the practice, the question has to be, identical, absolutely identical, the question yesterday, for that to be the case, for if that were the case, yesterday’s answer would have been deemed fully answered because the question has been answered. It’s not, so that question is in order. It is able to be asked because it’s different, but it’s referring to the answer yesterday. Because my Mercury is in retrograde, apparently forever, Michael McCormack is back. In maybe her first actual mis-step since coming to parliament, Zali Steggall inflicts Michael McCormack on the chamber. Warringah has some of the most congested roads in Australia and it’s a huge detriment to people’s daily lives. A proposed solution, the Beaches Link Tunnel, would reduce congestion by bypassing the Spit Bridge. The proposed Beaches Link Tunnel has been talked about for over two decades, including by the former member of Warringah, and is now in the New South Wales planning and assessment process. During the campaign the federal government committed $50 million from the Urban Congestion Fund to provide access to the tunnel. Could the minister please tell the House what has happened to that $50 million commitment? McCormack says some things, which involve the usual white bread homilies, but life is really too short to pay too much attention. It’s to be expected – white noise has that effect. Alan Tudge steps up. He threatens to go all afternoon, but the gist is ... We stand by all our commitments that we make and that’s the difference between this side and that side is when we promise something we actually deliver. When it comes to delivering we’re delivering $100 billion in infrastructure over the next 10 years. I mean, most of that is in the back end of the decade, but sure. Ed Husic looks like he is biting the inside of his mouth with everything he has to avoid heckling Josh Frydenberg. He settles on some very cartoonish nods. It’s a mood. Brendan O’Connor to Christian Porter: What bills are before the House that implement the recommendations of the banking royal commission? Porter: It’s unusual for the leader of the House to take a point of order on a question to him as leader of the House. That needs to be directed to a minister, the minister responsible for those bills. Tony Burke is up. This is where he proves he knows more about House procedure than Porter, who currently has practically every single piece of the government’s agenda on his plate, as well as this new job as leader of the House. Not a fun place to be, but hey, that’s why he gets the big bucks. Burke: The role of leader of the House is meant to be a real job. And as part of that job, members of parliament ... It has always been in order to ask the leader of the House about the business of the House, regardless of what portfolio that business falls in to otherwise. Tony Smith gives Porter an out: I’ll make two points because, whilst it’s unorthodox, certainly the manager of opposition business well knows I’ve seen many examples where that has occurred. But I mean the practice also makes very clear, if I can point out to ministers, that they are entitled to, if it relates to another portfolio, they’re entitled to refer that to a relevant minister if they wish to. That’s a right they have. I’ll leave it in the hands of the leader of the House whether he wishes to answer it. Porter gives it to Josh Frydenberg: I can confirm to the House that this parliament has passed legislation implementing the royal commission’s recommendations, including recommendation 3.6, to prohibit super funds from inducing employees, and introducing civil penalties for trustees and directors of super funds. We have also passed regulations which extend the remit in terms of dealing with financial complaints, back to January 1, 2008. We’ve also legislated product intervention powers. #theministerdoesnotanswerthequestion Ed Husic has just been told by Tony Smith that his word allocation is over for the day. Husic’s face says he STILL HAS WORDS to say. The new member for Lindsay was VERY eager to ask her dixer, jumping to her feet in an attempt to head off Peter Khalil’s question. That is probably also because there was a bit of a rev up through the government benches about paying attention as well. Anyways, now Josh Frydenberg is yelling about something. Tax, probably. Peter Khalil to Christian Porter: On how many occasions this year has a worker contacted the Fair Work Ombudsman to report an incident of wage theft, only for the ombudsman to make no contact with their employer? Porter: I mean, it would be unusual if I would have that level of detail to hand. I can certainly get that for the member. I am aware of several occasions where the ombudsman has taken complaints about underpayment which originally went to a union without action and went to the ombudsman for action. I am aware that in the last budget that this government provided $10.8 million to the Fair Work Ombudsman to investigate precisely the types of things that we’re now talking about. I am aware our government has a zero tolerance for this sort of behaviour, whether that is underpayment or wage theft. The difficulty is, Mr Speaker, the difficulty is that they seem over there to have a very low tolerance for underpayment but they’ve got a monstrously high tolerance when it’s workers’ money being diverted from workers to unions. That’s when their tolerance levels seem to get out of whack. We have $10.8 million given by this government to the Fair Work Ombudsman to investigate these matters. They are now investigated more heavily than they’ve ever been investigated previously. That builds on $30 million in unpaid wages, representing more than 13,000 workers with completed audits of 4,500 Australian workplaces. That is more than when Labor were last in office. When Labor were last in office, Mr Speaker – and this might interest the member for Wills – but when Labor were last in office, not without standing there with indignation today, they cut the funding of the Fair Work Ombudsman by 17%. So the body that investigates underpayment, when they were in government, they cut its funding by 17%. You know what, Mr Speaker, you know what they also cut, you know what they also cut – the Fair Work Ombudsman’s staff, who are paid money to investigate underpayment of wages, they were cut by members opposite by 20%. So the indignation exists now but when the rubber was on the road and they were required to investigate these matters, they underfunded and cut the staff of the organisation who are meant to investigate these matters. So we’d be very happy for another question like that, member for Wills. Gladys Liu gets the first dixer and it includes the phrase “whose side are you on”, which just means we get a lecture on WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON and Scott Morrison Shouty McShoutiness. Just on that (Guardian style guide aside) ‘leader of the opposition with a capital O’ isn’t quite the sledge the prime minister thinks it is, given that Leader of the Opposition is a proper noun. So it is literally spelt with a capital O. First question Susan Templeman to Scott Morrison: Which minister is dealing with the urgent issue of wage theft at restaurants? Morrison: I can tell her right now, right now the attorney general is drafting laws to deal with criminalising worker exploitation. And on top of that, Mr Speaker, there are bills in the parliament right now that deal with the wage theft that’s occurring in the union movement through workers’ entitlement funds. And I’ll tell you what this scam deal of the union does. What it does – you don’t like this answer, do you? Anthony Albanese: It was a very specific question. It went to an issue which is of great concern in the community – the rip-off of people who are working in restaurants. The PM should address that question. He might refer to Mr Calombaris’s restaurants. There’s a few issues, MasterChef, people know about it. How about you answer the question. Morrison: The leader of the opposition with a capital O might like to understand this, that the bill that’s in the parliament at the moment deals with workers’ entitlements, funds paid into workers’ entitlements funds held by unions, which ensures that when they are in a position to have their entitlements paid out – their wages – which doesn’t matter whether you’re working in a restaurant or anywhere else, that the dividends from those funds isn’t paid off to other unions ,which is the practice of those unions. Now the Labor party might not want to recognise what they are doing in supporting that practice is thieving workers’ wages, Mr Speaker. That’s what the Labor party is doing by supporting practices of unions which is thieving workers’ entitlements from those funds. Now on the matter that the leader of the opposition also raised in relation to the Calombaris matter, Mr Speaker – on that matter, that matter was exposed by the Fair Work Ombudsman as a result of the $10 million of extra funds we put into that organisation, to ensure that matter could be exposed, and that an enforceable undertaking was secured through the action to protect those workers. Now on this side of the House, we know whose side we’re on. It’s on Australian workers’ side. The Labor party, Mr Speaker, who knows whose side they’re on. They weren’t on the side of tax cuts for Australians. They weren’t on the side of farmers dealing with drought. And today we understand they’re only on the side of militant unions. It is time for ‘who’s that MP’. When I walked in, it was Ted O’Brien. And as I type this, it was Josh Burns. It’s the downhill slide to question time - hit me up with your predictions. Rebekha Sharkie has a message for supporters of repealing the legislation, “who call themselves Christian, as indeed I do”. Read Matthew 25 ... Matthew 25 makes it very clear – Christians should see everyone as Christ in the flesh. And in the New Testament, stranger and neighbour are in fact synonymous. The golden rule of love your neighbour as yourself refers not just to the people you know, your neighbours, but also to those you do not know. And I am sure I do not need to remind every person who follows Christ that Christ too was a refugee. If the government is successful in repealing this legislation it will cause much harm. Needless harm. Unnecessary harm. It is quite simply a wicked thing that we are doing in this place. It is unnecessary. And I therefore, in the strongest possible terms, oppose this bill, as will my Centre Alliance colleagues in the other place. Peter Dutton’s official statement on Reece Kershaw’s recommendation as the new AFP commissioner: The Government will recommend to the Governor-General that Mr Reece Kershaw APM be appointed as the 8th Australian Federal Police Commissioner. Commissioner Kershaw commenced with the Northern Territory Police Force (NTPF) in February 2011 and in April 2015 was appointed Commissioner of Police and Chief Executive Officer of the Northern Territory Police, Fire and Emergency Services. Prior to commencing with the NTPF Commissioner Kershaw was with the Australian Federal Police, including secondments to the National Crime Authority, the Australian Crime Commission and overseas postings to The Hague, East Timor and the Solomon Islands. He is a Graduate of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Law Enforcement Executive Development Program and was awarded the Australian Police Medal in the 2016 Australian Day Honours. We congratulate Commissioner Kershaw on his appointment at a time when the AFP needs to be future ready to meet the challenges posed by those that would seek to do us harm, here and abroad. The Government again sincerely thanks Commissioner Colvin for the service that he has provided to the Australian community for the last 30 years as a member of the AFP. Commissioner Colvin enjoyed an extensive AFP career that covered roles in serious and organised crime, counter terrorism, chief of staff and high tech crime. In 2002 Andrew was awarded the Order of Australia Medal for his investigative work into the 2002 Bali bombings. We wish Andrew every success in his future endeavours. The medevac repeal legislation is back in the House. Technically, it is the ongoing debate on Andrew Giles’s amendment, which you will find a few posts down. Rebekha Sharkie is talking in support of the amendment – she has been one of the fiercest advocates for medevac, the reason Centre Alliance will be fighting to keep medevac in the Senate. Richard Di Natale continuing what has become a favoured theme of late: Stephen Jones on superannuation, which is one of Labor’s favourite topics today, thanks mostly to Craig Kelly: This morning we read that influential backbencher Craig Kelly is putting out some policy ideas that the government should allow superannuation fund members to be able to dip into their superannuation fund to buy their own home. This is an idea that’s been kicked around many times and has been shown to be not in the interests of fund members. What’s more, and what’s of greater concern, is that Mr Kelly is proposing that the family home should be included in the assets test for pensioners. The prime minister needs to rule this out immediately. This would amount to a gigantic pensioner retiree tax. The prime minister needs to rule this out. He must rule this out. What is quite clear, is that a government without a policy agenda is finding that its backbenchers are busily trying to fill in the gaps. Whether it’s a new proposition for a retiree tax through the personal family home being a part of the pensioner assets test, or whether it’s the minister for energy freelancing on nuclear power. It’s time for Scott Morrison to step up to ensure that he stops playing the parlour political games and focuses on the real issues that members of the public care about. Scott Morrison has got to step up. He’s got to stop playing games around here. We need clear leadership from the government on all of these issues. What he needs to do today, and what he needs to do immediately, is to rule out this proposition for the family home to be included as a part of the pensioner assets test. Peter Dutton concludes with this: I just remind you that we have now had three vessels in only a short period of weeks. There were boats on the water anticipating a Labor government being elected in May. We have a very significant concern about some of the messages in Sri Lanka at the moment and we are working in a way that won’t restart boats but to get people off Manus and Nauru as quickly as possible. I have never ruled out the New Zealand option but I have made the point, and I make it again today, now is not the right time for us to be sending people to New Zealand because New Zealand is being marketed in Sri Lanka, as it is elsewhere, as essentially the same destination as Australia. Same welfare system, education, government support, all of that is marketed in a similar way. There may be a time when we can exercise the New Zealand option, we are grateful for it, but we will exercise that option when and if it is in our national interest and it will not restart boats, because under both the Labor party and the Coalition at the moment, if there is a boat that successfully gets through tonight with 30 kids on board, they are all going to Nauru. President Obama and President Trump have been clear they are not able to access the US arrangement and if they come from Iran, cannot send them back to Iran. Let’s be realistic. If the problem starts again, what happens, what will happen is this. Nauru will overflow and then you have the problem of where people go after that. We have worked to get 585 people off Manus and Nauru. When they need medical attention, we provide medical attention. That has always been the case. But I will not make decisions that will encourage people smugglers in Sri Lanka who are encouraging innocent people to pay money to get onto those boats. We are not going back to Labor’s days, having people in detention, and I will not allow our country to be held ransom by people who are evil criminal syndicates taking money [from innocent people]. Peter Dutton: The other point you made … is the fact that the people on Manus have been treated very poorly by many people, including some in the press here in Australia. They are islanders, peace loving people, very accommodating, and they have been portrayed as somebody different than that. PNG is quite aggrieved by that, as I am, and I have made this point in a number of occasions. And I am going to work with the PNG government to reframe that because there are people that have been presented in a way that they shouldn’t have. I am happy to come to that point. If I can get it down to zero tonight, I would. If I could bring those people to Australia, I would have done it by now. I am not putting a deadline on it because to go to the point before about people travelling, there are Iranians on PNG, Tehran will not issue travel documents for those people. They will not go to the United States, they will not accept a position to go to the US. No other country in the world will take them and they are holding out to come to Australia. In that circumstance, I am not taking those people and I have been clear about it. We have provided resettlement assistance for people to go back to the country of origin, there are 107 people on Manus who have been found not to be refugees and we will continue to work with authorities up there to get the number down to zero. Peter Dutton on why he won’t be accepting every recommendation from the joint parliamentary committee on intelligence and security - which is led by the Liberal MP Andrew Hastie and has a majority of government MPs: I believe that for a long time, Labor has effectively managed Mark Dreyfus through the process. I think they have done the job that the Labor caucus should do. The Labor caucus, I suspect, people because they are compelled to sit there, find it excruciating to listen to long lectures from Mr Dreyfus because as you know, he is the smartest person in any room, at least by his own account. So I think we need to recognise that, like any committee to the government, they provide recommendations … we have accepted 17 … we have been advised that the bill would be in a better form if we didn’t accept those but noted them and that is the advice we have taken. In the end, the government will look at the recommendations of the bill or any other, we’re not going to get ourselves into [the] position that we were in at the last parliament where Mark Dreyfus waters down [legislation], we’re not going to allow [that] to happen because what ends up happening is that we end up with a bill that is ineffective and these matters are too important for that. So Anthony Albanese can manage Mark Dreyfus in a different process but we are not going to allow a national security agency to be stifled by Mark Dreyfus and his ability to water down legislation. Incoming AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw on the potential prosecution of journalists: Look, it is about process. And I’ve said this before, where you can ask for a second opinion or a third opinion about the process and get those opinions and then make that decision but it’s got to be informed, with all the facts, or the legalities addressed and so on and that’s my style, I will get as much information as I can to see where it’s it. On whether children of foreign fighters who may have been forced to fight will be repatriated, Peter Dutton had this to say: I need to take into account those considerations, I also need to consider the rights of the 5-year-old Australian child at a school here in Australia because we can’t just take somebody having been over in the Middle East and put them into Year 5 or Year 6. “... We don’t want media attention in some immediate cases, I don’t want cameras parked out the front, and scrutiny of people going to mosques, we want to work with the, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, the family services authorities in those states … put a bespoke arrangement – and for some individuals and we don’t know whether or not some of these children are Australian citizens or not. We don’t know because we don’t have DNA testing and we don’t know. I am not going to provide a running commentary on this family or that, individual circumstances, given the way in which we are approaching this, which I think is reasonable. I think the threat level is different with some of the women and what they are posing, I want to be clear about this, the advice to me about some of these women is they are as bad as any of the men and what we have seen. So let’s be realistic about that. Others, as I have said before, have been in violent relationships or have been sold or traded into some other relationship and horrific circumstances. That’s is what we are dealing with. Reece Kershaw has been named the new AFP commissioner. He is the current Northern Territory police commissioner. He’ll start in October, when Andrew Colvin officially stands down. Peta Murphy: As I now know, cancer is not just indiscriminate, it’s sneaky. Two weeks ago, a week after being sworn in as the member for Dunkley, I received the unexpected news that my cancer had returned. You might say Murphy’s Law strikes again. But my mother, Jan, who is a Murphy by marriage, not birth, and therefore able to adopt a less pessimistic personal motto, would say ‘everything happens for a reason’. I am neither unique nor alone in the fight I am about to take on. Cancer Australia estimates that in 2019, just over 19,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 145,000 people will be diagnosed with cancer. I am neither unique nor alone, but I am someone who has a platform that I can use to benefit others. And as long as the people of Dunkley continue to vote for me to represent them in this place, I intend to use it. I am going to start by saying this today. Ladies, check your breasts. Men, don’t ignore what your body is telling you. Fellow members of parliament, listen to experts who warn that the promise of universal healthcare is under threat. Commit to the reform and funding that our heath system needs, and do whatever is required to ensure that Australia trains, retrains and invests in the healthcare professionals and researchers who make our system great. The contest to replace Mitch Fifield as a Victorian senator is shaping up as a two-horse race between Sarah Henderson and Greg Mirabella. Fifield is jetting off to be Australia’s ambassador to the United Nations. Henderson was defeated at the May election in the marginal lower house seat of Corangamite, after six years in federal parliament. She had risen to the ranks of assistant minister for social services and disabilities. Mirabella, a former army officer, is married to former federal minister Sophie Mirabella, who lost the blue ribbon Liberal seat of Indi in north-eastern Victoria in 2013 to Cathy McGowan. Some insiders say he’s got a solid standing and identity within the party, separate to that of his polarising wife. “He’s his own man,” a source told the Guardian. Party insiders expect a tight race and the push is on for a regional-based senator because the other Liberal senators live in Melbourne. Mirabella is from Wangaratta, while Henderson lives in Geelong. Nominations for preselection close on Friday and 600-odd party members will vote on 8 September. Prime minister Scott Morrison has endorsed Henderson for the Senate spot but party insiders don’t believe that will make much difference in the minds of rank and file members. “I just think back to when [Victoria premier] Denis Napthine wrote a letter supporting [cabinet minister] Mary Wooldridge in [the state seat of Kew 2014]. [Then 30-year-old former mayor] Tim Smith won resoundingly,” the insider told the Guardian. “I’m not sure branch members like to be told what to do.” Asked about whether gender and the party’s push for more female talent will be a factor in the contest, the insider said: “No.” “I just don’t think it will swing votes one way or the other.” Other names in the mix are former Liberal senate candidates Kyle Hoppitt and Karina Okotel, former federal MP for Dunkley Chris Crewther and former state upper house MP Inga Peulich. Another party insider says the two favourites may not necessarily win the room on the day. The last time there was a Victorian Senate casual vacancy, former veterans affairs minister Michael Ronaldson retired from politics and James Paterson, a then 28-year-old from the Institute of Public Affairs, won the spot. “I can’t recall James Paterson being the favourite in 2016. He performed really strongly and impressed delegates,” the party insider said. “Delegates to a Senate preselection are often more focused on ideology.” Peta Murphy, the new Labor MP for Dunkley, is delivering her first speech in the chamber now. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, was asked on Sky about the commonwealth ombudsman’s report, which revealed a litany of breaches of metadata laws, including that the Western Australian police obtained invalid warrants targeting journalists and ACT police accessed data 116 times without proper authorisation. Asked if this showed the law’s safeguards don’t work, Dutton replied: No it’s not, there are many cases now where Asio and the AFP have relied on those laws particularly in relation to serious matters including counter terrorism matters to keep Australians safe. There are mechanisms in place, safe checks and they should be adhered to, and if not there are consequences for that. So, take the protections very seriously but in the end the vast majority of cases – 99% of the use of these laws – will be appropriate, and they’ll be used in a way that will result in protecting Australians, that’s the reality. The ombudsman’s report didn’t detail any consequences that accrued from the breaches by WA Police or ACT Policing – aside from a polite request to quarantine the data which in ACT Policing’s case was not immediately adhered to. From our report: The ombudsman recommended the AFP quarantine all telecommunications data obtained under the 116 authorisations, which the AFP accepted. ‘However it did not act to quarantine the affected data at that time, which resulted in additional use and communication of the data,’ the report said. Despite the quarantine process beginning in February 2018, the data had still not been fully quarantined by April 2018. So we’ll have to hear from Dutton what the unspecified “consequences” might be! Kristina Keneally and Alan Jones have joined forces. Yes, you read that correctly. They have come together to try and reverse the decision which has seen a Sri Lankan family who made a home in Biloela, but who are now in detention after they were judged not to be refugees. So far, the government has not budged on the case, despite multiple appeals from the Queensland community to bring them home. And now, it has seen Jones and Keneally team up. That’s how serious it is. Why is it an issue, for Labor, that the government hasn’t taken on board all of the recommendations of the joint parliamentary security and intelligence committee on the temporary exclusion orders bill? Ed Husic told Sky News: Because the committee basically drops the politics, drops the politicking, thinks deeply about the advice that is given, not just from the security agencies, but from others who have a considered opinion in the community, the Law Council and others, and then frames its recommendations with a lot of consideration attached to them. And if they say, as a result of their considerations, it would be better to strengthen the law in this way, I think the government should be made to work double time to explain why those recommendations aren’t good enough to follow. I just think Peter Dutton has a lot to answer for, as to why so many people left, why he hasn’t brought the regime in the way that he should, why has he taken so long. I think the other thing is the government just can’t be trusted on national security. They prioritise politics over the safety of the country, and in Peter Dutton’s case, you have to ask, if his colleagues couldn’t bring themselves to put him in a leadership position, couldn’t trust him in a leadership position, why is he being trusted with national security when so many things are going off the rails under his watch. Rex Patrick also has concerns about the temporary exclusion order bill: Peter Dutton was on ABC radio this morning talking about why the government rejected some of the recommendations of the security and intelligence committee: There were 19 recommendations. We accept 17. And we’ll implement their recommendations, but the government, at the end of the day, relies not only on the advice from the committee, made up of Labor and Liberal members, but also, of course – and predominantly – the agencies, including Asio, Asis, my own intelligence units within Home Affairs, and we make decisions that we believe are in the best interests of the country. And excluding people on a temporary basis from coming back to our country to cause harm is an absolute priority of the government. So, we look at all of that information, and we make decisions that we believe are in the best interest. There is an ability for the minister to make a decision under legislation. Each decision, every decision, is reviewed by a retired judge or a member of the AAT. That process is in place. There is also an ability for matters to be heard right up to the high court, but the federal court to start with. So, there are checks and balances in place now. But you don’t have faith in a retired judge to make these decisions? Our judgement is, particularly in cases where you need to make an urgent decision, that that case is best considered by the minister, and then reviewed. We’re happy for the review to take place. It’s an important check and balance. But as is the case with passport cancellations, for example, where the foreign minister might make a decision, that decision is made by the minister, and that’s consistent with legislation and practice under both Liberal and Labor over a long period of time. Peter Dutton will hold a press conference at 11.45pm in the blue room - the second most fancy press conference location. There is a lot of aqua in the public gallery as Zali Steggall delivers her first speech and a pretty big cheer from that same quarter when she mentions defeating Tony Abbott Liberal backbench senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells continues to make her push for a broader “religious freedom act” than the defensive religious discrimination act currently being developed by attorney general Christian Porter. In the adjournment debate in the Senate on Tuesday night, she detailed nine cases of apparent religious discrimination, as she saw it. The cases included those already publicly aired, including a wedding photographer sued for refusing to provide services to a same-sex wedding (the case was dropped), a student being investigated for comments about not agreeing with the “lifestyle” of a gay friend (the case was dropped), a teacher who was investigated during the postal survey for posting on social media articles about “homosexual marriage” (the case was dropped). There was also a case about a Christian family being rejected for fostering children because of their beliefs. “This is no dream; it is a reality. For those involved it has become a nightmare,” Fierravanti-Wells said. “This is supposed to be modern-day Australia, supposedly democratic and free. But this was not the case and isn’t the case for these people. You or I could be the next victims.” It should be noted many of these situations are something gay people also face from religious organisations. For example, the Perth case where a teacher lost employment after revealing on social media he was in a same-sex relationship Craig Kelly has a friend in the Australian Taxpayers’ Association: Allowing wealthy individuals who live in multi-million dollar palatial mansions to claim handouts funded by hardworking middle and working class taxpayers is an unconscionable rort that must end now if our pension system is to be sustainable in the decades to come [ ATA director of policy Satya Marar said in a statement]. The pension isn’t some entitlement you get simply because you pay into the system over your working life. It’s meant to provide a safety net for those who genuinely need it. There’s nothing cruel or unfair about requiring wealthy Australians to support themselves with their own wealth by downsizing before depending on the government. Means-tested welfare is a shrewd, fair principle and pension eligibility is no exception. Both major parties have baulked at this commonsense change out of fear of political consequences. But the consequences of doing nothing and ratcheting up billions more in tax bills or unsustainable public debt to fund those who don’t need it are far worse. We commend Craig Kelly MP for recognising the need for this timely and taxpayer-friendly reform. Jim Chalmers on Rob Harris’s story that Paul Fletcher, the then social-services minister, intervened to remove a recommendation Newstart be raised from a bipartisan parliamentary committee report before the election. I don’t involve myself in the goings on of that committee, but I think what is clear from the reports that have come out today, is that the report was going to recommend working towards an increase to Newstart, the government intervened at the last minute. “They seem to be the only ones who don’t recognise the need for consideration for a need for change here.” Linda Burney: “Not only the minister, but the then minister for social services, intervened and that is a very, very, very dangerous precedent”. Zali Steggall is delivering her first speech in the chamber. Just to make it clear: a quorum for the House is 31 government MPs (moved up from 30 after an additional electorate was added at the last election). Usually, no one cares. people have meetings, the parliament runs, yadda, yadda, yadda. But given that the opposition was messed around on Monday, when the government rushed through legislation it didn’t actually have to rush through, Labor is making life a bit difficult for the government. I imagine those quorum bells are going to ring quite a few times in the near future. If anyone is wondering why Labor is playing hard ball in the lower house, the manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, foreshadowed on Monday that it would not play nice. The government pushed through the drought fund bill by suspending standing orders and moving straight to third reading on Monday, without giving Labor 24 hours for the bill to go to caucus – and with the consequence that MPs didn’t have time to read the bill. On Monday Burke warned that rushing the legislation through was a “really dumb idea” and made vague threats that “if the government decides proper process in this House no longer matters” it can’t come to the opposition seeking cooperation on other procedural matters. So this morning’s shenanigans seem like straight-up payback. The Australian Council of Social Services has responded to this report from Rob Harris at the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age: A bipartisan call to increase the Newstart allowance was removed from a parliamentary report at the direction of the Morrison government on the eve of the federal election. As Prime Minister Scott Morrison stares down growing demands by Coalition MPs to lift the unemployment benefit for the first time since 1994, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age can reveal former social services minister Paul Fletcher intervened in an inquiry to erase a major recommendation that would have turbo-charged the sensitive issue. Here’s the acting Acoss CEO, Jacqueline Phillips: It’s outrageous that a Government Minister would step in and change a Parliamentary Inquiry’s recommendations, which should be based purely on evidence presented to the Inquiry. Rather than trying to avoid the issue, the Government should listen to the clear calls from the community, business sector and economists, for an increase to Newstart, which would reduce poverty, stimulate the economy and create jobs. It’s telling that a Parliamentary Inquiry, made up of members from the Coalition, Labor and the crossbench, appears to have come to the conclusion, before the election, that Newstart needs to be increased. This shows that we can achieve bipartisan support on increasing Newstart, as does the growing consensus across Parliament, including agreement from majority of Nationals MPs. We call on the Government to urgently reconsider its position. The time to act on Newstart is now. This has happened three times now – there have not been enough government members in the chamber for a quorum. I take back everything I said about missing the bells. Jim Chalmers and Linda Burney will hold a door stop on Craig Kelly’s latest intervention in just a few minutes. Kristina Keneally was just on Sky News, talking about what she sees as the consequences of the government rejecting recommendations from the joint committee on security and intelligence: I would say the government has sought to blow up the compact of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security. If you will, this is the beginning, unfortunately, of the compact of a committee which has worked very well and unlike any other committee, has produced bipartisan recommendations that have improved every piece of national security legislation. Now if the government is intent on on disregarding the recommendations and not working with the committee, it may be that some of the government’s recommended changes are sensical. It may be that in some cases they have misunderstood the committee’s recommendations, and we need to have a conversation with them. All of that has been thrown out the window, and that does, I believe, pose a risk, to the good functioning of that committee into the future. And it is unfortunate, because I think it has been of great benefit to security agencies and to Australians generally. Labor did not take on all of the committee’s recommendations on the telecommunications data retention bill, which the government is using as precedent for not taking all of the recommendations on this one. Labor is supporting the bill, despite its concerns. One of those being that the minister is the power which will get to decide who the temporary exclusion order applies to, not, as it is in the UK, on which the Australian laws are based on, a retired judge, or independent judiciary member. Peter Dutton says that would undermine the intent of the bill. Keneally says the UK, which has had these laws since 2015, has not found that. But again – it doesn’t matter, because the laws have bipartisan support to go through the parliament. Oh lookie here. Malcolm Roberts has the Senate matter of importance debate today and he has chosen the topic: That the flawed and dangerous medevac legislation undermines Australia’s border security and must be urgently repealed. Well slather me in vinegar and call me pickled – that just happens to be the very thing the government wants to talk about! Jim Chalmer’s adjournment speech was on this very topic last night: We’re told at least a dozen Liberals want to strip Australians of the super increases they need, deserve, and were promised. I gave the Prime Minister multiple opportunities in this House to rule out any changes to increasing the Super Guarantee to 12 per cent and he couldn’t, or wouldn’t, do it. The Treasurer too; he was given five opportunities on Insiders. The Trade Minister would only say they wouldn’t change it at this point in time. The Finance Minister said they’d leave it alone – but now we hear there was a barney about it in their party room today. The weasel words and sly language gives the game away. Here we go again. They’ve got form and not just on super. It always begins with backbench extremists putting pressure on the Treasurer, and it ends with him folding. It happened on energy and it will happen again on super.” Anthony Albanese’s ban on the word ‘liar’ just means shadow frontbenchers and their staff have to break out the thesaurus a little more. Hence - weasel words. The government has a majority in the House, so the motion goes nowhere. BUT Craig Kelly’s latest thought bubble is in defiance of Scott Morrison’s order to the party room on Tuesday, to shut up. You can’t keep Kelly down though. There is not a debate in this country that man doesn’t have an opinion on. Jim Chalmer’s attempt to suspend standing orders is over this story in the New Daily, where Craig Kelly had a chat to Samantha Maiden over what he thinks first-home owners should be able to do with their super: Liberal MP Craig Kelly has called for first-home buyers to be able to access super for a housing deposit, and also include the family home as part of the pension asset test. Defying the prime minister Scott Morrison’s call that Liberal MPs toe the party line on the superannuation debate, Kelly told the New Daily there should be a debate about including the family home in the asset test for the pension. “Your family house at the moment is 100% exempt from the asset test,” Kelly said. “If you decide you could use super to pay for your house you could say, ‘I want a larger family home now when the kids are young, knowing when my kids move out I will downsize’, there would be some discount of the family home that would be counted in the asset test.” Over in the House of Representatives, Jim Chalmers is attempting to suspend standing orders for this motion: That the House: 1) notes that: a) the member for Hughes has called for the family home to be included in the pension assets test, meaning more retirees will be pushed off the pension, out of their homes or both; b) 12 members of the government have now called for changes to the legislated increase to the superannuation guarantee; c) the government has already shortchanged pensioners by refusing to properly adjust deeming rates for years despite five interest rate cuts; d) the government made a deal with the Greens to change the pension asset test, which meant that the pension was cut for 370,000 pensioners, with 88,000 losing their pension altogether; e) the government tried to scrap the energy supplement for years, meaning 1.5 million pensioners would have had their payments cut; f) the government has repeatedly sought to raise the pension age to 70; g) the government tried to cut pension indexation in the 2014 budget, which would have forced pensioners to live on $80 a week less within 10 years; and h) the government cut $1bn from pensioner concessions in the 2014 budget. 2) therefore, condemns the government for undermining the retirement incomes of millions of Australians. As I slowly make my way through last night’s Hansard (what can I say, I live a wild life) I see that Nick McKim used his parliamentary privilege overnight to accuse Peter Dutton, or his office, of leaking confidential security advice to the media. That’s in relation to this story. The AFP declined to investigate the leak, with the referral not even getting past the first hurdle. Outgoing chief Andrew Colvin said it was deemed to have a low chance of a success. McKim: We so desperately need a charter of rights in this country so we can protect and enshrine those fundamental rights and freedoms that actually are amongst those things that make Australia such a great country. Those rights and freedoms that so many of us take for granted are now being taken away, hand over fist, by a combination of the major political parties in this place, the LNP and the ALP. They do that because they stitch up cosy deals behind the closed doors of the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security, a committee that operates often in total secret, without public scrutiny and which denies any crossbench representation and input into its decision-making process. What we get because of that collusion is the ongoing giving away of fundamental rights and freedoms in Australia. The crossbench should be on the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security; there’s no doubt about that. I want to give a couple of examples of issues that have arisen in the last year or so in Australia. Firstly, the leaking, which I have no doubt came either from minister Dutton or from his office to Simon Benson, to a journalist at the Australian, of classified Asio information, a leak which was condemned by Mr Lewis, the head of Asio, when it happened but which inexplicably the Australian federal police have declined to investigate. When you superimpose that on to the recent raids by the Australian federal police of prominent media outlets in this country, including News Corp and the ABC, you can understand why there is nervousness starting to emerge amongst our media, amongst journalists about the intimidatory nature of those raids. I say to our media that in fact the issue here is far broader than just press and media freedom; it’s about the freedoms of ordinary Australians to go about their day-to-day business without unnecessary spying and intrusion into their personal privacy by intelligence agencies in this country. It’s time we had a charter of rights to protect a broad range of rights, including our rights to privacy. It’s time that we had an informed conversation in this country about the ongoing erosion of rights and freedoms in the name of national security and an informed debate about whether or not giving away those rights and freedoms is necessary or, indeed, whether giving them away makes us any safer at all from the threats that no doubt exist today. Andrew Giles: Justice Murphy, presiding over the case, stated, ‘There is a strongly arguable case that in evacuating the applicant to PIH rather than to a hospital in Australia, the respondents provided inadequate medical care to the applicant. The evacuation resulted in the applicant being sent to a hospital which, at least arguably, did not have the capacity to properly respond to her medical needs. The case of this little girl demonstrates that decisions about medical care should be taken by medical professionals. The advice of doctors should be listened to and acted upon. The Australian people are good, decent and generous. They don’t want to see vulnerable, sick people in our care suffering when medical care is available to treat them. They appreciate that these circumstances are distinct from the complex policy debates in this area. This is why the parliament must not allow the medevac legislation to be repealed. This is why we are proposing our second reading amendment to the bill, which is before the House. I move: That all words after “that” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that the: (1) minister for home affairs has: (a) failed to accurately describe the processes providing for the medical transfer of people from Papua New Guinea and Nauru; and (b) consistently mischaracterised the effects of these processes; and (2) minister for home affairs and the minister for immigration and citizenship have failed to put forward any amendments which would address any genuine concerns they may have with the operation of the processes.” Debate was interrupted by the adjournment. But you know where that amendment will go. Andrew Giles spoke in the House late last night on the medevac repeal bill: I want to briefly share with the House the human story I think best illustrates what a difference this regime has made and how dangerous it would be to go back. The story concerns a two-year-old girl known as DIZ18. Her parents fled Iran to Australia, arriving in 2013 without a visa. They were taken by the Australian government to Nauru and recognised as refugees under the refugee convention in 2014. DIZ18 was born in Nauru on 5 June 2016. This little girl became ill in June 2018 and her illness rapidly got worse over the next few days. On 12 June the treating doctors, with the International Health and Medical Services – the medical service contracted to provide healthcare to refugees on Nauru – diagnosed her with severe sepsis. In short, IHMS recommended that the little girl be urgently medically evacuated, to a tertiary-level hospital, to Australia or a third country. A senior officer of the Australian Border Force involved in the decision inquired whether it was possible for the applicant to, instead, be evacuated to a hospital in Papua New Guinea or Taiwan. Each doctor and specialist who recommended her medical evacuation recommended that she be taken to a tertiary hospital in Australia or another first-world country; however, the sick little girl was treated at the hospital in Papua New Guinea. It rapidly became clear that the standard of care required, including MRI brain scans and other scans, were not available at this hospital. The medevac repeal bill is low-key simmering away in the background. It won’t reach the Senate for a debate until it has been through a committee, which is not due to report back until October – and then the Senate will consider it in November. Jacqui Lambie is the key vote there. And she is not saying what she plans on doing. After the Angus Taylor hour yesterday, nuclear power is once again floating around. There is a growing number of Coalition backbenchers pushing for an inquiry into nuclear power, being led by the Queensland contingent. Keith Pitt is a particularly passionate advocate. Taylor, as part of Labor’s focus on him in question time yesterday, was asked about the policy, as well as where he believed any potential nuclear power sites should go. The government is not into nuclear power. During the election campaign, Scott Morrison’s comments to a Tasmanian radio station that nuclear power was “not ‘not’ on the agenda, wherever it can come from is fine, but it has to be self-sustaining”, caused a brief kerfuffle that the PMO was very quick to try and extinguish. And yet, here we still are. Taylor hasn’t done the best job of ruling it out, even if, as his colleagues tell me, he has been told to. So out comes Peter Dutton this morning on Sunrise: The only thing we have said, let us be clear about it, we want lower electricity prices. We want reliability. We want people to turn lights on and his crazy renewable targets doubling power prices that Labor is proposing ... Given that it is three years until the next election, Dutton was interrupted and asked if nuclear was the answer. I don’t believe it is and the government has had a moratorium. Bob Hawke was the last letter to advocate, and he did strongly, for nuclear. The government’s position has been made clear, we are not closed to to debates. People can express their views but the government’s perspective is to get prices down and make sure people can turn lights on. (Fun fact: Tveeder, the transcription service, changes nuclear to “new killer”, and I think that’s just beautiful.) In news that seems to be like all James McGrath’s Milo and milks came at once, Boris Johnson is officially the UK prime minister. Good to see a battler finally come out on top (yes, that is sarcasm). Former foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop welcomed the news, telling Network Seven: “Boris Johnson has an unusually close relationship with Australia for a British prime minister,” she said. “He spent his gap year here, attending Geelong Grammar. He’s visited Australia many times.” Speaking of that gap year, Johnson mentioned it in a 2015 interview with the Sydney Morning Herald, where he told this story about getting lost in Canberra and somehow managing to camp on a roundabout. I was driving there and I was about 18 and I got totally lost and I dossed down for the night in a roundabout. Well, I woke up and discovered it was a roundabout,” he explains. He pitched his tent on the roundabout in the middle of the night – an experience that went about as well as you’d expect for a young British kid sleeping in the middle of a Canberra street in the 1980s. “It was terrible. I thought it would be OK, then I got woken up by the traffic and then I looked at my hands, my hands had swollen up like blown-up washing-up gloves because I had been so badly bitten.” I call bull shit, but then again, maybe it sounds different in Latin. It’s day three which means the sitting is one day closer to ending. Silver linings people. After the latest national security fight, the government is now gearing up for the latest union fight. Christian Porter and the government are having another go at the ensuring integrity bill. Labor have already said it won’t support this bill. That’s not unexpected – it goes against everything that the Labor party stands for. So it is the crossbench the government needs to convince and so far, Centre Alliance and One Nation are not impressed. That will be debated in the House later today – and Porter has been out and about early to try and garner support. Meanwhile, late last night, Peter Dutton rejected a Senate request to hand over documents related to the extension of the Paladin contract. From AAP’s report: Senators instructed the home affairs minister to hand over information about the contract to ensure taxpayers were getting value for money, given it was awarded to the small company in a closed tender process. In a letter to the Senate president tabled late on Tuesday night, Dutton said tens of thousands of documents were potentially within scope of the order. “Due to the significant volume of documents, I assess compliance with the order would result in an unreasonable diversion of significant resources,” he said. “I will therefore not be tabling any documents on 23 July 2019 as stipulated in the original order.” Dutton is now locked in talks with Labor’s home affairs spokeswoman Kristina Keneally to reduce the scope of required documents, pushing the deadline out by another month. “Negotiations regarding the scope of the documents to be provided by this date are ongoing,” he said. We’ll bring you that, and everything else which happens within these so-called corridors of power (and beyond) as it unfolds, so I do hope you’ll come along with us. Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp are all at your service, so while I browbeat one of them into getting me a coffee, we should jump into it. Ready? Let’s go."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2021/sep/17/australia-covid-live-update-melbournes-alcohol-ban-to-stay-when-outdoor-restrictions-ease-national-cabinet-to-discuss-home-quarantine-lockdown-aged-care-vaccine-mandate-gladys-berejiklian-daniel-andrews-nsw-sydney-victoria-coronavirus","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-17T09:12:34Z","webTitle":"People in west Sydney made to feel like criminals in own homes, inquiry told: as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/sep/17/australia-covid-live-update-melbournes-alcohol-ban-to-stay-when-outdoor-restrictions-ease-national-cabinet-to-discuss-home-quarantine-lockdown-aged-care-vaccine-mandate-gladys-berejiklian-daniel-andrews-nsw-sydney-victoria-coronavirus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2021/sep/17/australia-covid-live-update-melbournes-alcohol-ban-to-stay-when-outdoor-restrictions-ease-national-cabinet-to-discuss-home-quarantine-lockdown-aged-care-vaccine-mandate-gladys-berejiklian-daniel-andrews-nsw-sydney-victoria-coronavirus","fields":{"headline":"People in west Sydney made to feel like criminals in own homes, inquiry told: as it happened","bodyText":"That’s where I will leave you for tonight. Here’s what we learned: New modelling by the Doherty Institute being presented to national cabinet warns that maintaining “medium” public health and social measures would be “prudent” until Australia reaches 80% vaccination if caseloads are high. The local government areas of Hilltops and Glen Innes in New South Wales will be placed into lockdown from 6pm Friday for seven days due to an increased Covid-19 public health risk. People in west and south-west Sydney have been traumatised and made to feel like criminals in their own homes, an inquiry into the state government’s handling of the pandemic has heard. The inquiry also heard a youth corrections officer has died from Covid-19 after the outbreak within the state’s prison system. NSW will begin a trial of home quarantine for returned international residents. Fully vaccinated travellers in the trial will only need to quarantine for seven days not 14. NSW also recorded 1,284 new cases and 12 deaths including two women in their 20s. Victoria recorded 510 new cases and one death. From this weekend Melburnians will be able picnic outside with members of another household. This can be groups of five if everyone is fully vaccinated or two if not. ACT has recorded 30 new cases, one of its highest-ever days. Queensland recorded one new case, a close contact of the Sunnybank cluster who was in home quarantine. The Chinese embassy in Canberra has accused the Australian and US governments of a “staged farce” after ministers at the Ausmin talks criticised China over a range of issues including human rights in Xinjiang. South Australia’s premier has promised that everyone working on the old French attack-class submarines will find work again in the state, many on the new nuclear program. Tasmania will begin a trial of home quarantine for fully vaccinated residents returning from regional NSW. New Zealand will not be reopening its trans-Tasman travel bubble any time soon, as case numbers in Australia rise and numbers in New Zealand continue to drop. The Victorian government is introducing some extraordinary measures to prevent anti-lockdown protestors entering Melbourne tomorrow. AAP reports that Melburnians heading into the city for a Covid-19 vaccination will have to show proof to pass through police roadblocks as the CBD is effectively turned into a no-go zone for Saturday’s planned rally, with public transport to and from the city suspended from 8am to 2pm and road checkpoints set up. Emergency and essential workers will still be let in, along with thousands of people scheduled to get a vaccine dose at one of the two city-based hubs. Victoria’s Covid-19 commander, Jeroen Weimar, on Friday confirmed 2,700 bookings at Jeff’s Shed and Melbourne Museum will go ahead, although no further appointments were being taken. Despite the public transport network shutdown and no alternative arrangements being made, Weimar said there had not been a significant cancellation of bookings. If you do not intend to attend for that vaccination appointment, that’s fine. There are alternative appointments available on other days. We’d appreciate it if you could go online or give us a call and make those changes now so we don’t have staff standing around waiting for you to come forward.” My benevolent and magnanimous colleague Michael McGowan is your steward from here on. Thanks all for your company, correspondence, and comments. Be well. Routine rapid antigen testing will be introduced into the nation’s largest criminal court in order to return jury trials to Sydney. Jurors will also need to be fully vaccinated to serve on trials as the NSW district court tries to address a growing backlog. The court on Friday said it would build on social distancing measures implemented in 2020, which included larger jury rooms, individualised meals for jurors, and mandatory face-mask wearing. About 200 trials have been vacated and countless others delayed since Sydney entered its current lockdown on June 26. Other than select regional areas no longer in lockdown, most district courts – including those in Sydney and Newcastle – are not holding jury trials. The new jury trial regime will commence on 25 October. Chief judge justice Derek Price said the court had done “everything possible during the lockdown to keep matters progressing” with judges hearing judge-alone trials, sentence matters, appeals and other matters virtually. “I am pleased to outline the steps that will be taken to enable the return of jury trials in a way that is in the interests of the health and wellbeing of all court participants,” he said. Rapid antigen testing will apply to all court participants. “If you get a juror summons, please answer it,” attorney-general Mark Speakman said. In a normal year, the district court holds about 1000 jury trials. It also stopped empanelling juries for three months last year as a result of the pandemic. An interstate truck driver has been arrested by Queensland police after ramming through a border checkpoint at an inland town 300km west of Brisbane. The driver was refused entry to Queensland in Goondiwindi on Thursday, then returned on Friday, before ramming through check point barriers at the Keetah Bridge crossing near Yelarbon. The man was arrested the next day in the border town of Texas. Both towns are along the Queensland-NSW border and are routinely patrolled by police due to the state’s Covid-19 entry restrictions. Deputy police commissioner Steve Gollschewski said the driver has been charged with illegally entering Queensland in breach of a health order, and with wilful damage. “That person was turned around. They didn’t have a right of entry at Goondiwindi, chose to go to another border crossing at Texas, tried to drive through it in a truck – didn’t work,” he said. The truck driver has since been returned to NSW but will face Queensland court at a later date. Police carried out 16,000 vehicle checks in the past 24 hours, with 191 people turned around. A youth corrections officer in New South Wales has died from Covid-19 after the outbreak within the state’s prison system, a parliamentary inquiry has heard. On Friday afternoon a parliamentary inquiry into the spiralling outbreak inside the prison system heard there are now more than 40 Covid-positive corrections staff within the state’s prison system. Those numbers do not include staff at the privately-run Parklea prison, where the outbreak began. There are more than 300 Covid positive inmates across the prison system, including 84 indigenous people. But the executive director of clinical operations at the justice health department, Wendy Hoey, has also confirmed that one officer has died as a result of the outbreak. The inquiry is ongoing. The man who ran the Minerals Council when it gave Scott Morrison a lacquered lump of coal that he took into parliament to goad the opposition has been appointed Australia’s ambassador to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. Former Minerals Council boss Brendan Pearson was most recently a senior trade adviser in prime minister Scott Morrison’s office and has held a number of roles in the department of foreign affairs and trade. He has also worked with global coal giant Peabody Energy. Former finance minister Mathias Cormann, for whom Pearson also previously worked, took on the role of OECD secretary general in June. Pearson’s appointment, like that of Cormann, has not been universally lauded. Richie Merzian, climate &amp; energy program director at the Australia Institute, said the appointment would damage Australia’s reputation. “The Australian Government already has a reputation as a lobbyist for the fossil fuel industry and the appointment of a fossil fuel lobbyist to represent Australia at the OECD in Paris does little more than cement this growing global perception. “Mr Pearson not only has a history of exaggerating the benefits of coal and ignoring its costs, but he oversaw one of Australia’s great public relations backfires, the 2015 ‘coal is amazing’ ads.” The OECD provides advice, analysis and research on a range of issues including trade, health, employment, agriculture, aid, energy, education, the digital economy and environment policy. While the ambassadorial role is usually staffed by a career diplomat, Pearson is not the first political appointment to the post. Wayne Swan’s chief of staff Chris Barrett served as ambassador from 2011 to 2014. Tiffanie Turnbull reports for AAP: People in west and southwest Sydney have been traumatised and made to feel like criminals in their own homes, an inquiry into the state government’s handling of the pandemic has heard. The majority of the 12 local government areas under the harshest lockdown restrictions are in the city’s west and southwest, which are hubs of multiculturalism and home to many people from non-English speaking backgrounds. A group of community leaders on Friday told the parliamentary inquiry people in the region feel “totally alienated from the rest of Sydney”. Many feel targeted because of their ethnicity. While people in the city’s east have been pictured sunbaking at Bondi, some in its west have been arrested for watching a relative’s funeral at a distance from inside their car, the inquiry heard. “We have been made to feel like criminals in our own homes,” Arab Council of Australia chief executive Randa Kattan said. “That’s what happens when you find yourself flanked by police as you leave the 7-Eleven store. “That’s how it feels when you wake to hear choppers hovering overhead.” The disparity in lockdown approaches was embodied by the curfew placed on the hotspot areas, the council said. Premier Gladys Berejiklian had previously ruled out curfews, saying the measure did not work in the fight against Covid-19, but in late August introduced one after media pressure, claiming the advice from health and police had changed. The curfew was this week lifted following a furious backlash, but community leaders say the damage has been done. Amar Singh, President of Turbans 4 Australia, told the inquiry seeing military and police patrol the streets had been extremely triggering. “Curfews is what we’ve heard of as migrant Australians from our mothers and grandmothers,” he said. “Bringing in those things mentally made a very big dent, a scar, on the average person living in southwest and west Sydney.” Kattan said the curfew broke a community “already on their knees” with the heavy lockdown. “It is absolutely sadistic to roll it out when you have no evidence that it would work,” she said. “It was just another message that you don’t matter.” The measure also added unnecessary financial and job-related stress, Unions NSW Secretary Mark Morey said, with the vast majority of people in the area not working nine-to-five jobs. NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Tony Cooke, who leads the southwest metropolitan area command, denied the area was being singled out. “The numbers of fines across the three metropolitan regions are very, very similar,” he said. “In fact, more have been issued in the central metropolitan region than have been in southwestern Sydney.” NSW Health is holding a state-wide Covid-19 vaccination blitz this weekend (18–19 September 2021) to increase vaccinations among Aboriginal people. Local health districts across NSW will have Aboriginal staff at 18 vaccination sites to provide a culturally safe place for Aboriginal people to get vaccinated. “It’s been very pleasing to see services working together to rollout vaccinations, especially during the challenges of the current outbreaks,” Geri Wilson-Matenga, executive director Centre for Aboriginal Health, said. “Working with our Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Sector is critical in enabling access to culturally safe vaccination options. These services have always provided the holistic wrap around care that is so important at this time.” The NSW government is supporting Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHS) to manage vaccinations for Aboriginal people, providing $4 million to support Aboriginal vaccination outreach. “Aboriginal people aged 12 years and over can access a Covid-19 vaccine. You can talk to your GP, Aboriginal Medical Service, Aboriginal Health Workers or any vaccination hubs about getting your vaccination,” Wilson-Matenga said. “Covid-19 vaccinations are safe, and will protect your and your parents, grandparents, aunties, uncles, sisters and brothers from the virus. If you are vaccinated you are less likely to catch Covid-19, and less likely to pass the virus on if you do. You are also less likely to get really unwell and need to go to hospital,” she said. A full list of clinics participating in the Aboriginal vaccination blitz weekend is available here. Amid Covid, young people are facing challenges unthinkable for their parents at the same age. Only a long-term commitment to fix the system can help them, writes Omar Khorshid, president of the Australian Medical Association. Back at home, and back on Covid. From the NSW health ministry: Stay-at-home orders will be introduced for the Hilltops and Glen Innes local government areas (LGAs) from 6pm Friday for seven days due to an increased Covid-19 public health risk. These stay-at-home orders also apply to anyone who has been in the Hilltops LGA including Young and surrounding areas since 3 September, and the Glen Innes LGA since 13 September. Everyone in the Hilltops and Glen Innes LGAs must stay at home unless it is for an essential reason, which includes shopping for food, medical care, getting vaccinated, compassionate needs, exercise and work or tertiary education if you can’t work or study at home. People who are fully vaccinated can attend an outdoor gathering of up to five people for exercise or outdoor recreation as long as all of those aged 16 or older are fully vaccinated. To determine the extent of the risk and detect any further potential Covid-19 cases in these areas we are calling on the communities to come forward for testing in large numbers. A strong response to testing will be a key factor in determining if these stay-at-home orders are extended beyond one week. High vaccination rates are also essential to reduce the risk of transmission and protect the health and safety of the community. Covid-19 vaccination is available through NSW Health clinics, GPs, pharmacies and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHS). This is dreadful news. From the AP in the US: Firefighters have wrapped the base of the world’s largest tree in a fire-resistant blanket as they tried to save a famous grove of gigantic old-growth sequoias from wildfires burning in California’s rugged Sierra Nevada. For some context, the giant sequoia General Sherman, thought to be the world’s largest tree, is 84m tall, has a circumference at ground level of 31m, and is believed to be more than 2000 years old. Adam Marshall, NSW’s agriculture minister and MP for the Northern Tablelands, has confirmed in a Facebook post that the Glen Innes Severn shire council will go into a week-long lockdown from tonight. I have just been advised moments ago by the health minister and NSW chief health officer that a decision has been taken to place the Glen Innes Severn LGA into a seven-day lockdown, from 6pm tonight, as a result of a known Covid case (announced yesterday) active in the community. I am very sorry and realise this was not the news many of you were wanting to hear, especially small business owners, and I fully appreciate the stress and strain this will place on you. However, in response to the Covid case and the fact that the individual had been active in the community while infectious, the NSW Chief Health Officer convened an independent panel of medical experts to review all the information relevant to the case in Glen Innes. That panel determined and strongly recommended that a 7-day lockdown be imposed to protect the community and safeguard against further spread of Covid in Glen Innes, especially given the Covid-positive individual was active in the local community (and outside the community) for three days while infectious. As announced at the time lockdowns were lifted across our region recently, if a case appeared which was active in the community, that LGA would be placed into a 14-day lockdown. Only 7 days has been recommended and agreed for the Glen Innes LGA based on the level of risk posed to the community. Marshall said the lockdown rules would be the same as for the previous lockdown, with stay-at-home orders – with the same exceptions allowed – in force for seven days. The lockdown begins at 6pm. New modelling by the Doherty Institute being presented to national cabinet warns that maintaining “medium” public health and social measures would be “prudent” until Australia reaches 80% vaccination if caseloads are high – with “medium” measures previously defined as including stay-at-home orders except for work, study and other essential purposes. The institute – which conducted the modelling informing Australia’s four-phase reopening plan – has updated its work after a dispute erupted within the federation about whether or not it was safe to ease restrictions once 70% of Australians over the age of 16 were vaccinated. While the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, warned other premiers to stick to the reopening plan agreed by national cabinet, and ease restrictions at 70%, other leaders in other states queried whether the first run of modelling was a reliable barometer of the risks because it assumed low case numbers. Hearing reports the Glen Innes Severn shire council, on NSW’s north coast, will go into a seven-day lockdown from 6pm this evening. Standby for more... The federal health minister has announced the first doses of the US-developed Moderna vaccine will arrive in Australia tonight, with one million doses due by the end of the weekend. Greg Hunt told reporters: “Tonight, the first shipment of Moderna arrives in Australia. “Over this weekend the second shipment will arrive and that will be over 1 million doses arriving in Australia and then that will be followed consistently over the course of the coming weeks doses going forward. “The significant outcome of that is that that means over 1800 pharmacies will commence distribution of Moderna next week, they will start aggressively during the week as they are ready and as supplies arrive to them.” He said by next week, there will be 9000 ‘points of access’ for Australians to get vaccinated. “My hope is that everybody, everybody who has not yet taken the vaccine will come forward over the coming days and weeks and there is sufficient vaccine for every Australian before the end of October, if not significantly earlier.” 70.5% of eligible Australians have had their first dose of a vaccine, Hunt said, some 14.5m people. “That means that less than 2 million Australians to achieve the 80% rate. We are on track to do that.” More than 24 million vaccine doses have been administered across Australia. The head of Victoria’s Covid-19 response has slammed construction workers for blocking the streets of Melbourne in protest at new restrictions placed on tea rooms. Dozens of workers set up plastic chairs and tables in the middle of Lonsdale Street in Melbourne’s CBD for their morning smoke break on Friday, forcing the cancellation of trams in the vicinity. Similar protests also took place on Collins Street and Elizabeth Street in the city centre, as well as in Brunswick, Coburg, Kew, Parkville, South Yarra and Richmond, during the morning and at lunchtime. The roads have now been cleared. The action comes after the Victorian government imposed tough restrictions on the industry, with 13% of the state’s active Covid-19 cases linked to transmission at construction sites. From 11.59pm on Friday, tea rooms at sites must shut, and food and drink can no longer be consumed indoors, while travel between Melbourne and the regions for work will be banned. By the same time on 23 September, all construction workers will be required to show evidence to their employer that they have had their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Limited medical exemptions will apply, in keeping with the vaccine mandate for aged care workers. Victorian state construction union secretary John Setka said the decision to close tea rooms was “appalling”, and was made without consulting the CFMEU. “It’s not really a protest,” he told 3AW radio on Friday of the smoko stand-off. “What they decided was, ‘If we can’t sit in the smoko shed, where do we have our break?’. So they’ve taken all the tables and chairs out into the fresh air. “They’ve got nowhere else to have their smoko.” But Victoria’s Covid-19 Commander Jeroen Weimar said there was a “significant risk of transmission” in tea rooms. “People are bending over backwards to keep the construction industry going and keep important sites going for important reasons. Please don’t,” he said. “We all need to be humble on this and recognise the privileges that those of us who are still able to work can get. If you can’t sit next to your mates having a sandwich, that doesn’t seem a huge burden to bear.” Opposition spokesman Tim Smith said the construction industry has been “treated abysmally like every other industry has been throughout this pandemic”. “You’ve now got the CFMEU, as part of the Labor party, protesting against this Labor government, because they’re being treated as poorly as the rest of the community,” he said. Premier Daniel Andrews on Thursday said the tightened restrictions were backed by health advice and designed to keep the construction industry open at its 25% workforce cap. The industry was earlier this week warned it risked losing its authorised worker status amid the launch of an enforcement and vaccination blitz. In NSW, the entire construction industry was shut down for two weeks as cases escalated. Australia’s decision to build nuclear-powered submarines as part of a security pact with the US and UK has disquieted its largest near-neighbour. Indonesia says it is “deeply concerned” by the “continuing arms race” across the Asia-Pacific. Jakarta’s foreign affairs ministry has issued a carefully worded statement on Australia’s nuclear-powered submarines program. It reads, in full: 1. Indonesia takes note cautiously of the Australian government’s decision to acquire nuclear-powered submarines. 2. Indonesia is deeply concerned over the continuing arms race and power projection in the region. 3. Indonesia stresses the importance of Australia’s commitment to continue meeting all of its nuclear non-proliferation obligations. 4. Indonesia calls on Australia to maintain its commitment towards regional peace, stability and security in accordance with the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. 5. Indonesia encourages Australia and other parties concerned to advance dialogue in settling any differences peacefully. In this regard, Indonesia underscores the respect for international law, including UNCLOS 1982, in maintaining peace and security in the region. Diplomatic relations between Canberra and Jakarta, characteristically unsteady, are currently at their strongest in years. Indonesia was the first stop for foreign minister Marise Payne and defence minister Peter Dutton last week, part of an overseas itinerary that has also included India, South Korea and the US. This is life on the front lines of Covid: Regardless of who they get to speak at the sanitised press conferences, no-one has come close to describing the strain the healthcare system is feeling. It’s buckling. A paramedic in south-west Sydney says hospitals are unrecognisable, and “it all feels very apocalyptic”. New South Wales will introduce a home quarantine “pilot” for international arrivals, as the state works towards opening international borders. The pilot, which will be run as a partnership between the NSW government and the commonwealth, will trial a seven-day home quarantine program for about 175 fully vaccinated people. NSW minister for jobs, tourism, investment and western Sydney, Stuart Ayres, said that the state’s high vaccination rates have meant the government could announce the “next step” in the reopening strategy. “We’re going to, at the end of this month, conduct a trial that changes the way we do quarantine. It gives us a chance to test seven-day quarantine in the home.” With that, I might leave you for the day (and the week), and hand you over to the amazing Ben Doherty. Here is what we have learnt during our time together: NSW will begin a trial of home quarantine for returned international residents. Fully vaccinated travellers in the trial will only need to quarantine for seven days not 14. NSW also recorded 1,284 new cases and 12 deaths including two women in their 20s. Victoria recorded 510 new cases and one death. From this weekend Melburnians will be able picnic outside with members of another household. This can be groups of five if everyone is fully vaccinated or two if not. ACT has recorded 30 new cases, one of its highest-ever days. Queensland recorded one new case, a close contact of the Sunnybank cluster who was in home quarantine. The Chinese embassy in Canberra has accused the Australian and US governments of a “staged farce” after ministers at the Ausmin talks criticised China over a range of issues including human rights in Xinjiang. South Australia’s premier has promised that everyone working on the old French attack-class submarines will find work again in the state, many on the new nuclear program. Tasmania will begin a trial of home quarantine for fully vaccinated residents returning from regional NSW. New Zealand will not be reopening its trans-Tasman travel bubble any time soon, as case numbers in Australia rise and numbers in New Zealand continue to drop. See you all next week! Just normal things happening today in Melbourne then... Torres Strait Islander communities are at risk from a growing Delta outbreak in Papua New Guinea due to a lack of essential goods, supplies and healthcare, federal MP Warren Entsch says. Treaty Islands like Boigu and Saigai sit in close proximity to mainland PNG but are recognised as part of the Torres Strait. Much of their food and healthcare supplies prior to the pandemic came from the neighbouring PNG town of Daru, which is now in the grip of a Covid-19 outbreak, reports Fraser Barton from AAP. Daru is roughly 50km from Saigai but treaty villages 4km from Australian territory have been cut off from the delivery of goods from the Torres Strait. Federal member for Leichardt Warren Entsch, says these treaty islands are at risk of travelling to Daru for essential supplies like food, fuel and healthcare needs. He has labelled the response by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as “a bloody disgrace” as only two supply rounds to the islands have been organised since the pandemic began, the last of which was in February of this year. Early this year I was able to convince the department to supply basic food items for the treaty villages and we actually did two deliveries... The problem that we had was that instead of buying it, or sourcing it from stores on Saibai and Boigu where it always comes from, they bought it out of Port Moresby. They had the capacity to supply food that the people understood and can cook, but now they decided to source it out of Port Moresby. The meat protein they come with like sloppy soup. They couldn’t eat it. In the Torres Strait, 69% of the eligible population have received their first dose, and 51% of people are fully vaccinated as at 10 September. But until the population is fully inoculated the threat of Covid-19 will be ever-present and Entsch says the region still faces other healthcare issues. “It’s going to be devastating in Daru. At the end of the day, if you want leprosy, cholera, tuberculosis encephalitis, meningitis ... It’s all there... I just know what’s going to happen and I’ve been warning them (DFAT) for ages, and they just continually deny that there’s a problem. Neither the ministers, nor any of the staff are not aware that there’s a problem. If this gets into these treaty villages, and then extends to cross to Australia, then the DFAT has to accept responsibility for it. Comment has been sought from the department. Canberra has recorded 30 new Covid-19 cases as some residential construction sites are shut down for “unforgivable” public health breaches. Of Friday’s cases, 19 are linked and most of those are household contacts of existing infections, reports Georgie Moore from AAP. Just 12 were in quarantine throughout their infectious period, with at least 14 in the community for some of the time. Chief minister Andrew Barr told reporters: Today is not the first time that we have seen new daily case numbers in the 30s... And it is too early to know if this is a one-off. But it is clear that this is not a good number. He labelled significant breaches of public health restrictions reported at residential construction sites “unforgivable”. It’s simply not good enough. And the sites have been shut down. Look at all those hard hats! Very salt of the earth! Back to the ACT and this doesn’t seem super encouraging. Chief minister Andrew Barr says he plans to discuss hospital capacity at national cabinet today as the modelling “looks quite scary across Australia”. The modelling would indicate case numbers will go from thousands to tens of thousands” when NSW opens up. Says health capacity “appears to be insufficient for the massive number of cases Secondly, Gutwein has formally set a goal of 90% of the population vaccinated by 1 December, in order for the state to safely open its border in time for Christmas. I’m just trying to get clarity on if this is a hard and fast requirement for reopening or more of an aspirational goal. He also challenged Tasmanians to reach 80% vaccination by Melbourne Cup Day ... because the vaccination rollout is a race ... I think? (I genuinely adore public policy being based on puns.) There are two main updates from the Tasmanian press conference. Firstly premier Peter Gutwein has announced that, from next Friday, the state will begin a trial of home quarantine conditions for Tasmanian residents returning from NSW. The trial will last at least 30 days before its effectiveness is assessed and only Tasmanians coming from regional NSW will be eligible to quarantine at first. They will have to be double vaccinated, have evidence of a negative Covid-19 test and must have no other occupants in their home. By the way, here is a look at the NSW daily case number graph now that we have today’s numbers. Call me an optimist, but we really are starting to see something that looks suspiciously like a downward curve. When it comes to that ACT news, Greg Jericho says it best. The Australian Capital Territory has recorded 30 Covid-19 cases overnight. Speaking of tense Chinese-Australian relations let’s jump back to South Australia where the federal finance minister Simon Birmingham has just been asked about the fairly inflammatory comments about the submarine deal from the pro-Chinese government newspaper, the Global Times, warning Australia not to act provocatively or China would “certainly punish it with no mercy”. Well, look, I have to The Global Times make many reckless comments over the years and these are in line with that type of recklessness... I’m not going to speculate in terms of internal discussions within Chinese government and Chinese media. I reinforce that Australia makes these sovereign decisions in relation to our defence capabilities, the same as any other nation makes such decisions, including China. We do so in a spirit of seeking to ensure security across our region. Our desires to see peace and security the Indo-Pacific region, because that is so crucial to the sovereignty of Australia and the sovereignty and action, indeed, of our many other fellow nations across this region. The Chinese embassy in Canberra has accused the Australian and US governments of a “staged farce” after ministers at the Ausmin talks criticised China over a range of issues including human rights in Xinjiang. The embassy also accused Australia of “sliding further down on the road of harming China-Australia relations” and of lacking independence from the US. The joint US/Australia statement, issued this morning, expressed “ongoing concern regarding the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea that are without legal basis”. Australian ministers Marise Payne and Peter Dutton and their US counterparts Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin also “expressed grave concerns about the PRC’s campaign of repression against Uyghurs and other religious and ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang”. This statement has just arrived from a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Canberra: We firmly oppose and reject the unfounded accusations and erroneous remarks against China on issues related to the South China Sea, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other China-related issues in the Joint Statement of Australia-U.S. Ministerial Consultations (Ausmin) on 17 September. Those assertions, in disregard of basic facts, violated international law and basic norms governing international relations and grossly interfered in China’s internal affairs. This petty move to put pressure on China will be of no avail but a staged farce. We urge the Australian side to abandon the outdated Cold War zero-sum mentality and narrow-minded geopolitical perception, handle its relationship with China in a genuinely independent manner, stop sliding further down on the road of harming China-Australia relations, and do more to enhance mutual trust and promote pragmatic cooperation. Victorian press conference: Reporter: Do Victorians have to be prepared, though – if case numbers are going to go up, we’ll see more Victorians die if we open up? Foley: Current projections continue to see case numbers go up and as we see case numbers go up, we see more Victorians treated in the community through the Covid positive pathway arrangements at home. We see more people admitted to hospital and we see, sadly, a small number continue to die, like we had tragically another death to report this morning. The best thing we can all do is if those numbers increase, get ahead of that increase by following the rules, getting tested and getting vaccinated. They are the best things we can all do to assist our frontline healthcare workers. Martin Foley is up responding to a release published today co-signed by 120,000 health workers warning against prioritising “getting on the beers” before double dose vaccination targets are met Foley: I’ve been talking with all of those organisations regularly, including in the last few days, and they’ve shared their concerns very forcefully. These are people who for 20 months now have been at the frontline of our public health response and know from last winter just what an outbreak can mean, with over 800 deaths in Victoria, particularly from our private aged care facilities. These people, whether they’re ambos, whether they’re salaried officers, nurses, clinicians, the entire public health workforce, have been working like never before in a system that has been busy like never before. And they’ve expressed, quite rightly I think, their concerns about what would happen if we continue to have high levels of uncontrolled infections in our community. We’re working with them and with our health services to make sure that we have plans in place to try to avoid that. But the best thing we can do as Victorians is to make sure we follow the public health rules, that we get tested and get vaccinated. That’s how that scenario gets avoided. In the likelihood that there will be continued increases in infections, we are working with the health services and all of those groups to put in place the best way in which we can manage increased demands. There still isn’t a great deal of clarity on whether picnickers will be able to get on the beers or will be required to keep their masks on while socialising. Weimar says the “spirit” of people’s picnics is important to consider. Weimar: It’s OK for five people, fully vaccinated, two households, and dependants to come together and enjoy a picnic. Let’s not abuse it. The questions yesterday around the fine details of picnic versus playground versus vaccination versus drinks and coffee and masks, there’ll be a detailed answer to that question but also a spirit. If we’re seeing large groups of people all hanging out together without masks on holding coffee cups, that’s not what we’re trying to achieve. We’re trying to reduce the numbers of infections in our community so we can get rid of this thing. Marshall: All of those who have been working on the Attack class programs will have a job in South Australia. I think all of the employees at Naval Group Australia will find jobs in South Australia because, at the moment, there are more than 20,000 jobs on offer in South Australia. You would have seen yesterday with those incredible employment statistics which came out from the ABS that, in fact, South Australia now has the very highest level of full-time employment we have had in the history of our state stop so there are no problems in finding work here in South Australia. The SA premier is also at this presser, and you better believe he is wearing a hard hat too. And because he is wearing a hard hat, you know he is speaking directly to the blue-collar workers of South Australia. Steven Marshall: It’s a happy day for South Australia. We are in a massive high still after the announcement yesterday. That we will be building a nuclear-powered submarine fleet right here in South Australia at Osborne on top of keeping full cycle docking, extending the life of the Collins class and doing that work here in South Australia. And of course, the Hobart class upgrade will take place right here at Osborne. So billions of dollars’ worth of work and huge jobs, jobs now and into the future, jobs for decades and decades to come. We are talking to the workforce right around the state at the moment, they are the reason that we won this work. We have got unequivocally, the very best maritime, shipbuilding and submarine building and sustainment workforce anywhere in the world. That’s what gave the federal government, the confidence to invest here in South Australia for decades and decades to come. Of course, we know that it is tough times for the Naval Group at the moment. I spoke to John Davis again this morning. The workforce there are obviously shocked with this news. My strong message to them is that we want you to remain here in South Australia and remain in the defence industry. There is so many jobs in this state. Wow has it been more than 10 minutes without me mentioning the word “submarine” on the blog? Let me fix that. Federal finance minister Simon Birmingham is donning the hard hat and high vis today, speaking from the ASC docks in South Australia where our new nuclear power submarines are expected to be built. He has reassured that Australians working on the French submarines who were effectively fired yesterday morning via international press conference when the new nuclear deal was announced, will be able to enter expressions of interest for the new decades-long build. All of those affected by yesterday’s decision in relation to the attack class program will be in a position to register their interest, skills ... with ASC and from that, we will be delivering on the commitment we made as a government to ensure that skilled designers and ship builders, those who have been working so hard on that program, are able to transition into other parts of the defence industry program. This is about providing a jobs guarantee the skilled workforce so that we can maintain and keep those skills deliver all the many other aspects our shipbuilding programs in the years and decades to come. New Zealand will not be reopening its trans-Tasman travel bubble any time soon, as case numbers in Australia rise and numbers in New Zealand continue to drop. Deputy prime minister Grant Robertson confirmed today that while the pause in quarantine-free travel had been due to expire next week, it would now be extended for at least a further eight weeks. Today, New South Wales announced 1284 new cases and 12 deaths, and Victoria announced 510 new cases. New Zealand reported 11 new cases in the country, all based in Auckland. New Zealand’s coronavirus outbreak has topped more than 1000 cases, but daily case numbers have been trending steadily down. All of the new cases today are in Auckland, and two are yet to be epidemiologically linked. Director of public health Dr Caroline McElnay said: We are closing in around this outbreak, and ... we can be cautiously optimistic about the containment of it. Covid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said “protecting New Zealand from any possible further spread of the Delta variant of Covid-19 is our absolute priority”. We have made great progress to contain our current outbreak and are working hard to ease restrictions next week. Reopening quarantine-free travel with Australia at this point could put those gains at risk. Robertson said it was “somewhat unlikely that in November we would make a quick decision [to re-open the bubble], but we want to continue to have the ability to assess it”. There are a total of 1007 cases in the outbreak, more than half of whom have recovered. Four new locations of interest outside of Auckland have been added to the ministry of health Covid-19 website, after a truck driver who tested positive for the virus travelled outside of the city, which is in a level four lockdown – the highest setting. The driver, who is an essential worker and permitted to leave the boundary, was transporting food supplies to supermarkets in Hamilton, Cambridge and Tauranga. But of course the Victorian marathon presser is still going strong. Covid commander Jeroen Weimar is asked why Geelong hasn’t been placed back into lockdown. Geelong has 13 active cases, two more than Ballarat. Weimar: We talked about this yesterday and the day before. The issue with Geelong is we’ve got – we have clearly identified sources of acquisition. There’s a bit of work to do in one case in today’s numbers and we’ll be interested to see where that transmission came from. Primary close contact are defined. They’re isolating. We don’t have wastewater pinging where we don’t expect it to ping in the Geelong area so it’s a risk we can just about manage at this point in time. If we’re seeing multiple cases springing up day after day after day, the chief health officer will review that closely. Wow! The NSW press conference was ended by media advisors after just 36 minutes! That has to be a record, especially on a day that such big news was announced. Victorian press conference: Jeroen Weimar has been asked about protests in Melbourne today against restrictions on Victoria’s construction industry. Construction workers are no longer allowed to travel between Melbourne and the regions for work, and will be required to receive a first dose of a vaccine from next Thursday after ongoing transmission across worksites and tearooms in the sector. Reporter: Some of the construction workers are sitting out and blocking city streets at the moment, protesting the fact that they can’t have lunch or a smoko together. Weimar: Yeah ... I mean I suppose I’d say two things. We’ve seen a number of examples, and I appreciate people think it’s amusing, but when you have people across the industry in the construction industry and they’re in a small cabin or hut enjoying food and drink together, that’s a significant risk of transmission. The CHO has talked about it many times. It’s a self-evident risk we need to manage. The weather is getting better and it doesn’t seem unreasonable to partake in those activities outside, preferably not on tram tracks. I think I’d appeal to the industry and to the employees, so many sectors, so many employees would love to be at work. So many of us would love to be working almost normally and actually, people are bending over backwards to keep the construction industry going and keep important sites going for important reasons. Please don’t. I think we all need to be humble on this. If you can’t sit next to your mates having a sandwich, that doesn’t seem a huge burden to bear. NSW press conference: Reporter: With the situation in Redfern with the social housing towers, do you know how many people testing positive are Indigenous? Deputy chief health officer Dr Marriane Gale: I don’t have exact figures on how many have tested positive and are Indigenous ... we know that our local services work very closely with the Redfern AMS and have done so since the start of the pandemic. There are Aboriginal health workers involved in supporting residents in the towers because clearly, there are a number of Aboriginal families implicated with the situation and those housing blocks. That’s where things are at the moment. Victorian press conference: Victoria has no plans to reduce the interval period between Pfizer doses. Reporter: When Pfizer supply ramps up in the coming weeks, is there enough capacity, enough staff, to cut the gap from six weeks to three weeks? Weimar: Look, at the moment, across the GPs and state clinics, we’re running at 500,000 doses every single week. I expect we’ll beat that this week. GPs are starting to ramp up activity. We’re due to get pharmacists administering Moderna in the coming weeks. We’ll continue to rise our numbers. I’m expecting to hit around 270,000 in the next week or so and we’ll keep pushing numbers up as supply becomes available. 30% of Victorians have not had a first dose and we’re determined to get first-dose appointments done. That’s what gives you the most significant step-up in your protection from the virus. So we’re not intending at this point to reduce that interval period. Supplies are still somewhat constrained and I want to make sure we get as many people through their first doses as fast as we can. Following the relaxation of restrictions in Victoria, Berejiklian has been asked if she would consider allowing those in the 12 western Sydney LGA’s of most concern to travel up to 10km from their home rather than five. Seems the answer is “maybe soon, but not quite yet”. Berejiklian: It is possible that if the health advice reflects that we will. But we are really keen to make sure all of us moved together. If the health experts give us that advice, nothing would give me greater joy... We’re getting there [with vaccination rates]. I want to encourage everybody to say that the second we get the green light to ease off on anything we will. But just stick with us until we can make those announcements. We need to stay the course. As you know, modelling told us we would reach a peak sometime in mid-September. We are kind of around mid-September now, a bit over mid-September, we don’t know whether there worst is behind us in terms of cases. So it is best for us to make sure we stay the course for a little bit longer until we know for sure and then obviously health can re-evaluate all of those settings. NSW press conference: Now you might be asking “if we are living with Covid-19 now, why have hotel quarantine at all?”, well you are in luck because the reporters at the press conference are asking the same thing. Here is Berejiklian’s answer: I think I made the very point several times about a month ago, saying given the number of cases we have in the community versus the number of cases in hotel quarantine that we have to re-examine, as part of the national plan, how we transition from the current system to a better system which reflects what is going on and what living with Delta means. Only one strong measure we have now we didn’t have before, those are very effective vaccines. When people are double vaccinated with the vaccines, which our Australian health authority regards a safe and effective, obviously we can look to that. Today is the start of that process. It’s the start of a process where returning Australians, returning groups of people who have received double doses of a safe vaccine can have alternative arrangements instead of the two weeks in a hotel, and nothing would give us greater joy than having our hotels returned to tourists and having our hotels returned to others, apart from those Australians having to do hotel quarantine and, certainly, no other states have still got New South Wales residents or other residents in the hotel system of their own citizens in their own quarantine systems for their own state. We should all be thinking about how we transition, how we move to the new system. Victorian press conference: Covid commander Jeroen Weimar is turning to anti-lockdown protests that had been planned for this weekend. Public transport in Melbourne will be suspended for six hours on Saturday as part of a large-scale police operation to stop the protests from going ahead. Weimar says there has been “no significant” cancellation of vaccination bookings because of the protests, but no additional transport shuttles will be organised for people who had booked in to receive a vaccine: Victoria Police are leading the operation and the management of those issues, I can confirm we have 2,700 vaccinations booked in at Jeff shed and the Royal Exhibition Building for Saturday. People coming for those vaccinations will be able to cross police checkpoints with evidence of their appointment. So please either online evidence or print it off at home and use that. We are not, of course, taking any more bookings for vaccinations at Jeff shed or the REB for that particular day so only those currently booked in. If you do not intend to attend for that vaccination appointment, that’s fine. There are alternative appointments available on other days. We’d appreciate it if you could go online or give us a call and make those changes now so we don’t have staff standing around waiting for you to come forward. Given the logistical management for Vic Police and transport partners tomorrow anyway, we won’t start arranging additional transport shuffles for people. There are alternative appointments available at those locations on other days or in other 55 clinics across the stay. If you live locally and it’s the nearest centre for you and you can walk there, please carry on and do that. If you’d rather not come in for your appointment, that’s fine. Make an appointment for a Sunday or Monday next week or another day. There are appointments available. Victorian press conference: Jeroen Weimar is breaking down today’s regional cases. There have been nine new cases outside of metropolitan Melbourne: We have three further cases in Ballarat following a strong day of testing yesterday. The three positive cases we have now means we have nine active cases in total in Ballarat across three different households. All the three active cases today are known household primary close contact so that is a somewhat encouraging sign.We have 187 identified primary close contact of those active cases. Two-thirds of them have already returned a negative test result and I expect the remaining of those results to come through in the next day or so. We do, however, have around 30 exposure sites across Ballarat. We have two new cases in Geelong. One of those is an employee at a call centre in Melbourne. So we’re working through some contact tracing there and the source course, we’re still working out where they’ve obtained infection from. Their partner works in Melbourne... We have a case in rural or western Victoria in the East Wimmera. This individual has been isolated very closely. They live in a fairly remote location. We have a pretty good line of inquiry around that possible source of acquisition. We need to land that in the coming day or so. We have two new cases in Mitchell Shire. One of those is a construction worker in Melbourne. The other is a result that came in late last night and we’re investigating that this morning. Finally, we have one further case in the regional results today from the La Trobe Valley. That’s an individual who works at two fast food restaurants in Traralgon. We have 36 primary close contact in the area. Reporters have raised an interesting point - the trial is only open to fully vaccinated people, but what about Australians returning from the US who have received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine which hasn’t been approved by the Australian TGA? Here is what the NSW toursim minister has to say: I want to draw a distinction here. The TGA does accredit different types of vaccines. The TGA is working through the accreditation of international vaccines at the moment. We will work closely with the Commonwealth on that. That is slightly different from the approvals to be used here, the vaccines we are using in Australia. We know there is a diversity of vaccines. We want to be able to work with the Commonwealth to ensure that the TGA can accredit different types of vaccines, so Australians who have used different vaccines can still come home. Reporter: It is only three vaccines the TGA have approved at the moment, Johnson &amp; Johnson is excluded? Ayres: That’s correct. OK, it seems the trial will be of 175 people, not 125 like the minister previously stated. Ayres: [Participants] will deftly be informed before they arrive. It’s random in the sense that we are only using a small group people but we will want to ensure that the cohort represents all the different conditions that we need to test in this trial. We are talking about 125 people. It’s going to be conducted over four weeks, 30 people a week, we want to ensure we get that spread across different types of accommodations, different types of age groups and conditions. We want to be able to learn of the hotel quarantine system needs to transition to when we got home-based quarantine. The prime minister is part of this NSW home quarantine plan as well. Here is a bit from Scott Morrison’s press release on the program today: This is the next step in our plan to safely reopen, and to stay safely open. NSW has carried the lion’s share of quarantining returning Australians and will be leading the way with this trial that could set the standard for the next phases of the way we live with Covid-19. This could mean more families and friends being able to reunite more quickly, more business being able to be done here, and more workers for key industries being able to fill critical jobs. Victoria’s outbreak is still disproportionately affecting young people: 85% of all cases are under the age of 50. A quarter of the total cases are in their 20s. Victorian press conference: Foley says there is still a steady growth of cases in Melbourne’s eastern and south-eastern suburbs, as well as ongoing transmission in Melbourne’s north and west. Ninety-five per cent of today’s cases are in northern and western suburbs, including 276 across Craigieburn, Roxburgh Park and Broadmeadows. Thirty-eight new cases have been detected across Cranbourne North, Pakenham and Dandenong. A new vaccine clinic will open at Dandenong’s Palm Plaza, including a pop-up site at Hallam mosque. Another site will be opened at Eastlands shopping centre which will initially be able to administer 300 doses per day, ramping up to 1,200 in a couple of day’s time. Ayres: It’ll be about [175] people, selected by NSW police and NSW Health and we want to be able to test across different cohorts. Families, singles, older people, younger people, people in different forms of work. This is a trial and about testing different types of accommodation, apartments and homes. We want to ensure we get the spread right. This isn’t about prioritising individuals or people who have been overseas. It’s about ensuring we conduct the trial properly, build the base of evidence so we can remove our hotel quarantine system for the majority of people who are coming into Australia. What I mean by that is those that are double vaccinated so we can ultimately remove them from having to be in our hotel system. NSW tourism minister Stuart Ayres is giving details about this new home quarantine trial now. He has confirmed that the trial will start with around 175 people including Qantas aircrews. Today is an important step in the reopening of NSW to the rest of the world. Our roadmap is really driven by the fantastic vaccination take-up rate by NSW citizens and because of that, today we are able to announce the next step on the reopening strategy. We’re going to, at the end of this month, conduct a trial that changes the way we do quarantine. It gives us a chance to test seven-day quarantine in the home. We will conduct the trial with approximately 175 people. They will be broken across two cohorts. We have been working with Qantas aircrew and staff are a number of months now and will include some of those people in this trial to conduct their quarantine at home. They are doing shorter turnaround times with some of their existing crew in the 14-day quarantine so there are a logical cohort to do this with. We’re also going to work with police and health to select from returning Australians, do go into this home-based quarantine trial. This will build on the evidence collected through the South Australian trial as part of the national plan where we utilise technology, particularly facial recognition and location-based services apps on your phone to allow police and health to continue to check in on a person during their home-based quarantine. NSW press conference: Gale has confirmed there has also been a positive case recorded in the regional town of Young. We also identified a positive case living in Young reported to 8pm last night and overnight, that person’s household contacts have also tested positive. There are a number of exposure sites in Young and, as we speak, NSW Health is providing advice to government around recommendations for the people of young but I’d like to urge anyone living in Young to please monitor for symptoms, look at public health advice and come forward for testing. The Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, and Covid-19 response commander Jeroen Weimar are up now, confirming that, of today’s 510 new local cases, 124 have been so far linked to current outbreaks. There has been one new case detected in hotel quarantine. Sadly, there has been one further death overnight, a woman in her 50s. There are now 4,697 active cases across the state and 208 people in hospital, including 49 in intensive care and 32 requiring ventilation. As of yesterday’s cases in hospital, 87% weren’t vaccinated, 12% were partially vaccinated and two were fully vaccinated. Victoria has now passed the milestone of 70% first vaccine doses, allowing a modest easing of restrictions from 11.59 tonight. Foley: In regards to tests, a very solid day yesterday, some 55,476 tests were processed. I can say that 2,079 of those were in Ballarat. A week ago on the same day, just some 300 tests were processed in Ballarat. So the people of Ballarat have come out in great numbers to get tested. There were 43,993 vaccines delivered at our state-run hundreds yesterday, another daily record for our vaccination clinics. We’ve now administered more than 3 million vaccines through the state-run clinics. That’s a substantial figure. That’s approximately about 50% of the figures overall. Before we hear more about the quarantine program, the deputy chief health officer, Dr Marriane Gale, is giving the details of those deaths overnight. This includes two women in their 20s, one of whom was living in a disability care facility. Among these people are two who were in their 20s, three people in their 50s, one person in the 60s, two people in their 70s, three people in their 80s and one person in their 90s. Of these 12 individuals who sadly passed away, seven were not vaccinated, two people had received one dose, and three were fully vaccinated. I’d like to provide a bit more detail about several of these tragic deaths. Firstly, the woman in her 20s from western Sydney died at the Nepean Hospital. She had received one dose of a Covid vaccine and had underlying health conditions. A woman in her 20s died at Gosford hospital. She was not vaccinated and was a resident of the life without barriers group home in Wyong where she acquired her infection. Three people passed away your residence of aged care facilities in Dubbo. They include a woman in her 80s who died at the Holy Spirit aged care facility. She was fully vaccinated and is a first are linked to an outbreak at this facility. A woman in her 90s was fully vaccinated and a man in his 80s, partially vaccinated, died at St Marys Villa aged care facility in Dubbo. There are now three deaths associated with an outbreak at this facility. Two people from western Sydney, a man in his 50s and a woman in her 80s, died at their homes and their Covid-19 infections were diagnosed after their death. Neither of these individuals was vaccinated. Berejiklian has made a significant announcement today: once the state reaches the 80% vaccination level they will likely begin allowing Australians returning from overseas to quarantine at home rather than in hotels, with a trial of the program starting in several weeks. I can confirm that New South Wales’s government has started work and planning on our 80% plan and what happens at 80% double dose. One of the things that we expect to occur at 80% is to consider our international borders. That Aussies returning home through Sydney airport but also our citizens having the opportunity to go overseas when previously they weren’t able to and I’m pleased today to be joined by Minister Ayres who ordinarily is a minister for major events and tourism and a whole range of other matters but today he will pleasingly be announcing a home quarantine trial that will be done in New South Wales which will start in the next couple of weeks. The planning works are being done and Minister Ayres will talk about that now but it’s really opening the doors what home quarantine will look like for us moving forward. For those returning Australians who have double dose vaccinations, they will be able to consider having a home quarantine setting rather than having to be in a hotel, similar to the hotel behind us now it has had thousands of people come through it in the hotel quarantine system. NSW has also just passed the 50% double vaccination mark. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian is speaking now and has confirmed 1,284 cases have been recorded. Sadly 12 people infected with Covid-19 have also died. Authorities have pleaded with Queenslanders to make the most of a state-wide vaccination blitz this weekend, with 38 community hubs open for walk-in jabs, reports Tracey Ferrier. There was one new local case of Covid-19 reported on Friday but it poses no threat. It is linked to Brisbane’s Sunnybank cluster, and the person had been in home quarantine for their entire infectious period. Health minister Yvette D’Ath says Queenslanders can walk into any of the state’s 38 community vaccination hubs this weekend and get a Pfizer vaccinated without an appointment. Anyone aged 12 and over is eligible. There will even be a pop-up vaccination centre for footy fans. It will open this afternoon ahead of the two NRL matches to be played in Mackay. Almost half of the doses needed to vaccinate all eligible Queenslanders have now been administered. Chief health officer Jeannette Young said today: We are starting to get that big ramp-up in vaccine supply that we’ve been promised for many months now. It’s taken us since the 22nd of February, when we did the first vaccination of a nurse on the Gold Coast, to get half of the doses out the door. The aim is over the next month or two to get the rest out. Queensland Health delivered more than 25,000 vaccines on Thursday with 58.17 per cent of eligible Queenslanders having had one dose of a vaccine, and 39.95 per cent now fully vaccinated. D’Ath said Queensland had been getting less than its Pfizer allocation but she was hopeful that would be delivered by November, or earlier. Notorious Sydney gang rapist Mohammed Skaf will leave prison next month after being granted parole with strict conditions. Skaf, now aged 38, has spent two decades in jail after being convicted for a series of terrifying rapes in Sydney throughout 2000 involving another 14 men, including the ringleader – his brother – Bilal. He first became eligible for release on parole in 2018. The State Parole Authority on Friday said Skaf would be granted parole under strict conditions and 24/7 electronic monitoring. Freeing Skaf at the end of his 23-year sentence in early 2024 without any conditions would have posed an unacceptable risk.

Speaking of 11 am, we are also expecting to hear from the Victorian leaders then, when they step up for their daily press conference. THESE PEOPLE DO KNOW THAT OTHER TIMES EXIST RIGHT? Okay, this has not yet been independently confirmed by Guardian Australia but Nine News is reporting that hotel quarantine will be wound back in NSW. They’ve suggested that more than 100 people, including Qantas employees, will be able to quarantine from home for 7 days rather than the regular 14 in a control facility. We will likely get more details at the NSW press conference in half an hour. We are set to hear news about “quarantine arrangments” today at the NSW press conference. That’s due to start in about 40 minutes. So tradies in Melbourne are not happy at all about Covid-19 new rules which make tea rooms off-limits at construction sites. Naturally, they have set up a tea room in the middle of Sydney Rd. There is definitely a Boston Tea Party joke in here somewhere. Interestingly, the joint statement out of the Ausmin talks also includes a lengthy passage on climate change – and suggests Australia and the US agreed on the need for “ambitious” 2030 emission reduction targets. The statement says the ministers, Marise Payne and Peter Dutton, and the secretaries, Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin, “noted with serious concern” the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They “emphasized the urgency of addressing the climate challenge, and pledged continued efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions”. The statement continues: The United States and Australia will pursue opportunities to take enhanced actions during the 2020s with the aim of achieving net-zero emissions as early as possible. They discussed the need to take action through mitigation, adaptation, and finance during the critical decade of the 2020s to limit temperature rises, and address the impacts of climate change, recognizing that the impacts of climate change at 1.5°C are much lower than at 2°C. They pledged to work together to strengthen the global commitment to climate action ahead of COP26 [the Glasgow summit in November] through ambitious nationally determined contributions with 2030 targets and to continue to strengthen efforts throughout this critical decade to keep a limit of 1.5 degrees temperature rise within reach. The United States and Australia both stress the importance of all G20 countries having communicated ambitious 2030 NDCs [targets] by the COP. The statement says both countries “share an ambition to drive clean solutions, including new and emerging technologies, in support of an effective global response to reducing greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring economic growth and job creation”. Our joint ambition is to make low-emissions technologies globally scalable and commercially viable to rapidly accelerate global emissions reductions, enable clean growth, and make achievement of net zero emissions by 2050 possible. Both countries have also “committed to increasing our climate financing including for climate change adaptation and responding to the needs and priorities of small island developing states that are the most vulnerable to the future impacts of climate change”. The statement also acknowledges the “global security threat posed by climate change”. The US secretaries and Australian ministers “committed to continuing cooperation on disaster response and resilience measures in defense planning, noting the threats to human security across the region, including pandemics, growing water and food scarcity, compounded by population growth, urbanization, and extreme weather events, in which climate change plays a part”. The US Department of Defence pledged to share its Defence Climate Assessment Tool (DCAT) with Australia. (As you can see, no specific new commitments from Australia, but noteworthy language in light of the growing international pressure on Australia to increase its 2030 targets and commit to net zero by 2050.) Australia and the US have given a little more detail on their plans for a bigger US military presence in Australia. Marise Payne and Peter Dutton met with their US counterparts, Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin, in Washington overnight. They spoke to the press hours ago, but the formal joint statement has just been issued. The statement notes that it has been 10 years since the establishment of the United States Force Posture Initiatives in Australia (Julia Gillard’s government and the Obama administration put in place the rotation of US Marines through Darwin). Citing the “strategic challenges of our time” that centre on the Indo-Pacific region, the statement says both sides have now “committed to significantly advance Australia-United States force posture cooperation”. “The Secretaries and Ministers endorsed the following areas of force posture cooperation: Enhanced air cooperation through the rotational deployment of U.S. aircraft of all types in Australia and appropriate aircraft training and exercises. Enhanced maritime cooperation by increasing logistics and sustainment capabilities of U.S. surface and subsurface vessels in Australia. Enhanced land cooperation by conducting more complex and more integrated exercises and greater combined engagement with Allies and Partners in the region. Establish a combined logistics, sustainment, and maintenance enterprise to support high‑end warfighting and combined military operations in the region.” For more on this, see our story from this morning: Ummmmmmmmmmm... Queensland has recorded one new local Covid-19 case, lucky they were a close contact of the Sunnybank cluster who was already in home quaratnine. NO TASMANIA! NO. You do not have a big enough population for an 11am press conference! PICK ANOTHER TIME! FYI: The Tasmanian premier is speaking to the media at 11am. Google must explain what steps it has taken to ensure the company’s platforms and advertising capabilities are not “exploited for misinformation” in the run-up to the next federal election, Labor’s national secretary, Paul Erickson, has demanded. In a letter to Google Australia’s managing director, Mel Silva, seen by Guardian Australia, Erickson raises a number of objections to recent interventions by Clive Palmer and Craig Kelly – activity he says undermines confidence in Australia’s public health response to Covid-19. Erickson cites multiple videos on Kelly’s personal YouTube page “in which Mr Kelly promotes ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine as effective treatments for Covid-19 or claims that Covid-19 vaccines are unsafe”. Guardian Australia understands Google has now flagged some of the videos identified by Erickson, and the contents are under review. You can read the full report below: Heading away from the east coast for a second we are expecting an announcement at 11.30am AWST (1.30pm AEST). We don’t know exactly what it will be yet but given we will be hearing from WA education minister Sue Ellery and vaccine commander Chris Dawson, it seems likely that it will be something to do with getting schoolkids vaccinated. We will bring you all the updates here on the blog. Scott Morrison really has been making the rounds this morning. While talking to Melbourne radio station 3AW he hit back at the suggestion that the new submarine would make Australia a nuclear target. What we’ve done is what Australia should do in its national interest. Australia has to stand up for itself and protect its interests and keep Australians safe. Host Neil Mitchell: Do you accept that what’s happened here has made China a more significant enemy of Australia? Morrison: No. Here is what today’s case numbers look like on the outbreak graph. Today is the second-worst day in the outbreak so far, with yesterday being the highest. The daily press conference times are also starting to file in, with Queensland leaders expected to speak at 10am AEST. The Victorian numbers are in and it’s not good news. They have recorded 510 new local Covid-19 cases and the death of one person. Just 124 of those cases have been linked to known outbreaks. Prime minister Scott Morrison was grilled once again this morning about the blind trust that part paid of Christian Porter’s legal fees. On Thursday Morrison declined to say if Porter had given him advance notice before publicly declaring the payment of unknown size from unknown donors on his register of interests. Morrison told ABC AM he had sought advice from his department because: I always act in these areas precisely. I always act on best possible advice, I always want to ensure ministerial standards are fully understood in these contexts and the right decisions are made. Asked if we could infer Porter will go – as Bridget McKenzie did in early 2020 – Morrison replied: I don’t think you can confer [infer] anything. I think you can take it that I’m following a process which you would expect a prime minister to do, who believes strongly in ministerial standards. Morrison again evaded directly answering whether he knew ahead of the public declaration. He said: He [Porter] only most recently became aware of becoming a beneficiary and that beneficiary payment becomes available to him. So, these are complicated, these are not ordinary arrangements, that’s why we’re seeking to have a full understanding of them. Morrison declined to discuss what he and Porter had talked about on Wednesday, beyond saying he wanted to ensure they had a shared view that ministerial standards are always maintained. Morrison said he was “not going to speculate” on whether Porter paying the money back would be sufficient to keep his job. The defence minister, Peter Dutton, has dismissed “outbursts” from China over Australia’s decision to develop nuclear-powered submarines, as he flagged plans for more US military aircraft to deploy to Australia. Speaking after talks with the Biden administration in Washington, Dutton said Australia was a “proud democracy in our region” and “no amount of propaganda can dismiss the facts”. The Australian government also renewed its request to China to resume high-level talks – an offer the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said “mature actors” would be prepared to take up. Dutton and Payne joined their US counterparts for the annual dialogue known as Ausmin – the first since the Biden administration took office – but it was overshadowed by the fallout from the announcement of a new security pact among Australia, the US and the UK.’ You can read the full report below: If you are confused by all this talk of nuclear submarines let me suggest Guardian Australia’s TikTok. Give me 110 seconds and some houseplants and I’ll get you up to speed in no time. Australia’s defence minister has hit back at China’s “embarrassing” and “immature” criticism of a nuclear-powered submarine deal with the US and UK, reports AAP. Peter Dutton, speaking with Sky News from the US, launched a counterattack after a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman labelled the pact extremely irresponsible. Frankly, I think they make the case for us. Their comments are counterproductive and immature, and frankly embarrassing. China foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijan said the decision to build nuclear-powered submarines intensified the arms race and undermined international non-proliferation agreements. The export of highly sensitive nuclear submarine technology to Australia by the US and the UK proves once again that they are using nuclear exports as a tool for geopolitical game and adopting double standards. This is extremely irresponsible. Zhao said he was not aware of an open invitation prime minister Scott Morrison said he had extended to Chinese president Xi Jinping to discuss the arrangement and said Australia, the UK and US should abandon a “Cold War zero-sum mentality” and do more for regional peace. Otherwise, they will only end up shooting themselves in the foot. But Dutton made no apology for the nuclear switch. We are a much safer country now because of this decision, and we will work with the French. We understand their disappointment, but my job is to make sure that we keep our country safe. The City of Melbourne is pushing to be allowed to introduce vaccine passports in a bid to reopen the arts, entertainment and hospitality venues that have been hit hardest by successive lockdowns. Councillors will vote next week on the introduction of a “heath pass system” that would allow fully vaccinated people to enter participating restaurants, pubs and other venues. All staff in participating venues would also have to be fully vaccinated. Melbourne lord mayor Sally Capp said: Nowhere in Australia has been hit harder by devastating lockdowns than Melbourne, and our businesses should be the first in line to reopen safely. They’re prepared to do whatever it takes. Capp said operating an opt-in pilot scheme in the City of Melbourne could help refine the system before it’s rolled out statewide. Councillor Roshena Campbell said the proposed scheme was “a temporary measure that will get our businesses back on their feet sooner while we continue to work towards vaccination targets”. In Islam, it is essential that the dead are buried as soon as possible. The body is washed, prayed over, taken to the cemetery and buried, with some small prayer or invocation said by the grave. It is usually a quick process, sometimes drawn out by lingering family, but one that can be shortened in times of difficulty, such as in a pandemic. The family physically bury the body, read the invocations and line up to share condolences. But with a large percentage of the Sydney Muslim community living in the 12 local government areas of concern, and under the toughest restrictions, the community has had to adapt. You can read the full report below: Morrison has been asked how he felt about that awkward moment where US president Joe Biden seemingly forgot his name, opting instead for “that fella from down under” and “pal”. But the prime minister is keen for us to know that “pal” has been a long time nickname from Biden ... apparently. Host: We know your nickname has been ScoMo for quite a while, how do you feel about being called “that fella from down under”? That fella from down under: It was quite funny. We always speak privately, he refers to me as his pal. I am looking forward to seeing him next week and will catch up in Washington and that will be another important opportunity. Morrison: We are very aware of China’s military capabilities and the military investment taking place around the world in that part of the world. We are interested in ensuring international waters are international waters and international skies are always international skies and the rule of law applies equally. There are no no-go zones where international law applies. That is important for trade, things like undersea cables, floodplains and where they can fly. That is the order that we need to preserve. That is what peace and stability provides for and that is what we are seeking to achieve. Now the prime minister himself has been out and about this morning spruiking the new submarine deal. Given how clearly this new UK, US and Australian military alliance is intended to curb Chinese power in the Indo-Pacific, Sunrise has asked Scott Morrison if he is worried about repercussions from the emerging superpower. We are just taking the necessary actions we need to take to keep Australians safe and have a peaceful and stable region in which we live. The world is changing significantly in our part of the world. We have deep friends and partners in the United States and the United Kingdom. The conversations I’ve had with regional leaders have been very positive [and consider it] a stabilising and a peaceful initiative that is very much in Australia’s interest and very necessary for Australia to undertake. This is interesting. The finance minister, Simon Birmingham, says the nuclear submarines that Australia announced plans to build yesterday will cost more than our previous plan for diesel-power subs, which already had an eye-watering price tag of $90bn! Plus, it looks like we are set to purchase only eight of the nuclear subs, rather than the original 12. Safe to say these aren’t coming cheap! Birmingham spoke to ABC radio a short time ago: Through much of our history, we have been a long way away from the centres of strategic competition. Now that centre of strategic competition is perhaps most profound in our own region across the Indo-Pacific. Finalisation of those costs is something that will be assessed through the 12-18 month process we’re now embarking on with the UK and US. The prime minister’s acknowledged that it will likely cost more than we had assessed for the conventionally powered submarines. Good morning everyone and well done, we made it to Friday! It’s Matilda Boseley here and first up let’s talk about picnics! Yes, Melburnians are abuzz with weekend plans after the premier announced “modest” restriction changes from Saturday, including small outdoor gatherings, to mark Victoria reaching its 70% first dose vaccination target. Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated adults will be able to meet up with one other person from a different household for a walk or picnic, while that figure grows to five from two households, plus dependents, for fully vaccinated adults. There is one small complication though – an exemption to the current ban on removing masks to drink alcohol outside of the home has not been granted, effectively making it illegal to have a tipple during picnics unless done under the mask, through a straw. Other rule changes from 11.59pm on Friday include a doubling of the amount of time allowed outdoors to four hours, the expansion of the travel limit from 5km to 10km, and the reopening of outdoor gym equipment and skate parks. Now, zooming out, we are also potentially awaiting some movement with the returned traveller quarantine system, with the prime minister and state and territory ministers meeting today for national cabinet. They will be discussing the possibility of at home quarantine for people arriving in Australia from abroad. Queensland and South Australia are already testing mobile applications for home quarantine and Scott Morrison wants to know when states and territories will be ready to take more international arrivals. With that, why don’t we jump into the day? There is plenty to get through."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/25/communities-offered-1m-a-year-to-host-nuclear-waste-dump","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T11:57:25Z","webTitle":"Communities offered £1m a year to host nuclear waste dump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/25/communities-offered-1m-a-year-to-host-nuclear-waste-dump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/25/communities-offered-1m-a-year-to-host-nuclear-waste-dump","fields":{"headline":"Communities offered £1m a year to host nuclear waste dump","bodyText":"Local communities around England, Wales and Northern Ireland will be offered £1m a year to volunteer to host an underground nuclear waste disposal facility for thousands of years, as part of a rebooted government programme. The financial incentive is one way the government hopes to encourage communities to host the £12bn facility, after previous efforts failed in 2013 when Cumbria county council rejected the project. Under new plans published on Thursday, a test of public support will be required for the scheme to go ahead, which could include a local referendum. The only areas to explore the idea last time round were Copeland and Allerdale borough councils in Cumbria, and Shepway District Council in Kent. This time, interested communities that explore hosting the facility will also receive £1m a year, which officials say could be spent on developing skills locally or apprenticeships. The payments, which could rise to £2.5m annually as a community considers whether to proceed, are expected to last for around five years. The geological disposal facility (GDF) is seen by experts as the best long-term solution to storing the estimated 750,000 cubic metres of waste generated by half a century of nuclear power and defence, which would fill three quarters of Wembley Stadium. It also includes the radioactive material created by potentially five new plants that the government expects to be built, including Hinkley Point C, which EDF Energy is constructing in Somerset. Business, unions and local authority groups welcomed the renewed bid to site a GDF. The Institute of Directors said storing waste deep underground would be cheaper than storing it above ground, as it is at present at around 30 sites. “Running costs for a geological disposal facility storing the waste 1,000 metres below the surface would be significantly lower,” the business group said. Richard Harrington, energy minister, said: “We owe it to future generations to take action now to find a suitable permanent site for the safe disposal of our radioactive waste. And it is right that local communities have a say.” But Greenpeace criticised the payments, calling them bribes, and said new nuclear power plants should not go ahead without a long-term solution in place for their waste. Doug Parr, the group’s chief scientist, said: “Having failed to find a council willing to have nuclear waste stored under their land, ministers are resorting to the tactics from the fracking playbook - bribing communities and bypassing local authorities.” Cumbria county council also immediately appeared to rule out the area, saying its geology was not suitable. “Ultimately the argument will be around safety and my personal view remains that on geological and hydrological grounds, West Cumbria would not be a suitable location for a GDF,” said council leader Stewart Young. Nuclear waste is currently stored at about 30 sites, but predominantly at ground level at Sellafield in Cumbria. The GDF project is expected to cost £12bn, spread over a century."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/feb/21/weatherwatch-floating-windfarms-prove-their-worth","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T21:30:17Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: floating windfarms prove their worth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/21/weatherwatch-floating-windfarms-prove-their-worth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/feb/21/weatherwatch-floating-windfarms-prove-their-worth","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: floating windfarms prove their worth","bodyText":"Floating windfarms are likely to be the next large-scale development in renewable energy. The first Hywind Scotland, developed by the Norwegian state oil giant, Statoil, has proved a greater success than its designers hoped. The five giant six-megawatt turbines, 25 miles east of Peterhead, produced more power than expected in the first three months and withstood hurricane-force winds and giant waves. The potential for this technology is hard to overstate. Few countries have shallow continental shelves like the UK to build offshore windfarms on the sea bed, but many have windy sites close to shore where floating windfarms could be anchored to provide power for coastal cities. It seems odd, then, that just as British firms are seeking to diversify from the struggling North Sea oil industry, the UK government is refusing to extend subsidies to the floating windfarm sector that has so much job creation and export potential. But then this is a government that has already tried to change the tide of history by deliberately obstructing the building of onshore windfarms just when they became the cheapest form of electricity production – while pouring billions into expensive nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/aug/18/brexit-looming-energy-sector-builds-new-links-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-18T15:00:53Z","webTitle":"With Brexit looming, energy sector builds new links to Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/18/brexit-looming-energy-sector-builds-new-links-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/aug/18/brexit-looming-energy-sector-builds-new-links-europe","fields":{"headline":"With Brexit looming, energy sector builds new links to Europe","bodyText":"While Westminster attempts to deliver Brexit within months, the UK’s energy system is set to become dramatically more dependent on the EU just as Britain leaves. Today, four cables – known as interconnectors – between the UK and Ireland, France and the Netherlands have a capacity of 4GW, providing around 6% of Britain’s power supplies. However, with 11 new connections linking the UK and other European countries either under construction or mooted by developers, imports could provide more than a fifth of the country’s electricity needs by 2025, the government expects. As the UK’s Brexit white paper said in understated fashion: “There has been a trend towards greater interconnectivity that has brought mutual benefits to trading partners.” Leading the charge is National Grid, which is behind three of the 11 new proposed cables. Jon Butterworth, who heads the group’s interconnectors business, said: “From our perspective, and from the perspective of the general public, there’s not a lot of downsides to interconnectors.” The company argues the links are good for consumers because lower wholesale prices on the continent will translate to cheaper energy bills in the UK. Households will save £9.01 a year once the 13.9GW of new capacity has come online, it calculates. That may not be much off the £1,138 average annual bill, but it would almost offset the cost of Hinkley Point C, the nuclear power station that will add at least £10 to bills. National Grid says interconnectors are vital to make electricity networks more flexible, a priority as more wind and solar power comes online. Butterworth said: “I don’t think you can do it [renewables] without them. As you get more and more intermittent renewable energy, to use it at the right time and get it into the right place, interconnection is vital.” Interconnectors have obvious appeal as a source of growth for the company, which is mulling job cuts in response to regulator Ofgem proposing tougher price controls on its core business, the UK’s national electricity network. Brexit poses one obvious risk, with the prospect of trading energy across borders becoming harder. The Brexit white paper stressed the need for efficient trade across interconnectors. But National Grid and its European counterparts, who develop the cables through joint ventures, believe the fundamentals remain unchanged. “When you talk to very senior civil servants [in Brussels], they say we still believe interconnectors are great things for Europe,” said Butterworth. He rejected criticism that the cables threatened energy security and would not be subject to the UK’s carbon tax, charges usually levelled at interconnectors by firms that wanted to build big gas power stations in Britain. “Some of the generators express their views,” said Butterworth. “[But] why would a generator in France be less reliable than a generator in the middle of England?” Industry experts broadly agree that greater interconnection is a good thing in a world with more renewables, but there is no consensus on how much. “The question is: what is the optimal level of interconnection? There is a hole in thinking,” said Peter Atherton, analyst at Cornwall Insight. He believes the links have played an important role in the UK’s energy system. Cheaper power from Europe sounds like good news for households hit by tariff rises blamed on rising wholesale costs. But if wholesale prices went too low it could hurt the economics of UK-based power stations. “A low wholesale price is not necessarily a good thing,” said Atherton. “We don’t accept dumping of other things.” National Grid’s dual role as builder of interconnectors and manager of balancing electricity supplies has also raised questions about its vested interests. “I wouldn’t say there is conflict of interest, but there is potential,” said Atherton. Other companies are building cables through the Channel tunnel, and planning to connect to electricity supplies as far away as Germany. National Grid’s link to Belgium is its first to come online, in early 2019. It will be followed by a second connection to France in 2020, and then the world’s longest subsea interconnector to Norway. The company is not ruling out more radical ideas, including interconnectors for a Dutch-backed island in the North Sea surrounded by windfarms. Butterworth said: “It’s just something we need to take a good, hard look at. It’s not crazy. You’ve got to sometimes push the boundary.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2019/aug/09/transport-strife-across-england-and-wales-after-power-cuts-disrupt-rail-and-road-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-09T21:39:28Z","webTitle":"Transport strife across England and Wales after widespread power cuts - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/aug/09/transport-strife-across-england-and-wales-after-power-cuts-disrupt-rail-and-road-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2019/aug/09/transport-strife-across-england-and-wales-after-power-cuts-disrupt-rail-and-road-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"Transport strife across England and Wales after widespread power cuts - as it happened","bodyText":"We’re going to close down this live blog now. Here’s a summary of the evening’s events: A major power cut left nearly a million homes without electricity and caused serious disruption on the UK’s rail network. The problems affected vast swathes of England and Wales on Friday afternoon and into the evening. The National Grid said the outage was the result of losing two generators. It called the event “unexpected and unusual” but said its contingency plans included “disconnecting an isolated portion of electricity demand”. Several of the UK’s largest train stations were shut down because of the loss of power. That forced the suspension of many services for the whole evening. If you’d like to read more, our full story is here: It seems some of the problems on the east coast line may be easing very slightly: A train has left King’s Cross station headed for Peterborough. It was the first to leave since all services were halted earlier today. The train departed platform one at around 9.30pm despite no signage alerting passengers to the departure. Some were able to force their way through closed barriers to get onto the train. A staff member told other people waiting more trains might leave for Peterborough tonight but said she had “no idea” if services would run to other destinations. The National Grid has offered a little more detail on what, exactly, went wrong today. A spokesperson has said: This evening, we had an unexpected and unusual event, the loss of two generators that connect to the GB transmission system, which led to a fall in the frequency of the electricity system. Even though these events are outside of our control, we have plans in place to respond and the system operated as planned by disconnecting an isolated portion of electricity demand. We appreciate the inconvenience caused but this action allows the system to protect itself and limit the fall in frequency, allowing for power to be quickly restored. By 6.30pm, all demand was restored by the distribution network operators. The system is operating normally. There will be no more Thameslink or Great Northern services running north of London for the rest of the day, the operator says. The Govia Thameslink chief executive, Patrick Verwer, says: I understand this has been a very difficult evening for our customers and our staff. We continue to re-energise trains stopped in platforms but this will take considerable time which is why, despite our best endeavours, we are not able to run services north of London on the Thameslink and Great Northern routes for the rest of the day. Our priority is to look after our customers. We have put on as many buses as we can source, arranged for our tickets to be accepted by other transport providers and organised taxis wherever possible. Details are available on our website and nationalrail.co.uk. Passengers with tickets will be able to use these for travel tomorrow and Sunday. Prof Keith Bell, expert in electronic and electrical engineering at the University of Strathclyde has echoed Martin’s comments (see 8.13pm), saying the power cut was similar to an outage 11 years ago. It seems to have been a very similar event to one in Britain in May 2008. However, this time we were kind of unlucky in that it was a deeper drop in frequency so more demand was tripped, and it happened during rush hour. It’s fair to say that from a transmission system point of view, things have now been returned to normal, but the relays still tripped on the distribution networks. One likes to think that, with the green light from National Grid that things are OK at the transmission level, they can restore supplies pretty quickly. But how good have they been at managing the flow of information to ordinary people and, in particular, managers of facilities such as railway power supplies? In the interests of transparency, Prof Bell declares his interests: “I hold the Scottish Power Chair in Smart Grids at the University of Strathclyde. (Scottish Power sponsors the Chair, not me. I speak as an independent academic. I have had various research projects over the years with the electricity companies, but only on the condition that results are published and, from my point of view, with the aim helping to improve engineering practice. I have also done work with government and Ofgem).” CNN’s Eliza Mackintosh has tweeted evidence of the frustration some rail passengers are feeling this evening: National Rail is stressing the scale of the problems at St Pancras: Alastair Martin, the chief strategy officer of the energy solutions specialist Flexitricty, said the UK energy system “hasn’t seen anything like this for at least a decade”. A similar energy system failure took place in May 2008 after the Sizewell B nuclear power plant tripped offline, two minutes before an outage at the Longannet coal-fired power plant. “It was a coincidence, but it was dramatic,” he said. The twin outages also caused frequency to drop below the critical 50 Hz limit, which caused an automatic shutdown of parts of the energy grid, he added. What is interesting this time around is that the energy system recovered far quicker than it did then. National Grid is more prepared, and it has more tools to help restore the frequency of the grid when it is struggling with inertia. Footage has emerged of passengers being evacuated from a train in north London, which the operator says was travelling from Moorgate station. Govia Thameslink Railway’s chief executive, Patrick Verwer, has said: The wide-scale failure of the power grid that has brought our Thameslink and many of our Great Northern trains to a stand north of London continues to cause major disruption. Despite our very best endeavours, we will not be able to run trains between London and Bedford, Cambridge and Peterborough and therefore advise customers they will not be able to travel on these routes for the rest of the day. Where possible, we are advising people to use alternative routes and our tickets are being accepted by other transport providers. The trains have been affected to the point where they require a technician to restart them and we are evacuating some of the trains that are stranded outside platforms. Our advice to customers is to stay on board trains for their own safety. At St Pancras station, the Guardian’s correspondents have found a chaotic scene. Henry McDonald reports that commuters are taking matters into their own hands and starting to organise taxis to different destinations. They’re clubbing together in large numbers to go to Watford, St Albans and Boreham Wood, he reports. One of them is the Guardian’s own Nicola Davis, who reports having had to share a ride northwards to Hertfordshire after hours of waiting for information, having only made it as far as Finsbury Park station. At Kings Cross, Zoe Hebblethwaite, a 23-year-old legal secretary from Pontefract in West Yorkshire, has described the situation as “absolute mayhem”. The 23-year-old has been stuck for hours, having arrived at the station at 5.30pm before being told to leave until further notice. They have closed doors of the station – no power whatsoever. Outside Kings Cross station is absolute mayhem nobody knows anything nobody can find an assistant to speak to at this point. No commuters are allowed in... There is so much confusion. Thomas Edward, a consultant at the energy specialist Cornwall Insight, says Little Barford tripped offline at 4.50pm and may have triggered the automatic shutdown of the windfarm. The key thing about today is that it is very windy. The strength of the system is determined by how many power plants you have running all at once. If there are a lot of power plants running and one has an outage, then the others can pick up the slack. Windfarms don’t have the same level of stability as a power plant. So, on a windy day when we rely more on wind power thermal power plants, it is more difficult to manage. We need to know exactly what happened from National Grid and the network operators to understand the full cause of the blackout. We’ve just had an updated statement from National Grid Electricity System Operator: Just before 5pm this afternoon, we saw a loss of supply from two separate power generators causing loss of power in selected UK areas. The issue is now resolved and the system has returned to normal. Our initial analysis indicates that system defences worked as expected during what was an unusual event. Anyone continuing to experience a local issue should contact their local Distribution Network Operator for assistance. Here’s a summary of the rail network problems being reported by National Rail at the moment: All Great Northern and Thameslink routes are affected, with services subject to cancellations and delays until the end of the day. “There are currently no trains running in either direction between: London and Bedford [and] London and Cambridge/Peterborough,” according to National Rail. East Midlands Trains services in and out of London St Pancras International may be cancelled or delayed by up to two hours. National Rail say the former is “advising customers not to travel to or from London St Pancras International this evening. Tickets for today will be valid tomorrow”. All routes into and out of London King’s Cross, including Grand Central, Hull Trains and LNER services, are severely affected and the station itself is closed. “LNER and Hull Trains are advising customers not to travel from London King’s Cross until further notice. Customers holding tickets for today, Friday 9th August, may use their tickets tomorrow Saturday 10th August,” National Rail say. There are also likely to be problems between Birmingham New Street and Coventry, though these are not related to the power cuts. Mitchell Collier, from Rayleigh, Essex, was planning on travelling to Newcastle with friends. He said: “It’s awful. We’re going on a boys’ weekend to Newcastle to watch the football and obviously we can’t get there at the moment. There’s been no updates from the train company, they’ve just kind of shut the doors on us, just kicked us out.” He added that the only information he and his friends were getting was from Twitter and the Trainline app. He said: “We’ll potentially have to cancel the whole trip. That’s the money gone, though, hotel and all that.” Michael Ajibowu was trying to get home to Biggleswade in Bedfordshire. He said: “I’ve just come from Finsbury Park. I was stuck there for about an hour. I thought I’d come down to central London for better access. When I got here the doors were locked.” • This entry was amended on 13 August 2019 because Biggleswade is in Bedfordshire, not Hertfordshire as an earlier version said. Philippa Higgins was travelling to York when the power cut hit King’s Cross. She was evacuated along with hundreds of passengers. She said: “There was overcrowding so they kicked us out. The guy who shut the door got yelled at but it’s not his fault. There has been no information and I’m just scrolling Twitter.” While it’s hard to be precise about how many people have been affected, especially once commuters are taken into account, PA Media estimates that there are close to a million customers facing blackouts, with 500,000 people affected in the Midlands, the south-west and Wales, and another 300,000 in London and the south-east. A spokeswoman for Northern Powergrid, which serves Yorkshire and the north-east, said 110,000 of its customers lost power, while Electricity North West said at least 26,000 people were without power in the north-west of England. Newcastle airport was also plunged into darkness by the power cut. Scott McKenzie was travelling through Newcastle airport when the power cut out for around 15 minutes, in what he was told by officials was “due to a wider problem in the region”. “It was a bit worrying to start – more so because various alarms were going off and staff clearly didn’t quite know what was going on either,” the 31-year-old from Cardiff told PA Media. “Some of the spaces in the airport have little daylight – we were literally plunged into darkness and people were using their phones as torches to see and get around.” My colleague Fran Lawther is at King’s Cross station in London, where she took this picture of passengers streaming out having been asked to leave. LNER tweeted that people should not attempt to travel to or from the station. Stockport was one of a number of areas to lose power earlier this afternoon, although it has now been restored. In Cheshire police said they were aware of a power outage in the Ellesmere Port area, including in Great Sutton and Little Sutton. Engineers are thought to be working remotely to restore the power. Meanwhile, in Bradford several sets of traffic lights stopped working. One Twitter user said that it was “like GTA out here” with “every car and pedestrian for themselves!” A spokesperson for Electricity NorthWest said: “We have experienced multiple power cuts across the region, this was due to a fault with National Grid. Power should now be restored, however if you continue to experience issues with your supply or need any support please contact us on 105.” The National Grid blamed issues with two power generators causing a loss of power in different areas across the country. Hundreds of thousands of customers have been affected. Many social media users posted images of difficulties they had been facing as they travelled. One Twitter user posted this video of people climbing the steps in silence at Clapham Junction: A large-scale power cut left swathes of the UK without electricity and caused major disruption to transport networks. While the National Grid said that the issue had been resolved by early Friday evening, knock-on effects for commuters appeared set to continue, with significant rail cancellations and passengers being advised to stay at home.

Neo-nazism is on the rise. The gap between rich and poor grows ever larger. Protections for women, people of colour, LGBTQ people and immigrants are under attack. Meanwhile, the planet is simultaneously freezing and burning. Yet George Lakey couldn’t be more optimistic. The civil rights legend bounces around his kitchen in suburban Philadelphia as the icy winds whistle outside. “It’s a huge opportunity. Huge,” he grins, waving his long arms inside his cosy cardigan. “I am grateful that, at age 81, I am around and vigorous enough to be able to participate in the political process because this is, in my judgment, the biggest opportunity for major change, in my country, in my lifetime. A bigger opportunity than the 60s and 70s.” Lakey should know. An activist from the age of 12, the sociologist and writer has been manning the barricades for close to 70 years. For an unfailingly polite Quaker, he has quite a rap sheet. He was first arrested in 1963 at a civil-rights protest in Chester, Pennsylvania, and was most recently arrested in 2018 at a rally demanding more green energy. There have been “a lot” of arrests in between. He helped sail a ship to Vietnam filled with supplies for peace activists during the Vietnam war, led workshops sponsored by the African National Congress to keep the peace in South Africa’s first multi-racial election in 1994, acted as an unarmed bodyguard for human rights defenders in Sri Lanka and has campaigned for same-sex marriage and LGBTQ rights. To help a new generation of activists, Lakey has just published How We Win: A Guide to Nonviolent Direct Action Campaigning. It’s a step-by-step guide to the methods and campaigns that have led to progressive change, and an update to A Manual for Direct Action, a handbook for activists he published in 1965. Activist friends had told him they need a guide to help the teens in Florida demanding gun control, Black Lives Matter protesters, trans rights activists and the rainbow coalition of insurgencies that have sprung up in reaction to Donald Trump and the rise of the new right. He said he didn’t want to do it, then completed it in five months. Now he is off on a 20-state tour to promote it, as he did for his 2016 book, Viking Economics, which put forward the Nordic countries as a model for a better world. Not since the 1960s has there been a better chance for real progressive change, says Lakey, and there are some strong parallels. “The 60s and 70s were also highly polarised,” he says. “It saw a rebirth of the American Nazi party; the Ku Klux Klan was riding high. National Rifle Association memberships statistics rose enormously. It was a very big time for the right and for the extreme left. “Polarisation, instead of making a society stuck, seems to heat up society and makes it more volatile. And so that means a lot of ugliness comes to the surface, a lot of violence, a lot of nastiness. And at the same time, the sheer volatility enables us to make major changes that otherwise cannot be made.” Lakey hopes that it will be possible to roll back a decades-long power grab by the economic elites that began under Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and other rightwing politicians. The crushing of the unions and the rise and rise of big money put progressives on the defensive, he says. That was a big mistake: instead of pushing for more, they hunkered down to protect what they had. And they lost. “It’s counter to folk wisdom, which says the best defence is offence. It’s counter to what any general would tell you. It’s counter to what Gandhi would say. He was constantly talking to his people about why they must stay on the offensive.” Part of the problem, Lakey believes, is that in the US in particular many of these issues, from women’s rights to labour and the environment, were being taken up by the Democratic party, which is “clueless strategically” and whose big-picture thinking has also come to be dominated by the economic elite. One notable cause that wasn’t picked up by mainstream politics until recently was LGBTQ rights. Even Barack Obama was against same-sex marriage before 2012. “The Democrats didn’t want to touch us with a 10ft pole,” Lakey says. Politicians betrayed their friends and their own convictions “because it was toxic politically to associate themselves with the gay cause”. But LGBTQ people, Lacey believes, benefited from their independence, which allowed them to campaign outside the system. That campaign, outlined in detail in his book, and the fight against nuclear power offer two examples of how progressives can win. Realisable goals, nonviolent protests, targeted campaigns, remaining true to your values – history has lessons to teach us, he says. His biggest fear is that we may not want to listen. “We have a profound dislike of learning from our own history,” he says. There is plenty to learn from Lakey’s personal history. Born in 1937 into a slate mining family in Bangor, Pennsylvania, he was briefly marked out as a potential child preacher. That was a big deal, “equivalent to being a piano prodigy or something”, he says. And his working-class community were excited about the celebrity his calling might bring to their church. At the age of 12 he was asked to give his first sermon. He prayed and prayed for a subject. “The message I got was to preach about it being God’s will that there be racial equality,” he says, smiling broadly. “In total innocence, I preached that, hoping that people would be delighted and proud of me, and say: ‘Oh, this boy has the makings of a preacher.’” The all-white congregation disagreed. His words were greeted with silent disapproval. It was the end of his preaching career. At university, he decided it was time to find a new church and joined the Quakers. But the pacifism proved problematic. “My family was very pro-military,” he says. “I didn’t want to be a pacifist. Especially after I realised my gayness. One thing was enough.” A year later, having read everything that he could find about pacifism, for and against, Lakey was a pacifist, too. “I just was so driven by not only a heart that said killing another person is just plain, fundamentally wrong, but also the pragmatic arguments that came about from the extraordinary successes that I found in history when people boldly tried nonviolence and it worked,” he says. And then there was Lakey’s sexuality. At university he had met, fallen in love with and married a Norwegian foreign student. “I already knew that I was strongly attracted to men, but I was strongly attracted to her. And so I married her telling her that, telling her about my attraction to men. I was in the closet. Nearly everyone was in those days.” By the early 1970s, the couple decided their situation was untenable. “We were being put on a pedestal and I wouldn’t have been there if they knew I was gay. We had adopted cross-racially, these cute black children. And we were living in this rough neighbourhood. So here were these wonderful, urban-pioneer idealist Quakers, you know, with the biracial family and the international family. And we were cute!” The Lakeys decided he had to come out. The reaction was everything they expected. The pedestal was removed and Lakey’s guest-speaker spots dried up. Things have changed “hugely” thanks to activists, he says. But this is no time for complacency. Society may seem more accepting, but “I don’t trust it”, he adds. Which is why he believes now is the time for action. “We’re dealing with thousands of years of oppression. How fast do societies really change their ways?” he says. “Germany looked amazingly progressive in the 20s, in the Weimar period, right? With a very strong gay liberation movement and a lot of intellectual work being done. Berlin was celebrated by Christopher Isherwood. And then, of course, the gay people were sent to concentration camps. “It’s not like I’m predicting [Nazi] Germany, but … I think the movement still has a lot of work to do. I think as long as there are so many gay teenagers killing themselves, we have a lot of work to do.” And, again, Lakey is full of hope that change is possible. “That doesn’t mean that I’m not enormously sad about the ugliness that goes with it. I cry over the morning newspaper in the kitchen. It’s highly distressing to me that we have to be so hard on each other, that we project our pain upon others … And yet to overlook the opportunity is to just experience the pain. And that would be a tremendous defeat on our part.” George Lakey’s How We Win: A Guide to Nonviolent Direct Action Campaigning is published by Melville House • This article was amended on 5 March 2019. An earlier version said George Lakey’s 1963 arrest was in the segregated US south, whereas it was in Pennsylvania. A reference to “peacekeeping workshops” in South Africa was also clarified."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/12/edf-energy-announces-14-bill-increase","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-12T11:38:02Z","webTitle":"EDF Energy announces 1.4% bill increase","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/12/edf-energy-announces-14-bill-increase","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/12/edf-energy-announces-14-bill-increase","fields":{"headline":"EDF Energy announces 1.4% bill increase","bodyText":"EDF Energy has become the second of the big six energy suppliers to raise prices this week, announcing a 1.4% increase for more than a million customers. The French state-owned supplier will raise dual fuel bills for 1.3m customers on standard variable tariffs, increasing the average bill by £16 to £1,158. The increase is relatively modest compared to the above-inflation 5.5% rise that British Gas announced on Tuesday, triggering government criticism. Comparison sites said the move by British Gas had paved the way for other suppliers to put up prices, and urged households to switch. “Clearly the price rise from British Gas earlier this week has opened the floodgates and we’re now officially in price rise season,” said Stephen Murray, at price comparison site MoneySuperMarket. EDF blamed the rise on a significant increase wholesale energy costs, as well as government policies such as clean energy subsidies, which have to be paid through energy bills. It said the rollout of smart meters, a government policy carried out by energy suppliers, had also contributed. Béatrice Bigois, managing director of customers at EDF, said: “We know that price rises are not welcome and we have worked to offset rising energy and policy charges by cutting our own costs.” The firm added that 59% of its customers would not be affected, limiting the rise to 1.3m households, because they are on fixed or protected tariffs. The increase comes ahead of the government’s plans for a price cap on standard variable tariffs, but that is not expected to take effect until the end of the year. While relatively small compared to British Gas in terms of customer numbers, EDF is a big player in UK electricity generation. The government has guaranteed the company twice the current wholesale cost of power for electricity from the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, which EDF hopes to complete by 2025, a timetable experts said this week was in doubt because of problems at a similar French plant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jul/23/uk-electric-car-drivers-charge-peak-times-ofgem-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-23T11:59:05Z","webTitle":"UK electric car drivers face paying more to charge at peak times","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/23/uk-electric-car-drivers-charge-peak-times-ofgem-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jul/23/uk-electric-car-drivers-charge-peak-times-ofgem-electricity","fields":{"headline":"UK electric car drivers face paying more to charge at peak times","bodyText":"British electric car drivers face having to pay more to power their car if they refuse to shift their charging to off-peak times, in a move designed to lessen their burden on the electricity network. There are currently 160,000 plug-in cars on UK roads but rapid growth means their impact on the energy system must be managed carefully, said energy regulator Ofgem. If enough drivers top up their cars when they get home from work it would put extra pressure on power networks, which already face a peak in demand between 4pm and 6pm. Such a scenario would require costly upgrades to local electricity grids, which everyone would ultimately pay for through their energy bills. “If electric vehicle users choose to charge during peak times, under current arrangements they will impose considerable costs, which will be borne by all consumers,” Ofgem said as it published reforms to promote the use of electric cars. Vulnerable energy consumers would likely object to “subsidising more affluent early adopters” of electric cars, the regulator added. Ofgem’s solution is to encourage plug-in car owners to use smart charging, where a vehicle could be plugged in at 5pm but would only start powering up at midnight, when electricity demand is much lower. Incentives to use cheaper charging could include energy tariffs that offered cheaper electricity at certain times, such as when solar and wind power are generating larger amounts of power, or when demand is low. Such an approach requires homes to be fitted with smart meters, which are in 10m households but whose rollout has been slow. Charging an electric car overnight at home will cost around £4 for 100 miles of range, depending on the electricity tariff. A similar distance in a petrol car would cost around £17. However, charging an electric car at public points is more expensive than at home, particularly on rapid chargers. Failure to charge smartly could be financially penalised, Ofgem said. “Consumers should be rewarded for being flexible with their demand but may pay a premium if their behaviour adds to peak demand or local congestion [on power networks],” the regulator added. The regulator admitted it was not yet clear how such a fee would be applied, or how much it would be, as its work was at an early stage. As a last resort, electric cars would have their charging interrupted if their demand on local power networks threatened outages to households. However, this is only expected to occur in extreme cases. Analysis by the regulator found that with smart charging, 60% more electric cars could connect to existing electricity networks before they needed to be reinforced. As part of the reforms, Ofgem is proposing that power grid owners should offer “off-peak” connections to the grid to avoid the cost of reinforcing networks. That could benefit the operator of a fleet of electric vehicles, if they could be flexible over when they powered their cars, as they would pay less in network charges than for a conventional “anytime” connection. Jonathan Brearley, the executive director, systems and networks at Ofgem, said: “Ofgem is working with the government to support the electric vehicle revolution in Britain, which can bring big benefits to consumers. Our reforms will help more users charge their electric vehicles and save them money.” National Grid recently revised upwards its projections for the take-up of electric vehicles and said it expects 11m electric vehicles by 2030, 2m more than it thought only a year ago. By 2040 it expects 36m electric vehicles. The company has also stressed the need for cars to be charged smartly, which it believes could limit the increase in peak electricity demand to 8GW, or about two and a half times the capacity of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. Last week a new law was passed in parliament that will require anyone installing an electric charge point to make it capable of smart charging."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/dec/26/eu-brexit-trump-world-us-president-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-26T12:06:06Z","webTitle":"Outside the EU, Britain faces a bleak future in Trump’s world | Simon Tisdall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/26/eu-brexit-trump-world-us-president-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/26/eu-brexit-trump-world-us-president-europe","fields":{"headline":"Outside the EU, Britain faces a bleak future in Trump’s world","bodyText":"Disagreements over the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU are obscuring the daunting international challenges that await the country once it supposedly shakes off Europe’s shackles. It’s a tough, unforgiving world out there, and 2019 is shaping up to be an even bigger rough-house than usual. By jettisoning a pivotal alliance, Britain no-mates is seriously weakening its capacity to manage these looming threats. The spectre of Donald Trump lies at the heart of ominous turbulence on the global horizon. Nearly halfway through his term, the 45th US president is helping to create a world where old rules don’t apply and long-held assumptions, such as Britain’s claim to a “special relationship” with Washington, are an anachronistic embarrassment. Trump’s is an anarchic realm, dangerous, delusional and chaotic – comparable to a dysfunctional Florida theme park – on which a category five hurricane is bearing down. It is characterised by structural vandalism, and fuelled by self-interest, insults and lies. Trump’s ignorant, confrontational persona informs concerted US efforts to overturn or bypass the rules-based international order – he regularly attacks and undermines the United Nations, the European Union, Nato, the international criminal court, the international court of justice, the World Trade Organisation and efforts to address climate change. It encourages bad behaviour everywhere. To survive on its own in a world full of hazards, Britain is relying on the familiar frameworks, multilateral institutions, laws, regulations, diplomatic conventions and commercial codes that have governed state-to-state relations since 1945. But it is exactly this consensual rulebook that Trump is recklessly tearing up. If there is to be a US trade deal with supplicant Britain, for example, it will be on Trump’s onerous “America first” terms. If the whim takes him, his punitive tariff wars will intensify, regardless of their impact on struggling partners. Britain may cast itself as a 21st-century champion of free trade and international engagement, but it is Trump’s protectionist, isolationist and nationalist tropes that are trending worldwide. In Trump’s fearful world, the night is full of terrors, and that’s especially true of 2019. The president needs a scary distraction from the deep legal and political trouble he is in at home, especially as he desires a second term. This distraction would preferably come from overseas – for in Trump’s world, foreigners are defined not as friends but as potential foes. Deliberately intensifying the US confrontation with Iran is one deflective possibility. Trump has worked hard to provoke Tehran, reneging on the 2015 nuclear deal and imposing new sanctions over British objections. The Israelis and Saudis would be up for a fight. But for Britain, it would be an unpropitious start to post-Brexit global outreach. At the same time, Trump’s hostility to existing military deployments overseas presage problems on other key policy fronts. A prime example is his rash decision to ignore UK advice and abandon the fight against Islamic State in Syria. US troop withdrawals from Afghanistan, where Britain recently increased troop numbers, may follow. James Mattis, the defence secretary, could not stop him, and resigned in protest. After Brexit, belittled Britain will have less say than ever. Russia is a leading beneficiary of Trump’s contempt for western solidarity and shared values – and a big problem for Britain no-mates. Vladimir Putin poisoned at will in Salisbury, subverted the Brexit vote, and regularly violates British sea, air and cyberspace. His covert hooliganism extends from the Barents Sea to the Sea of Azov. Russian “malign activity” in 2019 will underscore the reality that, in or out, Britain’s external defence and security remain intimately linked to Europe’s. Then there are EU allies to consider. Are they now to be forgotten? Angela Merkel, a European standard-bearer reviled by Trump and German xenophobes alike, is on her way out. France’s unpopular president, Emmanuel Macron, is besieged. If the Franco-German centre cannot hold, rightwing populist-nationalists from Italy to Poland will profit. The threats to Europe’s democratic order are real and pressing. This is Britain’s fight, too, as history shows. So forget the Irish backstop for a minute. Forget the price of fish. Who will stop Putin and the onwards march of Europe’s hard-right? Not Trump. He welcomes anything that weakens the EU. If or when such crisis points arrive, even the most intransigent Eurosceptic may finally grasp the inescapability of Britain’s European ties and the true worth of European unity. The post-Brexit challenge posed by China is of a different order: as much moral as economic. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, is running one of the most repressive regimes on Earth, under whose grim auspices Muslims in Xinjiang, Buddhists in Lhasa, “house church” Christians in Beijing, pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, and independent media, academics and writers suffer hugely. Trump does not give a hoot about human rights in China or anywhere else. But the British traditionally do. Does Britain really want to become further entangled with a communist dictatorship whose internal repression is matched by an aggressively expansionist, illiberal world view? As the head of MI6 noted recently, there are also grave security risks especially if, as in Britain, Chinese companies are investing in nuclear power and telecoms infrastructure. So, bottom line: how much would Liam Fox and friends give up to sweeten a deal with Beijing? They should remember, while counting pennies and yuan, that values matter more than VAT. Trump’s second-rank friends are an equally unappealing bunch. Saudi Arabia is a player these days, economically and politically. Yet British gun-running to Riyadh has always been objectionable, ethically speaking. Dodgy deals of that type will be even more insupportable in future, now we know the Saudi crown prince counts assassins among his subordinates. Turkey is another big market – and no friend to Brussels. But does Britain really want to cosy up to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whose idea of a good day at the office is killing Kurds and locking up a newspaper editor or two? Or take emerging Brazil. A lot of jolly juicy opportunities there, as Boris Johnson might say. Except Brazil recently elected a hard-right president who plans to burn down the Amazon for cash. This does not sit well with Britain’s climate change commitments. If push comes to shove, it’s even suggested Britain could revive old Commonwealth ties to sustain its venture into the unknown. But who in the modern Commonwealth needs Britain? India, for example, has moved on since the days of empire. In 2019, its GDP will overtake Britain’s. Any deal with Delhi will be costly. And it may not be long before belittled Britain forfeits its permanent seat on the UN security council, too. Old roles are reversed. The balance of power shifts. In Trump’s world, nobody respects weaklings and has-beens, especially when they used to run the show (or thought they did). Viewed from all those places formerly coloured pink in the atlas, Brexit increasingly looks like payback time. In spurning its European home, self-destructive Britain casts itself unready and unloved into a world of pain. • Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/live/2019/dec/18/brexit-cliff-edge-markets-pound-inflation-food-petrol-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-12-18T16:39:08Z","webTitle":"UK inflation at three-year low; Brexit worries weigh - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/dec/18/brexit-cliff-edge-markets-pound-inflation-food-petrol-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2019/dec/18/brexit-cliff-edge-markets-pound-inflation-food-petrol-business-live","fields":{"headline":"UK inflation at three-year low; Brexit worries weigh - as it happened","bodyText":"Time for a quick summary UK inflation remained at the lowest level in three years in November. The Consumer Prices Index stuck at 1.5%, despite rising prices for a variety of goods including chocolate, concert tickets and package holidays. UK house prices are also subdued, with prices rising by just 0.7% in the year to October. The Yorkshire market was quite buoyant, but London prices fell again. Sterling has had another poor day, as the UK’s insistence of ending its Brexit transition period at the end of December worries traders. The pound has dropped half a cent to $1.3078, wiping out all its gains since the general election. German business confidence has risen, easing recession worries. Wall Street has hit a fresh record high today, as New York ends the year strongly. The Bank of England is to test the UK’s financial sector’s ability to handle the climate crisis. Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler have agreed terms of a £38bn merger That’s all for tonight! Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The UK stock market has closed for the night, with the FTSE 100 up 15 points. With the pound still suffering from Brexit angst, international companies led the risers. Pharmaceutical firm Hikma gained 4%, with global equipment rental firm Ashtead 3% higher. But UK builders had a bad day, with Berkeley and Persimmon down 2% each. From shipping to craning.... and the world’s biggest crane has been in action today, helping to construct the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. Big Carl, which stands 250 metres high, successfully moved a 170 tonne (!) piece of the Hinkley reactor’s “steel containment liner” at 4.30am this morning. Here are some impressive photos, which have quite a sci-fi feel.... The Baltic Dry index is one of those esoteric financial benchmarks that may actually give a handy insight into the real economy. It measures the cost of shipping goods around the world, and thus can gauge how much demand there is for supertankers and smaller ships. So it’s worth noting that the Index has dropped close to a six-month low today, with weaker demand for a range of vessel sizes. It’s the 11th daily drop in a row. Wall Street has opened cautiously, as traders await the historic vote on whether to impeach Donald Trump (liveblog here). Shares are a little higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 39 points or 0.14% to 28,306 - back towards yesterday’s intraday high. The tech-focused Nasdaq has hit a record high, up 17 points or 0.2% at 8,840. A lot of people have been citing December 2020 as the big Brexit deadline. But actually, June could be the real cliff edge date. That the last date for the UK to request an extension, EU insiders insist. The withdrawal agreement stipulates that the transition can be extended by “one or two years”, but that would probably involve the UK committing more money for the EU budget. My colleague Jennifer Rankin reports that Brussels believes Johnson is serious about not seeking such an extension: But.. this cliff-edge wouldn’t be as serious as crashing out of the EU without a withdrawal agreement: Back in the markets, sterling is weakening further as traders keep fretting about Brexit. The pound has lost more than half a cent against the US dollar today, to $1.3060 - or more than four cents below its post-election spike. JP Morgan has warned there’s a 25% risk that the UK and EU fail to agree a trade deal by the end of 2020. This is “uncomfortably high”, it says. But the bank also believes there’s a 50% chance that a deal is reached, and only a 20% possibility of the transition period being extended. David Lidington, who was effectively deputy prime minister under Theresa May, has predicted that a ‘core’ trade deal will be agreed by the end of December 2020. Speaking of the Bank of England... the central bank has outlined new climate emergency stress tests. They will examine whether UK banks and insurance companies are prepared for the impact of climate change. It will consider a range of scenarios, including temperature rises of up to 4 degrees celsius (double the Paris climate agreement). More here: Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University argues that UK interest rates are likely to be cut next year - whether Brexit goes smoothly or not. He writes: Under the current interest rate of 0.75%, the Bank expects inflation to be 1.42% in late 2020. Under one interest rate cut, inflation will be 1.51% by the end of 2020. All this, based on the assumption that the sterling effective rate settles at the 79 level in 2020. Notice that sterling went up to 82 in the aftermath of the election result. Assuming that Brexit-related negotiations run reasonably smoothly in 2020, sterling will rise further therefore pushing inflation further below the Bank’s forecast and the 2% target. In this case, the Bank will surely react by cutting the policy rate. But what if the trade deal negotiations hit hurdles? Even if Brexit negotiations involve a lot of ups and downs, the BoE will most likely be forced to cut the policy rate. In this case, uncertainty will spiral out of control. Indeed, we got a taste of this following Boris Johnson’s move to legislate against extending the end of 2020 deadline which is, of course, a huge gamble. So whatever Brexit scenario one is willing to contemplate, an interest rate cut looks as the most likely outcome.. As a knowledgable and well-read lot, I’m sure you’ll have NO TROUBLE at all tackling our Christmas quiz. It’s just been published, covering some of the biggest business news stories of the year: Inflation is rising particularly briskly in the North of England, according to think tank NIESR. NIESR (the National Institute of Economic and Social Research) has calculated that ‘underlying inflation’ rose by 1% across the UK (this measure excludes ‘extreme price movements’). But while this underlying inflation rose by 1.5% in the North, it only picked up by 0.7% in the South East, and by 0.9% in Scotland. That’s based on 130,088 “locally collected” prices. NIESR economist Janine Boshoff said: “Headline CPI inflation remained unchanged at 1.5 per cent in the year to November 2019. Our analysis of approximately 130,000 goods and services included in the basket, indicates that higher inflation related to food and non-alcoholic beverages and recreation and culture was offset by lower inflation in alcoholic beverages and tobacco, clothing and footwear, and restaurants and hotels. Our measure of underlying inflation, which excludes extreme price movements, increased by 0.1 percentage point to 1.0 per cent in November. Underlying inflation increased in most regions of the UK A quick dig into November’s inflation report shows that the price of some types of food have risen sharply. Chocolate, for example, is 4.3% more expensive than a year ago. Ice-creams and ‘edible ices’ cost a chunky 6.1% more (which is intriguing, as November isn’t really peak season). Yoghurt is up 12.5%, margarine by 15.9%, while pasta and couscous is 17.7% more expensive than November 2018. In the drinks section, cocoa and powdered chocolate was 7.7% more expensive than a year ago, while fruit and vegetable juices were 8.9% pricier. Here’s a sector-by-sector breakdown of the November inflation report: OVERALL CONSUMER PRICES: 1.5% over the last year Food and non-alcoholic beverages: 2.1% Alcoholic beverages and tobacco: 1.9% Clothing and footwear: unchanged Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels: 1.2% Furniture, household equipment and maintenance: 1.2% Health: 2.9% Transport: 0.8% Communication: 3.3% Recreation and culture: 1.5% Education: 2.7% Restaurants and hotels: 2.4% Miscellaneous goods and services: 1.9% Economists agree that Britain’s low inflation means there’s no chance that the Bank of England will raise interest rates soon. The BoE sets rates tomorrow, at its last meeting of 2019, but Jing Teow, economist at PwC, doesn’t expect fireworks: “The below-target level of inflation means that the Bank of England will be under little pressure to raise its policy rates soon. However, a recovery next year that follows a further easing of political and economic uncertainties could spur further economic activity and spending, giving rise to inflationary pressures in the medium term. “ Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, predicts that inflation will stay low next year - potentially allowing the BoE to cut borrowing costs. Inflation is expected to remain well below the Bank of England’s target in 2020, thanks to price caps set on regulated utilities and a stronger pound, giving the Bank of England some room to act if the economy wobbles a little next year. “The Bank may wish to secure a pre-emptive cut in rates, either in February or May, if recent economic weakness proves more persistent. Chancellor Sajid Javid has welcomed today’s inflation figures, saying it will help families handle the cost of Christmas. However, prices are still rising -- so households will suffer if their income hasn’t kept pace with inflation. Wages are still rising faster than inflation in the UK, but the gap has narrowed. Yesterday we learned that total pay growth (including bonuses) slowed to 3.2%, from 3.6%, with basic pay growth dipping from 3.6% to 3.5%. Chocolate prices are a classic example of ‘shrinkflation’, especially at Christmas time. Last week, ITV News showed how some favourite festive confectionary tins, such as Roses and Quality Street, have shrunk by 40% in the last decade. That has allowed them to keep the sticker price low - but obviously consumers are getting less for their money. The Office for National Statistics tries to keep a close eye on this. Earlier this year, it reported that 206 products shrank in size in 2018, while 79 got bigger. So if a chocolate tub gets significantly smaller, but its price doesn’t, that pushes inflation up. UK house price growth has hit its lowest level in seven years, as prices continue to fall in London. Across the country, the average house price increased by 0.7% in the 12 months to October to £233,000. That’s the lowest growth since September 2012. Prices rose strongly in Yorkshire and the Humber (+3.2%) but fell in the capital (-1.6%) and the North East (-1%). On a regional basis, English house prices lagged behind the rest of the UK. England: +0.5% year-on-year Scotland: 1.4% Wales: 3.3% Northern Ireland: 4.0% ONS Head of Inflation Mike Hardie points out that concert tickets, and package holidays, also became pricier last month: “The headline rate of inflation remained steady with prices rising across a variety of goods and services such as chocolate, concert tickets and package holidays, offset by falling hotel costs and cigarette prices rising substantially slower than this time last year. Food prices rose in November, particularly for chocolate, according to today’s inflation report. The Office for National Statistics explains: Prices rose between October and November 2019 by more than between the same two months a year ago, especially for sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery (which rose by 1.8% this year, compared with a rise of 0.1% last year). Within this group, boxes and cartons of chocolates, and chocolate covered ice cream bars drove the upward movement. Recreation and culture costs rose at a faster rate last month, but that was balanced by smaller rises in hotel bills and tobacco prices. Women’s clothes price inflation also slower, the ONS says: Prices rose between October and November 2019 but by less than a year ago, especially for women’s garments (which rose by 1.3% this year, compared with 2.1% last year). Within this group, the largest individual contributions came from women’s formal trousers and strappy tops. Britain’s inflation rate remains at its lowest since November 2016, as this chart shows: Just in: UK inflation stuck at a three-year low of 1.5% last month. That’s a little higher than expected, but still comfortably below the Bank of England’s target of 2%. More to follow.... Big news in the auto sector: Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler have agreed to merge, creating the world’s four-biggest carmaker. My colleague Jasper Jolly has the details: The two parent companies, PSA Group and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, confirmed there will be no plant closures as part of €3.7bn in cost savings from the merger, a key concern for more than 1,000 workers at PSA’s Vauxhall factory in Ellesmere Port. PSA’s boss Carlos Tavares, who previously oversaw PSA’s successful integration and turnaround of the Vauxhall and Opel brands, will stay on as the chief executive of the new group, which will have combined annual sales of about 8.7m vehicles. Newsflash: German business confidence has risen, as Europe’s largest economy continues to swerve a recession. The IFO think tank has reported that Germany’s business leaders are more confident about future prospects, and that current economic conditions have brightened a little this month. IFO estimates that the German economy may grow by 0.2% in the current quarter, as firms enter 2020 with “more confidence’. Here’s the details: Business climate index: UP to 96.3 in December, from 95.1 Current conditions: UP to 98.8, from 98 Business expectations: UP to 93.8 from 92.3 The pound is bobbing nervously this morning, currently below $1.309 at its lowest level since election day. Rupert Harrison of asset manager BlackRock says Boris Johnson needs to tread more carefully, and help lower economic uncertainty rather than dolloping more onto the markets. Back in London, the UK-focused FTSE 250 index has dipped in early trading. The mid-cap index has lost 54 points or 0.25% at 21,636. Consumer stocks and financials are among the fallers. Experienced City watchers often say that profit warnings come in threes. Luxury audio equipment and TVs firm Bang &amp; Olufsen has gone one better (or worse) with its FOURTH profits warning of the year. Shares in Bang &amp; Olufsen have fallen by 20% this morning, after it warned that sales were “considerably lower than expected” last month. It now expects revenue to be 18% lower than a year ago. Demand for Bang &amp; Olufsen’s expensive equipment has faded as consumer behaviour changes -- rather than investing in a top-end hi-fi, younger people are more likely to be consuming music through their phones or smart speakers. The company has tried to move with the times with some new ranges, such as its Beosound 2 with Google Assistant (a snip at, er, £1,650). But profits and cash flow are both weakening. It’s also the season for profit warnings. UK recruiter Staffline has slashed its profit forecasts for the second time in three, after suffering a slump in demand from customers. It told investors: During November, customer demand was down approximately 16% from the prior year which the Board believes reflects high levels of consumer uncertainty across the UK. Alarmingly, Staffline also says it overstated its profits by £4m last year, due to accounting errors. The firm’s share have slumped by a third this morning. Breaking: Denise Coates, who runs gambling site Bet365, has secured another MASSIVE payday. Coates, who was already the world’s highest-paid woman, was paid a staggering £276.6m in the last financial year, up from £220m a year ago. She’s will also have received dividend payments of around £46m, taking her total earnings to a scarcely imaginable £322m. She picked up the payout after growing Bet365’s turnover to over £3bn last year, from £2.85bn, with profits rising to £791m from £660m. More than £64bn of bets were placed by customers. Last year’s pay packet would have formed a tower almost twice as high as the Shard skyscraper in London, if paid in crisp £50 notes. My colleague Rob Davies explained last year how Coates had turned the Stock-based firm into a major player: Bet365 is the personal fiefdom of the Coates family, a business dynasty worth £5.8bn, more than Sir Richard Branson’s empire. The story of how they built their empire from a Portakabin in Stoke-on-Trent is the stuff of industry legend. Coates’s father, Peter, the 80-year-old son of a miner, became a successful local businessman and owned a string of betting shops. But it was Coates, an econometrics graduate who, at around the turn of the millennium, became aware of the jackpot opportunity that lay online. She bought the Bet365.com domain name from eBay for $25,000 and borrowed against the bricks-and-mortar stores to develop sports-betting technology that left slow-moving rivals in the dust. When the likes of Ladbrokes and William Hill were buying the systems they needed from third parties, Bet365 already had them and was deploying them at great speed. Shares in UK-focused companies are coming under fresh pressure this morning. Housebuilders such as Barratt (-2.7%), Persimmon (-1.8%) and Berkeley Group (-1.7%) are among the top fallers. Ocado (-1.4%) and Next (-1%) are also dropping, on fears that Brexit fears will hurt consumer spending. Brexit jitters have pushed the pound down to a two-week low against the euro. Sterling dropped as low as €1.1737 this morning, just a few days after hitting a three-year high over €1.20 FxPro senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich blames Boris Johnson’s “hard line” on trade negotiations with the EU. The markets may have run ahead of the train again, expecting the volatility of the pound to be over. In this case, there are more and more similarities with Trump, whose arrival marked the increased uncertainty for the markets, although it still contributed more to their growth than to their decline for stocks. Today’s UK inflation data (9.30am) may show that households are benefitting from a cap on gas and electricity bills. Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada explains: CPI inflation dropped to 1.5% y/y last month from 1.7% y/y previously. Almost all of that fall in CPI inflation was attributable to a cap on domestic energy prices. The effect will continue to drag on inflation again this month. Our economists expect November CPI inflation to drop to what would be a three-year low of 1.4% y/y. Economist and trade expert Dr Rebecca Harding says Downing Street’s Brexit strategy appears to have been taken straight from the White House: “How should we assess Prime Minister Johnson’s proposed hard deadline for a Brexit deal? This is entirely strategic and straight out of the Trump playbook. Boris said he’d get Brexit done and he will live by that promise. In reality, what we’ll probably see is a small deal so everyone wins, leaving many doors open and allowing things that need a little bit longer to get done at a more leisurely pace. The politics are all for show.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. ‘Tiz the season for a festive hangover. But rather than a champagne-induced headache, City traders are feeling groggy about the prospect of a new Brexit deadline crisis next year. The pound is languishing below its levels before last week’s election this morning, at just $1.311 against the US dollar, after Boris Jonson vowed to outlaw extending EU trade deal talks beyond December 2020. Should a deal not be reached during 2020, Britain would then risk sliding into World Trade Organisation trading terms -- not a palatable prospect, when the WTO itself is in some turmoil. UK investors are facing up to the likelihood of another year dominated by Brexit, says David Madden of CMC Markets. The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 January, and then the transition period will kick in until the end of the year. It would appear that Mr Johnson doesn’t want the transition period to run on and on, so he intends to pass legislation that will prevent that possibility. Even if a no-deal Brexit does happen, it won’t take place for over a year, so equity traders are not overly worried. On the other hand, the pound sold-off aggressively yesterday on the back of the no-deal fears. All of the gains the pound made against the US dollar and the euro since the exit poll on election night have been reversed .Keep in mind the pound was broadly pushing higher in the months ahead of the election. Also coming up November’s inflation figures, due this morning, are expected to show that prices are rising relatively slowly. The consumer prices index is expected to have risen by just 1.4% compared with a year ago, down from 1.5% in October. That would leave CPI well below the official 2% target, helping households as they face Christmas bills. But with wage growth slowing in the last quarter (we learned yesterday), real earnings may be coming under pressure.

The almost 500-mile wide hurricane, which is swirling towards the US east coast, “could be the most dangerous storm in the history of the Carolinas”, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) administrator, Brock Long, warned. The storm is expected to make landfall on Thursday night. Officials have called for the mandatory evacuation of more than 1.4 million coastal residents across the Carolinas and Virginia. Those states plus Maryland and Washington DC have all declared a state of emergency. The president said his administration was “ready” for Hurricane Florence, citing its response to Hurricane Maria a year ago, which decimated Puerto Rico, as an “unsung success”, despite the chorus of criticism at the time, accusing Trump of a slow and paltry response to the devastation that ultimately is estimated to have killed almost 3,000 people and caused $100bn in damage. Trump reiterated the claim on Wednesday morning, insisting his administration’s response to the devastation in Puerto Rico last year was an “under-appreciated great job”. The governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossello, seized on Trump’s use of the word “success” and said in a statement issued later Tuesday: “No relationship between a colony and the federal government can ever be called ‘successful’ because Puerto Ricans lack certain inalienable rights enjoyed by our fellow Americans in the states.” Rossello called Hurricane Maria “the worst natural disaster in our modern history” and said work still remained before they could move on to other stages of recovery. He also said he was still waiting for Trump to respond to a petition to help Puerto Rico complete work on emergency housing restoration programs and debris removal. Long, the Fema administrator, warned that coastal residents could see storm surges up to 12ft – “rapid rise of water that is overwhelming and deadly”. Forecasters said the hurricane is not expected to change course in such a way that it will avoid a direct hit on the east coast late Thursday into Friday, threatening ocean surges and flooding from torrential rain inland. Craig Fugate, a former Fema director, said: “I’m afraid, based on my experience at Fema, that the public is probably not as prepared as everybody would like.” Many parts of the Appalachians have been saturated with rain over recent weeks, adding to concerns for flash flooding and mudslides inland. “This one really scares me,” said the National Hurricane Center director, Ken Graham, who called the storm’s size “staggering”. The storm was around 400 miles south of Bermuda on Tuesday afternoon and is trudging towards the east coast at 16mph. At more than 470 miles across, Florence is 56% wider than the typical Atlantic hurricane. The eye of the storm is forecast to make landfall late on Thursday or early Friday along a coastline already saturated by rising seas, and then the system could meander over land for days. Seven-day rainfall totals are forecast to reach as much as 30in in some places. “You’re going to get heavy rain, catastrophic, life-threatening storm surge, and also the winds,” Graham said. Trump attempted on Tuesday to assure Americans that his government is “absolutely, totally prepared” for the storm, which he described as “tremendously big and tremendously wet”. Ever since the federal government’s inadequate preparation and relief efforts during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, under president George W Bush, storm response has become a scrutinized measure of an administration’s efficiency. Florence could hit the Carolinas harder than any hurricane since Hazel packed 130mph (209kph) winds in 1954 and killed 19 people in North Carolina. Since then, thousands of people have moved to the coast. Ahead of Florence’s arrival, barrier islands were already seeing dangerous rip currents and seawater flowed over a state highway, the harbinger of a storm surge that could wipe out dunes and submerge entire communities. “The water could overtake some of these barrier islands and keep on going. All you have to do is look up at your ceiling, and think about 12ft [of water]. That, folks, is extremely life-threatening,” said Graham. Florence’s projected path includes half a dozen nuclear power plants, pits holding industrial waste, and numerous hog farms storing animal waste in open-air lagoons. Chinese-owned Smithfield Foods announced it will shut down the world’s largest slaughterhouse for pigs, which can kill 35,000 animals a day, in Tar Heel, North Carolina, during the storm. Ryan Moser, a spokesman for the North Carolina-based electricity company Duke Energy, said operators would begin shutting down nuclear plants at least two hours before hurricane-force winds arrive. A warm ocean gives hurricanes their energy, and Florence is moving over an area with water temperatures nearing 85F (30C), hurricane specialist Eric Blake reported. Hurricane-strength winds have been expanding to a range of 40 miles from the eye of the storm.Information gathered on Tuesday by a hurricane-hunting aircraft suggests it will intensify again as it nears the coast, approaching the 157mph threshold for a worst-case category 5 scenario."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2019/mar/11/referendums-who-holds-them-why-and-are-they-always-a-dogs-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2019-03-11T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"Referendums: who holds them, why, and are they always a dog's Brexit?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/mar/11/referendums-who-holds-them-why-and-are-they-always-a-dogs-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2019/mar/11/referendums-who-holds-them-why-and-are-they-always-a-dogs-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Referendums: who holds them, why, and are they always a dog's Brexit?","bodyText":"Are there more referendums going on now than ever before? The short answer is yes. Experts reckon there have been just over 600 referendums in the world since 1973. But they took a while to catch on in democracies. They were actually relatively rare in the immediate postwar period, with around a dozen a decade through the 1960s and 1970s, but took off in the 1990s as a spray of new post-communist states consulted their publics on what kind of countries they would be. According to Matt Qvortrup, professor of political science at Coventry University, the number of referendums roughly tripled in the 1990s and have persisted at that level. “The current decade is on track to become the most referendummed in history,” Qvortrup says, noting that there are still a slate of votes set to be held around the world before the decade closes out. He reckons that historically, referendums have always been more popular in times of political uncertainty, when politicians are not sure what their voters really want and do not want to risk all on an election. That certainly fits the bill today, with political landscapes splintering and traditional mainstream parties in decline almost everywhere. It also fits a more individualistic age: voters used to a plethora of personal choices, from music to shopping, may also now expect to “pick and mix” their politics too, rather than buy a long-term, all-inclusive package from a politician. Referendums have become increasingly popular in more recent times as a tool for independence drives, from Eritrea and Quebec to Catalonia, and Scotland to South Sudan, as national self-determination comes back into vogue and distant, centralised government fails to speak to the needs of provinces that feel marginalised. Where do they occur most often? Switzerland has held some 300 referendums since 1848 (and about the same number of other public consultations), as its system of direct democracy gives citizens a voice in how the country is run by requiring any amendment to the constitution to be put to a referendum. To pass, a proposal must usually win a double majority: of voters, and of the 26 cantons. This means the Swiss generally vote in plebiscites – on federal, cantonal and local issues that can range from major foreign policy decisions to the building of a new school – about four times a year. The average Swiss referendum turnout is 40-45%, although red-button issues like migration draw far more. Italy, effectively united by referendums in the 19th century, ranks second, with about 70 national votes on everything from divorce to abortion, drugs, trade unions and the electoral system. Ireland also frequently resorts to referendums. After obtaining independence from Britain in 1921 Ireland’s fledgling state decided its 1937 constitution could be amended only through referendums. Since then there have been 35 constitutional referendums, on average about one every two and a half years. They range from momentous votes on Europe, divorce, same-sex marriage and abortion to the arcane, such as tweaking rules on cabinet confidentiality and parliamentary inquiries. Turnout varies widely depending on topic. A 1996 vote on tweaking bail restrictions drew just 29% of the electorate. A 2015 vote on children’s rights drew 33.5%. The 1972 poll on whether to join the European Economic Community, in contrast, drew a record 70% turnout. Some 68% of the electorate turned out in 1992 for three votes on abortion. Referendums transformed Ireland from a quasi-Catholic theocracy into a liberal beacon. The most notable example was a vote to repeal a ban on abortion in 2018. Turnout was 64%. Two-thirds of voters voted in favour. About half of all US states add referendums to ballot papers during presidential and midterm elections, covering all manner of social and economic policy, from gay marriage to taxation, the legalisation of marijuana and the death penalty. In Latin America, constitutional referendums are the most popular sort of plebiscite. In Mexico, the new president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has put a succession of policy issues out to referendum at the start of his rule. What about EU referendums? There have been almost 50 separate referendums on the EU in its member nations, either on joining, staying in, approving a treaty or adopting the euro. Fully 70% of these have resulted in a yes vote. And for those in Britain wary of a second referendum, this would not be unprecedented. Ireland twice rejected EU treaties (2001 and 2008), won notable concessions and returned to the polls to approve the treaties the following year. In 1992, Denmark rejected the Maastricht treaty in a vote, only to approve it in a second referendum a year later. What are the main issues that referendums resolve? In short, constitutional matters and independence drives. But referendums have also been arranged on the widest array of issues, from whether to drive on the right (Sweden, 1955) to nuclear power (Sweden, Austria, Lithuania), immigration (Hungary, 2016 among others), external financial aid (Greece 2015), gay marriage, borders, airports, schools, language, female suffrage … Is Britain an avid member of the referendum club? No. The UK has only held three fully nationwide referendums: the 1975 vote on staying in the EU (yes), the 2016 vote on the same issue (no), and a vote in 2011 on electoral reform (no). Additionally, there were a succession of votes on devolution in the late 1970s (when they failed to pass in Scotland and Wales) and the late 1990s (when they passed in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London). What are the pros and cons of referendums? The Brexit controversy has raised the question of the utility of referendums, and yet many votes have resulted in clean, effective decision making. “The obvious pro is that you get a very direct sense of what the public mood is on an issue,” says Charles Pattie, professor of politics at Sheffield University. “When the referendum gives a clear result, as with the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum, it can pretty much settle a decision and can give legitimacy to potentially far-reaching changes. “The problem with referendums, though, is that they boil complex decisions down to simplistic binary either/or choices, and are not always a good way of getting at nuance or at the wider ramifications of a decision.” But do they always have to be binary yes-no affairs? Actually, no. Subtlety can be built in. Some can offer multiple choices, such as Puerto Rico’s vote on statehood in 1998. Some can offer follow-up questions, such as New Zealand’s flag referendum of 2016. Some can build in checks and balances, such as a two-thirds majority being required to pass, or a certain percentage of eligible voters being needed to validate a yes vote (such as the Montenegro independence vote in 2006). And some, like the Irish abortion referendum of 2018, can be preceded by a useful fact-finding Citizen’s Assembly, to assure that the electorate is in possession of quality impartial information when they come to making their decision. Swiss referendums are even more carefully calibrated. So-called mandatory referendums are votes on constitutional amendments or certain laws that have already been approved by the Swiss federal government. They require a double majority and can often embarrass governments, as when the country voted in 1992 to reject membership of the European Economic Area. Optional referendums, which require just a simple majority of voters to pass, allow individual citizens, or a group of at least eight cantons, to contest a new or amended law as long as they can gather at least 50,000 signatures within 100 days. Finally, since 1891 Swiss citizens have also been able to demand constitutional changes by proposing so-called popular initiatives. These must be launched by at least seven voters and be backed by 100,000 people within 18 months, and also require a double majority to pass. A favoured recent tool of the far-right, nationalist and anti-immigration Swiss People’s Party, relatively few pass: about half of all Swiss referendum proposals win a majority, but only 10% of popular initiatives. Alas, the 2016 UK EU referendum deployed none of these subtleties. Any other votes that have resulted in a real dog’s Brexit? Pattie says there have been plenty of votes where referendums have created problems because they oversimplify. He points to a ballot proposition in California (several US states hold mini-referendums during the biennial November elections) in 1978 in which voters approved a move to limit the state’s ability to raise property taxes. A budget crunch ensued, with knock on effects on social spending and even state schools. Switzerland’s 2014 immigration referendum caused similar headaches when the people voted to limit immigration – in direct contravention of Swiss agreements and treaties with the EU. So are they a good idea? Qvortrup says referendums are a good idea if deployed sparingly and on issues that are of major significance. “Referendums are a good idea if used as a people’s veto,” he says. “You need to save people’s civic reserves for when it really matters. But when it really matters people should be allowed to have their say.” But he adds that in Britain, the few referendums that have been called have been done so not for reasons of national imperative but for party political reasons: a party leader, unable to brook compromise over a towering issue (usually Europe) effectively contracts out the decision making process to the people And finally – referendums, or referenda? I’m glad you asked. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the plural of referendum is referendums. Referenda are the things being voted on, so one referendum could contain multiple referenda within it. The British parliament confirmed as much back in 1998, when the late Alan Clarke asked the then speaker Betty Boothroyd, to rule on the matter. “I’ve always preferred the use of the English language to any Latin form if that is of some guidance,” she said.

Civil servants say they have been frustrated by political paralysis, gripped by inter-departmental rows and shorn of key staff while trying to implement the biggest change to the state’s machinery since the second world war. Bob Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, said the root of this frustration was the failure of UK politicians to decide on a plan to leave the EU. “What is making it extremely difficult for civil servants is the paralysis of politicians. They do not know what they are preparing for,” Lord Kerslake said. “For every task in hand there are at least two streams – the deal and the no deal – and with it a duplication of tasks. What I am getting from them is a desire to serve the government but they cannot do so without instruction and time is running out to prepare properly, one way or the other. “This is really getting close to mission impossible now.” As the possibility of a no-deal Brexit has increased, mandarins have spent more time and public money on possible scenarios that may never be needed, with £4bn of taxpayers’ money earmarked for no-deal planning since 2016. They have also been planning for scenarios that would have a major impact on everyday public services. Kent police has asked for extra help to deal with traffic and related problems if the Channel ports are clogged up, calling for officers to be deployed and placed on standby from around the country. The plan is called Operation Snow Bunting. Frustrated ministers who are opposed to no deal say the shift in resources should not be happening. One cabinet source said: “I can’t believe we are planning to take officers off the street at a time knife crime is rising.” There are also plans in place to deploy officers in and around supermarkets and other shops at the end of March. The fear is that people panic-buying food could cause chaos. Border worries Civil servants from the Department of Health and the Department for Transport have been helping to coordinate commercial flights to fly radioisotopes, used to detect cancer, into the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit. At one point officials were considering hiring light aircraft to fly vital blood products to the UK from the European mainland. However, it is understood this plan has been ditched. “We have asked suppliers to bring in isotopes by air in the event of problems in the Calais-Dover crossing,” a Whitehall source said. The key focus is the management of the border with France. A source at Highways England, the agency that builds and monitors motorways and major roads, said managers had drawn up plans to relocate 10% of the workforce to Kent in the event of no deal. The principal worry is not the movement of people, which will be largely unchanged, or even tariffs, which can be levied subsequently, but checks relating to food and animal products where checks are made at or near the border. Kent council has made plans to park 5,000 lorries on one lane of the M20 and nearby dual carriageways and a further 6,000 at Manston airport to minimise disruption to traffic across the rest of the county. But Paul Carter, the council’s Conservative leader, says the UK will be reliant on the response of the French, particularly in a no-deal scenario, which he hopes to avoid. “The authorities have promised that Calais will run smoothly and we hope it will, but there were long delays last week when there was a go-slow, when they protested about a lack of resources to handle Brexit,” he said. Council planning has focused on the handling of lorries and other freight traffic, which has required a significant effort, with staff working extra time in addition to their day jobs, to reach a position where Carter is confident the plans are in place. However, at the Channel ports at least, plans are yet to be finalised as to how to handle private cars and tourist traffic wishing to use the crossing. The situation is sufficiently unclear that Carter had hoped May’s deal would pass. Economic distress Kent, though, is just part of the story. The Treasury and the Department for Work and Pensions have discussed setting up a hardship fund to deal with the economic fallout of no deal, where the unemployment rate could hit 7%. A total of £1bn has been earmarked. Ministers have been told to expect the suicide rate to rise because of the anticipated greater economic distress. At least two government agencies have identified the risk of “potential abuse of staff due to customer dissatisfaction” in the event of no deal. A union representative said border agency staff were “rightly concerned” about the possibility that they will be abused by disgruntled passengers at ports and airports. At first, the creation of the Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU) was seen to be a success in Whitehall, with civil servants eager to work there, and Brexit was considered a path to promotion. But as Theresa May’s negotiations have foundered, there have been growing tensions between DExEU and other departments, and working there has rapidly become less attractive. Turf wars Insiders say planning within Whitehall has been complicated by the fact that departments have been taking differing views as to what a no-deal Brexit means. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, has been more relaxed about planning for no deal, while Michael Gove’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has been more assiduous. MPs warned last week that turf wars had emerged between departments fighting for influence and staff, as the centre struggles to hold things together, weakening the UK’s negotiating capabilities. A report by the European scrutiny committee found power struggles between the Cabinet Office and DExEU meant hundreds of civil servants were working against each other. It referred to evidence from the former Brexit minister David Davis on the extent to which he had “less influence than expected in drawing up the UK negotiating position and conducting negotiations”. The paralysis of Brexit has spread to departments that have little to do with the EU. Anger is rising among civil servants in the Department for Education (DfE) and the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) over ministers’ refusal to halt non-essential work while allowing the secondment of hundreds of staff to Brexit-focused departments. A notice sent to departments two months ago sought 3,500 volunteers to work in Brexit departments such as Defra, the Home Office and HMRC which were floundering under an excessive workload. This was not the first call for staff – but it was the first that warned that supplying departments would still have to pay the wages of the volunteers, leaving senior civil servants unable to hire replacement staff. Agencies and departments are meant to be reprioritising work or stopping tasks to accommodate this change – but for the most part ministers are not being clear about which policies they are happy to drop. Sources have told the Guardian the DfE and the MoJ have put some policies on hold but have not officially announced which ones. Earlier this week, neither department was happy to say which. Lack of scrutiny At Defra, there are concerns over stress-related illnesses among staff, and the department is about to lose its permanent secretary, Clare Moriarty, who is taking over at DExEU after the retirement of Philip Rycroft on 29 March. The government has about 300 Brexit-related workstreams, but there is almost no scrutiny or discussion about progress, which is unprecedented in Whitehall. Typically, the Infrastructure and Projects Authority releases quarterly or annual progress updates for projects such as the Thames Tideway tunnel or the new Hinkley Point nuclear power station. “We don’t see any of that for Brexit, although we know it all exists within DExEU. So, the central team know about readiness and risk, but parliament has a limited idea about the levels of readiness across Whitehall,” said Joseph Owen from the Institute for Government. Official papers released in February said Whitehall was “on track for just over two-thirds of the most critical projects” but then did not say which of the projects were running behind. A DfE spokesman declined to say which of its policies had been put on hold. “Some people have been moved from a range of areas and they haven’t been replaced, because these are temporary moves. The only projects that have been suspended are those that are not business critical.” The MoJ also declined to say which policies it has suspended, and instead suggested sending a freedom of information request. Mike Clancy, the general secretary of the Prospect union, said: “Our members are now spending huge amounts of time preparing for a no-deal Brexit which nobody wants to happen, at the cost of doing the vital day-to-day job of government. “In the event of no deal, people are going to be angry and it is our members, not ministers, who will have to deal with them.” Government analysts said the possibility of a no-deal Brexit scenario was unprecedented in terms of Whitehall planning. “Some businesses were given six years to prepare for auto pensions enrolment,” said Owen from the IfG. “But here government won’t tell businesses what the important tariffs will be yet. No deal requires some political agreements on some big issues, not least what our economic policy will be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/16/wind-power-overtakes-nuclear-for-first-time-in-uk-across-a-quarter","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T05:01:39Z","webTitle":"Wind power overtakes nuclear for first time in UK across a quarter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/16/wind-power-overtakes-nuclear-for-first-time-in-uk-across-a-quarter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/16/wind-power-overtakes-nuclear-for-first-time-in-uk-across-a-quarter","fields":{"headline":"Wind power overtakes nuclear for first time in UK across a quarter","bodyText":"Britain’s windfarms provided more electricity than its eight nuclear power stations in the first three months of 2018, marking the first time wind has overtaken nuclear across a quarter. The renewable energy industry hailed the milestone as a sign the UK was well on its way to an electricity system powered by cheap, domestic green energy. Across the first quarter, wind power produced 18.8% of electricity, second only to gas, said a report by researchers at Imperial College London. At one point overnight on 17 March, wind turbines briefly provided almost half of the UK’s electricity. Wind power helped during the cold snaps, too, supplying 12-43% of electricity during the six subzero days in the first three months of the year. Two nuclear plants were temporarily offline for routine maintenance, while another was shut because of seaweed in the cooling system. While wind together with solar supplied more power than nuclear in the final three months of 2017, thiswas the first time wind has managed the feat alone. Dr Rob Gross, one of the authors of the Drax Electric Insights report, said: “There’s no sign of a limit to what we’re able to do with wind in the near future.” The opening in December of a new power cable between Scotland and north Wales also helped unlock electricity from Scottish windfarms, some of which would normally be turned off to help National Grid cope. The Western Link connection has drastically cut the amount of money paid by National Grid to windfarm owners for that curtailment. The company paid £100m in 2017 for curtailment. This year payments are already down by two-thirds. Emma Pinchbeck, the executive director at industry group RenewableUK, said: “It is great news for everyone that rather than turning turbines off to manage our ageing grid, the new cable instead will make best use of wind energy.” News of the quarterly milestone came as MPs said UK emissions targets were threatened by government policy changes, which had caused a collapse in clean energy investment since 2015, including a 56% fall in 2017. Mary Creagh, Labour MP and chair of the environmental audit committee, said: “Billions of pounds of investment is needed in clean energy, transport, heating and industry to meet our carbon targets. But a dramatic fall in investment is threatening the government’s ability to meet legally binding climate change targets.” Separately, the spending watchdog concluded that £23bn spent on a government subsidy scheme for low-carbon heating had been poor value for money and did not deliver its aims. The public accounts committee said the renewable heat incentive had “wildly optimistic” goals and that the government failed to understand what consumers wanted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/15/batteries-included-in-energy-storage-ideas","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-15T17:28:09Z","webTitle":"Batteries included in energy storage ideas | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/15/batteries-included-in-energy-storage-ideas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/15/batteries-included-in-energy-storage-ideas","fields":{"headline":"Batteries included in energy storage ideas","bodyText":"The WWF has been oversimplistic in its argument that no further gas-fired power stations are needed (Report, 14 May). The forecast increase in annual renewable electricity production is only just sufficient to balance the closure of coal-fired electricity generation and the fall in nuclear generation resulting from the retirement of many of our nuclear power stations (most of which are already working beyond their design lives). However, this does not mean more no more gas generation capacity is needed. Electricity demand varies, and renewables are intermittent. There has to be enough capacity to meet demand at all times. While pump storage systems and batteries are able to store enough energy to cope with short-term variations in demand and the availability of renewable generation, it would not be environmentally friendly, efficient or cost-effective to use such systems to store energy from summer to winter, or even to store enough to survive a long midwinter period of high pressure over the North Sea. We may not need to use more gas over the year, but with reduced nuclear output and no coal, the peak demand for gas-fired generation will be larger, meaning we will need more plant. We should not view electricity generation in isolation. We need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from heating and transport too. Using excess electricity to generate hydrogen, injecting it into the gas grid (or into hydrogen vehicle fuel tanks), and then using an equivalent amount of gas to generate electricity when in short supply, is a viable method of long- or short-term energy storage. The extra gas generation capacity needed for that is cheaper than battery storage. Steve Bolter Gestingthorpe, Essex • Your article (Hydrogen is solution to excess electricity puzzle, say engineers, 9 May) based on a recent report by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers about heat from hydrogen, makes me wonder whether the IMechE are in the pocket of the gas industry. The best electrolyser conversion efficiency I’ve ever come across is about 0.76. If that produces hydrogen from electricity and it’s burned in a boiler with a gross “efficiency” of 0.9, that’s 0.68 units of heat per unit of electricity supplied. Oh, and there’s no hydrogen infrastructure yet. Is there an alternative? Yes – the best lithium-ion batteries have a round trip “efficiency” of 0.89. If that’s fed to a heat pump with an eminently achievable coefficient of performance of 3, that’s 2.67 units of heat per unit of electricity supplied – almost four times as much as can be gained from the hydrogen option. And the infrastructure for that already exists.

The facility’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said atmospheric readings as high as 530 sieverts an hour had been recorded inside the containment vessel of reactor No 2, one of three reactors that experienced a meltdown when the plant was crippled by a huge tsunami that struck the north-east coast of Japan in March 2011. The extraordinary radiation readings highlight the scale of the task confronting thousands of workers, as pressure builds on Tepco to begin decommissioning the plant – a process that is expected to take about four decades. Even if a 30-percent margin of error is taken into account, the recent reading, described by some experts as “unimaginable”, is far higher than the previous record of 73 sieverts an hour detected by sensors in 2012. Tepco pointed out, however, that the camera had probed deeper inside the reactor than before and had focused on a single point. Radiation levels at other spots filmed by the camera are estimated to be much lower, it added. A single dose of one sievert is enough to cause radiation sickness and nausea; 5 sieverts would kill half those exposed to it within a month, and a single dose of 10 sieverts would prove fatal within weeks. Tepco also said image analysis had revealed a hole in metal grating beneath the same reactor’s pressure vessel. The one-metre-wide hole was probably created by nuclear fuel that melted and then penetrated the vessel after the tsunami knocked out Fukushima Daiichi’s back-up cooling system. “It may have been caused by nuclear fuel that would have melted and made a hole in the vessel, but it is only a hypothesis at this stage,” Tepco’s spokesman Tatsuhiro Yamagishi told AFP. “We believe the captured images offer very useful information, but we still need to investigate given that it is very difficult to assume the actual condition inside.” The presence of dangerously high radiation will complicate efforts to safely dismantle the plant. A remote-controlled robot that Tepco intends to send into the No 2 reactor’s containment vessel is designed to withstand exposure to a total of 1,000 sieverts, meaning it would survive for less than two hours before malfunctioning. The firm said radiation was not leaking outside the reactor, adding that the robot would still prove useful since it would move from one spot to the other and encounter radiation of varying levels. Tepco and its network of partner companies at Fukushima Daiichi have yet to identify the location and condition of melted fuel in the three most seriously damaged reactors. Removing it safely represents a challenge unprecedented in the history of nuclear power. Quantities of melted fuel are believed to have accumulated at the bottom of the damaged reactors’ containment vessels, but dangerously high radiation has prevented engineers from accurately gauging the state of the fuel deposits. Earlier this week, the utility released images of dark lumps found beneath reactor No 2 that it believes could be melted uranium fuel rods – the first such discovery since the disaster. In December, the government said the estimated cost of decommissioning the plant and decontaminating the surrounding area, as well as paying compensation and storing radioactive waste, had risen to 21.5tn yen (£150bn), nearly double an estimate released in 2013. This article was amended on 9 February to explain that the camera had probed deeper inside the No 2 reactor – and closer to the damaged nuclear fuel – than before, hence the high radiation estimate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/jul/19/uk-threatens-to-return-radioactive-waste-to-eu-without-nuclear-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-19T17:42:13Z","webTitle":"UK threatens to return radioactive waste to EU without nuclear deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/19/uk-threatens-to-return-radioactive-waste-to-eu-without-nuclear-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jul/19/uk-threatens-to-return-radioactive-waste-to-eu-without-nuclear-deal","fields":{"headline":"UK threatens to return radioactive waste to EU without nuclear deal","bodyText":"Britain has warned the EU that it could return boatloads of radioactive waste back to the continent if the Brexit talks fail to deliver an agreement on nuclear regulation. In what is being taken in Brussels as a thinly veiled threat, a paper setting out the UK position for the negotiations stresses the right “to return radioactive waste … to its country of origin” should negotiations collapse. The UK paper, detailing the British government’s hopes for future cooperation once it leaves the Euratom treaty, at the same time as leaving the EU, further stresses the “strong mutual interest in ensuring close cooperation in the future”. Britain currently has a 126-tonne stockpile of radioactive materials originating from EU countries such as Germany, Italy and Sweden. The state-owned Sellafield plant in Cumbria has been reprocessing spent nuclear field from across Europe since the 1970s, producing reusable uranium, plutonium and radioactive waste. Almost a fifth of the UK’s stockpile of civilian plutonium at Sellafield originates from overseas. Nuclear experts who have advised the British government told the Financial Times that the Department for Exiting the European Union’s none-too-coded warning over the future ownership of radioactive waste might just encourage a more flexible approach from the Europeans over the issue. “It might just be a reminder that a boatload of plutonium could end up at a harbour in Antwerp unless an arrangement is made,” one nuclear expert told the FT. Britain has signalled that while it is leaving the Euraotom treaty, of which it has been a member since 1957, it wants to continue to cooperate on nuclear regulation after the UK leaves the union in March 2019. The treaty regulates the civilian use of atomic technology and critics of the government’s position fear there is a threat of disruption to UK supplies of nuclear reactor parts, fuel and medical isotopes vital for the treatment of cancer if a new agreement outside membership of the EU is not reached. Around 500,000 scans are performed in the UK every year using imported radioisotopes. In May the House of Commons energy select committee urged the UK to postpone leaving Euratom. It claimed that power supplies could be threatened if a new regulator was not ready. The EU insist, however, that such cooperation on nuclear regulation would require the UK to recognise the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, which is a red line for Theresa May. EU diplomats told the FT that they had noted the veiled threat on nuclear waste. One reportedly joked that they would have “the coastguard ready”. The UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy told the paper, however, that negotiations would focus on the “legal ownership not physical location” of nuclear materials. What happens to materials once ownership has been settled “will be a matter for the owner and the UK to agree on commercial terms,” the Whitehall department added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/19/japans-renewable-energy-puzzle-solar-push-threatens-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T04:08:25Z","webTitle":"Japan's renewable energy puzzle: solar push threatens environment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/19/japans-renewable-energy-puzzle-solar-push-threatens-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/19/japans-renewable-energy-puzzle-solar-push-threatens-environment","fields":{"headline":"Japan's renewable energy puzzle: solar push threatens environment","bodyText":"The tens of thousands of solar panels resting on the surface of the Yamakura dam reservoir have finally begun to earn their keep. This floating solar farm in Chiba prefecture is the biggest of its kind in Japan – and one of the largest in the world – covering 180,000 square metres, or roughly equivalent to 25 Wembley stadium pitches. Over the next two decades its 51,000 solar panels will generate an estimated 16,170 megawatt hours annually — enough to power thousands of local households. In the post-Fukushima era, local authorities around Japan are courting private investment in renewables as part of a push to dramatically increase their share of the national energy mix. The project, along with dozens of other large-scale solar farms, is also supposed to help Japan – the world’s fifth-biggest carbon emitter – honour its Paris climate agreement vow to cut carbon emissions by 26% by 2030 from 2013 levels. But while most residents support the Yamakura plant’s construction, in other parts of Chiba prefecture campaigners say the rush to blanket large areas with solar panels has the potential to unleash environmental catastrophes, even as they lower CO2 emissions. Pressure on Japan to increase renewables’ share of the energy mix means the number of large-scale solar farms is expected to rise. But, far from welcoming the dawn of a new age of clean energy on their doorstep, residents near the proposed site of a huge solar farm in the city of Kamogawa are mounting a last-ditch effort to prevent its construction. To make the Kamogawa mega solar plant, developers will destroy 300 hectares of pristine forest. The irony of chopping down trees, which absorb CO2 in the air as they grow, to replace them with a solar plant has not been lost on campaigners, who claim the facility will destroy the natural environment and put the area at the mercy of the elements. Of all of the countries investing in renewables, few are as in need of a fundamental rethink on energy policy as Japan. The country recently marked the seventh anniversary of the tsunami disaster and Fukushima meltdown – which resulted in the closure of dozens of nuclear reactors – yet it still lags behind other countries in clean energy development. China is by far the biggest investor in renewables, according to a 2017 report by the International Energy Agency. By 2022, the report said, solar and wind capacity in China could reach twice Japan’s current total power capacity. Over the next four years, the growth in renewable energy capacity in the US, India and the European Union are forecast to outstrip that in Japan. According to the ministry of economy, trade and industry, renewable energy accounts for almost 15% of Japan’ energy mix but is dwarfed by coal at 30% and liquefied natural gas at almost 40%. In response, the government is aiming to increase renewables’ share to between 22% and 24% by 2030 – a target described as “ambitious” by the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, but criticised by his foreign minister, Taro Kono. “For too long, Japan has turned a blind eye to global trends, such as the dramatic decrease in the price of renewables and the inevitable shift to decarbonisation in the face of climate change,” Kono told a meeting of the International Renewable Energy Agency in the United Arab Emirates earlier this year. He said Japan’s 2030 pledge was woefully inadequate given that renewable energy already accounts for 24% of total global energy generation. “As Japanese foreign minister, I consider these circumstances lamentable.” The company behind the Kamogawa mega solar plant has vowed to spare trees on half of the site but that gesture will not be enough to save local wildlife, according to Noriyuki Imanishi, who heads a local group opposing the Kamogawa plant. “Under Japan’s renewable drive there is no need to conduct environmental impact assessments, but we are certain that the plant will have a negative impact on local animals,” Imanishi said. “There are lots of deer and wild boar in the area, and this will threaten their environment.” A Chiba prefectural official said solar plants were part of the central government’s drive to promote renewables. “We’re aware that there is opposition and we now take a more holistic approach to building new facilities so that we can gain the understanding of the local community,” he said. Chiba prefecture, which is served by the electricity company Tepco, is one of several local regions that are courting private renewable investors, offering public land for the construction of ever-larger solar farms on land and water. Developers, meanwhile, are seeking bigger, more economical, sites – which come at a premium in a mountainous country with a large coastal population, and where large tracts of flat land are hard to come by. “After the Fukushima disaster we identified the need to diversify our energy supply to include solar, wind and micro-hydroelectric, and at the same time stimulate the local economy,” said Kouichi Ishige, a deputy director in the prefecture’s industrial waterworks bureau. In its 2017 report on the industry, the Japan Renewable Energy Institute noted mounting concern about the impact mega plants were having on areas of natural and historical importance, echoing campaigners’ fears that the destruction of heavily wooded, mountainous land could increase the risk posed by floods and landslides. Mega solar projects are under construction in other parts of the country, including in areas of natural beauty such as the Izu peninsula and Nikko, a national park. But as long as local authorities see mega solar plants as a source of tax revenue – as well as cheap electricity – opponents appear powerless to halt their construction. “This isn’t about pitting renewable energy against nuclear power,” said Yasufumi Horie, an opponent of the Kamogawa plant, who believes Fukushima has proved nuclear power is no longer a viable source of energy in Japan. “I’m in favour of renewables – the issue is the solar plants’ size and location.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/10/republican-candidates-north-korea-experience-may-not-be-all-he-claims","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-10T11:30:11Z","webTitle":"Republican candidate's North Korea experience may not be all he claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/10/republican-candidates-north-korea-experience-may-not-be-all-he-claims","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/10/republican-candidates-north-korea-experience-may-not-be-all-he-claims","fields":{"headline":"Republican candidate's North Korea experience may not be all he claims","bodyText":"North Korea rarely plays a prominent role in US congressional elections, but Rick Saccone – the Republican candidate for Congress in Tuesday’s crucial special election in Pennsylvania – has made much of his experience in the reclusive country. A television advertisement features moody shots of a missile launch and goose-stepping North Korean soldiers – and Saccone’s claim that his career as “a diplomat in North Korea” makes him uniquely placed to deal with the looming crisis over Pyongyang’s nuclear programme. Saccone’s campaign website says that he “spent one year on a diplomatic mission in North Korea” and describes him as “the only United States citizen living in North Korea that negotiated with the North Korean regime on a daily basis”. But the four-term state legislator may be overstating his role. According to former colleagues, although Saccone is one of the few Americans to have dealt with North Korean officials, he was not a diplomat, and was not engaged in traditional diplomacy. “From what I have heard, he has tended to embellish his role,” said David Lambertson, a former US diplomat who held the same position as Saccone in North Korea. Both were US representatives for the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, (KEDO), a nuclear power plant project in North Korea that was designed to give Pyongyang civilian nuclear power without the ability to make weapons. KEDO was the result of Bill Clinton-era negotiations that began in 1994 and slowly fell apart before formally ending in 2006. The agreement required at least one American to be on site, as well as representatives from Japan and South Korea. The building site where Saccone spent his time was in Kumho, about 270 kilometres (165 miles) from Pyongyang. The close race between Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb in a district that Donald Trump won overwhelmingly in 2016 has become a major test of Republican strength ahead of the 2018 midterms. And after this week’s shock announcement that Trump had accepted an invitation to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, Saccone’s experience in Kumho has taken on fresh relevance. Questions about the precise nature of that experience were first raised by blogger Warren Throckmorton. According to Lambertson, substantial negotiations over KEDO would take place in Pyongyang, with US staff flown in from New York. Lambertson attended these meetings but described his presence at negotiations as “more of an observer”. “Saccone’s experience would have been exactly the same: he was not negotiating highly sensitive matters with the North Koreans by any means,” he added. Kim Joong-keun, the South Korean representative on the project who worked with Saccone, agreed that the candidate’s account was “inaccurate”. “Frankly speaking, he didn’t meet any important North Koreans,” Kim said. “There was a lot more contact between North Koreans and South Koreans. “Of all the Americans I worked with, I would rank Saccone at the bottom.” Kim said that meetings typically took place twice a month – a far cry from the claims in Saccone’s campaign literature. “Once the framework was signed, there was no political negotiations going on with KEDO, it was a $5 billion construction project,” said Joel Wit, a former state department official who was instrumental in establishing KEDO and oversaw the agreement with North Korea. “If you want to talk to people who knew about the project, he wouldn’t be one of them”. Bob Branstetter, a spokesman for Saccone said: “Rick was the American representative for the Korea Peninsula Energy Development Organization inside North Korea from December 2000 to December 2001.” He added that Saccone “interacted daily with the North Koreans regarding the implementation of the agreed framework” and “served in a diplomatic capacity for KEDO”. Branstetter also sent a picture of Saccone shaking hands with another man over a conference table lined with full glasses of beer. He added: “What is portrayed in the photo is the definition of diplomacy. In the photo, Rick was shaking hands with North Korean officials immediately after signing an agreement negotiated by Rick and the North Koreans to give access to the beach area for the KEDO workers.” Branstatter also provided an image of a commemorative plate given to Saccone after he left KEDO. It bore the names of six KEDO co-workers. The first name listed was that was of Kim. Branstattter said Saccone “interacted with North Koreans virtually every single day during his year in the country”. Although Saccone has said that he lived in North Korea for one year, Lambertson and Kim said his position was shared among two or three people, with each rotating in for a maximum period of about six weeks. Despite his experience in North Korea, Saccone has hesitated to share explicit views on how Washington should engage with Pyongyang. In an interview earlier in March, he declined to comment on the wisdom of a pre-emptive airstrike against North Korea. “I’m not privy to exactly what the adminstration’s strategy is,” said Saccone. “I don’t want to second-guess a strategy that may be going on behind the scenes until I get there and then I can advise how to make this work.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/nov/14/afd-german-media-politicians-angela-merkel","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-14T06:00:11Z","webTitle":"Is Germany’s media to blame for the inexorable rise of the AfD? | Ben Knight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/14/afd-german-media-politicians-angela-merkel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/14/afd-german-media-politicians-angela-merkel","fields":{"headline":"Is Germany’s media to blame for the inexorable rise of the AfD?","bodyText":"Political journalists in Berlin often do a thing called Hintergrundgespräch. This “background conversation” involves gathering in an airless room of a ministry or a party headquarters with a group of favoured colleagues and some alpha politician who then tells you what’s what. Or what’s really what. The mood is relaxed and pally. Recording devices are not allowed, and although notes may be taken, direct quotes can’t be used. Free drinks are provided. The first time I went to a Hintergrundgespräch, not long ago, a heavy realisation dawned on me: this is why people hate us. This is why people vote for the far-right AfD. It looks a lot like a cosy arrangement: journalists being spoonfed their stories by politicians. For a country that nurses political stability so carefully, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD, Alternative for Germany) is an electoral phenomenon. In its five-year life, this unashamedly populist and often ill-disciplined party has become the third-biggest group in the German parliament, the Bundestag, and has representatives in all state parliaments. And polls suggest it may not have plateaued. AfD is still fundamentally repugnant to all the other mainstream parties, who have ruled out joining coalitions with it, mainly because the AfD still harbours open racists and flirts with revisionism about Germany’s remembrance for the Holocaust. Several obvious factors have helped the AfD get itself established in the party system in the past year: weariness with Chancellor Angela Merkel, coupled with exasperation that her latest coalition with the Social Democrats has lurched from one crisis to the next, tearing itself apart over the perennial problem of refugee policy. Merkel will step down from her party’s leadership next month, yet it is unclear how that will affect support for the AfD. Still, today, migration is almost never out of the news, even though the “refugee crisis” is now more than three years old, and Merkel has done all she can within legal limits to close Germany’s borders and deport failed asylum seekers back to countries deemed “safe”, including Afghanistan. Florian Hartleb, a political scientist and author of a book on European populism, thinks this last point is crucial. Ever since Merkel’s fateful decision in 2015, the media have made things too easy for the AfD, first by relentlessly demonising it and then by keeping its core policy issue on the front pages. The media has done some soul-searching recently: a 2017 study by the Hamburg Media School and Leipzig University found that a majority of news outlets had accepted the government’s “slogans” on migration too uncritically. Merkel’s famous line “Wir schaffen das” (“We will manage”) had simply been adopted, rather than scrutinised. “It was easy for the AfD to play the opponent,” says Hartleb. “And the more we talk about migration, the more the chances are for the AfD.” But the origins of the AfD predate 2015 and, if you believe the party’s strategists, the refugee crisis was simply the moment when 15 years of frustration with complacent German centrism finally crystallised into a party. “The refugee crisis broke trust in established politics,” Rainer Erkens, an AfD member in Berlin, tells me. “For years politicians were doing things they did not have a mandate for, which were not even remotely an issue in elections.” He lists decisions made by successive governments “over the people’s heads”: creating the euro, launching the so-called Hartz IV social welfare reforms in the early 2000s, abandoning nuclear power, abolishing military service, and bailing out Greece in the aftermath of the eurozone debt crisis. Merkel’s decision to open borders in 2015 was the last straw for many voters, Erkens says. “People realised that politicians were getting majorities in elections for policies they’re not even pursuing.” Something else AfD voters share is an all-pervading pessimism. “You have to see that people who vote for the AfD have a specific image of Germany. And this image is that Germany is going down the drain.” Then comes another list – images of Germany’s deterioration: the poor state of the Bundeswehr (armed forces), the botched “energy transition” to renewable sources, the debts of other EU countries, the alleged “Islamisation” of German society, and, as Erkens puts it, “what does climate protection even mean, and how much will that cost us?” All these are the weeds underfoot, destabilising Germany’s economic power. AfD voters seem unaffected, however, by the scandals that outrage everyone else – like the time in June when AfD leader Alexander Gauland triggered an outcry because of a speech describing the Third Reich as a “bird shit in a thousand years of successful German history”. The pessimism of AfD voters supersedes any such scruples. “If you have the feeling that Germany is going down the drain and if there is one party, the AfD, which is saying exactly that, then you couldn’t care less that Gauland uses the term ‘bird shit’ when he talks about the Nazi period in German history,” says Erkens. “The AfD is much more important than one politician possibly talking nonsense.” Ronald Gläser, a spokesperson for the AfD in Berlin, puts it bluntly: “Those outrage issues do accompany us, but they don’t harm us that much. And of course, when the media reports about us so hysterically, that’s useful for us.” Hartleb believes baiting the media is a calculated strategy. “There is this taboo-breaking logic: you say something baldly provocative, then you say it was just a misunderstanding, then you go one step further,” he says. “It doesn’t help any more to just blame the voters of the AfD. It doesn’t help to say that these are neo-Nazis.” So what strategies are left to counter the far right? Recent state elections have shown that only those parties that aren’t divided over migration are winning – the AfD and the Greens. Either you’re for a diverse society or you’re against it. This, says Erkens, is where the political debate in Germany is headed: “In the future there will be two big parties: the Greens and the AfD. Those will be the poles, and between them there will be three other parties crawling around at 10% or 15%. It’s perfectly feasible that that will be our party system.” If it’s true, journalists and politicians might need to get out of those Hintergrundgespräche once in a while to grasp how Germany’s political scene is being redrawn.

But, in a meaty fact-check today, the BBC quoted an expert saying that two studies by the Chinese institute – one from 2015, and another from 2017 – included gain-of-function research, where diseases are genetically altered to increase their transmissibility. New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced that the country is pausing quarantine-free travel from Australia for at least eight weeks, due to Covid outbreaks on the neighbouring island. It is the first time New Zealand has taken this course of action – which will come into force at 11.59pm local time tonight – since the bubble was introduced in April. Australia’s most populous state declared a “national emergency” as it struggles to contain a record-breaking surge of the Delta variant of Covid-19 amid a lockdown affecting half the country. The state of New South Wales announced 136 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 today, with continued community transmission among essential workers, including in supermarkets and pharmacies. The Republican governor of Alabama said it is “time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks” for rising cases of Covid-19, amid concern that months of misinformation over the need and efficacy of vaccines is fuelling a resurgence of coronavirus infections in several states. Only about a third of eligible people in Alabama have received a vaccine shot, one of the lowest rates in the US. About 100 of the 613 US athletes arriving in Tokyo for the Olympics are unvaccinated, the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee’s medical chief said. Medical director Jonathan Finnoff said 567 of the American athletes had filled out their health histories as they prepared for the trip, and estimated that 83% had replied that they had been vaccinated. An Australian clothing brand was fined A$5m for claiming that its garments stop the spread of Covid.

Mexico’s health ministry on Friday reported 16,421 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country and 328 more fatalities, Reuters reports. It brings the total to 2,726,160 infections and 237,954 deaths. The government has said the real number of cases is likely significantly higher, and separate data published recently suggested the actual death toll could be 60% higher than the official count Brazil registered 108,732 new cases of coronavirus and 1,324 additional deaths in the last 24 hours, the country’s health ministry said on Friday. The country has had over 19.5 million cases in total and more than 547,000 deaths. Australian authorities said fragments of Covid-19 had been detected at the sewage treatment plant at Moss Vale in the NSW Southern Highlands where there were no known cases in this area. The department said this was of “great concern”. Moss Vale area residents are asked to be vigilant for any symptoms and if they appear to immediately be tested and isolate until a negative result is received. The England football manager Gareth Southgate has joined the campaign to encourage people to have their coronavirus vaccine, saying it will allow them to “get your freedom back”. Downing Street has released a message from the manager thanking the public for their support during the team’s journey to the Euro 2020 final and urging younger people in particular to get the jab. In the UK, only 58% of people aged 18-25 have their first dose, according to new Public Health England data, despite all adults having been offered the jab. There are also large disparities in uptake by ethnicity. Southgate, 50, said: “Oldies like me have had both jabs, so we can crack on with our lives, but for you younger ones especially, it’s the chance for everything to open up, to get your freedom back.” Iceland has announced new curbs following a spate of infections, AFP reports. At the end of June, Iceland lifted rules around social distancing, mask-wearing, limits on public gatherings and the opening hours of bars and restaurants after introducing virus restrictions in March last year. Starting from midnight on Sunday until 13 August, public gatherings will be restricted to 200, the one-metre social distancing rule will be reimposed and bars and restaurants will have to close at 11:00pm. Swimming pools and indoor sports facilities can only operate to 75% of capacity and masks will be mandatory indoors. The US administered 340,363,922 doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the country as of Friday morning and distributed 393,929,955 doses, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Those figures are up from the 339,763,765 vaccine doses the CDC said had gone into arms by July 22 out of 391,998,625 doses delivered. The agency said 187,579,557 people had received at least one dose while 162,435,276 people are fully vaccinated as of Friday, Reuters reports. The north-east of England is to be given a five-week package of support by the UK’s government in a bid to slow the growth of Covid-19 in the region. The package includes the option to deliver extra testing in the area, as well as providing logistical support to maximise vaccine and testing uptake, PA reports. It will be deployed to the seven local authorities across Tyne and Wear, Northumberland and County Durham, and five local authorities in the Tees Valley. The move comes as similar support in Bedford and much of the north-west, which has been in place for between six and 10 weeks, is being scaled back. Health authorities in Australia has issued a warning about misinformation circulating on WhatsApp that claims Sydney supermarkets will close as part of the ongoing lockdown, with owner Facebook saying it is working to limit the spread of misinformation on its private messaging app. On Thursday, it was reported that a screenshot purporting to be from NSW Health saying that supermarkets would close for four days as part of the Covid-19 response was circulating on WhatsApp. Supermarkets in NSW have remained open during the greater Sydney lockdown and are considered essential retail. In a statement, the state’s health department urged people not to take advice from anywhere but the official NSW Health channels. “NSW Health is urging people to use trusted and credible sources of information to inform them about the most up-to-date Covid-19 information in NSW,” a spokesperson said. Chilean authorities said China’s Sinovac had begun evaluating potential sites for the construction of a vaccine plant in Chile that could begin producing doses of the Chinese shot as early as the first half of 2022. Chile, a global leader in vaccinating its citizens against the coronavirus, has leaned heavily on the Sinovac vaccine in its fast-paced mass vaccination program. The Andean nation also helped spearhead clinical trials of the shot late last year. A delegation of executives from Sinovac this week visited potential sites for the factory near the capital Santiago and in Chile’s northern desert. “This is an investment that could be made very quickly and that would make the plant ... operational in the first quarter next year,” economy minister Lucas Palacios told reporters. Palacios said the plant could produce as many as 50 million vaccine doses annually and in addition to its CoronaVac COVID-19 jab, it could produce vaccines for hepatitis B or influenza, Reuters reports. Covid-19 hospitalisations in Mexico City and its suburbs, increased by a third in the last week, authorities said, amid a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. There are currently 3,382 people hospitalised in the metropolitan area of the Valley of Mexico, city official Eduardo Clark said. He added that if necessary more hospital beds would be turned over to Covid-19 treatment. Positive coronavirus test results, however, had decreased since mid-July, he said. “Fortunately, we see signs that in the last week positive (results) have stabilised,” Clark said, citing it as a sign that the infection curve might be flattening, Reuters reports.

The state of Florida has asked the US Supreme Court to allow a lower-court decision to take effect that said the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could not enforce its coronavirus cruise ship rules in the state. The ruling had been blocked by a US appeals court, Reuters reports. Florida asked the Supreme Court to lift the appeals court order warning without action. “Florida is all but guaranteed to lose yet another summer cruise season while the CDC pursues its appeal,” the state said in its filing to the Supreme Court. England is facing weeks of disruption to bin collection, transport and food supply due to staff self-isolating, companies and councils have warned, amid concerns the 16 August date to lift quarantine for the double-vaccinated could be delayed. No 10 was on Friday scrambling to set up a system to let more key workers take daily tests rather than isolate for 10-days, over fears that large parts of the economy could grind to a halt over the so-called “pingdemic”. Ministers initially said that there would only be a narrow definition of critical workers allowed to be routinely excused from quarantine, with about 10,000 workers at 500 food distribution sites and some NHS and social care workers permitted to take daily tests instead of isolation. Public Health England has upgraded its risk assessment of the Delta variant after national testing data revealed it is more likely to cause reinfections than the Alpha variant, which was first identified in Kent. The health agency’s analysis found the risk of reinfection with Delta may be 46% greater than with the Alpha variant, with the highest risk seen six months after a first infection – when second cases caused by Delta were 2.37 times more common than with Alpha. The finding is bolstered by new data from Public Health England’s (PHE) Siren study, which monitors more than 40,000 NHS staff for Covid infections. The latest figures show that positive tests rose steadily from May to July when 1.1% had the virus. Nearly a third of the healthcare workers had Covid before enrolling on the study and more than 95% have been vaccinated. It is unclear why Delta may be causing more reinfections, but one possibility is that immunity from infections early on in the pandemic may be waning a little and so reducing the body’s defences against the variant which became dominant in the UK this year. PHE said that further work is now being undertaken to examine the risk of reinfection. The US purchased 200 million more doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for flexibility if booster shots are later needed and the shots are approved for younger children, the White House said. The vaccine makers announced the government’s purchase earlier on Friday , Reuters reports. The number of people in hospital with coronavirus in England has risen to its highest level in four months, data shows. Latest figures from NHS England show that 4,401 hospital beds were occupied by confirmed Covid-19 cases on Friday, the highest level since March 22. This is a week-on-week rise of 30.7% from the 3,367 people in hospital on July 16. But the numbers are still much lower than the peak of the second wave when patient levels in England reached 34,336 on January 18. The North East and Yorkshire had the highest number of beds occupied with Covid patients on Friday, at 1,026, PA reports. My colleague Justin McCurry reports from the Olympic opening ceremony in Tokyo. Setting the right emotional tone for the precursor to an Olympics being held in such extraordinary circumstances was always going to be a perilous exercise in not causing offence, to a world traumatised by a pandemic and to a host nation deeply uneasy about its moment in the spotlight. An opening ceremony that overstated its tragic backdrop would have sent a curious message to thousands of athletes, confined inside an Olympic bubble, who from tomorrow will begin their quest for medals. Yet one that appeared to overtly celebrate the start of the world’s biggest sporting event would have come across as insensitive – even callous – in a week when daily Covid-19 cases in Tokyo reached their highest for six months. In the end, Japan played it safe.

New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced the country is pausing quarantine-free travel from Australia for at least eight weeks, due to Covid outbreaks in the neighbouring island. It is the first time New Zealand has taken this course of action – which will come into force at 11.59pm local time tonight – since the bubble was introduced in April. Australia’s most populous state declared a “national emergency” as it struggles to contain a record-breaking surge of the Delta variant of Covid-19 amid a lockdown affecting half the country. The state of New South Wales announced 136 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 today, with continued community transmission among essential workers, including in supermarkets and pharmacies. The Republican governor of Alabama said it is “time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks” for rising cases of Covid-19, amid concern that months of misinformation over the need and efficacy of vaccines is fuelling a resurgence of coronavirus infections in several states. Only about a third of eligible people in Alabama have got a vaccine shot, one of the lowest rates in the US. About 100 of the 613 US athletes arriving in Tokyo for the Olympics are unvaccinated, the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee’s medical chief said. Medical director Jonathan Finnoff said 567 of the American athletes had filled out their health histories as they prepared for the trip, and estimated 83% had replied they were vaccinated. An Australian clothing brand was fined AUS$5m for claiming its garments stop the spread of Covid. Lorna Jane advertised that its clothes used “a groundbreaking technology” called LJ Shield to prevent the “transferal of all pathogens”. But a judge ruled that the claim was “exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous”. The recent drop in new daily reported Covid cases in the UK has led some scientists to hope we may have reached the peak of this wave – but others said the dip could be something of a mirage. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, about 1 in 75 people in the community in England had Covid in the week ending 17 July, up from 1 in 95 the week before. The survey suggests infection levels have also risen in Wales and Northern Ireland, although the trend for Scotland was unclear. A scientist advising the UK government has accused ministers of allowing infections to rip through the younger population in an effort to bolster levels of immunity before the NHS faces winter pressures, my colleagues Ian Sample and Heather Stewart report. The allegation comes after England’s remaining Covid restrictions were eased on Monday, with nightclubs throwing open their doors for the first time in the pandemic and all rules on social distancing and mask wearing dropped even as infections run high. The European Central Bank has said it would end pandemic-era restrictions on banks’ payouts to shareholders but urged eurozone lenders to “remain prudent”. AFP reports that the ECB “decided not to extend beyond September 2021 its recommendation that all banks limit dividends”, it said in a statement. But it warned that eurozone lenders “should remain prudent when deciding on dividends and share buy-backs”. The ECB imposed a cap on banks’ rewards to shareholders at the onset of the coronavirus crisis in March 2020, to ensure lenders had enough liquidity to weather the fallout. The curbs were then extended twice, until September 2021. With the eurozone recovery now firmly under way thanks to mass vaccinations and post-lockdown re-openings, the Frankfurt institution said it would return to the “pre-pandemic way of assessing” banks’ plans for dividends and share buy-backs, AFP reports. But banks should “not underestimate the risk that additional losses may later have an impact on their capital trajectory as support measures expire”, the ECB said. The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have also recently lifted their Covid-era restrictions on dividends after banks reportedly proved they had successfully weathered the changing economic circumstances. Two hospitals in Florida reportedly have more Covid than at any point during the pandemic. The New York Times reports that more than 140 people at two University of Florida hospitals in Jacksonville are admitted with the virus, a tenfold increase over five weeks — and the highest number of Covid patients so far at any one time. Last month, the number of Covid-19 patients was down to 14 in total. “It’s very frustrating,” said Dr Leon Haley, the chief executive of UF Health Jacksonville, told the NYT. “Each day we continue to go up. There’s no sense of when things are going to curtail themselves. People are stretched thin.” He added: “If we were able to get more people vaccinated earlier than this ... We probably wouldn’t be here.” The costs of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic have forced Mexican archaeologists to re-bury an unusual find that combined colonial and pre-Hispanic features. The Associated Press reports that the National Institute of Anthropology and History had announced in 2019 that it found a flood control tunnel on the outskirts of Mexico City that had Spanish construction techniques but carved Aztec symbols embedded in it. The institute had planned to make an exhibit of the strange tunnel, which was apparently built in the early 1600s. It replaced an earlier Aztec flood-control system built in the 1400s to protect Mexico City, then an island surrounded by shallow lakes, against periodic floods. After the Spanish conquered the Aztec capital in 1521, they unwisely destroyed parts of the pre-Hispanic system. But the institute said that archaeologists would simply cover the finds with dirt again, in hopes that someday it would have enough money to build a display for it. The institute said in a statement that “it must be considered that the world-wide Covid-19 health emergency forced all levels of government to place priority on assigning money to health care for the population. For that reason, the archaeological project had to be postponed.” The tunnel was discovered in an ancient flood-control wall during the construction of a confined-lane bus service line, AP reports. Experts speculate the pre-Hispanic symbols may have been placed in the wall because Indigenous labourers were the main work force during its construction. French president Emmanuel Macron has backed Japan’s decision to host the delayed Olympics despite the pandemic, as he attended the opening ceremony in Tokyo with just hundreds of other officials and dignitaries. Paris will host the next edition of the summer Games in 2024, and Macron’s meetings in Tokyo included talks with International Olympic committee chief Thomas Bach, according to Reuters. The French president, who arrived this morning, was one of only around 950 people in the stands, including US first lady Jill Biden. Coronavirus rules have forced Macron to reduce his delegation to a minimum, and he is travelling with just a single minister. But despite the restrictions, Macron told France Television hours before the ceremony that “these Olympic Games had to be held” after they were postponed for a year in March 2020, Reuters reports. “We have to resist, we have to hold these Games. It’s important because the Olympic spirit is a spirit of cooperation and that’s what we need in these times,” he added. Macron said he sympathised with the difficult decision Japan faced in moving ahead with the Games even as infections rise in Tokyo. “I think that they did not anticipate that these variants were going to happen and because their borders were shut, they started vaccinations later than some others, which has created difficulties,” he said. “But I think the Japanese authorities were right to go ahead with the Olympics ... It demonstrates something: that whatever happens, we have to adapt, to organise and do the best we can.” Riot police have fired teargas at hundreds of demonstrators who blocked the entrance to Slovakia’s parliament today as lawmakers debated legislation which could prevent unvaccinated people from public events and premises. Some protesters chanted “Treason” and one carried a banner declaring “Stop corona fascism” over the draft law that would create a two-tier society, while others reportedly pelted the building in the capital Bratislava with eggs. Some opposition parties have spoken out against vaccination, including former prime minister Robert Fico, who has said he will not get vaccinated. Parliament’s speaker Boris Kollár, whose party Sme Rodina is opposed to dividing people based on their vaccination status, reportedly described the situation outside the legislature as a “fatal failure” of the police, as barriers were not erected in anticipation of the protest. “Those people, obviously, are fighting against something. That does not mean we should beat them with batons or spray them with water cannons or with tear gas,” Kollár said, according to local media. The government has reportedly proposed using a version of the EU Digital Covid Pass domestically so that that vaccinated people would be able to use it as an alternative to a negative PCR test when entering certain premises, including restaurants, with those unvaccinated to be denied access. Prime minister Eduard Heger reportedly said that the public’s right to express their opinion is part of democracy, but called for calm “I understand people are tired of the pandemic and nobody likes the measures,” he said, as quoted by TASR. “But we adopt them to protect the lives of all people in Slovakia, including the protesters.” One policewoman was slightly hurt, Slovak media quoted parliamentary speaker Boris Kollar as saying. The protest continued peacefully and eventually dwindled after the police intervention, Reuters reported. The EU member state of 5.5 million has been struggling to get people vaccinated against Covid-19. As of yesterday, just 34.9% of the population was fully vaccinated, data from Johns Hopkins University showed. That is one of the lowest vaccination rates per capita in the EU. Greek authorities have turned to the leaders of the country’s Orthodox Church to urge those hesitant to get the vaccine to get jabbed. The New York Times reports that health minister Vassilis Kikilias and the government’s chief epidemiologist, Sotiris Tsiodras, have also visited the church’s Holy Synod to ask Archbishop Ieronymos to censure vaccine-sceptic priests. After the visit, the church sent a message to its clergy this week saying vaccination against Covid is “the greatest act of responsibility toward one’s fellow human being” and cast the jab as “a gift from God”. Some clerics have been using sermons to bolster vaccine hesitancy, the NYT reports, and others have warned inoculated churchgoers would be denied holy communion. One priest in Halkidiki, northern Greece, has reportedly banned vaccinated and masked worshipers from attending his services, while another in nearby Thessaloniki told his faithful not to get the vaccine and to defy Covid curbs. Only 44% of Greece’s nearly 11 million citizens are fully vaccinated, with healthcare workers to be required to get the shots. Businesses are reportedly to be given the choice state whether or not they would host only vaccinated customers, with the reward being that they could operate at a higher capacity. “Of course, the pandemic has exacerbated our pre-existing condition of extremely rich people,” Stephen Colbert said last night, citing a Bloomberg report on super-yacht charters, which are up over 340%. “This is disgusting. At a time of dire need, the ultra-rich shouldn’t be blowing their money on boats. That’s money that could be used to launch giant penises into space,” Colbert joked, referring to Jeff Bezos’s phallic-shaped rocket, which traveled to space earlier this week. South Africa’s Covid-19 vaccination campaign is regaining momentum after being disrupted earlier this month by a week of riots sparked by the imprisonment of former president Jacob Zuma, the country’s acting health minister has said. The Associated Press reports that at least 120 pharmacies, including 71 that were vaccination sites, were damaged and closed during the unrest in the KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces, according to acting health minister Mamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane. More than 47,000 vaccine doses were destroyed when the sites were ransacked, she said. “The social unrest has added to the complexity of our fight against the Covid-19 pandemic,” Kubayi-Ngubane said, adding that the “violent nature of the protests unsettled the health care system as a whole.” At least 337 people died during the riots, including 213 deaths that police are investigating as possible murders, the government has stated. Major highways to Durban, one of Africa’s busiest Indian Ocean ports, were also closed and barricaded, with more than 27 trucks burned in KwaZulu-Natal. Police also are investigating 132 cases of arson, including the burning of 11 warehouses and 8 factories. Property worth an estimated US$1.37bn was destroyed in KwaZulu-Natal. South Africa, population 59m, reported 14,858 new infections and 433 deaths today, rising to almost 69,000 in total, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Vaccination rates dropped as a result of the unrest, but have picked up pace. South Africa gave shots to more than 220,000 people per day this week and aims to increase the number to 300,000 jabs each weekday next week, AP reports. More than 6m South Africans have received at least one shot and 1.6 million are fully vaccinated with two jabs of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine or one dose of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. About 100 of the 613 US athletes arriving in Tokyo for the Olympics are unvaccinated, the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee’s medical chief said hours before Friday night’s opening ceremony. Medical director Jonathan Finnoff said 567 of the American athletes had filled out their health histories as they prepared for the trip, and estimated 83% had replied they were vaccinated, the Associated Press reports. “Eighty-three percent is actually a substantial number and we’re quite happy with it,” Finnoff said. Nationally, 56.3% of Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Republican governor of Alabama has said it is “time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks” for rising cases of Covid-19, amid concern that months of misinformation over the need and efficacy of vaccines is fueling a resurgence of coronavirus infections in several states. Kay Ivey said that vaccines are “the greatest weapon we have to fight Covid” and added that a surge in new cases of the coronavirus in Alabama is due to a reluctance among many people in the state to get inoculated. Only about a third of eligible people in Alabama have got a vaccine shot, one of the lowest rates in the US. In Alabama and neighboring Mississippi, for example, reluctance to take the vaccine can be driven by economic factors as well as politics or simple fear of a new vaccine. But also, for many Black residents, they struggle to overcome a historical mistrust of the government and the health system because of a history not just of neglect but of racist medical abuse, such as the decades-long, government-sponsored Tuskegee study, where African American men were coerced into a syphilis experiment. You can follow US-focused updates with my colleague Jessica Glenza here. Germany’s public health institute has said it is putting Spain and the Netherlands on a list of high-incidence countries for coronavirus, meaning new restrictions for unvaccinated travellers. The move by the Robert Koch Institute, effective from Tuesday, means anyone arriving from high-incidence countries with new infection rates of 200 or more per 100,000 people in the past seven days is required to go into a 10-day quarantine, which can be cut to five days upon a negative test. But fully vaccinated people – even though they can still carry the virus – or those who have recovered recently from the coronavirus are exempt from the quarantine. Today, Germany reported 2,089 new cases and 34 deaths in the previous 24 hours, bringing its seven-day incidence rate to 13.2. Cases of Covid-19 have increased in Sweden’s main cities and the more contagious Delta has emerged as the dominant variant in the country, health authorities said on Friday, though it added infection levels nationally remained low. Sweden reported 1,855 new cases of Covid-19 last week, a 24% increase compared to the previous week. Around a quarter of new cases were linked to travel abroad, the heath authority said. The authority said in a statement: The number of cases nationally of Covid-19 continues to be at a low level, but an increase is seen in all metropolitan regions. The statement also said that 75% of Sweden’s adult population had now received at least one dose of vaccine, Reuters reports. After suffering a third wave during the spring, infection rates, hospitalisations and deaths in the disease fell rapidly during the early summer with the vaccine roll-out and warmer weather seen having helped bring down the spread. Sweden pressed ahead last week with easing pandemic restrictions, though, faced by the spread of new variants of the virus, the government also urged citizens to keep to social distancing recommendations. The Nordic country has relied mainly on voluntary measures to stem the spread of infections, though curbs on opening hours for restaurants and limits on crowds at venues such as shopping malls have also been periodically enforced. Workers in critical roles in Scotland will be able to avoid self-isolation when notified by the NHS Covid app if they are fully vaccinated and are tested daily, Nicola Sturgeon has announced. Scotland’s first minister said it was “essential that lifeline services and critical national infrastructure are maintained” and that the changes would ensure staff shortages do not put key services at risk. Sectors such as health and social care, transport and food supply have been badly affected by the “pingdemic”, in which those who receive a notification from the NHS are ordinarily required to self-isolate at home. Affected industries will have to apply to the Scottish government for staff to be given exemption from the mandatory quarantine rules. In those cases where work is deemed to be essential, close contacts of infected people will not be required to isolate. If the government deems that a critical role is exempt, the worker will still have to prove they have had two doses of coronavirus vaccine at least two weeks before close contact with an infected person, have a negative PCR test and agree to carry out lateral flow tests for 10 days after the contact. Scotland’s Covid rules shifted to their lowest level on Monday, but the country still has fixed limits on the numbers of people in social gatherings, unlike in England. Read the full story: Vietnam will extend a strict lockdown in Ho Chi Minh City until 1 August, its health ministry said on Friday, as the south-east Asian country battles one of its most challenging and unpredictable Covid-19 outbreaks to date. After successfully containing the virus for much of the pandemic, Vietnam has been facing a complicated outbreak of the virus, with southern business hub Ho Chi Minh City and surrounding provinces accounting for most new infections, Reuters reports. Ho Chi Minh City’s governing body said in a statement: Due to the rapid and unpredictable nature of the Delta variant and in order to protect people and minimise deaths, city authorities have decided to strengthen a number of measures to control the outbreak. The number of services permitted to operate during the lockdown will be reduced, the health ministry said, citing Duong Anh Duc, deputy chairman of Ho Chi Minh City. The current measures, which had been in place since July 9, include a stay-home order, a ban on gatherings larger than two people and the suspension of public transport services. Banking and securities services in the city will be reduced to minimal levels, while unnecessary construction projects will be suspended, the ministry said in a statement. A week-long disinfection spray in high-risk Covid-19 areas also has started, it added. Since late April, when the current outbreak began, Vietnam has imposed restrictions on movement in about one third of its 63 cities and provinces, including in the capital Hanoi. The Ministry of Health reported a record 7,307 cases on Friday, raising Vietnam’s overall caseload to 81,678, with 370 deaths. Ho Chi Minh City accounts for around 60% of total cases. City authorities have asked Vietnam’s prime minister for more personnel to help combat the current outbreak, the health ministry said in a Facebook post on Friday. Vietnam, which has heavily relied on AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, is trying to accelerate its inoculation programme. The country received 1.2m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine on Friday, the largest shipment of its procurement so far. Around 4.4 million doses have been administered in the country, but fewer than 335,000 people have been fully vaccinated, official data showed. Europe’s medicines regulator on Friday recommended approving the use of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine in 12- to 17-year-olds, paving the way for it to become the second shot sanctioned for adolescent use in the EU, Reuters reports. The use of the vaccine, branded Spikevax, will be the same in children from 12 to 17 years as in people aged 18 and above, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said. New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern has announced the country is pausing quarantine-free travel from Australia for at least eight weeks, due to Covid outbreaks in the neighbouring island. This is not a decision we have taken lightly but it is, we believe, the right one. This will mean many people will find themselves for a time once more separated from friends and families in Australia, and I know this announcement will be a disappointment to them. The New York Times reports that the travel bubble was a relative rarity in Asia, where many countries have closed their borders during the pandemic. It is the first time New Zealand has taken this course of action – which will come into force at 11.59pm local time tonight – since the bubble was introduced in April, though travel from New Zealand to Australia would not be affected by the change. Australia’s most populous state has declared a “national emergency” as it struggles to contain a record-breaking surge of the Delta variant of Covid-19 amid a lockdown affecting half the country. The state of New South Wales announced 136 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 on Friday, with continued community transmission among essential workers, including in supermarkets and pharmacies. More than a year after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, NSW has broken records for daily case numbers on consecutive days, and the city of Sydney is under the strictest lockdown measures it has ever experienced. More than 13 million Australians – approximately half the country’s population – are under some form of lockdown or restriction, including the states of Victoria and South Australia. Pfizer and BioNTech have said the US government has purchased 200m additional doses of their vaccine and had the option to buy an updated version of the vaccine targeting new variants of the virus. The announcement brings the total number of the doses to be supplied to the US – which has stepped up its donations abroad amid slowing demand at home – to 500m, out of which roughly 208m doses have already been delivered, according to latest government data. Reuters reports that Pfizer last year signed the deal with the US government for 100m doses of the vaccine for nearly $2bn, with an option to buy 500m more doses. A majority of the new doses will be supplied by the end of the year, and the remaining 90m will be delivered by 30 April next year, the companies said. Pfizer earlier this month said the companies plan to seek authorisation from US and European regulators for a booster dose of their Covid-19 vaccine, though officials do not appear keen. The row over American funding of potentially risky research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology is deepening, after Dr Anthony Fauci, the US infectious diseases chief, restated his denial this week that it bankrolled gain of function experiments. But, in a meaty fact check, the BBC quotes Prof Richard Ebright, of Rutgers University, who said that two published academic studies by the Chinese institute – one from 2015 (written with the University of North Carolina), and another from 2017 – included gain of function research. He said it showed new viruses – that did not already exist naturally – were created, and these “risked creating new potential pathogens” that were more infectious. “The research in both papers was gain-of-function research”, he told the BBC. Ebright added that it met the definition of such research outlined in 2014 when the US government paused funding due to biosafety concerns. Scientists have justified the potential risks of such research since it can help prepare for future outbreaks and pandemics by understanding how viruses evolve. The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the US government’s National Institutes of Health (NIH), awarded a grant of $3.7m to the US-based EcoHealth Alliance, $600,000 of which was given to the WIV, to look into possible coronaviruses from bats. But Fauci told a Senate hearing the research in question “has been evaluated multiple times by qualified people to not fall under the gain-of-function definition”. Dr Ralph Baric from the University of North Carolina – who collaborated on the 2015 research on bat viruses with the WIV – has told the Washington Post that the work was deemed by the NIH and his university’s biosafety committee to not be gain of function. The BBC reports that he also said none of the viruses subject of the 2015 study are related to the pandemic-causing Sars-Cov-2. Biologist Alina Chan at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard has pointed to issues with the wording of the US government’s wording on the funding parameters (amid the pause in 2014), which she said implied that while the permitted research may not intend to produce gain of function, that could be the end result of it. Rebecca Moritz ,of Colorado State University, told the BBC: “There is not always consensus [on gain of function research] even amongst experts, and institutions interpret and apply policy differently.” An Australian clothing brand has been fined AUS$5m for claiming its garments stop the spread of Covid. The BBC reports that Lorna Jane advertised that its clothes used “a groundbreaking technology” called LJ Shield to prevent the “transferal of all pathogens”. But a judge ruled that the claim was “exploitative, predatory and potentially dangerous” after the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) took legal action. Accepting the ruling, the company said it had been misled by a supplier. “A trusted supplier sold us a product that did not perform as promised,” said chief executive Bill Clarkson. “They led us to believe the technology behind LJ Shield was being sold elsewhere in Australia, the USA, China, and Taiwan and that it was both anti-bacterial and anti-viral. We believed we were passing on a benefit to our customers.” The federal court judge found that Lorna Jane “represented to consumers that it had a reasonable scientific or technological basis” to make its claims when in fact it had none, the BBC reports. Rod Sims, the chairman of the ACCC, said: “This was dreadful conduct as it involved making serious claims regarding public health when there was no basis for them. The whole marketing campaign was based upon consumers’ desire for greater protection against the global pandemic.” It has gone from harmless pastime to one of the most dangerous activities during Covid, but with restrictions in England now lifted, sitting in a small enclosed space with friends belting out favourite songs – otherwise known as karaoke – is taking off and people are returning in droves. Lucky Voice, which has karaoke rooms in London and Brighton, said it was “jampacked” over the summer. “We’re really hoping to go from strength to strength over the summer, the pent-up demand that we were hoping for is definitely there,” said the managing director, Charlie Elek. A plastic bag factory outside San Francisco is limiting planned pay rises to unvaccinated workers to 1.5%, while those who have been jabbed will receive a 3% rise. “With the Delta variant spreading quickly and likely to hit the unvaccinated here, and thus put everyone at risk for sickness, it likely is my last best shot to get people jabbed,” said Kevin Kelly, the chief executive of Emerald Packaging. The US vaccination campaign has been limping along at a daily pace of just over 500,000 since the 4 July holiday. At the current pace, most models show the country would not reach the lowest threshold for herd immunity, of about 70%, until late this year, Reuters reports. Now, with those government efforts having stalled, companies like Kelly’s have taken on the task of cajoling reluctant workers to get the vaccine. German carmaker Daimler AG has opened pop-up vaccine clinics at its larger US sites and adjusted work schedules so that employees, and in many cases their dependents, can get shots conveniently. Deere &amp; Co, the Illinois-based tractor maker, said it has no requirements that workers get the shots. But employees, as well as suppliers and other visitors to its locations, who are not vaccinated must continue to wear masks – although the jabs do not prevent people from contracting and transmitting the virus. Croatia has decided to tighten controls against the spread of Covid-19 along its Adriatic coast in an effort to safeguard its summer tourist season, interior minister Davor Bozinovic has said. “Any public gathering of more than 50 people will be forbidden from next week,” said Davor Bozinovic, who is also head of the national civil protection directorate. Reuters reports that the exception will be gatherings of up to 1,000 people, such as for concerts which would require all participants to show a certificate that they are either vaccinated, tested negative for the virus, or have recovered from the respiratory disease. “Similarly, anyone who wants to attend any sports event will have to meet those requirements,” he said. Croatia, with its stunning, rugged Dalmatian coast and chains of islands, sweeping beaches, limpid seas and historic Venetian towns including Dubrovnik, is popular with holidaymakers from Italy, Germany, Austria and central and eastern Europe. Tourism accounts for 20% of Croatia’s gross domestic product. Despite continued travel obstacles caused by the coronavirus pandemic, officials hope this year’s season, now nearing its peak period, can raise 70% of revenues seen in 2019. In a further move to protect the tourist season, Croatia this week introduced obligatory tests for arrivals from Britain, Russia and Cyprus regardless of their vaccination status. Wearing face masks remains obligatory in indoor public places and in public transport. The British Olympic Association is resigned to the fact that six Team GB athletes will spend 14 days in enforced quarantine after failing in its attempts to spring them out. Hugh Robertson, the BOA chair, said they had been working “on an hourly basis” to help the athletes in Yokohama, as well as four staff members who were also pinged as close contacts of a passenger with Covid on their flight to Japan. However Robertson conceded they were now “right up against it”. All the athletes and staff members involved have tested negative for the virus. We’ve tried the various committees, we’ve tried direct approaches, we’ve been at it through the IOC. I’d be lying if I said at the moment that we’re very confident we’re going to get a whole lot of movement. But at least they can train, and at least we have a roadmap to get them to the start line in order to compete at their events. I think where we have succeeded in the things we’ve managed to do – where some others haven’t – is to get a concession from the local authority in Yokohama that, even though they are in quarantine, they can actually train. There are athletes around the world who are just sitting in their hotel rooms. At least ours can get out. They can train. All countries must work together to investigate the origin of the coronavirus that sparked the pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said, a day after China rejected the proposed scope of a second phase. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic, asked about China’s rejection, told a UN briefing in Geneva: This is not about politics, it’s not about a blame game. It is about basically a requirement we all have to try to understand how the pathogen came into the human population. In this sense, countries really have the responsibility to work together and to work with WHO in a spirit of partnership. Yesterday the White House said China’s decision to reject the WHO plan for a second phase which would have a greater focus on a possible lab leak was “irresponsible and dangerous”. Previously considered a crackpot conspiracy theory that was not permitted to be discussed on Facebook, there is growing pressure on China to investigate the part US-funded Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which was working with coronaviruses; though most scientists still believe a zoonotic origin remains a more likely explanation. State-backed Chinese newspaper Global Times cites officials claiming that no WIV staff have been infected with Covid-19, and that WIV has no viruses that can directly infect human beings. No pathogen leakage or human infection has occurred in Wuhan’s P4 lab since it was put into operation in 2018, Yuan Zhiming, director of China’s National Biosafety Laboratory and professor at the WIV, said. Liang Wannian, team leader of the Chinese side of the WHO-China joint team on Covid-19’s origins, said at a briefing the lab-leak theory was highly unlikely. “If some countries believe that further investigation in this area should be carried out, then the investigations should be conducted in labs that have not yet been inspected,” Liang said. AFP has this dispatch from Bangkok, Thailand, where there is a night-time curfew and a ban on gatherings as the kingdom undergoes its worst stretch of the pandemic yet. Tuk-tuks and garishly coloured taxis that once weaved through chaotic Bangkok traffic are sitting idle in storage as a fresh coronavirus surge scuttles hopes of relief for Thailand’s tourism-dependent economy. Bangkok is subject to a night-time curfew and a ban on gatherings as authorities advise residents of the capital to stay home. “Tourists, people going to work, shopping, hanging out with friends – these are our customers but they’ve all vanished,” said taxi driver Anuchit Surasit. The 47-year-old had just dropped off his vehicle at a garage in western Bangkok, parking it among hundreds of other cabs on forced sabbatical. While he loves being a cabbie, Anuchit said he has watched his income drop to just 300 baht ($9) a day. Tourism accounts for a fifth of Thailand’s economy, which is suffering its worst crash since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The kingdom has seen a bare fraction of the 40 million tourists forecast to visit last year, before the pandemic began. Around 100,000 people working in Thailand’s transport sector are now unemployed and more than half of metropolitan Bangkok’s taxi fleet is off the road, Thai Transportation Operators Association president Wasuchet Sophonsathien told AFP. Tuk-tuk motortaxis – once a ubiquitous sight around Bangkok’s historic neighbourhoods and a favourite transport mode of foreign travellers – have meanwhile largely disappeared from roads. “I feel hopeless but I still have to fight for the survival of my family,” said 57-year-old driver Somsak Boontook. Wichai Supattranon, who started a transport business with his mother four decades ago and now owns a fleet of 60 furloughed tuk-tuks, said: “The only solution I can see now is for the government to move forward and reopen the country as soon as possible.” Tanzania’s government said it is preparing to roll out vaccinations against Covid-19, in a radical departure from the policies of the country’s former Covid-sceptic leader, who died in March. Health minister Dorothy Gwajima said the government was also banning all “unnecessary gatherings” to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Tanzania’s late leader John Magufuli had downplayed the gravity of the pandemic and shunned masks for the healing power of prayer, even as neighbouring countries shut their borders and imposed curfews and lockdowns, AFP reports. The government stopped releasing Covid-19 data in April 2020, with Magufuli saying that issuing the figures was scaring people and describing vaccines as “dangerous”. Gwajima said Tanzania had 682 Covid patients as of 21 July. When the government stopped releasing the figures, it had reported 509 cases and 16 deaths. Like many other African countries, the scale of the pandemic appears much less severe than in the global north. Since Magufuli’s death in March, his successor Samia Suluhu Hassan has taken a different approach more aligned with the international consensus. Gwajima, who under Magufuli promoted a vegetable smoothie and other purported natural cures to ward off Covid, said vaccines would start being administered soon for free to those who want them, but did not specify a date. “I call upon all citizens to get prepared for vaccination,” she said. Tanzania, Eritrea and Burundi are the only countries on the continent yet to begin vaccinating their citizens against Covid-19, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. The government says Magufuli, nicknamed the “Bulldozer” for his uncompromising leadership style, died of a heart condition after a mysterious three-week absence. Hello and greetings to everyone reading, wherever you are in the world. Mattha Busby here to take you through the next few hours of global Covid developments. Thanks to my colleague Miranda Bryant for covering the blog up until now. Please feel free to drop me a line on Twitter or message me via email (mattha.busby.freelance@guardian.co.uk) with any tips or thoughts on our coverage. Scott Morrison was advised last week by Australia’s chief medical officer that anyone who attends his Canberra residence should be vaccinated against Covid-19 and take daily saliva tests – advice that was not followed in relation to journalists at recent press conferences. On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, the prime minister held press conferences outside the Lodge, where he is quarantining after returning to Canberra from Sydney. The press conferences were attended by reporters who were required to wear masks and check in using QR codes to reduce risk – but not all were fully vaccinated and none had been required to undertake saliva testing. In Indonesia, my colleagues Gemma Holliani Cahya in Jakarta and Rebecca Ratcliffe report that Scenes that have for months haunted hospitals across Java island are appearing across the country, as the Delta variant spreads to new provinces, causing shortages of beds and oxygen. Images have circulated on social media of overstretched hospitals in both Papua and Kalimantan. One video shows a patient lying inside an ambulance, with two of his relatives sitting next to him. “The people need help. [I] have brought them to hospitals but all of them rejected us. [The hospitals] said there is no oxygen. How come the government can’t provide oxygen?” the ambulance driver, who recorded the video, can be heard saying. When Klinger Duarte Rodrigues set off for his coronavirus shot last weekend he did so dressed as a South American snake. “A sucuri,” he said, using the indigenous name for the Amazonian water boa whose skin he borrowed for his first dose of AstraZeneca. The outfit – footage of which went immediately viral on social media – was not merely a fashion statement: it was a protest against the Brazilian government’s woeful handling of a Covid outbreak that has killed more than 545,000 citizens, among them Rodrigues’s brother-in-law. “If the government had been quicker to acquire vaccines, many people would still be with us,” said the environmentalist and internet influencer, who attached a placard to his snake costume calling for the impeachment of Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro. Rodrigues’s protest was not the only act of reptilian resistance documented as Brazilians have headed out for their jabs – and the explanation for their choice of clothing is the president himself. Indonesia has reported a record 1,566 Covid deaths - the country’s highest daily toll to date. It also recorded 49,071 new coronavirus infections. Russia has promised to resolve delays in deliveries of Sputnik V to Argentina after the South American country complained that it was holding back its vaccination campaign. The Philippines is to suspend travel from Malaysia and Thailand and tighten coronavirus restrictions in Manila – including banning children from going out – in a bid to prevent Delta’s spread. Malaysia’s health ministry today reported 15,573 new coronavirus cases – the country’s highest daily cases since the start of the pandemic. The latest figure brings the total number of cases for Malaysia to 980,941. As the Olympic Games kicked off today, Tokyo reported 1,359 new Covid cases as the city battles a wave of infection. It comes after the city yesterday reported 1,979 cases – its highest number of cases since January. UK government scientific adviser Jeremy Farrar has said Covid is an endemic infection now and believes it is “never going to go away”. Farrar, a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and director of the Wellcome Trust, said people are “going to have to learn to live with it”. The Police Federation of England and Wales has said they have “no confidence” in home secretary Priti Patel after they were refused a pay rise following the pandemic. It has asked for a 3% increase – which it said would come at a cost of £138m. In England, the environment secretary, George Eustice, has said that more than 10,000 food production workers will be exempt from self-isolation rules in a bid to combat “pingdemic” food shortages. He said the government has identified close to 500 key sites – including about 170 supermarket depots plus other “key manufacturers” - that will be able to use the scheme, which he said would cover “well over 10,000 people”. That’s it from me for today. Handing over now to my colleague Mattha Busby. Thanks for reading! Asked about China’s rejection of a second virus investigation, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said that countries have a “responsibility to work together and with WHO,” reports Reuters. Indonesia has reported a record 1,566 Covid deaths - the country’s highest daily toll to date. It also recorded 49,071 new coronavirus infections. The latest figures bring the total number of deaths to 80,598 and overall cases to 3,082,410. Yesterday, Gemma Holliani Cahya reported from Jakarta on the devastating impact coronavirus restrictions have had on people living in poverty: Russia has promised to resolve delays in deliveries of Sputnik V to Argentina after the South American country complained that it was holding back its vaccination campaign. The Kremlin said it would fix the issue but that its first priority was to meet demand at home, where deaths and infections are high. A study suggests that the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine provides poor protection from coronavirus for the elderly. A survey of the blood samples of 450 people in Hungary who were at least two weeks on from their second dose of the vaccine found that 90% of those under 50 developed antibodies, while 50% of those aged 80-plus didn’t have any. Here’s more from the Associated Press: The study by two Hungarian researchers was posted online this week but not yet reviewed by other scientists. Three outside experts said they had no problems with the methodology of the study of the vaccine developed by Sinopharm’s Beijing Institute of Biological Products. “This is very, very worrying that these people, who are high-risk, have a poor antibody response,” said Jin Dong-yan, a Hong Kong University virologist who was not affiliated with the study. Antibody levels are not a direct measure of how protected a person is from COVID-19, but there is growing evidence that they are a good proxy. One expert cautioned that the choice of test kits could have limited the accuracy of the measurements. Still, the study’s findings have value and are the first public, scientific attempt to analyze the effect of the Sinopharm vaccine in the elderly, said Wang Chenguang, a former professor at Peking Union Medical College and an immunology expert. China’s National Health Commission declined to comment on the study, saying it would only respond to studies by governments or major research institutions. For more UK-focused coronavirus news and politics, follow Andrew Sparrow’s blog, which is now up and running: The Philippines is to suspend travel from Malaysia and Thailand and tighten coronavirus restrictions in Manila – including banning children from going out – in a bid to prevent Delta’s spread. A spokesperson for president Rodrigo Duterte said today that the travel restriction will go into effect on Sunday and remain in place until the end of the month, reports Reuters. The capital region, home to 16 cities and over 13m people, and four provinces have also been placed under tighter restrictions – including a ban on children aged 5-17 leaving the house – until the end of the month. Other restrictions include bans on indoor sports and conference venues, indoor tourist attractions and gyms and reduced capacity at restaurants. Spokesperson Harry Roque said: “This action is undertaken to prevent the further spread and community transmission of Covid-19 variants in the Philippines.” The Philippines has previously issued bans on travellers from eight counties including India and Indonesia. The Philippines has recorded 47 cases of the Delta variant – eight of which are active – and three deaths. Overall nearly 1.54 million infections and close to 27,000 deaths have been recorded – the second-highest numbers in south-east Asia. Russia today reported 23,811 new Covid cases and 795 deaths. The latest figures bring the overall total cases to 6,078,522 and the death toll to 152,296. The country is facing a surge in cases which authorities have attributed to the Delta variant and slow vaccination rate. Malaysia’s health ministry today reported 15,573 new coronavirus cases – the country’s highest daily cases since the start of the pandemic. The latest figure brings the total number of cases for Malaysia to 980,941. As the Olympic Games kicked off today, Tokyo reported 1,359 new Covid cases as the city battles a wave of infection. It comes after the city yesterday reported 1,979 cases – its highest number of cases since January. A French government scientific adviser has said normal pre-pandemic life may not resume until next year or even the year after. Prof Jean-François Delfaissy told BFM TV today France could reach around 50,000 new Covid cases per day by the beginning of next month. It comes after he said yesterday that the fourth wave of infections in the country is expected to hit hospitals in the second half of August. More from UK government scientific adviser Jeremy Farrar (see 08:10), who said there is “overwhelming” evidence that coronavirus jumped from animals to humans in China but that he “cannot completely rule out” that it leaked from a Wuhan lab. The member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: My personal view is the overwhelming scientific evidence, consistent with many previous infections that came from animals, is this arose from the animal kingdom, came across to the human population in 2019 and, as the virus adapted to humans, it led to the pandemic. That is where the wealth and weight of the scientific evidence currently sits, but you cannot completely rule out a laboratory accident, and we need to know which of those two things it is. America’s No 2 diplomat has told of her concerns for North Koreans who are facing food shortages as a result of the pandemic. The Associated Press reports that US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman told reporters in Seoul: “We all feel for the people of the DPRK, who are indeed facing all the most difficult circumstances given the pandemic, and what it means as well for their food security.” It comes after the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, recently warned of a “tense” food situation and admitted his country faces its “worst ever” crisis. Latitude, the first music festival to take place since the lifting of England’s lockdown restrictions, kicks off today. As a government test event, festivalgoers had to present either a negative test or proof of full vaccination or immunity to enter. In England, Ian Wright, chief executive of the food and drink federation, has praised the new government self-isolation exemption plans for food workers saying they have acted “expeditiously”. But Luke Garnsworthy, owner of Crockers restaurants in Henley and Tring, which was not covered by the exemption, said it was “ridiculous”. He said the “stupid” government policy “traps people in their homes” even if they test negative. UK government scientific adviser Jeremy Farrar has said Covid is an endemic infection now and believes it is “never going to go away”. Farrar, a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and director of the Wellcome Trust, told BBC Radio 4’s Today that people are “going to have to learn to live with it”, but that the level of transmission, long Covid and disruption of education doesn’t have to continue. He said the UK “remains very vulnerable” to variants in other parts of the world, which could cause problems in the way that Delta has done. India has recorded 35,342 new cases – bringing the official total to 31.29 million. The death toll stands at 419,470, the health ministry said, but the true figure is believed to be considerably higher, potentially as high as 4.7 million. In the UK, the Police Federation of England and Wales has said they have “no confidence” in the home secretary after they were refused a pay rise following the pandemic. National chair John Apter, told Sky News that the federation’s unanimous decision puts Priti Patel on notice that they are “not messing about”. it has asked for a 3% increase – which it said would come at a cost of £138m. More on England, the environment secretary, George Eustice, said ministers are “never going to take risks with our food supply”. He said there would be two different isolation exemption schemes: one for the food sector, which would mean all employees at identified sites would be automatically included, and another for other key industries. He told Sky News: For sectors like the nuclear power industry, the rail network, the water industry, where you have a small number of highly skilled professionals that you need to ensure can come to work, we’re having an exemption for them as well … but it’s quite a narrow exemption. For the food sector, it’s very different. This is quite a big exemption. In England, the environment secretary, George Eustice, has said that more than 10,000 food production workers will be exempt from self-isolation rules in a bid to combat “pingdemic” food shortages. He told Sky News that the government has identified close to 500 key sites – including about 170 supermarket depots plus other “key manufacturers” - that will be able to use the scheme, which he said would cover “well over 10,000 people”. He said the government has adopted this approach with the food sector but is keeping everything under review. They are broadly maintaining isolation rules to “try to dampen the spread” to try to keep the peak of hospitalisations as low as possible but that he is confident the country has passed the peak of infection. Until infections dip downwards he said it would be “premature” to change rules. Hi, I’m taking over the blog now from Helen. Please get in touch with any tips or suggestions: miranda.bryant@guardian.co.uk Vaccinations are beginning to rise in some states where Covid cases are soaring, White House officials said Thursday in a sign that the summer surge is getting the attention of vaccine-hesitant Americans as hospitals in the south are being overrun with patients. Coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients told reporters that several states with the highest proportions of new infections have seen residents get vaccinated at higher rates than the nation as a whole. Officials cited Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri and Nevada as examples. “The fourth surge is real, and the numbers are quite frightening at the moment,” the governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said on a New Orleans radio show. Edwards, a Democrat, added: “There’s no doubt that we are going in the wrong direction, and we’re going there in a hurry.” Louisiana, for example, reported 2,843 new cases Thursday, a day after reporting 5,388 – the third-highest level since the pandemic began. Hospitalisations are up steeply in the last month, from 242 on 19 June to 913 in the latest report. Fifteen new deaths were reported Thursday. Just 36% of Louisiana’s population is fully vaccinated, state health department data shows. Nationally, 56.3% of Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Warner Thomas, president and CEO of the Ochsner Health system serving Louisiana and Mississippi, said the system had seen a 10% to 15% increase in people seeking vaccination over the past week or two. Taiwan will ease its Covid restrictions from next week though some will remain in place, the government said on Friday, with rapidly falling case numbers giving authorities confidence to further lower the alert level. Reuters: Taiwan implemented restrictions on gatherings, including closing entertainment venues and limiting restaurants to take-out service, in mid-May following a spike in domestic cases after months of no or few cases apart from imported ones. While some of those curbs were eased this month, the so-called level 3 alert has been in force and is due to end on 26 July. Premier Su Tseng-chang said the alert would be lowered to level 2 from Tuesday. “The domestic epidemic has gradually stabilized and is heading towards a good direction,” Su said. “Citizens should still strictly follow all pandemic prevention guidance to guard this hard-earned achievement after restrictions are relaxed.” The health ministry will announce details of the new guidance later on Friday, he said. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. Taiwan will ease its Covid restrictions from next week though some will remain in place, the government said on Friday, with rapidly falling case numbers giving authorities confidence to further lower the alert level. Meanwhile in the US, vaccinations are beginning to rise in some states where cases are soaring, White House officials said Thursday, in a sign that the summer surge is getting the attention of vaccine-hesitant Americans as hospitals in the South are being overrun with patients. Here are the other key recent developments: Workers from 16 key services including health, transport and energy will not have to isolate after being pinged by the NHS Covid app, as it was revealed that more than 600,000 people in England and Wales were sent self-isolation alerts last week. Advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will consider evidence suggesting that a booster dose of Covid vaccines could increase protection among people with compromised immune systems. Last week, Israel began administering third doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to immunocompromised people. Some experts believe the CDC is nearing a similar recommendation in the US. Chile announced that its citizens and foreign residents would be allowed to travel outside the country if they were fully inoculated against coronavirus, a fresh perk for Chileans participating in one of the world’s fastest vaccination campaigns. The White House said China’s decision to reject a World Health Organization plan for a second phase of an investigation into the origin of the coronavirus which would have a greater focus on a possible lab leak was “irresponsible and dangerous”. The EU has said that 200 million Europeans had been fully vaccinated, more than half of the adult population but still short of a 70% target set for the summer. Tax raids were carried out on the offices of one of India’s most popular newspapers, after months of critical coverage of the government’s handling of the pandemic. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid jab is much less effective in mitigating the symptoms of those with the Delta or Lambda variants than against the original virus strain, a new study suggested. Peruvian police dismantled an alleged criminal ring that had charged as much as $21,000 per bed for seriously ill Covid-19 patients in a state-run hospital. Authorities arrested nine people in an early morning raid on Wednesday, including the administrators of Lima’s Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen public hospital, according to reports. German pharmacies stopped issuing digital Covid-19 vaccination certificates after hackers created passes from fake outlets, the industry association said. The German Pharmacists’ Association said hackers had managed to produce two vaccination certificates by accessing the portal and making up pharmacy owner identities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2019/jun/11/robots-and-reconstruction-can-tokyo-2020-top-1964s-olympic-legacy","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2019-06-10T20:00:12Z","webTitle":"Reconstruction and robots: can Tokyo 2020 live up to 1964’s Olympic legacy?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/11/robots-and-reconstruction-can-tokyo-2020-top-1964s-olympic-legacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2019/jun/11/robots-and-reconstruction-can-tokyo-2020-top-1964s-olympic-legacy","fields":{"headline":"Reconstruction and robots: can Tokyo 2020 live up to 1964’s Olympic legacy?","bodyText":"There is a simple riposte to anyone who doubts an Olympics can truly transform a city: Tokyo. When Japan’s capital first won the right to host the Games, in 1959, it suffered from a desperate shortage of housing and functional infrastructure – and the lack of flush toilets meant most waste had to be vacuumed daily out of cesspits underneath buildings by “honey wagon” trucks. But within five years Japan’s capital had undergone such a metamorphosis that visitors to the 1964 Olympics responded with stunned awe. “Out of the jungle of concrete mixers, mud and timber that has been Tokyo for years, the city has emerged, as from a chrysalis, to stand glitteringly ready for the Olympics,” the Times’ correspondent swooned, citing a long list of buildings and accomplishments “all blurring into a neon haze … that will convince the new arrival he has come upon a mirage”. But Tokyo’s makeover was real. There were 100km of freshly laid highways, a new sewage system, new luxury hotels and 21km of monorail from the new international airport to downtown. Meanwhile, the new Tokaido Shinkansen bullet train blasted to Kyoto and back at world-record speed, and startlingly modernist arenas such as the Tokyo metropolitan gymnasium, which was shaped like a flying saucer, only added to the futuristic wonderland vibe. There were also technological innovations. Computers were used for the first time at an Olympics, along with timing devices that could separate competitors to one-hundredth of a second. And the Syncom III satellite, combined with cutting-edge Japanese technology, enabled live TV pictures to be beamed across the globe – another first. No wonder it was hailed as the “science fiction” Olympics. Tokyo 1964 was, according to David Goldblatt in his excellent book The Games, “the single greatest act of collective reimagining in Japan’s postwar history”. And there was a clear message for the wider world too, reflected in the choice of Yoshinori Sakai, born in Hiroshima on the day the atomic bomb was dropped on the city, to light the Olympic flame. The 19-year-old athlete was not only a symbol of his country’s rebirth following the second world war – but also its hope for a brighter future. Such was the event’s success that it has set the bar dazzlingly high for Tokyo 2020. Every Olympian knows, after all, that while winning a gold medal is a formidable task, repeating the trick years later is tougher still. On the 24th floor of the Harumi Triton Y building, organisers finalising plans for next year’s Olympics and Paralympics say the world will see the “most innovative” Games in history. Not everyone, to put it mildly, is as upbeat. ‘At that point blood drained out of his face’ Shortly after Japan won the right to host the 2020 Games, the country’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, toured the Queen Elizabeth Park in Stratford, London, with Sebastian Coe, who had steered the hugely successful 2012 Olympics. There was only one thing on Abe’s mind: money. “The only question he kept asking was: ‘How much was that? How much was that?’” Lord Coe recalls. “He loved the velodrome, which he thought was a beautiful building architecturally. I also explained the difficulties we had with the Olympic Stadium because we couldn’t get football engaged and he said: ‘Oh yeah, I get that.’ “Then he pointed at the Aquatics Centre and said: ‘And that one?’ I told him that was the most expensive and that Zaha Hadid had designed it. At that point blood drained out of his face and he said: ‘She’s done our new Olympic stadium.’” By 2015 Hadid’s plans for the stadium, which had spiralled to £1.3bn, had been cancelled – and a new design by Kengo Kuma, blending steel and layers of latticed larch wood and intended to “restore the link that Tokyo lost with nature”, chosen instead. But while it is hundreds of millions of pounds cheaper, the Olympics and Paralympics remain a money pit. Last year Japanese government auditors predicted the Games would cost around £19.5bn – close to four times more than originally forecast in 2013. To make matters worse, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, Tsunekazu Takeda, was forced to step down in March following corruption revelations about the bid, first revealed by the Guardian in 2016. Tokyo might be about to throw the greatest sporting party of them all. But, some of its residents ask, at what cost? ‘It is important to showcase our robot technology’ So what will Japan get for its investment next summer, aside from eight shiny new arenas? In their office in Tokyo’s bay area, organisers stress that the Olympics and Paralympics will be “a catalyst for social change” – particularly by improving attitudes and facilities towards disabled people and opening up the country more. That makes sense. Japan remains the world’s third largest economy, but that position is in jeopardy due to a growing shortage of workers and an ageing population. Another key aim for Tokyo 2020 is for it to be the “recovery and reconstruction Games”, following the Tohoku disaster in 2011, when an earthquake and tsunami led to over 10,000 deaths and a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. “Baseball and softball matches will be held in the disaster-affected areas,” says Masa Takaya, spokesman for the Tokyo 2020 organisers, “and restore vitality through the power of sport.” But these Games will be more about hearts and minds than bricks and mortar. “Tokyo 2020 is focusing more on the softer legacy,” says Takaya. “Of course we have a similar spirit as 1964 by leaving new sporting facilities. But we are even more keen to leave an intangible legacy for future generations, who will have a first-hand experience of the Games with a massive number of people with different backgrounds, religions and languages coming together in one place.” Some of the 1964 playbook will be dusted off, with Japan keen to show it still leads the world in tech. Toyota not only plans to showcase its driverless cars at the Games but has also designed robots for the new Olympic stadium that, among other things, can take – and then bring – food and drinks orders to spectators using wheelchairs. Panasonic, meanwhile, has created motor-assisted power suits to allow people to carry heavy luggage with ease. And Aruze Gaming’s Arisa – a sharply dressed six-foot robot that can show passengers the way to toilets and lockers, offer directions and recommend tourist attractions, in Japanese, English, Chinese and Korean – was tested at two metro stations earlier this year. “We are still discussing what sort of other robots can we use for the Games operations,” says Takaya. “It is important to showcase our robot technology.” ‘Tourists might enjoy it … but for citizens it will be hellish’ It certainly sounds appetising enough. But in a coffee shop near Yoyogi Park, Misako Ichimura and Kumiko Suto of the Hangorin no Kai (No Olympics 2020) activist group, paint a much bleaker picture of the Games’ impact. Among their many concerns, they claim that the construction of the new national stadium, along with other “upgrading” projects, has led to homeless people in areas like Shibuya and Shinjuku being forcibly removed from parks and streets. They also express dismay that nearly 300 residents were evicted from 10 public housing projects near the stadium to make way for luxury buildings. “Many of these people were elderly residents living alone, and around 10 passed away just before or soon after their cruel removal from their homes,” says Ichimura. “Public housing is being destroyed in favour of high-end housing, but no new projects are going up to offset these displaced people. To make matters worse, the government has also pushed the homeless tent communities out of Meiji Park.” Activists also have concerns about health and safety at construction sites that were backed up by The Dark Side of the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics, a recent report by the global trade union federation Building and Wood Workers’ International. It documents how low pay, overwork and poor access to grievance procedures have created a “culture of fear” among construction workers – and says some workers have been required to work up to 28 days in a row on Olympic projects. There are unwelcome echoes of the past here. Before Tokyo 1964, safety standards were so low that “that there were more than 100 deaths and 2,000 injuries on Olympic-related projects”, according to Goldblatt, while the beggars and vagrants who made their homes in Ueno Park were also swept aside. Meanwhile, Ichimura says many residents are dreading next summer. “Schools and other events are being cancelled or having altered schedules,” she says, “and the already difficult summertime transportation will be much more crowded and hot. Tourists might enjoy a happy and fun experience but for citizens it will be hellish.” Not all criticism of the Games comes from leftwing social activists. Makoto Yokohari, a professor at the department of urban engineering at the University of Tokyo, says that while he agrees that the Games needs to promote soft legacies, he hasn’t seen any sign of them yet. “The Olympics may merely be a snapshot event which may become like an illusion within a couple of years,” he says. His criticisms carry weight given he serves on the urban planning and sustainability panel as a part of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics/Paralympics Organising Committee. “I’m afraid my thoughts are shared by most members,” he says. Meanwhile, the respected architect Hiroshi Ota has another criticism: Tokyo 2020 is not daring enough compared with 1964, when buildings such as Kenzo Tange’s Yoyogi gym were immediately seen as design masterpieces. As the Times put it at the time: “The arenas have approached new heights of architectural imagination and efficiency. In the the press room journalists look over blankly over their typewriters at each other. They still feel stunned as they try to pay tribute.” That, says Ota, will not be happening in 2020. “I am not optimistic,” he says. “Most of the design for the new venues were chosen in closed competition and, more generally, I really think Tokyo has missed the chance to include people in urban planning and regeneration.” Rising temperatures There is, however, one thing on which everyone agrees: the potential for Tokyo to be unbearably hot next July and August. The city’s governor, Yuriko Koike, concedes it is the one thing that keeps her up at night, saying: “Obviously climate change is a global issue, and it needs to be tackled globally, but the possibility of extreme temperatures in 2020 is a concern for me.” Her fears are well-founded. Last year Japan suffered from a month-long heatwave that saw temperatures peak at 41.1C – the highest ever recorded in the country – and caused the deaths of 138 people. However, Koike says the city has put in place a series of measures that will ensure the Games are bearable for athletes and spectators. “We are introducing heat-blocking road surfaces that can reduce the temperature of the road by eight degrees,” she says. “This is being installed in more than 100km in the city centre and this covers the marathon course. We have also have low-tech responses that have existed since the Edo period [1603-1868], such as water sprays.” Lord Coe is better placed than most to understand the journey cities go through after winning an Olympic bid. “There have been some challenges which I think Tokyo 2020 would be the first to admit,” he says. “There is permanently a dynamic of stress and tension in the buildup to a Games, and always four or five car crashes along the way. “The first big crunch comes with costs – because you always find stuff that you can’t possibly know when making a bid. Then you end up in that odd period where everything that is going wrong in the country is down to the Olympic Games. Yet eventually the excitement will start to build, especially when you start talking about torch relays and volunteers and things that engage the public.” Slowly these wheels are starting to turn. Last month nearly 5 million Japanese registered with the official ticketing site, more than double the initial target. And Koike insists she sees parallels with the London 2012 Games, where a modest build-up gave way to an outpouring of sustained joy and exhilaration for both the Olympics and the Paralympics. Tokyo 2020 may have suffered so far from the same vaguely underwhelming feeling that Japan itself has laboured under since the nation’s firework-like rise after the second world war. Yet come next July, Koike and millions of others will be watching a torchbearer climb the steps of the Olympic Stadium during the opening ceremony of the Games of the XXXII Olympiad – hoping that out of the darkness of the Tokyo sky comes raging and sustained illumination.

A dozen waders, perched on a rocky outcrop alongside the River Parrett, Somerset, at high tide, the water lapping at their feet. Most were turnstones, whose faded tortoiseshell plumage blended in surprisingly well with the rocks. A couple of dunlins, too, the ubiquitous small wader also in drab winter garb. And one other bird: plump, dark and fast asleep, head tucked beneath its feathers. Only an unusual plumage feature, the patch of yellow at the base of its bill, gave away its identity as a purple sandpiper. Though at this time of year slate-grey sandpiper might be more apt. Like the turnstone this is a bird of the far north, nesting on Arctic tundra, with a few pairs breeding in the Scottish Highlands. In winter they visit rocky coasts, almost always in the company of turnstones. This was only the second time I had seen one in Somerset; the first, a distant view from Hinkley Point nuclear power station. So even though the bird resolutely refused to wake up it was still a thrill to find it on my local patch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2019/jul/19/apollo-11-moon-landings-america-kathleen-alcott","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-19T06:00:48Z","webTitle":"The Apollo 11 moon landing was a distraction from America's problems","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/19/apollo-11-moon-landings-america-kathleen-alcott","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2019/jul/19/apollo-11-moon-landings-america-kathleen-alcott","fields":{"headline":"The Apollo 11 moon landing was a distraction from America's problems","bodyText":"On a bright winter morning in 2014, I pressed my head against the glass of my bedroom window and asked a man who had walked on the moon to tell me about the colors there. The black sky as seen from that planet, Alan Bean said, on the phone from Texas, was “glossy” like “patent leather”. It’s a recording I’ve listened to many times since, trying to understand the particular solitude of the mid-century astronaut, a person who could explore another world while his own spun in flames. As a girl raised in the fallout of liberal northern California’s anti-war revolution, men like him had always been objects of disdain to me – products of the military-industrial complex, upholders of white patriarchy – though somehow their achievements, the spacesuits and rockets, had escaped my scorn. But as research for my novel about the Apollo program deepened, a strange inversion was taking place: I was coming to revere the men who defined it, whose conservative politics I despised, but coming to question what they’d done, the celestial explorations I’d always assumed existed outside of politics. As though you could understand the unhappiness of a marriage by the details of an affair that went on outside of it, my understanding of the cultural revolution of the 60s and 70s had always come directly from the left-most, long-haired side of it, the stories and biases of my parents, people who had lived excessively and died young, their memories of that time never more than a happy tap of the ashtray away. They met as reporters at the Oakland Tribune in 1987, he a member of the Silent Generation conditioned to petrify his ideas in private, she a Boomer who lived like a slogan, bold and loud. She danced to the Dead, making strange shapes in the air, and he read about the nature of time, making trippy notes in the margins. Where her rebellion was public and bodily, his was existential and sub rosa, and the compound result, in their parenting, was that I was never asked to brush my hair, but always required to have an opinion. As a child, I felt an outsider’s near erotic longing at the idea of things like made beds and time-outs. The year I was seven, I sobbed at the incorrect clock on my mother’s kitchen wall – red and white and never changed for daylight savings – already beginning to believe that only the small organizations of life might protect us against the meaner waves of it. Twenty-odd years later, reading about the psychological testing Neil Armstrong endured in the brutalist Nasa complex in Houston, I felt a deep serenity. After passing into a pitch-dark room with the orders to come out in two hours, he sang to himself, a nursery rhyme on repeat – “there were 10 in the bed and the little one said: roll over, roll over” – and emerged only seconds off. In the image of that man in the quiet of that black, he is only a body, his mind secondary to his circumstances, and there was a peace in that I could not ignore, a dissolution of ego I had not expected to find on the political side of polished shoes and war mongering. Somehow, that story was an antidote to the pain I felt as the child of individualists, always loved but often forgotten, deciding to walk when the car was late or didn’t show, left alone in my afternoon and my thinking. My father would have called that time Armstrong spent in a room depersonalization, a favorite invective, an insult leveled by his hero Norman Mailer at the Apollo astronauts (“they were depersonalized to the extent they were true Christians,” he wrote in Life in 1967), but to me it seemed a great feat to forget yourself, an enlightenment purer than that possible on the LSD and psilocybin my parents espoused. Taking syringeful after syringeful of ice cold water in his ear, sitting in a room of 120F, doing all of it without so much as a raise in his heart rate: Armstrong had stepped into the void without help, had approached and chosen it. But if my childhood loved this part of the research – about the mental purity of the other side, the focus possible when the individual was done away with – my adulthood kept pulling on another thread. The deeper I looked, a sinister shadow followed the light of the program’s marvels: courting the descriptions of something called “earthshine”, the strange charred smells of lunar dust, the Astrud Gilberto cassette tapes and family photos brought to the moon, were machinations of war and cries of injustice. There was the fact that in 1962, the year he gave his famous address at Rice University and secured a blank check from Congress to land a man on the moon, Kennedy had already approved 3,205 American “advisers” to the government of South Vietnam, as well as the use of the dioxin Agent Orange. There was the fact that the brilliant rocket engineers whom that blank check paid were Nazis, Wernher von Braun and Arthur Rudolph, the project that showcased their talents the V-2 rocket that killed 30,000 – built by forced Jewish laborers from the concentration camp Mittelbau-Dora. No matter how I loved the image of the Apollo 11 launch – a million exultant people transforming the beaches, binoculars held aloft from yachts where they drank Chardonnay or trucks where they tailgated with Budweiser – there was the fact that the evening before, the civil rights leader Ralph Abernathy led a group of 500 activists behind mule-drawn carts to meet with Nasa’s deputy administrator, Thomas Paine. One fifth of the country was living without proper healthcare, food and shelter, Abernathy pointed out, an inordinate portion of them black. “I am here,” he said, “to demonstrate with poor people in a symbolic way against the tragic and inexcusable gulf that exists between America’s technological abilities and our social injustices.” The year before, he had held Martin Luther King Jr as he bled to death, and he must have wondered where that image fit in the minds of the audience. “Billions for space, the signs said. Pennies for the hungry.” A note I’d made, about a GI who confronted Neil Armstrong during a GSO tour – why, he wanted to know, was his country “so interested in the moon instead of the conflict in Vietnam” – grew different legs, walking across the page to affix itself to something Alan Bean had said: asked about how the Earth looked from the moon, he had two words: “Disappointingly small.” No more bread and circuses, went an anti-Apollo protest chant, referencing the Roman poet Juvenal, his polemic against the grain subsidy autocrats afforded the lower classes in an attempt to subdue them. Even if I set aside the issue of money – $24bn spent on the program, in 1973 currency, or roughly $150bn today – there was the purer question of American attention, how we guided it. In an era of limited airtime, was the color and sound spent on astronauts and their wives and children something like a crime? Was it agitprop, a western for the cold war audience that made no mention of certain earthly atrocities – of the black military companies who suffered gangrene for lack of the fresh socks their white peers received, of the systematic environmental devastation of a country smaller than California, of children killed and mutilated by teenagers? To say so would be easy, and you might mention the camp and artificiality shot through all things Apollo – the telescopic arm designed to hold up a flag in a place without wind, the golf ball Alan Shepard teed off the lunar surface, the basalt craters Nasa named the Sea of Fertility. In Kennedy’s address that made all that came possible, given 18 months after the early stain on his presidency that was the Bay of Pigs and five weeks shy of the Cuban Missile Crisis, he does a funny thing with progress, asking the audience to consider all achievements of man as happening in the last 50 years: “Christianity began less than two years ago. The printing press came this year … Newton explored the meaning of gravity … Only last week did we discover penicillin and television and nuclear power, and now, if America’s new spacecraft succeeds in reaching Venus, we will have literally reached the stars before midnight tonight.” Entreating his country in this way, playing that trick with time, he rang a prominent bell in the American psyche: to be a part of a superpower is to be a part of history, and the temptation, in playing a minor part of history, is to see other lives, other parts, as minor – over and absorbed, after all, in a few relative turns of the planet. It is also, perhaps, to hope less for yourself. Looking back on his position in history, Alan Bean was practical and pragmatic. In training, he said, you replicated all possible smells, the feeling of the spacesuit air conditioner mounted on your back, the half-second delay of communications between Earth and not Earth, so that you could linger in other observations. “The sun was much brighter than it ever seemed in training on Earth,” he said. “The shadows were much darker.” Thinking of the freedom in this – planning so well, knowing so much, that you needed only notice flexions in light – and wanting to string a line from one side of my country to the other, I tried to liken those impressions of darkness to the sort of enlightenment I inevitably chased, the other worlds on Earth that I went after. I tried psychedelics first at 15, not long after my father died in his armchair, still surrounded by Carlos Castaneda paperbacks and printouts of Pete Seeger lyrics he’d pinned up in his cluttered rental. I remembered a morning, in an isolated beach town known for removing the signs that announced it, that I left my place by the ocean in search of some water I could drink. I’d eaten acid all night, spoken very little, and I was close to naked as I walked uphill through the sunrise and mist, wearing only someone else’s cut off sweatshirt. The pink of the sky felt like a taste in my mouth, and the sound of the birds like something I could see, their chirp responsible for the movement of leaves. On the side of a one-storey church, which was white and wooden and peaked with a small belfry, I uncurled a green hose and drank a long time. When a woman with a key ring appeared, waving in a kind of admonishment, she seemed like my invention, something that had formed in my careful study of the fog. How did I seem to her, my eyes enormous and empty, the water I’d been desperate for spilled down that dirty, sandy cotton? It must have appeared I’d forgotten everything – my shoes, my manners, the school day that was about to begin without me – except the first and most primal needs of my accidental life. To identify the ligature between those trips, deep into space or deep into the mind, to find the thread between the bell sleeves and roach clips that were my mother’s country and the 4am steak-and-egg breakfasts that were Alan Bean’s, was not to understand two American cultures – one who waged war under the guise of protecting democracy, the other who used democracy to denounce that war – but to clearly see a certain American problem of the self. If the goal of one side was total control of the mind, the goal of the other total freedom, the crucial tools involved were never really the systems or institutions – the military or government, the school or church – that supported or repressed those ends. They were always the inner resources of one, for the United States has always been a country that tends to leave you, in so many ways, alone. Alone without a doctor, alone without a union, alone without a guaranteed education, and alone without much of a history, a record so short that what stands out are always the personalities that rose above it – not the six Apollo landings made possible by Nasa, but Armstrong’s laconic announcement during one of them; not the systematic redlining of cities, which kept black Americans from home ownership, but a few soundbites of Martin Luther King to be played exactly once a year in a country that hasn’t changed enough since he died for it. By the time Bean died, in 2018, the novel was done but the facts remained in my mind unarranged, something like the last things unpacked in a move between very different buildings, fragile, difficult to display in another setting. The sickness of my young country, what it did to people, what it allowed them to do, couldn’t be explained by statistics of armament or dissent, although there was a story I read that stuck with me, a narrative of ameliorative diversion that held the whole Apollo program in its speculative palm. The anecdote is simple: an 18-year-old boy, about to be deployed in 1969, a bag slung over the shoulder of his uniform, calls through the open front door to the driveway where his mother’s car is idling. He wants a few more minutes in front of the television, where Neil Armstrong has just taken his step, and though they’re very late she allows him that, hoping maybe, if he feels the satiety of wonder at what his country has done, he might be able to get some sleep, something he’s been missing given what his country has asked him to do. While it’s certain the war crimes of My Lai or Khe Sanh would have occurred with or without a grand and expensive show going on in the sky above them, it might be true that it did something for how Americans treated each other, then. Answering Ralph Abernathy, Thomas Paine said: “If we could solve the problems of poverty by not pushing the button to launch men to the moon tomorrow, then we would not push that button.” He asked that the leader of the Southern Poverty Law Center “regard the space program … as an encouraging demonstration of what the American people could accomplish when they had vision, leadership and adequate resources,” and to pray for the safety of the astronauts. Finally, he offered Abernathy and the activists VIP seating to watch the Saturn lift off, and the two peaceably shook hands. Thinking of Abernathy watching that launch, I understood it as the zenith of American pain: that you should be, in the same breath, denied your rights, assured of your smallness, and awarded front-row tickets to combustive, deafening glory.

Before we close this blog and begin a new one, here is a comprehensive run down of the past 24 hours. Western and Ukrainian officials have reacted warily to Russia’s claim that it will significantly cut back its military activity in northern Ukraine after “meaningful” progress at peace talks in Istanbul. More than a month after the start of an invasion that has largely stalled in the eyes of the west, Russia’s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, said Moscow would “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the talks had been “positive but they do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells”, adding that Ukraine had no intention of reducing its military efforts. Joe Biden said: “I don’t read anything into it until I see what their actions are.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he had not seen anything indicating that talks were progressing in a “constructive way” and suggested Russian indications of a pullback could be an attempt by Moscow to “deceive people and deflect attention”. “What Russia says, and what Russia does, and we’re focused on the latter.” Zelenskiy said Ukrainians are “not naive people” and he saw “no reason to trust the words of certain representatives of a state that continues to fight for our destruction”. He also called for sanctions to be strengthened. “They must be effective. Not just for headlines in the media that sanctions have been imposed, but for real peace. Real.” In Ukraine’s latest intelligence report as of 10pm local time, its military claimed Russian troops continue to withdraw from Kyiv and Chernihiv but the movement is merely “a rotation of individual units” and aims to “mislead the military leadership” of Ukraine. China’s ambassador to the UN addressed the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, describing a “worrying account of the situation on ground” and called for the protection of civilian lives and respect for international humanitarian law. Dai Bing said increasing sanctions on Russia will “give rise to new humanitarian problems” including hitting global energy, food, economic, trade and financial markets. Moscow’s lead negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said Russia’s promise to “drastically reduce” military operations does not represent a ceasefire. In an interview with the Russian state-owned Tass news agency, Medinsky said there is still “a long way to go” to reach a mutual agreement with Ukraine. Following Russia’s announcement, two senior US officials said the US was seeing Russia beginning to withdraw some of its forces from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in what it believes is a “major” change in Russian strategy. Another US official said any movement of Russian forces from around Kyiv would constitute a “redeployment, not a withdrawal”. The UK has also seen signs of “some reduction” in Russian bombardment around Kyiv, Downing Street said. But it insisted the UK will judge tentative steps towards a possible peace deal by actions rather than words. “We don’t want to see anything less than a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory,” the PM’s spokesperson said. The UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in its latest updated that “it is almost certain that the Russian offensive has failed in its objective to encircle Kyiv”. Ukraine called for “an international mechanism of security guarantees” similar to Nato’s article 5, which commits alliance members to defend one another. The senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said the guarantee would involve countries such as the US, UK, Turkey, France and Germany being “legally actively involved in protecting [Ukraine] from any aggression”. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said Moscow’s “main goal” in Ukraine was now the “liberation” of the Donbas region. In a sign that Moscow may be switching to more limited objectives after facing fierce Ukrainian resistance in the first month of the war, Shoigu claimed the “main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed”. A Russian airstrike hit a government building in the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv on Tuesday, destroying a large portion of the structure and leaving people trapped under debris. At least 12 people were killed and 33 injured, Ukraine’s emergencies agency said. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) called on Russia and Ukraine to reach a clear agreement for the safe evacuation of civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol and other frontline places as vital supplies run out. “Time is running out” for people in Mariupol, it warned, adding that there was still a lack of “concrete agreements” for the safe passage and evacuations of civilians in the southern Ukrainian city. The Kremlin dismissed reports that Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich suffered symptoms consistent with poisoning during an informal round of talks earlier this month. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the reports were false and “part of the information war”. A Ukrainian soldier who told a Russian warship to “go fuck yourself” while defending an island has been awarded for his services, local authorities said. Roman Hrybov was serving on Snake Island – known as Zmiinyi Island in Ukrainian – when it came under Russian air and sea bombardment on 24 February. Ukraine’s defence ministry said Hrybov was released from Russian captivity and is now home in Cherkasy. A £38m superyacht owned by an unnamed Russian businessman has been detained in Canary Wharf in London as part of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The vessel, known as Phi, is subject to the first detention of a superyacht in UK waters, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said, and its owner was “We can say the signals we are receiving from the talks are positive but they do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells,” he said. Americans may be ‘singled out’ by Russian forces in Ukraine, the US state department said in its latest travel advisory. “There are continued reports of US citizens being singled out and detained by the Russian military in Ukraine and when evacuating by land through Russia-occupied territory or to Russia or Belarus,” it said. The US state department has warned American citizens not to travel to Ukraine or Russia in its latest travel advisory. “There are continued reports of US citizens being singled out and detained by the Russian military in Ukraine and when evacuating by land through Russia-occupied territory or to Russia or Belarus,” it said. The US embassy has limited ability to assist US citizens in Russia, it noted. China’s ambassador to the UN has addressed the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, describing a “worrying account of the situation on ground” and called for the protection of civilian lives and respect for international humanitarian law. Dai Bing told the latest UN Security Council, according to a statement released by China’s permanent mission to the UN: The conflict situation in Ukraine is persisting. Effectively protecting civilian lives and meeting their humanitarian needs is a must. China calls for respect for international humanitarian law to avoid civilian casualties to the maximum extent, protect civilian facilities, provide safe passage for evacuation and humanitarian access, and ensure a continuous supply of basic necessities, such as food, drinking water, and medicines. Protection of vulnerable groups such as women and children must be strengthened.” Increasing sanctions on Russia will “give rise to new humanitarian problems”, Bing added. We must also be cognisant that the ever-escalating, sweeping, indiscriminate sanctions have hit global energy, food, economic, trade and financial markets, and will continue to do so, affecting the lives and livelihoods of the general public, and giving rise to new humanitarian problems.” Addressing global food security, Bing called for an “enhanced international coordination” to stabilise food supply and food prices and a “refrain from unjustified export restrictions”. Sanctions and economic blockades will only artificially exacerbate food shortages and price distortions, further disrupt food production and food supply chain across the world, push up food prices, and put such burdens on developing countries as they do not deserve. We call for enhanced international coordination to stabilise food supply and food prices, refrain from unjustified export restrictions, keep the market working in a stable manner, and ensure global food security. Finally, Bing cautioned that further damage is on its way if the crisis continues and escalates, describing such an event as being “not in the interest of any party”. The most conclusive way towards a ceasefire to end hostilities is dialogue and negotiation. The international community should encourage and support continued direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine until a positive outcome is achieved and peace is restored. Security is indivisible and seeking absolute security by pitting one bloc against another is precisely the most assured way to achieve insecurity. The United States, Nato and EU should also engage in dialogue with Russia, accommodate the legitimate security concerns of all parties, and build a balanced, effective and sustainable regional security architecture through dialogue and negotiation.” Here are some of the latest photos to come out of Ukraine on Tuesday. A Russian hotel owner has taken in Ukrainians fleeing the fighting, saying it was partly the shame he feels over Russia’s invasion that persuaded him and his family to take in 34 Ukrainians so far, and counting. Mikhail Golubtsov, a Russian former construction engineer, left his home country in 2014 over Moscow’s “unacceptable” annexation of Crimea, and now runs a modest but cosy hotel in the green hills of central Serbia. Most of Golubtsov’s hotel rooms are now taken up by Ukrainian refugees, who can stay at the hotel free of charge, for as long as they need. “The first seven people arrived because a friend gave them the address, ... now they are simply arriving,” he told Reuters. “At first (after the invasion started), I was in shock and I was so ashamed. For some time I could not speak Russian, but when guests arrive and they speak Russian to me, I speak Russian as well. I think the only thing I can do now is to help Ukrainians somehow.” Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy will address Australia’s parliament on Thursday evening by video, according to parliament records cited by Reuters. Employment minister Stuart Robert told parliament on Thursday morning that Zelenskiy would make an address via video link at 5.30pm (7.30am GMT). Australia has supplied defence equipment and humanitarian supplies to Ukraine, as well as imposing a ban on exports of alumina and aluminium ores, including bauxite, to Russia. It has also imposed a total of 476 sanctions on 443 individuals, including businessmen close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and 33 entities, including most of Russia*s banking sector and all entities responsible for the country’s sovereign debt. The war in Ukraine will have a global impact “beyond anything we’ve seen since World War Two” and damage global food security because many of the Ukrainian farmers who produce a significant amount of the world’s wheat are now fighting Russians, the UN’s food chief has warned. David Beasley, executive director of the UN World Food Program, told the UN Security Council that already high food prices are skyrocketing. His agency was feeding 125 million people around the world before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Beasley said it has had to start cutting their rations because of rising food, fuel and shipping costs, the Associated Press reports. He pointed to war-torn Yemen where 8 million people just had their food allotment cut 50%, “and now we’re looking at going to zero rations.” The war in Ukraine is turning “the breadbasket of the world to breadlines” for millions of its people, while devastating countries like Egypt that normally gets 85% of its grain from Ukraine and Lebanon that got 81% in 2020, Beasley said. Ukraine and Russia produce 30% of the world’s wheat supply, 20% of its corn and 75%-80% of the sunflower seed oil. The World Food Program buys 50% of its grain from Ukraine, he said. The war is going to increase the agency’s monthly expenses by $71 million because of rising food, fuel and shipping costs, he said. That will total $850 million for a year and mean that there will be “4 million less people we’ll be able to reach.” The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has said it is greatly concerned that Russian and Ukrainian authorities are yet to meet many of their core obligations under international humanitarian law or reach consensus on key issues. In a statement shared with the Guardian via email, a spokesperson said: Over the last five weeks, the ICRC has been speaking with Russian and Ukrainian authorities about their obligations under international humanitarian law (IHL) and what practical steps must be taken to limit the suffering of civilians and those who no longer participate in hostilities, including the wounded, sick, and prisoners of war (POWs). To the ICRC’s great concern, the parties are yet to meet many of their core obligations under IHL or reach consensus on key issues that only they can concretely deliver.” Specifically, the ICRC said it made detailed proposals regarding the safe passage and evacuations for civilians in Mariupol, but still “lack the concrete agreements needed to move forward”. Today, civilians are taking the life-and-death decision to flee when there is no ceasefire or other agreements in place that would allow them to leave safely. Time is running out for civilians in Mariupol and in other frontline areas who have now gone for weeks with no humanitarian assistance. The militaries on the ground need to give civilians and humanitarian organisations security guarantees and practical agreements to allow aid in and for those who wish to evacuate safely.” The ICRC added that the parties must inform of any POWs—and other people deprived of their liberty—whom they hold and allow the ICRC to visit them. The parties need to follow through on concrete proposals for the dignified treatment of the dead so they can be identified, families informed, and bodies returned. The belligerents are obligated under international humanitarian law to protect civilians, to limit military operations to exclusively military objectives and to take precautionary measures.” According to the statement, the ICRC’s president travelled first to Kyiv and then Moscow to meet with authorities where his meetings with authorities in Moscow “triggered deep anger for some”. “We want to be clear that these diplomatic meetings with all sides are anchored in international humanitarian law and passionate advocacy for the best interest of civilians trapped in conflict,” the statement added. Former US president Donald Trump has called on Russian president Vladimir Putin to release any damaging information he has about the Biden family and Hunter Biden’s dealings with oligarchs in eastern Europe. “I would think Putin would know the answer to that,” Trump said in an interview with Just the News, referring to Hunter Biden’s potential dealings in Russia. “I think he should release it. I think we should know that answer.” Trump cited a 2020 Senate report that disclosed Russian oligarch Yelena Baturina, then the wife of Moscow’s mayor, provided $3.5 million a decade ago to a company co-founded by President Joe Biden’s son and unanswered questions about why the money was given. “How is it that the mayor of Moscow, his wife gave the Biden family three and a half million dollars? I think Putin now would be willing to probably give that answer,” Trump said. “I’m sure he knows.” A grand jury has been investigating Hunter Biden’s business dealings for possible tax violations, foreign lobbying issues and money laundering but he has denied any wrongdoing. There needs to be full peace across Ukraine for any final agreement with Russia to come into force, the head of the Ukrainian delegation said following talks with Moscow in Istanbul on Tuesday. David Arakhamia told reporters that all troops must retreat from Ukraine and allow the 3.5 million refugees who fled the war to come back home. He added that there was enough material in Ukraine’s proposals to warrant a meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Vladimir Putin. Watch the video of Arakhamia’s remarks below. Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces has just released its latest intelligence report as of 10pm local time, claiming Russian troops continue to withdraw from the territory of Kyiv and Chernihiv in the Ukraine’s north but the movement is merely “a rotation of individual units” and aims to “mislead the military leadership” of Ukraine. The report reads: According to some indications, the Russian enemy is regrouping units to focus its main efforts on the east. At the same time, the so-called ‘withdrawal of troops’ is probably a rotation of individual units and aims to mislead the military leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and create a misconception about the occupiers’ refusal to plan to encircle the city of Kyiv.” US President Joe Biden’s deputy national security adviser for economics, Daleep Singh, will travel to New Delhi and meet government officials to discuss Russia’s war against Ukraine and develop an economic framework for the Indo-Pacific, the White House said on Tuesday. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is also planning to visit India, one of the biggest buyers of Russian commodities. New Delhi has called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine but has refused to explicitly condemn Moscow’s actions. India has also abstained from voting on multiple UN resolutions on the war. “Singh will consult closely with counterparts on the consequences of Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine and mitigating its impact on the global economy,” the White House said in a statement. Last week, Biden said only India among the Quad group of countries was “somewhat shaky” in acting against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The South Asian nation has tried to balance its ties with Russia and the west but unlike other members of the Quad countries - United States, Japan, Australia - it has not imposed sanctions on Russia. Earlier today, the US president said it remains to be seen if Russia will follow through on its pledge to scale down its military operations in northern Ukraine, saying Washington and its allies will maintain sanctions and continue providing aid to Ukraine in the meantime. “I don’t read anything into it until we see what their actions are,” Biden said of Russia at a White House press conference. Watch Biden’s remarks in the video below. Guardian reporter based in Kyiv, Shaun Walker, brings us this analysis piece, asking: Why is Abramovich playing peacemaker after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine? Sanctioned billionaire Roman Abramovich is not officially part of the Russian delegation, but has apparently played a major role behind the scenes, jetting between Moscow, Kyiv and Istanbul since Russia invaded Ukraine. Further questions about what role Abramovich was playing, and why, were raised on Monday, when the Wall Street Journal and investigative outlet Bellingcat claimed Abramovich and a Ukrainian MP were among three people to fall ill with symptoms consistent with chemical poisoning, during a round of negotiations in Kyiv in early March. A source confirmed to the Guardian that Abramovich had fallen ill after the meeting, and had lost his sight for several hours. He soon recovered and was able to take part in later rounds of negotiations. Aside from the poisoning claims, the emergence of the publicity-shy oligarch at the heart of peace negotiations has also surprised many. Read the full story below. At least 12 people were killed and 33 wounded on Tuesday when a Russian missile hit a regional government building in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, emergency officials have said. A Russian airstrike hit a nine-storey government building before 9am local time on Tuesday, destroying a large portion of the structure and leaving people trapped under debris. “The bodies of 12 people have been recovered from the site of the destruction and 33 people have been injured,” Ukraine’s emergencies agency said in a statement on Telegram. Zelenskiy also provided an update as to the situation in Mykolaiv after a Russian airstrike hit a government building on Tuesday, destroying a large portion of the structure and leaving people trapped under debris. During the day the rescue operation was ongoing in Mykolaiv. The debris of the building of the regional administration destroyed by Russian missile strikes was dismantled. The Russian troops hit Mykolaiv very insidiously. At a time when people came to their workplaces in the morning. Thank God, most of those in the building managed to evacuate when they heard an air alarm. This one more act of the Russian so-called denazification of Mykolaiv took place in the morning after the anniversary of [the] liberation of the city from Nazi invaders. Mykolaiv residents remember the day of March 28, 1944. And they see who the Russian troops trying to capture their city now look like.” Regarding recent peace negotiations, Zelenskiy called for caution. Of course, we see all the risks. Of course, we see no reason to trust the words of certain representatives of a state that continues to fight for our destruction. Ukrainians are not naive people. Ukrainians have already learned during these 34 days of invasion and over the past eight years of the war in Donbas that only a concrete result can be trusted. The facts – if they change on our land. Zelenskiy said Ukraine was willing to negotiate and would continue the negotiation process. There must be real security for us, for our state, for sovereignty, for our people. Russian troops must leave the occupied territories. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity must be guaranteed. There can be no compromise on sovereignty and our territorial integrity. And there will not be any.” Referring to sanctions, he added: And certain countries should not even expect that certain negotiations will facilitate the lifting of sanctions against the Russian Federation. The question of sanctions cannot even be raised until the war is over, until we get back what’s ours and until we restore justice. On the contrary, sanctions must be strengthened. Intensified weekly. And they must be effective. Not just for headlines in the media that sanctions have been imposed, but for real peace. Real. Hello, it’s Samantha Lock with you as my colleague Maanvi Singh signs off for the day. Here’s a little more from Zelenskiy’s late-night address. The Ukrainian leader urged his people to “not lose vigilance” despite saying the signals received from peace talks with Russia appeared positive. The situation has not become easier. The scale of the challenges has not diminished. The Russian army still has significant potential to continue attacks against our state. They still have a lot of equipment and enough people completely deprived of rights whom they can send to the cauldron of war.” Zelenskiy said Ukraine would not be reducing its defence efforts. The enemy is still in our territory. The shelling of our cities continues. Mariupol is blocked. Missile and air strikes do not stop. This is the reality. These are the facts. Yes, we can call positive the signals we hear from the negotiating platform. But these signals do not silence the explosion of Russian shells.” It is 1.30am in Ukraine. Here’s the latest: Russia said it will significantly cut back its military activity in northern Ukraine after “meaningful” progress at peace talks in Istanbul. In a potentially significant shift more than a month after the start of the invasion, Russia’s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, said Moscow would “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv”. However, western officials said they were “very wary” about Russian diplomatic promises and feared that Vladimir Putin could be seeking to take advantage of the situation. Negotiations between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations had not yet reached the point where it was possible to talk about a ceasefire, although there is a feeling that at the very least the war is entering a new phase. Moscow’s lead negotiator in talks with Ukraine, Vladimir Medinsky, said Russia’s promise to “drastically reduce” military operations did not represent a ceasefire. In an interview with the Russian state-owned Tass news agency, Medinsky said there was still “a long way to go” to reach a mutual agreement with Ukraine. Following Russia’s announcement, two senior US officials said the US is seeing Russia beginning to withdraw some of its forces from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in what it believes is a “major” change in Russian strategy. Another US official said any movement of Russian forces from around Kyiv would constitute a “redeployment, not a withdrawal”. The UK has also seen signs of “some reduction” in Russian bombardment around Kyiv, Downing Street said. But it insisted the UK would judge tentative steps towards a possible peace deal by actions rather than words. “We don’t want to see anything less than a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory,” the PM’s spokesperson said. Ukraine called for “an international mechanism of security guarantees” similar to Nato’s article 5, which commits alliance members to defend one another. The senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said the guarantee would involve countries such as the US, UK, Turkey, France and Germany being “legally actively involved in protecting [Ukraine] from any aggression”. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said Moscow’s “main goal” in Ukraine was now the “liberation” of the Donbas region. In a sign that Moscow may be switching to more limited objectives after facing fierce Ukrainian resistance in the first month of the war, Shoigu claimed the “main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed”. A Russian airstrike hit a government building in the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv on Tuesday, destroying a large portion of the structure and leaving people trapped under debris. At least seven people were killed and 22 injured, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told the Danish parliament in a video address. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) called on Russia and Ukraine to reach a clear agreement for the safe evacuation of civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol and other frontline places as vital supplies run out. “Time is running out” for people in Mariupol, it warned, adding that there was still a lack of “concrete agreements” for the safe passage and evacuations of civilians in the southern Ukrainian city. The Kremlin dismissed reports that Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich suffered symptoms consistent with poisoning during an informal round of talks earlier this month. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the reports were false and “part of the information war”. A Ukrainian soldier who told a Russian warship to “go fuck yourself” while defending an island has been awarded for his services, local authorities said. Roman Hrybov was serving on Snake Island – known as Zmiinyi Island in Ukrainian – when it came under Russian air and sea bombardment on 24 February. Ukraine’s defence ministry said Hrybov had been released from Russian captivity and was now home in Cherkasy. A £38m superyacht owned by an unnamed Russian businessman has been detained in Canary Wharf in London as part of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The vessel, known as Phi, is subject to the first detention of a superyacht in UK waters, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said, and its owner was “deliberately well hidden”. In his latest address, posted on Telegram, Zelenskiy said that Ukraine wouldn’t be reducing its defensive efforts despite Russian promises to ease off some parts of the country.“We can say the signals we are receiving from the talks are positive but they do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells,” he said. According the UK Ministry of Defence’s latest update, “it is almost certain that the Russian offensive has failed in its objective to encircle Kyiv”. The assessment mirrors that of the Pentagon. “Russia has failed in its objective of capturing Kyiv,” a Pentagon spokesman said earlier. “It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over.” – Leonie Chao-Fong, Joanna Walters, Maanvi Singh A senior UN official has said they have seen videos purporting to show the abuse of prisoners of war on both sides in Ukraine, as Russia raised the mistreatment of its soldiers at the first day of the latest peace talks. Matilda Bogner, head of the UN’s human rights office in Ukraine, said a number of videos of the abuse of Russian and Ukrainian prisoners were being examined, adding that “on the face of it, it does raise serious concerns”. “It is important that these types of videos and that any ill treatment that may happen is stopped immediately,” she said, following the broadcast of footage that appeared to show Ukrainian soldiers shooting three captive Russians in their legs. In the grainy footage, which is being investigated by Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government in Kyiv, three prisoners are seen being brought in from a car. A man with a blue armband then approaches them and says: “Hi” before shooting each of them in the leg. The Ukrainian government has said it is taking the footage “very seriously” although there is no independent evidence of its veracity yet. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Zelenskiy, said: “if this turns out to be real, this is absolutely unacceptable behaviour”. One of the biggest promoters of the video was Maria Dubovikova, a political commentator at the Russian International Affairs Council. The BBC reported that the footage of Ukrainian soldiers being shot took place in a dairy plant in Malaya Rohan’, to the south-east of Kharkiv, which had been recently been re-taken by Ukrainian troops from Russian forces. Analysis of the weather conditions and troop movements further suggested that the video could have been shot in the early hours of Saturday 26 March.

And while the dog across the platform still yaps at them both, after more than a month, the humans and their pets living in this corner of Kharkiv’s metro station are used to each other. On one side of the platform, Tetiana Kapustynska hung up balloons for her 24th birthday on the pillar she sleeps behind. “The day before I cried because I didn’t know what it was going to be like, but in the end people got together and celebrated with me,” she said. “The biggest problem was champagne, I couldn’t find a bottle anywhere,” she added with a grin, as she made cups of instant coffee for visitors with water in a flask. “Cake wasn’t so much of a problem. You can still get it in the shops.” Kapustynska, who is a maths and physics teacher, turned the metro station’s operation room into a cross between a childcare facility and a school for the children living in the underground chamber. For her birthday, they made decorations and organised flowers. Barely a month ago, she had been trying to choose a bar or restaurant for celebrations. But since the war began, bombs, shells and rockets have smashed Kharkiv city centre and residential areas, killing hundreds of civilians, in perhaps the most intense offensives of the war outside the besieged port town of Mariupol. In response, life has largely moved indoors and underground, with thousands of people taking refuge in Soviet-era stations. These were designed in the cold war era to shelter the city’s residents from a western attack, but now the bunkers are protecting civilians from the Russians. “I don’t go out much; it’s frightening,” said Denis Kapustynskyi, 19, Tetiana’s brother. He lived with his mother in Saltivka, a northern suburb that has been turned into a burnt-out wasteland by some of the most intense shelling of the war. He does not even know if they have a house any more, after fleeing with little more than the clothes on their backs at the start of the war. “On the first day of the war, the sounds of explosions were really loud. They were already shelling housing blocks. We got dressed, picked up our documents and left,” he said. Some still risk venturing out in the daytime for light, fresh air, shopping, and Tetiana goes to feed and play with her dog, who is too big to be brought into the metro station – although every trip above ground is potentially deadly. Read more: In his latest address, posted on Telegram, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Ukraine wouldn’t be reducing its defensive efforts despite Russian promises to ease off some parts of the country. “We can say the signals we are receiving from the talks are positive but they do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells,” he said. “The Russian army still has significant potential to continue attacks against our state,” he added. “Therefore we are not reducing our defensive efforts.” Zelenskiy signaled optimism about talks in Turkey, but noted that any peace deal couldn’t compromise Ukrainian sovereignty. According the UK Ministry of Defence’s latest update, “it is almost certain that the Russian offensive has failed in its objective to encircle Kyiv.” “Russian statements regarding a reduction in activity around Kyiv, and reporting indicating the withdrawal of some Russian units from these areas, may indicate Russia’s acceptance that it has now lost the initiative in the region,” said the UK defence attaché Mick Smeath in a statement. “It is highly likely that Russia will seek to divert combat power from the north to their offensive in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east.” The assessment mirrors that of the Pentagon. “Russia has failed in its objective of capturing Kyiv,” a Pentagon spokesman said earlier. “It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over.” Thousands of Ukrainian civilians in Mariupol might have died since Russia began bombing the port city, according to the UN human rights mission. Reuters reports: Nearly 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed in Mariupol since Russian forces laid siege to it a month ago, a spokesperson for Mayor Vadym Boichenko said on Monday. His office said 90% of Mariupol’s buildings had been damaged and 40% destroyed, including hospitals, schools, kindergartens and factories. “We do think that there could be thousands of deaths, of civilian casualties, in Mariupol,” Matilda Bogner, head of the UN human rights mission in Ukraine which deploys some 60 monitors, said in a virtual interview. She said the mission did not have a precise estimate but was working to gather more information. Local officials, citing witness accounts, last week estimated that 300 people were killed in the March 16 bombing of a Mariupol theatre where people were sheltering. As of Tuesday, the UN human rights office had confirmed 1,179 civilians killed and 1,860 injured across Ukraine in the five-week old conflict, amid reporting delays due to the hostilities, a statement said. The White House has warned its allies “no one should be fooled by Russia’s announcements” about reducing its military presence around the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and that it was important to be “clear-eyed about the reality of what is happening on the ground”, Agence France-Presse reports. Any movement of Russian forces around Kyiv is a “redeployment and not a withdrawal”, White House director of communications Kate Bedingfield said in Washington at a briefing moments ago. The comments echoed those coming from the Pentagon just prior, warning that Kyiv “remains under threat”. Russia itself had noted earlier, via Moscow’s lead negotiator in talks with Ukraine, Vladimir Medinsky, that its promise to “drastically reduce” military operations around Kyiv and northern Ukraine did not represent a ceasefire. And Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy just said that although signals from the talks in Turkey were positive, they didn’t drown out the explosions of Russian shells raining down on Ukraine. Now Washington has amplified warnings for caution. AFP further reports: We’re seeing a small number now that appears to be moving away from Kyiv, this on the same day that the Russians say they’re withdrawing,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said just earlier. “But we’re not prepared to call this a retreat or even a withdrawal. We think that what they probably have in mind is a repositioning to prioritize elsewhere.” “We all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine. It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over. “Russia has failed in its objective of capturing Kiev,” the Pentagon spokesman said, but “they can still inflict massive brutality on the country including on Kyiv.” A dozen members of the US Senate foreign relations committee urged Joe Biden’s administration to push for Russia’s removal from the United Nations human rights council, citing its invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. In a letter dated Monday and made public on Tuesday, the eight Democrats and four Republicans asked the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, to introduce a resolution to remove Russia from the rights body, citing widespread casualties in Ukraine and the destruction of residential buildings, hospital and schools. Support for Ukraine is one of the rare areas of bipartisan agreement in the bitterly divided US Congress, which has approved billions of dollars in aid for the government in Kyiv. “Swift action must be taken to show the world the United States and our allies will not stand for indiscriminate and unprovoked attacks on civilians and democracies. The time has come for Russia to no longer have a seat on the Council,” said the letter, led by the committee’s top Republican, Senator Jim Risch, and its Democratic chairman, Senator Bob Menendez. In the letter, the senators said states engaging in a pattern of gross and systemic rights abuses can be removed by a two-thirds vote in the UN general assembly. “We implore you to introduce a resolution in the UN General Assembly to call for the removal of the Russian Federation from the UNHRC immediately,” they wrote. American officials at the US mission to the United Nations in New York referred a request for comment to the office in Geneva, which did not immediately respond. The Human Rights Council is based in Geneva. Russia, which has called its actions since 24 February a “special operation”, has denied targeting civilians in Ukraine. Only one country has been suspended from the 47-member Geneva-based council: Libya. The North African country was suspended in 2011 because of violence against protesters by forces loyal to its then-leader Muammar Gaddafi. Some senior officials addressing the council during a meeting earlier this month questioned Russia’s membership, but did not explicitly call for its suspension. The White House has provided a read-out of the five way phone call earlier today between the Nato member leaders Joe Biden, the US president, the UK’s Boris Johnson, Germany’s Olaf Scholz, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Italy’s Mario Draghi. “The leaders affirmed their determination to continue raising costs on Russia for its brutal attacks in Ukraine, as well as to continue supplying Ukraine with security assistance to defend itself against this unjustified and unprovoked assault,” the White House statement said. It continued: “They reviewed their efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the millions affected by the violence, both inside Ukraine and seeking refuge in other countries, and underscored the need for humanitarian access to civilians in Mariupol. They also discussed the importance of supporting stable energy markets in light of current disruptions due to sanctions.” In the last three days, Biden and Macron essentially disagreed over the US president’s ad lib at the end of a speech in Poland on Saturday where he said that Russian president Vladimir Putin was a butcher who “cannot remain in power”. On Sunday, as US officials rushed to play down Biden’s remarks and insisted they were not meant to signal a new US policy stance of “regime change” in Russia, Macron warned warned against the use of inflammatory language in an already volatile situation. Yesterday, Biden said he was not “walking anything back”, made no apologies for his use of language and said the comment had been made from a personal sense of moral outrage after meeting with Ukrainian refugees in Poland. The death toll from the Russian strike on a regional administration building in the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv has risen from at least seven to at least nine, with 28 people wounded, local authorities said and various wire services reported. The wounded were pulled from the rubble by rescue workers, who continue to work at the scene, the emergencies service said in an online post. Footage from the state rescue service showed a gaping hole in a side of the building, with firefighters extinguishing a fire where the rocket hit and the wounded being put onto ambulance stretchers. There was blood visible in the debris, and shattered glass and upturned furniture strewn on the floor in the offices inside the building, Reuters reported. This is just a nightmare. A girl died on my floor. What can I say? Are you kidding? I hugged her, two minutes passed, and she passed,” said a woman who was helped out of the building by rescuers. They destroyed half of the building, hit my office,” regional governor Vitaliy Kim said. Russian forces have attacked Ukraine’s southern ports including Kherson, Odesa, Mykolaiv and Mariupol as they try to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea and establish a land corridor from Russia to Crimea, the peninsula Russia seized in 2014. Kim said there was an upside to the strike - it suggested Russia had given up trying to take over the city. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special military operation” to disarm its neighbour. It denies targeting civilians and did not comment on the strike on Mykolaiv. Ukraine and the west say Vladimir Putin launched an unprovoked invasion. It was so noisy, people were very afraid. People all ran into the hallway and some are still sitting there because they’re still scared. After that the [air-raid] sirens went off,” said Natalia Novikova, 57, an employee in the department of health in the local administration It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: Russia said it will significantly cut back its military activity in northern Ukraine after “meaningful” progress at peace talks in Istanbul. In a potentially significant shift more than a month after the start of the invasion, Russia’s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, said Moscow would “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv”.

That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, for today as I hand the blog over to my US colleague, Joanna Walters. The US president, Joe Biden, said it remains to be seen whether Russia follows through with any actions to scale down its military operations in Ukraine. Speaking to reporters at the White House following his meeting with Lee Hsien Loong, the prime minister of Singapore, Biden said: We’ll see. I don’t read anything into it until I see what their actions are. We’ll see if they follow through with what they’ve suggested. Western officials said they were “very wary” about Russian diplomatic promises made during the peace talks in Istanbul and fear that Vladimir Putin could be seeking to take advantage of the situation. One official said: Certainly, in terms of the negotiations, nothing that we have seen so far has demonstrated to us that Putin and his colleagues are particularly serious … it’s more of a tactical exercise in playing for time. Negotiations between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations had not yet reached the point where it was possible to talk about a ceasefire, although there is a feeling that at the very least the war is entering a new phase. One official said: Clearly, we are at a moment when some of the tactics and strategies are changing. Exactly what that prefigures at the moment, I don’t think we feel particularly confident about. But there were not yet discussions that amounted to “in any shape or form a cessation of hostilities”, they added. A five-way phone call between Joe Biden, the US president, plus the UK’s Boris Johnson, Germany’s Olaf Scholz, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Italy’s Mario Draghi agreed to ramp up pressure on Russia, added the official, who had knowledge of the call. Significantly, the five said they wanted to “increase our support for Ukraine”, implying more weapons would be sent to help Kyiv, and to “continue to tighten the economic vice around Russia”. There was “not a cigarette paper between them”, the official added. Statements from Russia’s deputy defence minister that Moscow was pulling out forces in northern Ukraine also had to be judged sceptically at this stage. An official added: I think you will have to wait and see over the next few days whether that’s a seismic shift. Nevertheless, despite the uncertainty, it is believed the talks in Istanbul remain the only hope for ending the brutal fighting. It is nevertheless the best way forward in due course. And we would hope that at some stage it would become real and lead to a ceasefire. Romania will distribute potassium iodine tablets to residents free of charge to prepare in case of a nuclear emergency, the country’s health minister, Alexandru Rafila, said today. Describing the likelihood of a nuclear incident as “not probable” but “possible”, Rafila said the government would start distributing the tablets from next week through family doctors. He told reporters: They should be taken if there is a nuclear incident in the vicinity. Otherwise, they should not be taken. Several doctors have warned against taking iodine without proper precautions, pointing at the serious side effects, Reuters reports. Russia has not yet demonstrated it is serious about negotiations with Ukraine, a western official speaking on condition of anonymity said. Reuters is reporting the official as saying: In terms of the negotiations, nothing that we have seen so far has demonstrated to us that President Putin and his colleagues are particularly serious about that, it’s more of a tactical exercise in playing for time. The official added that talks were “nevertheless the best way forward in due course”. We would hope that at some stage it would become real and lead to a ceasefire … we are sceptical that it is real just yet. Nevertheless, we do want to see a ceasefire which will emerge ultimately from a negotiation. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, discussed the situation in Ukraine in a phone call today. Macron brought up the subject of carrying out a humanitarian mission for the besieged city of Mariupol with Putin, but conditions are not in place at this stage, a French presidency official said. Russia’s position on a humanitarian mission for Mariupol remains tough, the official said, adding that Putin told the French president that he would think about it. In a statement, the Kremlin said the two leaders also discussed Russia’s decision to request payments in roubles for Russian gas supplies to the European Union. A US official said any movement of Russian forces from around Kyiv would constitute a “redeployment, not a withdrawal”, Reuters reports. The official warned: We believe any movement of Russian forces from around Kyiv is a redeployment, not a withdrawal. And the world should be prepared for continued major offensives against other areas of Ukraine. They added: They are shifting gears ... No one should mistake that for Russia ending the conflict. Separately, a US official told the BBC that some Russian forces are moving away from the Ukrainian capital. Yes, we have seen the Russians begin to draw away from Kyiv. But we have little confidence at this stage that it marks some significant shift or a meaningful retreat. The Russians are still pounding Kyiv with airstrikes. Time will tell. Here are some images from the aftermath of a Russian strike on a government building in the Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv on Tuesday morning. At least seven people were killed and 22 injured, Ukraine’s president, Volodmyr Zelenskiy, said. Authorities are still searching for more survivors in the rubble. Ruth Michaelson has been following the peace talks for us from Istanbul, and sends this latest dispatch from the Turkish city: Russian and Ukrainian negotiators arrived in the early morning hours at Istanbul’s Dolmabahçe Palace to conduct talks in a formal setting, shielded from a media scrum assembled at the entrance. The delegations conducted delicate negotiations facing one another at a long conference table inside a stone-walled room, with pictures of the meeting showing Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich seated at a small nearby table alongside Turkish presidential spokesman İbrahim Kalın. The discussions followed a short opening speech by The Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who addressed them from a lectern, telling them: The world is waiting for good news, and good news from you. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to present Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweeted “unconditional security guarantees for Ukraine, ceasefire, effective decisions on humanitarian corridors and humanitarian convoys, observance by the parties of the rules and customs of war. Difficult negotiations for peace in our country. Istanbul round right now,” with a picture that showed him embracing another member of one of the delegations. Despite the difficulties of the talks, the results appeared warmer and more productive than previous sessions in Belarus or talks between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers in the southern Turkish city of Antalya. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, told a press conference that “we see with satisfaction that both sides are getting closer at every stage,” and expressed hopes that the foreign ministers and later perhaps even Zelenskiy and Vladimir Putin would meet. Ukrainian and Turkish diplomats later said that the Istanbul talks were not scheduled to continue into a second day. Yet after the initial formal meeting, discussions between both Ukrainian and Russian representatives continued apace at the glitzy Shangri-La hotel adjacent to the Dolmabahçe Palace. Podolyak resisted further questions from journalists and disappeared from view under the crystal chandeliers in the hotel lobby. But out on the sunlit terrace of the Shangri-La’s seafood and burger restaurant, Abramovich sat and talked intently with Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov, with whom he reportedly previously held a series of talks in Istanbul under Kalin’s supervision. Umerov and Abramovich reportedly suffered symptoms consistent with poisoning during their previous series of unofficial talks. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba told Ukraine’s channel 24 television prior to the meeting: I advise anyone going through negotiations with the Russian Federation not to eat or drink anything, and preferably avoid touching any surface. The restaurant’s long terrace overlooks the Bosphorus and the adjacent bustling Beşiktaş ferry stop, with travellers hurrying past seemingly unaware of their proximity to the group or their furtive negotiations. Abramovich, drinking a tulip-shaped glass of Turkish black tea under heavy security, sat with his back to the adjacent boardwalk as he leaned in to talk with Umerov, later joined by Ukrainian parliamentary leader and head of the delegation David Arakhamia. The rest of the Ukrainian delegation, including the defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, wearing military green, were seated at the far end of the terrace, later getting up to reveal a forest of half-empty wine glasses. Abramovich, Umerov and Arakhamia moved into the restaurant’s interior away from public view, soon joined by Reznikov, who strolled inside after them. Once inside, Abramovich peeled off to sit on a plush sofa alone to make a phone call, accompanied only by his glass of tea while Arakhamia joined other members of the Ukrainian delegation at a large table laden with food. Despite the restaurant’s extensive menu and large fridge advertising its stock of dry-aged meat, Abramovich did not appear to eat during the entire meeting. He later followed Umerov and other members of the Ukrainian delegation, clutching stuffed blue binders, to another area of the restaurant to continue their discussions well into the late afternoon, hours after the official talks had ended. Outside under the bright lobby lights, a Ukrainian general strolled across the marble floor next to an accompanying diplomat, who fell asleep in an armchair while clutching a briefcase, exhausted from the day’s events. It is almost 7.15pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand now: A Russian airstrike hit a government building in the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv on Tuesday, destroying a large portion of the structure and leaving people trapped under debris. At least seven people were killed and 22 injured, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told the Danish parliament in a video address. Russia has said it will significantly cut back its military activity in northern Ukraine after “meaningful” progress at peace talks in Istanbul. In a potentially significant shift more than a month after the start of the invasion, Russia’s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, said Moscow would “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv”. However, Moscow’s lead negotiator in talks with Ukraine, Vladimir Medinsky, said Russia’s promise to “drastically reduce” military operations does not represent a ceasefire. In an interview with the Russian state-owned Tass news agency, Medinsky said there is still “a long way to go” to reach a mutual agreement with Ukraine. Following Russia’s announcement, two senior US officials said the US said it is seeing Russia beginning to withdraw some of its forces from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in what it believes is a “major” change in Russian strategy. Large numbers of military vehicles with Russian flags were reportedly seen retreating from the Kyiv direction. The US officials warned that Russia could always reverse their latest move. The UK has seen signs of “some reduction” in Russian bombardment around the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, Downing Street said, but it insisted the UK will judge tentative steps towards a possible peace deal by actions rather than words. “We don’t want to see anything less than a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory,” the PM’s spokesperson said. Ukraine called for “an international mechanism of security guarantees” similar to Nato’s article 5, which commits alliance members to defend one another. The senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said the guarantee would involve countries such as the US, UK, Turkey, France and Germany being “legally actively involved in protecting [Ukraine] from any aggression”. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said Moscow’s “main goal” in Ukraine was now the “liberation” of the Donbas region. In a sign that Moscow may be switching to more limited objectives after facing fierce Ukrainian resistance in the first month of the war, Shoigu claimed the “main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed”. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) called on Russia and Ukraine to reach a clear agreement for the safe evacuation of civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol and other frontline places as vital supplies run out. “Time is running out” for people in Mariupol, it warned, adding that there was still a lack of “concrete agreements” for the safe passage and evacuations of civilians in the southern Ukrainian city. The Kremlin dismissed reports that Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich suffered symptoms consistent with poisoning during an informal round of talks earlier this month. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the reports were false and “part of the information war”. A Ukrainian soldier who told a Russian warship to “go fuck yourself” while defending an island has been awarded for his services, local authorities said. Roman Hrybov was serving on Snake Island – known as Zmiinyi Island in Ukrainian – when it came under Russian air and sea bombardment on 24 February. Ukraine’s defence ministry said Hrybov was released from Russian captivity and is now home in Cherkasy. A £38m superyacht owned by an unnamed Russian businessman has been detained in Canary Wharf in London as part of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The vessel, known as Phi, is subject to the first detention of a superyacht in UK waters, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said, and its owner was “deliberately well hidden”. Hello, I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll continue to bring you all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. You can reach me on Twitter or via email. A Ukrainian soldier who told a Russian warship to “go fuck yourself” while defending an island has been awarded for his services, local authorities said. Roman Hrybov, a Ukrainian border guard, was serving on Snake Island – known as Zmiinyi Island in Ukrainian – when it came under Russian air and sea bombardment on 24 February. Initial reports said 13 border guards had died after refusing to surrender the island. When asked to lay down their weapons, the soldiers are said to have responded to an officer on board the Russian warship with a defiant: “Russian warship, go fuck yourself.” It later emerged that the soldiers had survived. The phrase became a rallying cry for Ukraine’s defenders and was commemorated in a postage stamp by the Ukrainian postal service. Ukraine’s defence ministry said Hrybov was released from Russian captivity and is now home in Cherkasy. Four Russian officials have been expelled from Ireland for “activities not in accordance with diplomatic behaviour, the Irish department of foreign affairs has said. It will keep diplomatic relations open and allow the Russian embassy to remain open. The move comes weeks after an RTÉ documentary raised questions about the function of the expansive embassy site in Dublin. In a statement, the DFA said: This afternoon, the Department of Foreign Affairs summoned the Russian Ambassador to Iveagh House to advise him that four senior officials have been asked to leave the State. This is because their activities have not been in accordance with international standards of diplomatic behaviour. This action is being taken under Article 9 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The Government continues to believe that diplomatic channels between Ireland and the Russian Federation should remain open. This is in the interests of our citizens as well as to ensure that we can continue to have a diplomatic channel of communication between Ireland and the Russian Federation in the future. This channel of communication has been important in the context of conveying our strong views on the Russian Federation’s war against Ukraine, which we regard as a serious breach of international law. The UK has seen signs of “some reduction” in Russian bombardment around the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, Downing Street said. However, the UK wants to see a full withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine and will judge tentative steps towards a possible peace deal by actions rather than words, Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said. Asked if the PM was encouraged by Russia’s promise to scale down military operations around Kyiv and northern Ukraine, Johnson’s spokesperson said: We will judge Putin and his regime by his actions, not by his words. He told reporters: There has been some reduction in Russian bombardment around Kyiv, largely because Ukrainian forces have been successfully pushing back the Russian offensives in the northwest of the city. But fighting continues. There’s heavy bombardment in Mariupol and other areas. So we don’t want to see anything less than a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory. Russia’s promise to “drastically reduce” military operations around Kyiv and northern Ukraine does not represent a ceasefire, Moscow’s lead negotiator in talks with Ukraine, Vladimir Medinsky, said. In an interview with the Russian state-owned Tass news agency, Medinsky said there is still “a long way to do” to reach a mutual agreement with Ukraine. He said: This is not a ceasefire but this is our aspiration, gradually to reach a de-escalation of the conflict at least on these fronts. The US is seeing Russia beginning to withdraw some of its forces from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in what it believes is a change in Russian strategy in Ukraine, senior US military officials said. The US is already observing a major strategy shift after Russia’s defence ministry announced earlier today that it would “drastically reduce” military activity outside Kyiv and Chernihiv, according to two senior US officials. Russia is beginning to withdraw some forces, including Russian Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs) leaving the surrounding areas around the Ukrainian capital, CNN cited the officials as saying. The Russian forces now pulling back in some areas of the north to focus on gains in the south and east. The officials warned that Russia could always reverse their latest move. From CNN’s Jim Sciutto: Large numbers of military vehicles with Russian flags were reportedly seen retreating from the Kyiv direction. However, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he has not seen “signs of real seriousness” from Russia in pursuing peace, adding that Moscow should “end the aggression now, stop firing, pull its forces back and of course engage in talks”. Speaking today at a joint press conference with Morocco’s foreign minister, Nasser Bourita, Blinken said he has not seen signs the talks between Ukraine and Russia are “moving forward in an effective way”. There is what Russia says, and there is what Russia does. We’re focused on the latter. Ukraine’s military said it had noted withdrawals of some forces around Kyiv and Chernihiv. Boris Johnson told a meeting of senior ministers that a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine would not be enough to trigger the lifting of UK sanctions, Downing Street said. The PM’s spokesperson suggested a full withdrawal would be a good start but a ceasefire was only the first step towards that, telling reporters: The prime minister said a ceasefire alone would not be cause for UK sanctions to be removed on Russia. He said the pressure on (Russian president Vladimir) Putin must be increased both through further economic measures and providing military aid to ensure Russia changes course completely. He added: I think as ever, we will judge Putin by his actions. A Russian airstrike hit a government building in the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv on Tuesday, destroying a large portion of the structure and leaving people trapped under debris. British cybersecurity agency NCSC has published a special blog advising businesses to review their IT security as the war between Russia and Ukraine continues - although it stressed while there have been “ongoing cyber-attacks” by Russia against Ukraine “we’ve not seen – and don’t expect to see – the massive, global cyber-attacks that some have predicted”. The agency urged businesses and individuals to remain alert nevertheless and keep software patched and up to date, because the overall cybersecurity environment remains uncertain while the war between the countries continues. Officials also advised that any British business that relies on Russian software should “reconsider their risk” if they operate in the wider public sector, provide services related to the UK’s critical infrastructure, do business with Ukraine or are in any way high profile, where any hack would represent “a PR win for Russia”. This was in case the Kremlin tried to force Russian software companies to “cause damage to UK interests”, said Ian Levy, NCSC’s technical director. He said that “we have no evidence the Russian state intends to suborn Russian commercial products and service”, but warned “the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence”. He added: The war has proven many widely held beliefs wrong and the situation remains highly unpredictable. In our view, it would be prudent to plan for the possibility that this could happen. There has been a flurry of diplomatic activity in the Benelux. Belgium has just announced that it is expelling 21 Russian diplomats for spying. The Netherlands is doing the same with 17 others. In the UK, the chief of the defence staff, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, told the cabinet that Britain’s support was moving to a “new phase” as the Ukrainians sought to retake territory captured by the Russians. The prime minister’s spokesperson said they were looking at “all possible options” to ensure the Ukrainians had the equipment they needed while avoiding any “escalatory effects”. Asked what he meant by this, PA Media reports that the prime minister’s official spokesperson said it reflected “different asks of us as we provide further defensive aid, military capability”. “Obviously they are in a different phase in their situation. First there was the invasion and now they are seeking to both defend and also regain territory,” he said. Asked if this meant sending more offensive rather than defensive weaponry, the spokesman said the UK did not want to do anything that had any “escalatory effects”, but he said: “We are considering all possible options when it comes to making sure the Ukrainian government have what they need to defend themselves.” He added: “Now, we are looking at what further equipment and what capabilities we can provide but I’m not going to get into what that might entail at this stage.” He said as well as working with Nato, the UK was in conversation directly with the Ukrainian government and was delivering equipment directly to the country. It should be noted that these quotes pre-date the information that has been coming out of the peace talks in Istanbul, with Russia suggesting it may scale down military activity in the west of Ukraine around Kyiv. Here is the video clip of what could prove to be a significant shift in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Speaking on television after talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiating teams in Istanbul, Russia’s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, said Moscow had decided to “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv” in order to “increase mutual trust” and create the right conditions to sign a peace deal with Ukraine. Ruth Michaelson has been following the peace talks for us from Istanbul, and sends this latest dispatch from the Turkish city: Tuesday’s talks in Istanbul signalled the first signs of progress in discussions between the Russian and Ukrainian sides, despite the fact that the three-hour meeting started late and appeared to finish almost an hour ahead of schedule. Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, accompanied by the majority leader and head of the Ukrainian delegation David Arakhamia and MP Rustem Umerov, retired immediately following the official talks to a luxury restaurant on a terrace at the adjacent Shangri-La hotel overlooking the Bosphorus, where Abramovich drank tea under heavy security and the group appeared to continue their discussions. Abramovich and Umerov reportedly previously held a series of meetings in Istanbul as a parallel track to official negotiations under the supervision of Turkish presidential adviser, İbrahim Kalın. The meeting at the restaurant did not initially appear to include the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, who told journalists following the negotiations that “the results of today’s meeting are sufficient for a meeting at the leaders’ level”. Ukrainian defence minister Olekseii Reznikov, wearing military green, followed Abramovich, Umerov and Arakhamia to a different location in the restaurant interior to continue discussions away from public view. Ukrainian negotiators stated following the official talks that the sides had discussed their demands for “security guarantees” at length, agreeing that Ukraine could remain “neutral” in exchange for protections equivalent to Nato’s article 5, meaning collective security guaranteed by other nations. They also discussed the future status of the Crimean peninsula, adding “Donetsk and Lugansk are a slightly different issue, the presidents will resolve it among themselves.” Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu told a press conference that “we see with satisfaction that both sides are getting closer at every stage”. Çavuşoğlu added that the Istanbul meeting will hopefully prompt a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers, followed by a potential meeting of both leaders, long a request of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. “The greatest progress was made during today’s talks,” he said. A quick snap from Reuters that in comments broadcast on state media, Russia’s chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said that Kyiv’s proposals to Moscow at talks in Istanbul included one that Russia would not oppose Ukraine joining the European Union. Here is a selection of some of the latest images of the Ukraine crisis to land on the newswires: Angela Giuffrida reports for us from Italy: A luxury car worth €600,000 and built to withstand bullets and explosives has been seized in Sardinia as part of EU sanctions against oligarchs with close links to Vladimir Putin. The black Mercedes Maybach S650 Guard belongs to Alisher Usmanov, an ex-shareholder in Arsenal football club, and was recently seized by police in Porto Cervo on the Costa Smeralda, Corriere della Sera reported on Tuesday. Usmanov is said to own several properties on the island, but it is not clear whether they have been seized too. Corriere said the “maximum protection” car was bought from a company in Sardinia in 2018. Usmanov, once said to be the UK’s richest person, last week claimed that millions of pounds of his assets are in an irrevocable trust. Russian oligarchs have long gravitated to Porto Cervo during the summer and other key hotspots in luxury. In early March, Italian police seized a yacht owned by Alexei Mordashov, the richest man in Russia before being blacklisted by the European Union, and another owned by Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire with close ties to Putin, in the Ligurian port of Imperia. Ecumenical patriarch Bartholomew I, the spiritual leader of the Eastern Orthodox Christians worldwide, has denounced the invasion of Ukraine as an “atrocious” act that is causing enormous suffering during a visit to Warsaw. Although he did not denounce Russia by name, he said: “It is simply impossible to imagine how much devastation this atrocious invasion has caused for the Ukrainian people and the entire world,” at a news briefing. He added that solidarity with Ukrainians “is the only thing that can overcome evil and darkness in the world”. Bartholomew also met with Archbishop Stanisaw Gdecki, the head of the Polish Bishops’ Conference. Associated Press quote him going further with a condemnation of Russia, saying that Russia’s invasion has resulted in the deaths of “thousands of innocent people” including “hundreds of children, elderly people, women, and men who had nothing to do with the hostilities”. “Many of the aggressor’s actions bear the hallmarks of genocide,” Gdecki said. The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, has defended the attack on Ukraine, writing in a letter on 10 March that “This conflict did not start today. It is my firm belief that its initiators are not the peoples of Russia and Ukraine, who came from one Kievan baptismal font, are united by common faith, common saints and prayers, and share common historical fate. The origins of the confrontation lie in the relationships between the west and Russia.” A Russian rocket that struck a regional administration building in the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv today has left at least seven people dead and 22 injured, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. Speaking in a video address to the Danish parliament today, the Ukrainian president said: As far as we know now seven people were killed, 22 were wounded, and people are still going through the rubble. He added: There were no military ambitions in Mykolaiv, the people in Mykolaiv presented no threat to Russia. And even then, like all the Ukrainians, they became the targets for the Russian troops. Eighteen of the wounded were pulled from the rubble by rescue workers, who continue to work at the scene, the emergencies service said in an online post. Vitaly Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, said in a series of video posts that dozens of people had managed to flee from the building before it was hit. There were reports of air raid sirens in Mykolaiv on Tuesday morning. President Zelenskiy told the Danish parliament that the Russian siege of the port city of Mariupol constituted a “crime against humanity”. What the Russian troops are doing to Mariupol is a crime against humanity, which is happening in front of the eyes of the whole planet in real time. A Ukrainian negotiator said a “security guarantees” treaty with an “enhanced analogue” of Nato’s “article 5” collective defence clause was discussed during today’s talks with Russia in Istanbul. From Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy and the lead negotiator in talks with Russia: Russia’s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, said Moscow has decided to “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernigiv” in order to “increase mutual trust and create the right conditions for future negotiations and reach the final aim of signing a peace deal with Ukraine”. Fomin added that the Russian delegation will give more details on the decision to reduce military activity on their return to Moscow. Speaking alongside Fomin, Russia’s chief negotiator Vladimir Medisnky said the talks were “constructive”, adding that Russia was taking “two steps to de-escalate the conflict”. Medinsky said: We received proposals from Ukraine to consider their clearly formulated position on inclusion in the peace treaty. These proposals will be looked at in the coming period and delivered to the President, and an answer will be given. Medinsky also said that a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy was possible in the future. The meeting between Putin and Zelensky is possible simultaneously with the preliminary signing of a peace treaty. Here’s more from Ukrainian negotiators following their first face-to-face talks with the Russian delegation in nearly three weeks. The Ukrainian team said it proposed adopting neutral status in exchange for security guarantees, meaning it would not join military alliances or host military bases. The proposals would also include a 15-year consultation period on the status of annexed Crimea and could come into force only in the event of a complete ceasefire, the negotiators told reporters in Istanbul. The proposals are the most detailed and concrete that Ukraine has aired publicly, Reuters reports. Negotiator Oleksander Chaly said in comments broadcast on Ukrainian national television: If we manage to consolidate these key provisions, and for us this is the most fundamental, then Ukraine will be in a position to actually fix its current status as a non-bloc and non-nuclear state in the form of permanent neutrality. He added: We will not host foreign military bases on our territory, as well as deploy military contingents on our territory, and we will not enter into military-political alliances. Military exercises on our territory will take place with the consent of the guarantor countries. There was enough material in the current Ukrainian proposals to warrant a meeting between the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, the Ukrainian negotiators said, adding they were awaiting Russia’s response. Russia’s defence ministry said Russia will “drastically reduce” military activity outside Kyiv and Chernihiv. Speaking on television after talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiating teams in Istanbul, Russia’s deputy defence minister said Moscow has decided to “fundamentally cut back military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv” in order to “increase mutual trust for future negotiations to agree and sign a peace deal with Ukraine.” From the Financial Times’ Max Seddon: Ukrainian negotiators have shared some details of what was covered at today’s talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul, the two delegations’ first face-to-face meeting in more than a fortnight. Ukraine proposed adopting neutral status in exchange for security guarantees, meaning it would not join military alliances or host military bases, Ukrainian negotiators told reporters. The proposals would also include a 15-year consultation period on the status of annexed Crimea and could come into force only in the event of a complete ceasefire, Reuters reports. A superyacht has been detained in London as part of sanctions against Russia, the UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has announced. Officials boarded Phi, owned by a Russian businessman, in Canary Wharf, east London, on Tuesday. The vessel is the first to be detained in the UK under sanctions imposed because of the war in Ukraine. Phi – named after the mathematical concept – made its maiden voyage last year after being built in the Netherlands. It is 58.5 metres and features what is described as an “infinite wine cellar” and a freshwater swimming pool. The vessel was in London for a superyacht awards ceremony and was due to depart at noon on Tuesday. Shapps said: Today we’ve detained a £38m superyacht and turned an icon of Russia’s power and wealth into a clear and stark warning to Putin and his cronies. Detaining the Phi proves, yet again, that we can and will take the strongest possible action against those seeking to benefit from connections to Putin’s regime. The Department for Transport (DfT) said it worked with the National Crime Agency and the Border Force maritime investigation bureau to identify and detain the vessel. It refused to reveal the name of the owner. The department described Phi’s ownership as “deliberately well-hidden”. The vessel is registered to a company based in Saint Kitts and Nevis and carries a Maltese flag. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has called on Russia and Ukraine to reach a clear agreement for the safe evacuation of civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol and other frontline places as vital supplies run out. “Time is running out” for people in Mariupol, it warned, adding that there was still a lack of “concrete agreements” for the safe passage and evacuations of civilians in the southern Ukrainian city. In a statement, it said: Today, civilians are taking the life-and-death decision to flee when there is no ceasefire or other agreements in place that would allow them to leave safely. Robert Mardini, the aid agency’s director-general, told Reuters that the ICRC would not participate in any forced evacuations of civilians from Ukraine and it had no first-hand information that this is happening. Our concern is that the very intensity of the fighting is putting civilians in harm’s way, the fact that in places like Mariupol civilians are not able to leave in safe conditions, there were no concrete agreements by parties to the conflict for safe evacuation of civilians, nor has there been a green light to get humanitarian aid in. The meeting between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators in Istanbul has ended, the Ukrainian Embassy in Turkey said. The talks lasted around four hours with occasional breaks. It is unclear if the discussions will continue for a second day, Reuters reports. A Russian rocket hit the regional administration building in the southern Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv today, killing at least three people and wounding 22, local authorities said. In an online post, emergency services said 18 of the wounded were pulled from the rubble by rescue workers, who continue to work at the scene. Reuters cited witnesses who saw the destruction from a distance and ambulances and fire engines heading to the scene. Regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said: They destroyed half of the building, got into my office. Ruth Michaelson is in Istanbul to cover the peace talks for us. She sends this report: “I advise anyone going through negotiations with the Russian Federation not to eat or drink anything, and preferably avoid touching any surface,” Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba reportedly told delegates. Pictures from inside the negotiations, expected to stretch into the afternoon, suggest Kuleba’s instructions might be a challenge. While Abramovich’s presence inside the negotiation room alongside Kalin, who reportedly arranged a series of talks between him and Umerov at five-star hotels across Istanbul, suggested to some that this parallel track of negotiations might have ended in favour of these official talks, others were not convinced. “A presence in the room doesn’t mean the parallel track has collapsed,” said Sinan Ülgen, of the Istanbul think-tank the Centre for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies (EDAM). “We can read into [Abramovich’s presence] is the receptivity of both Kyiv and Moscow to Turkey’s involvement. Not only is Turkey acting formally as a facilitator but it also has an active role in this second track of diplomacy to defuse the conflict.” “From a Turkish perspective, what matters is that Turkey remains a central piece of diplomatic efforts going forward, first to agree on a ceasefire and then to reach a political settlement,” he said. “I would pay particular attention if, at the end of the talks, the two sides issue a statement outlining some degree of convergence.” However Ülgen added that observers should temper their expectations from today’s talks, after previous rounds of negotiations in Belarus and in the southern Turkish city of Antalya yielded few results. “I think we should not harbour any big expectations from this specific round of talks. I think the dynamics on the ground are not very suitable to this type of...more positive expectations,” he added. Here’s more from Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, who said relations between Russia and the US would inevitably be affected by “personal insults” by the US President, Joe Biden, directed at his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Personal insults cannot but leave their mark on relations between heads of state. However, Peskov said: One way or another, sooner or later, we will have to speak about questions of strategic stability and security and so on. The Kremlin was referring to unscripted remarks made by Biden at a speech in Poland at the weekend, in which the US president said Putin “cannot remain in power”. On Monday, Biden defended his remarks and denied that he was seeking “regime change” as a new policy. “I’m not walking anything back,” Biden said. I was expressing the moral outrage I felt … I had just come from being with those families. But I want to be clear that I wasn’t then, nor am I now, articulating a policy change. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday dismissed reports that Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich suffered symptoms consistent with poisoning during an informal round of talks earlier this month, calling the reports “part of the information war”. Peskov said during his daily call with reporters: This is part of the information panic, part of the information sabotage, information war. These reports are not true…it is necessary to strongly filter the flow of information. Peskov further confirmed that Abramovich was part of the talks in Istanbul that will kick off today, but said the Russian billionaire was not an official member of the delegation. Abramovich is involved in ensuring certain contacts between the Russian and Ukrainian sides. There was photographic evidence to confirm that Abramovich is indeed in the room this morning with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said Moscow’s “main goal” in Ukraine was now the “liberation” of the Donbas region, a sign that Moscow may be switching to more limited objectives after facing fierce Ukrainian resistance in the first month of the war. Russian state news agency Interfax quoted Shoigu as saying on Tuesday: The main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed. The combat potential of the Ukrainian armed forces has been significantly reduced, which makes it possible to focus our main attention and main efforts on achieving the main goal – the liberation of Donbas. Shoigu further claimed that the Ukrainian air force and the air defence system have been “practically destroyed” and that Russia now controlled the skies. Last Friday, a spokesperson of Russia’s defence ministry also said that the first phase of its military operation was “generally” complete, saying the country would focus on the “liberation” of Ukraine’s Luhansk region and Donetsk region, jointly known as the Donbas. The country’s forces, however, have continued their action on several battlefronts across Ukraine over the weekend, including attacking the western city of Lviv, where a Russian cruise missile slammed into a fuel depot. Russia has been shifting its objectives in Ukraine throughout the war, as the country failed to secure a quick victory over Ukraine. The Financial Times on Monday reported that the Kremlin no longer requested Ukraine be “denazified” and “demilitarised”, initial core demands that Russian president Vladimir Putin raised to justify the invasion. The two sides will hold highly anticipated peace talks in Istanbul today, but some Ukrainian officials have warned Russia could be using the talks as an opportunity to regroup and fix its tactical and logistical issues. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said Ukraine’s military capacity had been seriously degraded, adding that the main tasks of the first phase of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine had been completed, Reuters reports. Speaking to officials in a televised meeting, Shoigu also warned that Russia would respond appropriately if Nato supplied Ukraine with planes and air defence systems. Interfax news agency reports that Shoigu said Ukraine no longer has a navy, and that the main task of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine now is “liberating” Donbas. Hello. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Fresh talks between Ukraine and Russia have begun in Istanbul, with Kyiv seeking a ceasefire without compromising on its sovereignty or territorial integrity and both sides playing down hopes of an early breakthrough. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, opened the talks – the two delegations’ first face-to-face meeting in more than a fortnight – at the Dolmabahçe Palace in Istanbul, urging both sets of negotiators to “put an end to this tragedy”. The Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich was in attendance – and talks started with “a cold welcome and no handshake”. The International Committee of the Red Cross called on Ukraine and Russia to reach a clear agreement for the safe evacuation of civilians from the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol and other places as vital supplies run out. Robert Mardini, ICRC director general, said the neutral aid agency would not participate in any forced evacuations of civilians from Ukraine and it had no first-hand information that this is happening. He also said there was a “disinformation campaign” against the ICRC on social media. Ukraine hopes to open three humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from besieged towns and cities today, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. The main government building in Mykolaiv in Ukraine has been struck and damaged by a missile strike. There are no reports of fatalities but eight people are said to be trapped under the rubble. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed it has destroyed a major fuel depot in Ukraine’s Rivne region. The UK’s Ministry of Defence released its latest intelligence report on the situation unfolding in Ukraine, claiming Ukrainian forces are continuing to conduct localised counterattacks outside Kyiv. Ukraine’s military also released its latest operational report as of 6am this morning and appears to corroborate with British intelligence, claiming its forces carried out successful counterattacks in some directions. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged for sanctions packages to be “effective and substantial” and called for countries to keep supplying weapons to Ukraine. “Ukrainians should not die just because someone cannot find enough courage to hand over the necessary weapons to Ukraine,” he said. “Fear always makes you an accomplice.” Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has tweeted to call upon states around the world to criminalise the use of the “Z” symbol as a way to publicly support Russia’s war of aggression. Finland’s security service said it expects neighbouring Russia to mount a campaign of disinformation over the coming months to influence the Nordic nation’s debate over joining Nato. The Russian foreign ministry is summoning ambassadors from the Baltic states to announce the expulsion of diplomats. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back a little later on. I am now handing over to Léonie Chao-Fong who will guide you through the next few hours of developments in the war. A quick snap from Reuters that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, is due to talk to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, later today. At the weekend, Macron warned against inflammatory remarks after the US president, Joe Biden, said Putin “cannot remain in power”, words that Biden has stood by. Macron is in the middle of a domestic election campaign. Here is a round-up of this morning’s latest diplomatic developments from my colleague Jon Henley: Fresh talks between Ukraine and Russia have begun in Istanbul, with Kyiv seeking a ceasefire without compromising on its sovereignty or territorial integrity and both sides playing down hopes of an early breakthrough. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, opened the talks – the two delegations’ first face-to-face meeting in more than a fortnight – at the Dolmabahçe Palace in Istanbul, urging both sets of negotiators to “put an end to this tragedy”. With Russia’s invasion appearing stalled on the ground, Erdogan said each side had “legitimate concerns” but added: “We have now entered a period where concrete results are needed. It should be “possible to reach a solution acceptable to the international community”, he said, with further conflict “in no one’s interest”. Ukrainian media said the talks – with the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich in attendance – started with “a cold welcome and no handshake”. Mykhailo Podolyak, a political adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymr Zelenskiy, said delegations were working on “the entire spectrum of contentious issues”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the least he was hoping for was an end to the country’s humanitarian catastrophe, and the most was a ceasefire. “We are not trading people, land or sovereignty,” he insisted. “If we see that the mood has changed and they are ready for a serious, substantive conversation and balanced arrangements, then things will move forward,” Kuleba said. He said if it was a “repetition of their propaganda”, then talks would again fail. Read more of Jon Henley’s round-up here: Ukraine-Russia peace talks start in Turkey amid warnings they may again fail Our correspondent Ruth Michaelson is in Istanbul, and brings us this analysis of the presence of sanctioned oligarch Roman Abramovich in today’s peace talks: Roman Abramovich and Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov had reportedly arranged a series of talks between them at five-star hotels across Istanbul. Abramovich’s presence inside the negotiation room alongside Turkish presidential spokesperson İbrahim Kalın suggested to some that this parallel track of negotiations might have ended in favour of these official talks. But others were not convinced. “A presence in the room doesn’t mean the parallel track has collapsed,” said Sinan Ülgen, of the Istanbul thinktank the Centre for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies (EDAM). “We can read into [Abramovich’s presence] the receptivity of both Kyiv and Moscow to Turkey’s involvement. Not only is Turkey acting formally as a facilitator but it also has an active role in this second track of diplomacy to diffuse the conflict.” “From a Turkish perspective, what matters is that Turkey remains a central piece of diplomatic efforts going forward, first to agree on a ceasefire and then to reach a political settlement,” he said. “I would pay particular attention if, at the end of the talks, the two sides issue a statement outlining some degree of convergence.” However, Ülgen added that observers should temper their expectations from today’s talks, after previous rounds of negotiations in Belarus and in the southern Turkish city of Antalya yielded few results. “I think we should not harbour any big expectations from this specific round of talks. I think the dynamics on the ground are not very suitable to this type of … more positive expectations,” he added. On the theme of disinformation, Finland expects neighbouring Russia to mount a campaign of disinformation in coming months to influence the Nordic nation’s debate over joining Nato, the Finnish security service Supo said today. In an updated assessment the agency said that “broad influencing and unlawful intelligence operations” by Russia were among the main threats to Finland’s national security. “Finnish society as a whole should be prepared for various measures from Russia seeking to influence policymaking in Finland on the Nato issue,” Supo director Antti Pelttari said. “Public authorities must secure the conditions for a full and frank debate without intimidation, and ensure that outsiders are unable to influence security policy decisions made by Finland.” Opinion polls show Finnish willingness to join Nato has soared following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, indicating for the first time a majority in favour of becoming a member. A taskforce led by Finnish foreign minister Pekka Haavisto is currently reviewing ways for Finland to strengthen its national security, including possible Nato membership. Supo said it has, however, as yet seen no significant change in Russian operations targeting Finland, the agency added. The International Committee of the Red Cross called on Ukraine and Russia to reach a clear agreement for the safe evacuation of civilians from the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol and other places as vital supplies run out. Robert Mardini, ICRC director general, told Reuters that the neutral aid agency would not participate in any forced evacuations of civilians from Ukraine and it had no first-hand information that this is happening. He also said there was a “disinformation campaign” against the ICRC on social media. “Our concern is that the very intensity of the fighting is putting civilians in harm’s way, the fact that in places like Mariupol civilians are not able to leave in safe conditions, there were no concrete agreements by parties to the conflict for safe evacuation of civilians, nor has there been a green light to get humanitarian aid in,” Mardini said. Ukraine and Russia must allow the ICRC to visit captured prisoners of war, in line with the Geneva conventions, and return the remains of people killed in the conflict, he said in an interview at ICRC headquarters in Geneva. We have the very first read-out from talks in Istanbul coming out in brief on Reuters at the moment. The key points to have emerged so far are: Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky has said there will be a statement after the talks, in several hours. Russia say they have protested to the Ukraine delegation over the alleged abuse of Russian prisoners – no doubt a reference to the video circulating purporting to show the torture of Russian prisoners of war. Ukraine’s presidential advisor has said the main issue for Ukraine at the talks is security guarantees, with humanitarian issues second. Ruth Michaelson is in Istanbul to cover the peace talks for us. She sends this report: Russian and Ukrainian negotiators arrived at Istanbul’s opulent Dolmabahçe Palace for talks early this morning, although talks didn’t start until after 11am local time according to the Ukrainian side. Ukrainian television reported the talks began with “a cold welcome” and no handshake between the delegations as things kicked off. “The eyes of the world were turned to this meeting, where the ministers of the two warring countries sat at the same table,” reported Turkish daily Hurriyet. The meeting itself is closed to the press, corralled outside between the aptly named Shangri-La hotel and Istanbul’s naval museum on the bustling street outside, awaiting statements expected to come from the Ukrainian side. Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, who previously held part of parallel talks with the Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov in Istanbul, had a front row seat as the talks started. Pictures of Abramovich wearing a translation headset and sitting next to Turkish presidential spokesperson İbrahim Kalın quickly spread across Turkish media, after reports that Abramovich and Umerov were poisoned during previous negotiation efforts. Here are some of the latest images to have appeared on the newswires today from Ukraine: Reuters has a direct quote from Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, addressing the start of peace talks in Istanbul. He told delegates: It is up to the sides to stop this tragedy. Achieving a ceasefire and peace as soon as possible is to the benefit of everyone. We think we have now entered a period where concrete results are needed from talk. The negotiating process, which you have been carrying out under the orders of your leaders, has raised hopes for peace. There is also photographic evidence to confirm that sanctioned oligarch Roman Abramovich is indeed in the room. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted on Twitter to say he had thanked Czech prime minister Petr Fiala, saying “he noted the significant humanitarian and security assistance, exceptional treatment of Ukrainians who found temporary shelter in the Czech Republic”. Fiala himself has just announced that he has tested positive for Covid and will be isolating for a week. The main government building in Mykolaiv in Ukraine has been struck and damaged by a missile strike this morning, according to a post on Telegram by the regional governor Vitaliy Kim. There are no reports of fatalities but eight people are said to be trapped under the rubble. Ukrainian journalist Oleh Novikov has pictures from the scene. Kim has clearly not entirely lost his sense of humour during the war, because he has said on his Telegram video post that it means Russia can’t be trying to take the city any more, as if they were planning to occupy it they would have needed these offices. Mykolaiv is near the south coast of Ukraine, between Odesa and Kherson, and would be a natural target if the Russian military objective is to seize control of a strip of land along that coast. There is another diplomatic development coming along this morning, as the Tass and RIA news agencies in Russia are reporting that the Russian foreign ministry is summoning ambassadors from the Baltic states to announce the expulsion of diplomats. I will bring you more on that when I have it. Ukrainian television is reporting that the peace talks in Istanbul started with “a cold welcome, no handshake”, although it isn’t clear whether reporters witnessed this, or have just been informed this was the case. Mykhailo Podolyak, a political adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymr Zelenskiy, said on Twitter the delegations were discussing “the fundamental provisions of the negotiation process. Delegations are working in parallel on the entire spectrum of contentious issues.” As recently as 24 February this year, every time we wrote about Roman Abramovich we tended to have to carry disclaimers like “Abramovich has vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin and Russia or that he has done anything to merit sanctions being imposed against him” as he had very energetic lawyers. Reuters is quoting two sources saying that Abramovich is in attendance at the Istanbul peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. That suggests the nature of his relationship with Putin has either changed dramatically in the course of the last month, or that Abramovich’s lawyers were somehow previously mistaken. We have some pictures from the opening of the peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul, hosted by Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Two quick snaps from Reuters here – with contrasting implications. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed it has destroyed a major fuel depot in Ukraine’s Rivne region. The Guardian and Reuters have not independently verified this. At the same time, Gazprom has just announced that gas exports to the rest of Europe via Ukraine remain high. The RIA news agency reported that gas has been flowing at a rate of just over 109m cubic metres per day, which is in line with the Kremlin-owned Gazprom’s contractual obligations. Peter Forbes Ricketts, retired senior diplomat and the UK’s former permanent representative to Nato in Brussels, has also been making media appearances in the UK this morning. He told Sky News: We’d all love to think that negotiations could produce a breakthrough and a ceasefire, and I’ve absolutely no doubt that President’s Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian side are totally sincere. But I’m really wary of the Russians here. I don’t honestly see that the conditions are there for a meaningful ceasefire. I think it’s brave of President Zelenskiy to face up to the fact that Ukraine is not going to join Nato anytime soon. He’s interested in security guarantees from the major powers and a neutral status for Ukraine, possibly with the right to join the EU. All these are important, but they’re frankly secondary issues. The key thing is what happens to this territory that Russian forces have occupied. I do not believe that Putin will be willing to give up places like Mariupol, once they do hold it firmly. That’s on the corridor between the east, which Russia already controls, and the south and the Crimean peninsula. I’m afraid his minimum objective is to hold the territory that he’s now occupied. That requires Ukraine to accept, effectively, the partition of their country. And I just find it very hard to imagine that any Ukrainian government could do that. So I’m pretty sceptical about the outcome of these talks, although it’s a good thing people are talking. Ukraine hopes to open three humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from besieged towns and cities today, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. Reuters reports she said this would include trying to establish a safe corridor for people to leave the encircled southern port city of Mariupol in private vehicles. A few more of the words of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, at the start of the peace talks in Istanbul via Reuters. He has said that Turkey sees both President Vladimir Putin and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as “valuable friends”. He has also said that progress in the Istanbul talks can pave the way for a meeting between the two leaders of Ukraine and Russia, which Turkey is also willing to host. Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is addressing the delegates before the process starts. I will hope to have some fuller quotes in due course but initially Reuters have a quick snap that he has said he hopes the meeting will be beneficial for the countries involved and the whole region, that Turkey has shown a fair stance on the conflict at every stage, and that a fair peace will not have a loser. He has called for an immediate ceasefire. Here is a picture of the press scrum which was greeting delegates outside of the venue for the Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul today. In the UK, education minister Will Quince has been doing the media round for the government, and has been asked several question about Ukraine on Sky News. He expressed a wish that any peace talks would be successful, saying “as much as there is scepticism globally about whether these peace talks will be successful, I desperately hope that they are, on any terms that are acceptable to the Ukrainian president and Ukrainian people”. Regarding the allegation of poisoning at a previous round of talks, Quince would not be drawn on the veracity of the claims. He said it was a “worrying development” and that there was “no doubt [the] UK government will be looking to establish the facts there” but that ultimately it was a matter for local authorities. On criticism of the low numbers of refugees being processed and accepted into the UK, he was defensive of the UK government’s two schemes saying: On the family scheme we’ve had about 23,000 people accepted on that scheme and about 8,000 of those are children … I know that number will increase. And then on the other scheme, which is in relation to the homeless Ukrainians, British people have been absolutely incredible. Over 150,000 have expressed an interest. He could not give a number of successful placements yet but said “many are in progress” and added: “I want to thank from the bottom of my heart everyone who’s reached out, seeing those terrible scenes in Ukraine, who is offering up their home.” Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has tweeted to call upon states around the world to criminalise the use of the “Z” symbol as a way to publicly support Russia’s war of aggression: I call on all states to criminalise the use of the ‘Z’ symbol as a way to publicly support Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. ’Z’ means Russian war crimes, bombed out cities, thousands of murdered Ukrainians. Public support of this barbarism must be forbidden. It is Martin Belam taking over from Samantha Lock here – you can get in touch with me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Face-to-face peace talks between Ukraine and Russia are likely to start in Turkey today after negotiators arrived in Istanbul for their first face-to-face talks in more than two weeks. Both sides have played down the chances of a major breakthrough and a senior US official said Vladimir Putin did not appear ready to compromise. The UK’s Ministry of Defence released its latest intelligence report on the situation unfolding in Ukraine, claiming Ukrainian forces are continuing to conduct localised counterattacks outside Kyiv. Ukraine’s military also released its latest operational report as of 6am this morning and appears to corroborate with British intelligence, claiming its forces carried out successful counterattacks in some directions. More than 60 Ukrainian churches and religious buildings have been destroyed and 733 educational institutions damaged by Russian forces since the invasion first began on 24 February, according to Ukraine’s crisis centre (UCMC). A total of 144 children have so far been killed and more than 220 injured as a result of Russia’s invasion, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office has said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged for sanctions packages to be “effective and substantial” and called for countries to keep supplying weapons to Ukraine. “Ukrainians should not die just because someone cannot find enough courage to hand over the necessary weapons to Ukraine,” he said. “Fear always makes you an accomplice.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia feels it is “amongst war” with the west after an array of sanctions were imposed on Russian businesses and individuals. Referencing Russia’s ongoing tension with Nato, Peskov told broadcaster PBS: “For a couple of decades, we were telling the collective west that we are afraid of your Nato’s moving eastwards. We too are afraid of Nato getting closer to our borders with its military infrastructure. Please take care of that. Don’t push us into the corner. No.” Peskov added that “no one is thinking about using” or “even about [the] idea of using a nuclear weapon”. Video footage purporting to show the torture of Russian prisoners of war is being investigated by the Ukrainian government. The film, which has not been verified, appears to show Ukrainian soldiers removing three hooded Russians from a van before shooting them in the legs. Britain’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, accused Putin’s forces of abducting innocent civilians, describing the move as an “abhorrent tactic” after Ukrainian human rights group, ZMINA, claimed to have identified dozens of individuals who had been abducted, with thousands more deported to Russia. The US president, Joe Biden, said he will “make no apologies” after appearing to call for Putin’s removal last week. When asked by a reporter if he regretted saying that Putin should not remain in power, Biden said: “I wasn’t then, nor am I now, articulating a policy change. I was expressing moral outrage that I felt.” Peskov added that “no one is thinking about using” or “even about [the] idea of using a nuclear weapon” in an interview with PBS on Monday evening. Reporter Ryan Chilcote asked Peskov to clear up the confusion surrounding Russia’s position on a possible nuclear attack after the Russian official previously said that Russia would only use nuclear weapons if its very existence were threatened. “So could you please clarify for us what exactly would amount to an existential threat to Russia?” Chilcote asked. Peskov replied: Well, first of all, we have no doubt that all the objectives of our special military operation in Ukraine will be completed. We have no doubt about that. But any outcome of the operation, of course, is not a reason for usage of a nuclear weapon. We have a security concept that very clearly states that only when there is a threat for existence of the state in our country, we can use and we will actually use nuclear weapons to eliminate the threat or the existence of our country.” Chilcote pressed: “So, why not just clear this up right now? Why can’t you, on behalf of Russia, rule out the use of nuclear weapons in this conflict, right here?” Dmitry Peskov replied: “No one is thinking about using, about — even about idea of using a nuclear weapon.” Vladimir Putin’s main spokesman has said that sanctions on trade and oligarchs were akin to “total war” against Russia, and that the west has pushed the Kremlin “into the corner” with Nato expansion, as officials prepare for the resumption of peace talks with Ukraine on Tuesday. Dmitry Peskov said in an interview on American television PBS that the punitive sanctions levelled against Russia were “quite unfriendly” and made the country feel as it were at war with the US and its western allies. Unfortunately, those conditions, they are quite unfriendly. And they are enemy, enemy-like for us. We entered the phase, the phase of a total war. And we in Russia, we will feel ourselves amongst war, because Western European countries, United States, Canada, Australia, they actually — they actually — they are leading war against us in trade, in economy, in seizing our properties, in seizing our funds, in blocking our financial relations. And we have to adapt ourselves to new reality. You have to understand Russia. You have to understand Russia.” Referencing Russia’s ongoing tension with Nato, Peskov said: For a couple of decades, we were telling the collective west that we are afraid of your Nato’s moving eastwards. We too are afraid of Nato getting closer to our borders with its military infrastructure. Please take care of that. Don’t push us into the corner. No. Now we said, listen, guys, we are not happy with this coup in Ukraine. And you have guarantees by Poland, by France and by Germany. You would probably remember the document with the signatures of the relevant foreign ministers. No reaction. Then, we said, listen, guys, we’re not happy with the possibility of Ukraine’s getting into Nato, because it will endanger us additionally, and it will ruin the balance of mutual deterrence in Europe. No reaction. Then we said, listen, guys, we want equal relationship. We want to take into account each other’s concerns. If you don’t into account our concerns, then we will be a little bit nervous. No reaction completely.” The UK’s Ministry of Defence has just released its latest intelligence report on the situation unfolding in Ukraine, claiming Ukrainian forces are continuing to conduct localised counterattacks outside Kyiv The report appears to corroborate earlier operational reports released by Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces. The British intelligence report reads: Ukrainian forces have continued to conduct localised counterattacks to the north-west of Kyiv – including at Irpen, Bucha and Hostomel. These attacks have had some success and the Russians have been pushed back from a number of positions. However, Russia still poses a significant threat to the city through their strike capability. Russian forces have maintained their offensive on Mariupul with continuous heavy shelling of the city, however the centre of the city remains under Ukrainian control. Elsewhere, Russian forces are maintaining blocking positions while attempting to reorganise and reset their forces.” A total of 144 children have so far been killed and more than 220 injured as a result of Russia’s invasion, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office has said adding that the figures are probably much higher as deaths in Mariupol have not yet been confirmed. Bombing and shelling also damaged 773 educational institutions, 75 of which were completely destroyed, the office said in a statement released on Tuesday. More than 60 Ukrainian churches and religious buildings have been destroyed and 733 educational institutions damaged by Russian forces since the invasion first began on 24 February, according to Ukraine’s crisis centre (UCMC). The spiritual structures – mainly Orthodox temples – were reportedly destroyed across eight regions of Ukraine: Kyiv, Donetsk, Zhytomyr, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk, Sumy, Kharkiv and Chernihiv. “The vast majority of them are Orthodox temples. Mosques, synagogues, Protestant churches, religious educational institutions and important administrative buildings of religious organisations were also destroyed,” the agency said in a statement late on Monday. A further 733 educational institutions were also damaged as a result of Russian bombing and shelling with 74 completely destroyed as of 28 March, the UCMC added in a separate statement. While Russia’s assault on Ukraine continues, Ukrainians are trying to preserve the symbols of their cultural heritage. In Kyiv in particular, statues such as those flanking Mykhailivska Square and the Grand Princess Olga are surrounded by sandbags often thanks to the work of volunteers. In case you missed Joe Biden’s earlier remarks regarding his comments in Warsaw, you can watch the video from his press conference below. During an appearance in Poland at the weekend, Biden said that Russian president Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”, which then prompted hurried efforts by other senior figures in the administration to play down the comment in the face of international criticism. However, Biden on Monday defended the unscripted remarks, saying it reflected his own moral outrage, not an administration policy shift. “I wasn’t then nor am I now articulating a policy change. I was expressing moral outrage that I felt and I make no apologies,” he said. Biden added that he was “not walking anything back” by clarifying the remark. Asked whether the remark would spur a negative response from Putin, Biden said: “I don’t care what he thinks ... He’s going to do what he’s going to do”. Zelenskiy delivered some emphatic lines in his most recent national address regarding what he described as “passive” sanctions imposed by the west on Russia. Ukraine cannot and will not agree with the passive sanctions position of some entities towards Russia. There should be no ‘suspended’ sanctions packages - that if the Russian troops do something, then there will be some answer... We went through this story last year when we said that strong preventive sanctions against Russia were needed to prevent an invasion. The preventive package was not made. A full-scale war has begun. There are now many hints and warnings that sanctions will be tightened, such as an embargo on Russian oil supplies to Europe, if Russia uses chemical weapons. There are simply no words.” Zelenskiy continued to claim a tightening of sanctions now depends on Russia’s use of chemical weapons. Just think about what it all came down to. Waiting for chemical weapons... We, living people, have to wait… Doesn’t everything that the Russian military is doing and has already done deserve an oil embargo? Don’t phosphorus bombs deserve that? Do the shelled chemical production or nuclear power plant deserve that? Zelenskiy urged for sanctions packages to be “effective and substantial”. If the sanctions packages are weak or do not work enough, if they can be circumvented, it creates a dangerous illusion for the Russian leadership that they can continue to afford what they are doing now. And Ukrainians pay for it with their lives. Thousands of lives.” Wrapping up his late-night address, Zelenskiy urged other countries to act with courage. Ukrainians should not die just because someone cannot find enough courage to hand over the necessary weapons to Ukraine. Fear always makes you an accomplice. If someone is afraid of Russia, if he or she is afraid to make the necessary decisions that are important to us, in particular for us to get planes, tanks, necessary artillery, shells, it makes these people responsible for the catastrophe created by Russian troops in our cities, too. Because if you could save, you had to save.” Ukraine’s military has just released its latest operational report as of 6am this this morning, claiming its forces have carried out successful counterattacks in some directions. Russia continues to carry out out missile-bomb strikes in an attempt to “completely destroy the infrastructure and residential quarters of Ukrainian cities”, Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said. Such attacks in the temporarily occupied regions of Kyiv, Zaporizhzhya, Chernihiv, Kherson and Kharkiv are in violation of international humanitarian law requirements and have seen Russian troops continue to terrorise civilian populations, officials said. “Residential houses are shot; robbed, kidnapped and held hostage,” the report read. A total of seven Russian attacks were thwarted over the past day, with 12 tanks and 10 combat vehicles destroyed, according to officials. Ukraine’s air force also reportedly hit 17 air targets on Monday, including 8 aircraft, 3 helicopters, 4 UAVs and 2 winged missiles. The Guardian has been unable to verify these claims. An earlier report claimed Russian troops are “weakened, disoriented” and “cut off from logistics and the main forces”. “The command of the Russian occupying forces is trying to compensate for the decline in the combat potential of the enemy’s units by indiscriminate artillery fire and rocket-bomb attacks, thus destroying the infrastructure of Ukrainian cities,” officials from the general staff of the armed forces said. Ukrainian forces “continue to maintain the circular defence of the city of Mariupol and defend and deter the advance of the enemy in the Chernihiv region,” the report added. Ukrainian forces are also continuing to defend Kyiv and the settlements of Motyzhyn, Lisne, Kapitanivka and Dmytrivka, officials said. Here are some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine today. Apartment buildings are seen destroyed in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, Ukraine. One woman looks at the destruction caused to her roof after a Russian attack inside her house near Brovary, on the outskirts of Kyiv. Women walk past a damaged building that was shelled by Russian forces, in Kharkiv, northeast Ukraine. Statues and iconic symbols of Ukraine’s cultural heritage stand surrounded by sandbags to protect against shelling. Hello. Thank you for joining us for today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments before my colleague, Martin Belam, takes over from London. It is approaching 7am in Ukraine with peace talks expected to continue. Face-to-face peace talks between Ukraine and Russia are likely to start in Turkey today after negotiators arrived in Istanbul for their first face-to-face peace talks in more than two weeks. Both sides have played down the chances of a major breakthrough and a senior US official said Vladimir Putin did not appear ready to compromise. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly address that he had had a “very active diplomatic day” after speaking with British prime minister Boris Johnson, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, German chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian prime minister Mario Draghi and the president of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev. Zelenskiy also urged for sanctions packages to be “effective and substantial” and called for countries to keep supplying weapons to Ukraine. “Ukrainians should not die just because someone cannot find enough courage to hand over the necessary weapons to Ukraine,” he said. “Fear always makes you an accomplice.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia feels it is “amongst war” with the west after an array of sanctions were imposed on Russian businesses and individuals. Referencing Russia’s ongoing tension with Nato, Peskov told broadcaster PBS: “For a couple of decades, we were telling the collective west that we are afraid of your Nato’s moving eastwards. We too are afraid of Nato getting closer to our borders with its military infrastructure. Please take care of that. Don’t push us into the corner. No.” Peskov added “no one is thinking about using” or “even about [the] idea of using a nuclear weapon”. Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and a Ukrainian peace negotiator suffered symptoms consistent with poisoning earlier this month, according to a source with direct knowledge of the incident. Abramovich was taking part in informal peace negotiations in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, early in March when he began to feel ill, the source told the Guardian. Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov was also part of the negotiation. UK military intelligence says that Russia is expected to send more than 1,000 mercenaries into eastern Ukraine as they continue to suffer heavy losses. Russia’s private military company, the Wagner group, has already deployed to eastern Ukraine and is expected to send more than 1,000 mercenaries, including senior officials in the organisation, according to the Ministry of Defence. Kyiv sees no signs on the ground that Russia has given up a plan to surround the Ukrainian capital, Ukrainian defence ministry spokesperson Oleksander Motuzyanyk said. “For now we don’t see the movement of enemy forces away from Kyiv,” he said in a televised briefing. Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces claimed Russian troops are “weakened, disoriented” and “cut off from logistics and the main forces”. Ukrainian forces have seized back full control of the town of Irpin, a few miles from Kyiv. The area’s mayor, Oleksandr Markushyn. said Irpin had been “liberated” and that Russian soldiers were “offering to surrender”. The United States cannot confirm who is in control of the city of Irpin, a senior US defence official said. Russian soldiers who seized the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster drove unprotected through a highly toxic zone called the “Red Forest”, kicking up clouds of radioactive dust, Chernobyl workers told Reuters. The two sources said they had witnessed Russian tanks and other armoured vehicles moving through the Red Forest, which is the most radioactively contaminated part of the zone around Chernobyl. Almost 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed in the devastated city of Mariupol since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, a spokesperson for the mayor said. Vadym Boichenko said Mariupol was on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe and must be completely evacuated, with about 160,000 civilians were trapped in the city without power. Ukraine’s economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said the war has so far cost the country $564.9bn (£429.3bn) in terms of damage to infrastructure, lost economic growth and other factors. Eight thousand kilometres (4,970 miles) of roads and 10m sq metres of housing have been damaged or destroyed as a result of fighting, she said in an online post. Video footage purporting to show the torture of Russian prisoners of war is being investigated by the Ukrainian government. The film, which has not been verified, appears to show Ukrainian soldiers removing three hooded Russians from a van before shooting them in the legs. US president Joe Biden said he will “make no apologies” after appearing to call for Putin’s removal last week.

Three books can help us understand how nationalist passions and the nationalization of campaign communications and media coverage led to this point. Nationalism and nationalization warp the practice of American politics. World history is replete with examples of how nationalism has debased democratic preferences, corrupted republican values such as liberty and the rule of law, and provoked violence and war. The shutdown – the third in one year and the second over immigration – is an ill omen for the “exceptional” nation. In The Nationalist Revival: Trade, Immigration, and the Revolt Against Globalization, John Judis, a respected Washington analyst, defines nationalism as a social psychology instead of an ideological “ism”. Unlike those who prefer to restrict the word to its negative connotations and use “patriotism” for positive references to love of country, Judis writes that nationalism underwrites both xenophobia and helping fellow citizens in need. He quotes psychologist Joshua Searle-White: “Nationalism provides us with a way … [sic] to feel moral, right, and just. It gives us a way to join with others in a heroic struggle. It gives a sense of purpose and meaning to our lives, and even our deaths.” Judis contends that we are all paying a price for the failure of recent political leaders, Bill Clinton above all, to take the depths of nationalist passion into sufficient account while promoting globalization, which he deftly summarizes as being for free trade, mobile capital, floating exchange rates and unskilled immigration. Judis shows how policy errors and economic pressures combined to elicit reactionary movements in western democracies; he is particularly good on nationalist surges in Germany, Hungary and Poland. In those countries and the US, nationalist leaders have fanned popular feelings of economic abandonment, cultural degradation and abject terror through rhetoric that also stresses love of and pride in country. Daniel Hopkins is a rising-star political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. In The Increasingly United States: How and Why American Political Behavior Nationalized, he shows how and why the politics of the US has been nationalized in two ways. First, the electoral relevance of state and local issues has receded in voters’ minds. Second, voter (and, crucially, donor) participation has been spurred mainly through the promulgation of nationwide party agendas. American voters have told pollsters they believe more gets done that affects their lives at the sub-national levels of government – yet they remain fixated on who the president is and what he says and does with respect to Congress and the supreme court. This is a political science text, but Hopkins keeps the jargon to a minimum and has a knack for literary quotations. He shows how votes for president and governor have become more aligned since the 1970s, and how local contexts have minimal impact on voters and poll respondents on issue after issue. For example, people living near nuclear power plants have not voted all that differently on funding new ones from those who live far away. The same goes for military spending and living near military bases. The book does not look at immigration, although the author has done so in a previous article and found that “native-born white and black Americans adopt more anti-immigration views in response to an influx of immigrants only when immigration is a nationally salient issue” – ie, when the president and media are talking about it. The Hopkins and Judis books share a shortcoming: each underplays the inflammatory ingredient of racism. Judis notes how the election of Barack Obama challenged the “Euro-American prototype” at the core of many Americans’ conception of their personal-partisan-national identity. Yet he limited his interviews to six white working-class men in Ohio who voted for Donald Trump. Hopkins treats race, ethnicity and religion as variables without paying special attention to them. To judge from their bibliographies as well as their arguments, neither Hopkins nor Judis consulted Gary Gerstle’s American Crucible: Race and Nation in the Twentieth Century, which was first published in 2001 and had a second edition 16 years later. It is a superb interpretation of American cultural and political history. Gerstle, who teaches at Princeton, depicts a central tension between two traditional conceptions of the US as a nation. “Civic nationalists” have seen America as unified by an aspirational and foundational creed that people from around the world should embrace and, once melted into the pot, uphold in their politics. “Racial nationalists” have regarded the founders as Wasps, and strive to preserve a code and ethos to which immigrants must pledge allegiance. As Gerstle tells it, Clinton and George W Bush professed a hybrid “soft multiculturalism” that Obama embodied in his lineage. These three presidents faced a growing reaction to decades of non-white immigration as permitted by the 1965 and 1986 immigration laws. Birthers began assailing Obama’s foreignness in 2008 and Trump picked up the charge in 2011. The “madrassa/secret Muslim” attacks on Obama imported post-9/11 emotions. By 2015, nearly a third of Americans and almost half of Republicans believed their president was Muslim. This became nationalist kindling wood for Trump’s Muslim ban proposal after the San Bernardino shooting at the end of that year. Coded attacks on his origins and “political correctness” put Obama on the defensive. Stymied by Congress, he turned to executive orders (notably Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), which elicited cries of “tyrant”. What kind of civic nationalist skirted the law like this, asked racial nationalists, rhetorically. “It is possible to discern in [Trump],” Gerstle concluded, “a belief that America’s Christian white majority ought to resume its role as the country’s gatekeeper, and to set the terms by which nonwhites and non-Christians would be accepted into American life.” This nationalist duality has intensified the battle over the border wall. The conflict is not really about the barrier’s physical composition, length or cost. Rather, it is about which conception of the nation will prevail. To civic nationalists, locking out migrants betrays the creed they hold dear. Racial nationalists are convinced that people of color and Muslim faith are invaders bent on subverting their America, abetted by cosmopolitan elitists. These attitudes have been rolled into already polarized party identities. And because American voters are fixated on the national narrative, candidates, officials and mediated voices in every state must attend to the issue. Since border concerns have exploded out of proportion, a compromise such as that sketched by Judis seems beyond attainment. He prescribes a path to citizenship for those undocumented migrants already in the country, stiff penalties on those who employ them and lowered admission quotas for legals while shifting the criteria away from family reunification toward needed skills. As Judis admits, that’s a long shot. Just this month Trump (who may have employed undocumented migrants at his New Jersey golf club) threatened to close the entire border while blaming Democrats for the deaths of two children apprehended there. The British political philosopher Bernard Crick, writing in 1962 in another book uncited by Hopkins and Judis, In Defense of Politics, argues that the best known antidote to the ill effects of nationalism rests “not [in] how best and most elegantly to deplore it, but how to work with it so that it can be politicized”. In other words, national leaders should drain their invocations of American Dreams of racial and religious connotations, and perhaps of talk about the border altogether for a while. We should watch for this as candidates for 2020 take the stage. What kind of America will they dream out loud, in what words and images? In her “pre-announcement” video, Senator Elizabeth Warren focused on economic fairness. As reactions to her formation of an exploratory committee wash across the nationalized communications grid, we will be able to discern how high the nationalist tide is running.

Azuma baseball stadium, about 70km north-west of the ruined Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, will host at least one baseball game – possibly the opening match – and one or more softball fixtures, according to Yoshiro Mori, the 2020 organising committee president. “By hosting Olympic baseball and softball events, Fukushima will have a great platform to show the world the extent of its recovery in the 10 years since the disaster,” Mori said in a statement. “It will also be a wonderful chance for us to show our gratitude towards those who assisted in the region’s reconstruction. And I’m sure the people of Fukushima are also looking forward very much to seeing Olympics events hosted there.” Mori said the “fantastic idea” to hold baseball and softball matches in the affected area had originated in a meeting between the president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Thomas Bach, and Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in October last year. Two months later, however, the IOC initially declined to add Azuma to the main baseball venue in Yokohama. Riccardo Fraccari, the president of the World Baseball Softball Confederation, welcomed the IOC’s change of heart, describing it as a “great step” that would to “inspire hope and highlight the regeneration in Fukushima”. He added: “It is a tremendous honour and a duty we take very seriously to be a part of something so meaningful – to serve the Olympic movement and to use the power of sport to shape a better world.” The Fukushima prefectural government has offered to cover the costs of the refurbishment and renovation work needed to bring the 30,000-seat stadium up to Olympic standards, according to organisers. Miyagi prefecture, where almost 11,000 people died in the March 2011 triple disaster along Japan’s north-east coast, will host preliminary matches in the 2020 football competition. No evacuation order has ever been in place in the part of Fukushima prefecture where the baseball stadium is located. The Azuma sports park complex served as an evacuation centre for people fleeing radiation caused by the triple meltdown triggered by a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011. Nuclear power officials in Japan insist the 40-year effort to decommission Fukushima Daiichi, including the storage of nuclear waste, will not affect people visiting the region to attend Olympics events. The IOC’s executive board, which is meeting this week in Pyeongchang, South Korea – the host of next year’s Winter Olympics – is expected to receive an update on the golf venue for 2020, which has come under pressure to change its discriminatory membership policy. Kasumigaseki Country Club, a private golf course in Saitama prefecture, north-west of Tokyo, forbids women from becoming full members and from playing on Sundays. Last month, the IOC’s vice-president, John Coates, said organisers would have to find another venue if the club refused to drop its restrictions on female players."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jul/17/uk-must-take-lead-on-nuclear-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-17T16:43:03Z","webTitle":"UK must take lead on nuclear weapons | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/17/uk-must-take-lead-on-nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/17/uk-must-take-lead-on-nuclear-weapons","fields":{"headline":"UK must take lead on nuclear weapons","bodyText":"As your article on nuclear weapons states (All you wanted to know about nuclear war but were too afraid to ask, 16 July), the use of a nuclear weapons is now more likely than at any time since the cold war. Billions are being spent on modernising superpower nuclear arsenals. The old “deterrence” myth – that they will never be used – is still being deployed, but at the same time Trump is unveiling plans for new “usable” nuclear weapons, and outlining more scenarios in which to use them. With Trump’s tearing up of the Iran nuclear deal, the dangers of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East are increasing. The possibility of denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula hangs on a thread – a return to threat and counter-threat is an ever-present danger, with potentially catastrophic consequences. But this tide towards annihilation can be turned if the political will is there. Maybe we can’t expect that from the trigger-happy US president, but we should demand it from our own government. It’s a year since the UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to support a treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons. The UK government has poured scorn on it, but this is a very real global initiative that presents a way out of the accelerating nuclear crisis. There is much talk of Britain’s standing in the world. This is a way in which Britain could genuinely lead: by supporting the treaty and helping to end the impasse between nuclear weapons states. We ask this of our government, because without such an initiative, the threat of destruction will only grow.

Revisiting the book and the film after 25 years of researching British nuclear – not atomic – tests in Australia I was struck by Shute’s understanding that global winds would bring radiation from the northern hemisphere to the southern from nuclear warfare that began between “minor” nuclear powers. The timing of the book and the film are also important in retrospect. Ava Gardner arrived in Sydney on New Year’s Day 1959 to start filming precisely a year after Harold Macmillan made the first visit to Australia by a serving British prime minister. He came to tell the Australian cabinet that Britain would be rejoining the nuclear alliance with the US because it had shown that it could build a thermonuclear H bomb – in Australia – and detonate it off Malden Island in the Pacific in May 1957. The UK would therefore be withdrawing from the Australian test sites and would not be in a position to leave tactical ballistic missiles developed at Woomera Rocket Range as an independent nuclear deterrent as had been argued for by Prime Minister Chifley, Sir Mark Oliphant and the Royal Australian Air Force. There are intercontinental nuclear missiles in Australia today, but they are American. I am putting the archival evidence for these statements on my website the Rabbitt Review. Sue Rabbitt Roff Cellardyke, Fife • Why perpetuate the myth that the Non-Proliferation Treaty somehow legitimised the nuclear weapons of an “official owners club”? The then five nuclear weapons states were defined as such solely for the purposes of the NPT, which was a bargain between nuclear and non-nuclear states: non-nuclear states had the right to develop civil nuclear power and nuclear weapons states had an obligation to disarm, as clarified by the international court of justice in 1996. The continued refusal of the nuclear weapons states to fulfil their treaty obligations was an important driver for the ban treaty agreed by a huge majority at the UN almost exactly a year ago. All nuclear weapons states, including the UK, are embarking on a programme of modernisation and deserve no kudos for retiring weapons of an older generation.

Speaking to the the Guardian, Hugh McNeal, the chief executive of trade body RenewableUK, said he expected that offshore windfarms would secure a deal with the government lower than the £92.50 per megawatt hour agreed with EDF for £18bn Hinkley Point C. “I wouldn’t be surprised if it [offshore wind] cleared Hinkley prices,” he said of the bidding for a £290m-a-year government subsidy pot in April. The auction is under a scheme known as contracts for difference, which offer generators a guaranteed price for their electricity above the wholesale price. A 35-year deal with EDF was agreed last year. McNeal, a career civil servant who joined RenewableUK from the now abolished Department of Energy and Climate Change last year, was upbeat about the future of offshore wind. “I don’t think there’s any doubt about the political commitment of any party, apart from perhaps Ukip, to offshore wind. I think it’s got an incredibly healthy future,” he said. Construction of offshore and onshore windfarms in the UK was responsible for €12.7bn (£11bn) of investment in 2016, or nearly half the year’s financial activity for new wind power in the EU. The industry has also been buoyed by recent figures showing the price of offshore wind power had fallen by nearly one-third since 2012 to £100/MWh, a crucial milestone as the government will only continue to subsidise the technology if costs go down. But McNeal said the decision by ministers to end onshore windfarm subsidies had been hard for the industry. The building of new turbines on land is expected to largely grind to a halt after next year. Green energy subsidies are paid through energy bills, but MPs said last week that government efforts to communicate the impact on consumers had been “shambolic.” McNeal said he found the focus solely on the cost of new low-carbon power “a little bit odd” given the other factors driving energy price rises. Three of the UK’s big six energy suppliers have announced price increases as their costs have risen, the bulk of which are higher wholesale prices. “We are perhaps a little bit overexposed to global markets over which we have no control, which fluctuate over time,” McNeal said. Government officials should do more to spell out all the costs of energy to consumers, he added. The impact of renewable energy subsidies on bills has previously been broken down, but the effect on bills from subsidies to coal power stations for providing backup power, for example, are not. However, McNeal defended the Conservative party, arguing it was unfairly derided as anti-renewables. “We have to actually just look at what’s been achieved,” he said. “I’m not saying to you that there isn’t a challenge around the [Conservative] onshore wind manifesto commitment; of course there is. But the record is still a pretty remarkable one.” Renewable energy supplies one-quarter of Britain’s electricity, he said, compared with a marginal amount before the 2010 general election, when the first of three Conservative-led governments came to power. McNeal would not be drawn on whether Labour’s energy policy, which is pro-renewables and pro-nuclear, but would ban fracking for shale gas, was credible. But he said questions of energy supply should be depoliticised. “I don’t think it’s my job to tell any party what its energy policy should be. Let’s just take the heat out of all this,” he said. “I just don’t think it does anyone any good to be in public fighting between different forms of technologies.” Despite saying last year that new onshore windfarms in England were “very unlikely”, McNeal suggested the technology would come back because it was so cheap. “I don’t think onshore is done at all. I think onshore wind has a terrific future in our country,” he said. McNeal said he was confident that wind power in the UK would thrive after Brexit, even though the industry’s growth had so far been driven in part by binding EU renewable targets for 2020. “The idea that we need a separate European package [of support] – that would be the crucial thing that would drive our industry – we don’t need that now,” he said, adding that the sector would win on market terms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/21/search-area-willing-host-highly-radioactive-waste-uk-geology","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-21T15:52:15Z","webTitle":"Search restarts for area willing to host highly radioactive UK waste","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/21/search-area-willing-host-highly-radioactive-waste-uk-geology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/21/search-area-willing-host-highly-radioactive-waste-uk-geology","fields":{"headline":"Search restarts for area willing to host highly radioactive UK waste","bodyText":"The government is expected this week to begin a nationwide search for a community willing to host an underground nuclear waste dump to store highly radioactive material for thousands of years. Britain has been trying for years to secure a site with the right geology and local communities which would volunteer to host a £12bn geological disposal facility (GDF), as a long-term solution for the most dangerous waste from nuclear power stations. The last effort hit a brick wall in 2013 when Cumbria county council, the only local authority still in the running as a host for the dump, rejected it. Now, ministers are to relaunch their mission to win over a community to host the GDF. The task has taken on heightened importance now that a nuclear power plant is under construction in Somerset, with plans to build four others. Radioactive Waste Management, the government body tasked with building the facility hundreds of metres underground, said it had made significant progress since 2014 in “developing the offer” to interested communities. The energy minister Richard Harrington has said construction of the GDF would create 1,000 jobs and running it would create 600 more. Consultations on the planning process and how the government will work with communities will be launched this week, said two sources close to the process. “I hope to God they get it right this time,” said one. “The mess they made in the past can’t be repeated. It’s outrageous it became a victim of local politics last time.” In January 2013, Cumbria council’s cabinet voted against preliminary work starting on the facility, with the Conservative council leader citing concerns about the local geology. The decision came five months before local elections. After the failures of 2013, a 2014 white paper set out the government’s new plans, which are still based on gaining the consent of a community. Experts said success in finding a site would hinge on suitable geology and acceptance by the public. Prof Neil Hyatt, who heads the department of materials science and engineering at the University of Sheffield, said: “It’s having the right geology coupled with community acceptance. The geological setting needs to be able to isolate the radioactive waste from the surface for the required timescale, which is hundreds of thousands of years.” A national geological screening report has been undertaken to identify the most favourable parts of the country, but Hyatt said further information was needed. Ann McCall, the geological disposal facility siting and engagement director of Radioactive Waste Management, told a conference in December that building the GDF was “mission critical” to store the UK’s radioactive waste, which the country has “an awful lot of”. She said the agency would soon launch a campaign website to increase awareness and engagement with the public, adding: “It’s not possible to foist a solution on a community.” The facility would be sited in England or Wales, as Scotland prefers a ground-level store. High-level waste, the most radioactive material, would not be moved there for many decades. Nuclear waste is currently stored at about 30 sites, but predominantly at ground level at Sellafield in Cumbria. The project is expected to cost £12bn, spread over a century. The government will bear 55% of the cost, owners of new-build plants such as EDF another 35%, and the final 10% will be covered by a liability fund set aside by previous nuclear operators. The price tag could go up or down depending on how much waste the facility needs to store, said Hyatt. “There is a lot of uncertainty around costs.” Other nuclear countries, such as Finland, have already started building underground stores. One senior industry figure said: “Lots of other countries would just get on and do this. They’ve got to do something. They can’t keep ducking this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jul/20/north-korea-mike-pompeo-russia-china-oil-sanctions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-20T18:32:04Z","webTitle":"North Korea: US calls on Russia and China to tackle breaches of oil sanctions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/20/north-korea-mike-pompeo-russia-china-oil-sanctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jul/20/north-korea-mike-pompeo-russia-china-oil-sanctions","fields":{"headline":"North Korea: US calls on Russia and China to tackle breaches of oil sanctions","bodyText":"The US has urged Russia and China to clamp down on repeated breaches of the oil sanctions regime imposed on North Korea, saying America had evidence of at least 89 illegal ship-to-ship oil transfers this year. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, was speaking at the UN headquarters in New York on Friday, the day after Russia and China at the UN sanctions committee rejected a US call to step up sanctions saying it needed further evidence of North Korean sanctions evasion. The Russian and Chinese decision at the UN was the first fissure in the international alliance putting pressure on Pyongyang to act on its commitment to end its efforts to become a nuclear power and effectively delayed further discussions on extra sanctions for as long as six months. The US claims on the basis of intelligence that North Korea using ship-to-ship transfers in international waters has breached a cap of 500,000 barrels of refined oil a year – imposed by the security council in December. The US had demanded an immediate halt to all further oil transfers. “Strict enforcement of sanctions” was critical to achieving the goal of North Korea’s denuclearisation, Pompeo said. Despite the diplomatic reverse, Pompeo said after his briefing with the UN that he remained confident that it will be possible to reach an agreement on North Korean denuclearisation, saying it was even possible to envisage North Korea attending meetings at the UN “not as a pariah, but as a friend”. But his call for Russia and China to act on the evidence of North Korean sanctions evasion represents a change in tone from previous US optimistic assessments of the direction the Pyongyang regime was taking. His remarks underscored the US belief that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is acting under duress, and a united international sanctions regime is critical to ensuring final verified denuclearisation. Kim made a broad commitment to denuclearise at an unprecedented summit with Donald Trump in June, but offered no details as to how and when this might take place, leaving considerable doubts about Pyongyang’s intentions. Pompeo reiterated his view that it would take some time and the path ahead was difficult. He also called for sanctions to be tightened on coal imports. Pompeo visited Pyongyang in early July and the two sides struggled to make headway on the denuclearisation issue. At the end of the talks the North Korean foreign ministry accused the US of making unilateral demands and behaving like gangsters. The US senator Lindsey Graham, representing a current of thinking inside the Republican party, said he feared that China had intervened to sour the talks. “I see China’s hands all over this,” he said in the wake of the fruitless Pompeo talks. Pompeo’s visit came immediately after the US on 6 Julyslapped tariffs on $34bn of goods from China, a move that China promptly matched. On Friday, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on all $505bn in Chinese imports. Pompeo’s UN briefing was undertaken jointly with the South Korean foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, who has struck a more optimistic note this week. She said there was a shared analysis of the situation between China and the US and implied the North Korean leader had taken an irreversible decision. Speaking at Chatham House she said scepticism was necessary given the history of past failed talks but went on: “I think that what is clear is that there is the political will that was not there in any previous negotiations, from the top level, to move in that direction.” She added: “Having come out this far, for him to go back, I think will be hugely risky.” On the North’s demolition of its nuclear-testing site in Punggye-ri, she said, “We will press them, at some point, to verify that this is a genuine closure.” She warned “given the pace of developments there is an expectation that things are going to move very fast. We need to pace ourselves because this will take time.” She also said the US troop presence in South Korea was not part of the talks with the North."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jun/06/michael-pack-steve-bannon-ally-broadcasting-board-of-governors","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T15:56:42Z","webTitle":"Michael Pack: the Bannon ally critics fear will become Trump's global propagandist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/06/michael-pack-steve-bannon-ally-broadcasting-board-of-governors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jun/06/michael-pack-steve-bannon-ally-broadcasting-board-of-governors","fields":{"headline":"Michael Pack: the Bannon ally critics fear will become Trump's global propagandist","bodyText":"Donald Trump intends to nominate Michael Pack, a controversial ally of Steve Bannon, as the next head of the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), according to a recent statement by the White House. If confirmed by the Senate, Pack would replace the current CEO, John Lansing, who was appointed in 2015. While the BBG may not be a household name, the $685m agency wields significant international influence through its news networks including Office of Cuba Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, Voice of America and Middle East Broadcasting Networks. These government-funded outlets create and distribute news in more than 100 countries and 61 languages, reaching an audience of 278 million people. BBG has sometimes been accused of being a propaganda outlet; perhaps because some of the networks it manages were set up for precisely that purpose. Radio Free Europe, for example, was founded in 1949 to help with cold war efforts and was subsidized by the CIA until 1972. BBG insists that it is not propaganda, but “present[s] fair and accurate news”. In its most recent annual report BBG also describes itself as “a strong and nimble global media agency … [which] advances US foreign policy priorities and national security interests”. In 2014, Jeff Shell, then chairman of the BBG, took umbrage with an article in Time which seemed to suggest the agency is analogous to the Kremlin-run Russia Today. Shell and wrote an op-ed stressing BBG’s “founding legislation mandates that our programs be conducted in accordance with the highest professional standards of broadcast journalism”. Pack’s nomination as head of the BBG has reportedly been in the works for over a year, but was delayed while he removed himself from conflict of interest issues. Pack has a long history in the media and of disseminating conservative ideas. He was previously head of the Claremont Institute, a conservative thinktank, where he also presided over the Claremont Review of Books, which has been described as the “bible of highbrow Trumpism”. Its editor, Charles Kesler, has called Trump’s election “a liberating moment for conservatism”. Previously, Pack served on the National Council of the National Endowment for Humanities and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. He is also a documentary film-maker and the president of Manifold Productions, an independent film and television production company. Pack worked on two documentaries with Steve Bannon; one about nuclear power and one about the Iraq war. Last year, Pack wrote an article for the Federalist that praised Steve Bannon, and professed his desire that Bannon would help break the left’s “monopoly” on documentaries. Pack argued that film departments in American universities are a hotbed of liberal “indoctrination and grooming”. “I have some bad news for this documentary establishment,” Pack wrote. “Trump, with Bannon’s help, campaigned against political correctness and self-dealing elites. And they won.” If Pack does become head of the BBG, critics fear that he will turn Voice of America and the other BBG networks into a megaphone for Trump. This is of particular concern because the new head of the BBG will have more unilateral power than previous leaders. Towards the end of the Obama administration, a provision was enacted which would replace BBG’s bipartisan board with an advisory board elected by the president. While some people saw the move as a way to make the BBG more efficient, others worry that it might imperil its journalistic independence. When contacted by the Guardian about his nomination, Pack said that he was honored to be asked to serve his country in this important position, but had no further comment at this point."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/nov/03/angela-merkel-legacy-has-she-saved-or-destroyed-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-11-03T05:00:02Z","webTitle":"Angela Merkel's legacy: has she saved or destroyed Europe? | Jon Henley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/03/angela-merkel-legacy-has-she-saved-or-destroyed-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/nov/03/angela-merkel-legacy-has-she-saved-or-destroyed-europe","fields":{"headline":"Angela Merkel's legacy: has she saved or destroyed Europe?","bodyText":"Angela Merkel’s approach to a problem, wrote one of her biographers, is “to sit it out”. Rather than entertain grand ideas of a “historic mission” or “strategic vision”, she aims to “solve today’s problems, in a way that ensures she stays in power”. The German chancellor, once described by Forbes as the world’s most powerful woman, managed that for 13 years. She has been measured, cautious, methodical, pragmatic, sometimes maddeningly noncommittal and seemingly always in control. But this week, weakened by plummeting polls, an unpopular and ineffective coalition, dire performances in recent state elections and increasingly acrimonious in-fighting among her centre-right alliance, she conceded defeat. The dignified, matter-of-fact announcement of her coming departure, however, was Merkel all over, as was the orderly two-stage exit she plans, first surrendering her 18-year leadership of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) next month, then stepping down as chancellor in 2021, at the end of her fourth term. It might not work. The election of a conservative Merkel critic such as Friedrich Merz, the current frontrunner, as the party’s head would see her go before election day, many believe. Further big losses by the CDU’s coalition partners, the Social Democratic party (SPD), in coming state elections could also mean her government collapses as early as next year. But whether or not Merkel sees out her last mandate, a battle royal is under way over her legacy. For her defenders, the chancellor is a calm, unflappable, non-ideological consensus builder who brought stability to her country and the EU in a string of major crises. She is, they say, a fundamentally decent politician who fought for democratic values; whose civil, level-headed persona represents all that the posturing populists now challenging Europe’s unity in countries like Hungary and Italy – and the one in the White House – do not. Her critics say that on major policy questions she is indecisive, unknowable and panders to public opinion. They describe her as a tactician but not a strategist, with no real vision; unwilling and unable to challenge old German orthodoxies or change the political weather. Perhaps most damningly, they suggest that her analytical, rational, non-partisan and ultimately technocratic style of leadership may, in the end, have actually precipitated the collapse of Europe’s political centre and helped pave the way for the populists. “Politicians have to be effective and credible, and Merkel has been both,” says one of her supporters, Constanze Stelzenmüller, of the Brookings Institution. “She built relationships of trust – she had a relationship of trust even with Alexis Tsipras.” At the peak of the eurozone crisis, when most of northern Europe wanted the Greek prime minister to be told his country had to leave the common currency, Merkel demurred, Stelzenmüller says, saying it would have been “a betrayal of the European project. She gains people’s trust because she has clear values.” Those values are plain, supporters say, in Merkel’s determination to impose sanctions after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, her decision to welcome more than one million migrants into Germany in 2015, and her response to Donald Trump’s election (she pointedly offered him cooperation “based on the values of democracy, freedom, respect for the law and the dignity of all human beings”). And that thorough, lead-from-behind, won’t-be-rushed style? “It’s exactly what you want running a major power in the centre of Europe,” insists Stelzenmüller. “You have to build support, you can’t just ‘decide and do’. Imagine if you tried.” Others, however, are not so sure. “Much of what we think we know about Merkel is either spin or speculation,” says Hans Kundnani, senior research fellow at Chatham House. “The extraordinary thing is, after 13 years in the chancellery we still don’t really know who she is.” Certainly there is something about Merkel’s unremarkable personality that resonated with many Germans, who have sound historical reasons for disliking excessive political passion. As one diplomat puts it: “Policies were never the point of Merkel. What Germans knew about her character outweighed what they didn’t know about her ideas.” For Jan-Werner Müller, professor of politics at Princeton university, many Germans saw Merkel as “an eminently reliable and highly analytical civil servant, not as a politician who has ever systematically staked out a vision for the country”. Her frequent U-turns (on nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster, for example), “could only have been pulled off by someone seen as more of a civil servant-in-chief, who chose the most seemingly reasonable course of action, beyond partisan commitments,” Müller argued in Foreign Policy magazine. But this managerial style of politics is not just out of step with a populist age, says Kundnani, but helped create it. The radical far-right party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) emerged “in direct response to Merkel’s statement, regarding the Greek bailout, that there was ‘no alternative’,” he says. “It basically said: ‘Yes there is’.” Merkel’s hard line on enforcing austerity was popular in Germany but almost certainly helped fuel support for populist movements in southern Europe, while her 2015 open borders policy – based, Kundnani believes, as much on a misreading of German opinion as on compassion – boosted the German anti-immigration party. Kundnani sees Merkel as a cynical operator, who is “Machiavellian” in her ruthless sidelining of political opponents and who acts generally in the way she believes will most appeal to voters. (Her statement on Trump can also be seen in that light, he says: “There are points to be scored in Germany by standing up to a US president.”) As Europe’s de facto leader for so many years, her failure to do more to create a real architecture for European integration, or – more recently – to take bold steps to secure with France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, the institutional future of the euro, will not be viewed kindly by future historians, critics say. Merkel’s defenders note the constraints placed on German chancellors, who have far less real power than French or US presidents, by their country’s political structure and strong constitutional court. “She’s not inscrutable; you just have to know her,” says Stelzenmüller. “Nor is she a populism enabler. She’s been a bulwark against it.” But it could just be that her style of politics has left voters feeling deprived of real democratic choice - and encouraged the ongoing splintering of Europe’s politics. “We don’t yet know,” says Kundnani, “whether Merkel will go down in history as the woman who destroyed Europe, or saved it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/12/theresa-mays-green-plan-new-york-divests-and-insect-decline-green-news-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-12T14:29:24Z","webTitle":"Theresa May's green plan, New York divests and insect decline – green news roundup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/12/theresa-mays-green-plan-new-york-divests-and-insect-decline-green-news-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/12/theresa-mays-green-plan-new-york-divests-and-insect-decline-green-news-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May's green plan, New York divests and insect decline – green news roundup","bodyText":"Environment news Theresa May defends green plan as critics say it is too slow and vague Insect declines: new alarm over mayfly is ‘tip of iceberg’, warn experts Conservationists decry NSW shark net trial after protected species caught and killed Brexit bill may have broken international environment law, says UN Plastic microbeads ban enters force in UK Energy agency rejects Trump plan to prop up coal and nuclear power plants Great Barrier Reef: rising temperatures turning green sea turtles female Calls for EU to reinstate ban on ‘destructive’ electric pulse fishing Government pledges £5.7m to develop new northern forest In depth ‘A really big deal’: New York City’s fossil fuel divestment could spur global shift Conservatives’ 25-year green plan: main points at a glance Confessions of a Deliveroo rider: get fit by delivering fast food The latest cutting-edge technology changing our landscapes?

The record high share of 54.4% of power from low carbon sources was a result of the rapid growth in solar and wind power, according to the Office for National Statistics. During the same period in 2016 the share for low carbon electricity stood at 50%, and in 2015 it was 45%. The growth of green energy squeezed out fossil fuels, pushing the share of electricity generation from coal and gas plants to a record low of 42%. Including windfarms, solar panels, hydro schemes and biomass plants, renewables accounted for 30% of power in the third quarter. The all-time high was 30.7% in the second quarter of 2017. “This latest record is yet another nail in the coffin for the claim that renewables cannot be a sizeable part of the UK’s electricity mix,” said Dr Jonathan Marshall, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. The three months were not as windy or sunny as the year before, but this was offset by new windfarm and solar installations. The share was also helped by the return to operation of a wood-burning unit at the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire, which was out of action the year before. The green energy records are the latest in a string of milestones this year that demonstrate how dramatically and quickly the UK’s energy mix is changing. Britain went without coal power for a day in April for the first time in more than 130 years. The country has since gone hundreds of hours without the polluting fuel in 2017, and coal generated just 2.9% of electricity between July and September. Solar has set several records and now provides a sizeable amount of power in the middle of the day. For one period on an afternoon in May, all the solar panels in fields and on buildings across the country were even generating more electricity than the UK’s eight nuclear power stations. Wind power capacity has increased, too, though one of the biggest moments for windfarms was not growth but falls in price. In September windfarm developers secured a record low subsidy price to build wind turbines off the coast in the early 2020s in what experts said marked a breakthrough for the technology. Put together, the National Grid has said that renewables were now a “significant part” of the UK’s energy mix. According to one analysis, generation of renewable power has increased by more than 1,000% over the last two decades. Bulb, an energy company that supplies renewable power to more than a quarter of a million customers, said that at the current rate 2017 would prove to be a record year for renewables. The company forecast 100 terawatt hours of power would be produced by renewables by the year’s end compared twith 208 for fossil fuels and nuclear based on an extrapolation of the official data so far this year. “Right now we are at a moment where those new technologies are becoming cheaper than existing technologies. It now just makes much more sense,” said the Bulb co-founder Hayden Wood."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/sep/13/hurricane-florence-latest-storm-surge","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-09-14T04:38:52Z","webTitle":"Hurricane Florence expected to cause 'life-threatening storm surge'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/13/hurricane-florence-latest-storm-surge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/sep/13/hurricane-florence-latest-storm-surge","fields":{"headline":"Hurricane Florence expected to cause 'life-threatening storm surge'","bodyText":"Forecasters have warned that Hurricane Florence remains a deadly weather event as wind and rain lashed North Carolina in the first signs of the storm’s arrival near landearly on Thursday. Florence was downgraded to a category 1 hurricane, from a category 4, but was still generating sustained winds of 90mph (150kp/h) and expected to cause “life-threatening storm surge and rainfall”, according to the National Hurricane Center. More than 1.7 million people have been ordered to evacuate from coastal areas. Officials issued a stark warning on Thursday for those who choose to remain in their homes that emergency response units will not rescue them if they find themselves in an emergency in the height of the storm. Forecasters said conditions will deteriorate as the storm pushes ashore early Friday near the North Carolina-South Carolina line and makes its way slowly inland. Its surge could cover all but a sliver of the Carolina coast under as much as 11 feet (3.4m) of ocean water, and days of downpours could unload more than 3 feet (0.9m) of rain, causing severe flooding. “We cannot underestimate this storm,” North Carolina’s governor, Roy Cooper, said on Thursday. “Storm surge and massive flooding – both are going to be extreme. Catastrophic effects will be felt outside the center of the storm,” Cooper said. “We’re on the wrong side of this thing. This storm will bring destruction to North Carolina.” As of midnight on Thursday, the storm was located about 60 miles (95km) south-east of Wilmington, North Carolina and continued to make its way towards the east coast. Hurricane conditions were expected to arrive in the affected areas on Thursday night or early Friday. Tornadoes also remain a threat, particularly in areas north-east of the hurricane’s eye. “We are completely ready for Hurricane Florence, as the storm gets even larger and more powerful. Be careful!” Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday morning. About 10 million people live in areas covered by hurricane and tropical storm warnings, and 1.7 million were ordered to evacuate, though not all of them heeded those warnings and some insisted on staying put and riding out the storm. Cooper said that even as wind speeds slowed, the hurricane’s breadth got wider, warning of “battering winds and relentless rain that will last for days”. The state has opened 108 shelters, where more than 7,000 people are currently hunkered down, and schools in 56 districts are closed, according to the governor. He said residents should not drive during the peak of the storm and should avoid driving through flooded roads. “That puts your life in danger,” he said. The mayor of Myrtle Beach said her city had done as much as it could to prepare for Hurricane Florence. Brenda Bethune told NBC’s Today show on Thursday morning that public safety crews have been checking to make sure businesses were secure, and looking for anything that could become a projectile as the winds come ashore. But the mayor said she knew many people were ignoring evacuation orders. She hoped they would stay inside once the winds, rain and floods arrive. She warned people against going outside and taking pictures, because emergency crews would not be able to reach them in the storm. In Wilmington, North Carolina, the Wrightsville Beach police chief, Dan House, said a handful of residents on the island had refused evacuation orders. He advised that they “better go ahead and give me your next of kin” information, because no one will rescue them at the height of the storm. The police chief said he was not going to put his staff in harm’s way, especially for people told to evacuate. The latest forecast shows the eye of Florence could pass directly over the barrier island, pushing a huge surge of ocean water. Florence was moving toward the coast at a speed of 10mph, and the hurricane center forecasts the center of the storm will approach the coasts of North and South Carolina later Thursday, then move near or over the coast of southern North Carolina and north-eastern South Carolina on Thursday night and Friday. It is expected to progress slowly over eastern South Carolina on Friday night through Saturday night. Forecasters predicted storm surges up to 13ft (4 meters) in parts of coastal North Carolina, and the storm could dump 20 to 30in (50-76cm) of rain in the hardest hit areas – and even up to 40in in isolated spots. “This rainfall would produce catastrophic flash flooding and prolonged significant river flooding,” the hurricane center said. Areas further from the coast could see six to 12in of rain. Power outages are expected, with Duke Energy, the main supplier in the area, warning that three-quarters of its 4 million customers in the Carolinas could lose electricity. Outages could take weeks to repair, according to the company. Florence has sparked fears of an environmental disaster, because its path is lined with hog manure pits, coal ash dumps and other industrial sites, as well as six nuclear power plants. On North Carolina’s Ocracoke Island , a group of wild horses were left to fend for themselves as most humans evacuate the island, according to the Greenville News. Experts said that with some extra hay, they expected the 15 horses descended from Spanish mustangs could weather the storm. The storm has also kicked up waves as high as 83ft. Ken Graham, director of the Miami-based National Hurricane Center, said areas that repeatedly get hit even with weaker winds at Florence’s edges could see heavy rainfall for hours. Storm surge flooding also could push two miles or more inland if Florence lingers for days along the coast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/14/the-role-of-renewables-in-the-uk-energy-mix","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-14T16:54:06Z","webTitle":"The role of renewables in the UK energy mix | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/14/the-role-of-renewables-in-the-uk-energy-mix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/14/the-role-of-renewables-in-the-uk-energy-mix","fields":{"headline":"The role of renewables in the UK energy mix","bodyText":"Your excellent editorial on the reducing cost of offshore wind power (13 September) is timely in identifying the increasingly futile case for new nuclear build. It does, however, repeat the fallacy that nuclear power “is a zero-carbon technology”. The carbon emissions involved in building such immense structures, in mining and transporting uranium, and in the transport, reprocessing and storage of waste, contribute to a considerable carbon burden. Estimates vary considerably, but studies suggest that the emissions from nuclear generation could be one-10th of those of fossil fuels, but twice those of wind power. Furthermore, the need for a continuous supply is of only limited use when consumption patterns become distorted by, for example, the increased need to charge electric vehicles overnight, as your leader identifies. What is needed now, alongside continued investment in the latest generation of renewable production, is increased investment into a wide range of storage technologies, and further research and investment into the production of renewable heat. Tackling the energy challenge is plainly within our grasp as new technologies come to the market. The challenge now is not a technological one, it is a political one. Sadly, that is a political challenge which our current government seem unable to address. Ian Hill Cockermouth, Cumbria • Yes, yes to more wind farms. But why do our politicians continue to ignore or reject the potential of enormous tides that rise and fall conveniently close to a huge proportion of Britain’s population – indeed, precisely as close as Hinkley Point? Nearly every time a picture of Hinkley is shown there is a strip of water in front of it, the Bristol Channel, home to the second-highest tidal range in the world. Twice every day that enormous body of water rises and falls between 11 and 14 metres. That represents energy of a similar order to that which may, eventually, and at enormous cost and perpetual taxation transfer to French and Chinese companies, be produced by Hinkley Point. Marine turbine technology is not experimental, nor potentially polluting. A smaller tidal barrage has been operating successfully on the Rance, near St Malo in France for nearly 50 years. It is clean, the energy is free and perpetual, there is no noxious waste and the birds seem to have adapted quite well. Will Taylor Tiverton, Devon • To replace the UK’s current nuclear generating capacity with offshore wind turbines like those planned for Triton Knoll, and at similar spacing, would require a sea area equivalent to a 1.6km wide band around the entire coastline of the UK. This assumes perfect power storage, loss-free transmission and an optimistic through-life load-factor of 27%: real figures would almost certainly increase the required sea area. Is the UK population ready for the environmental impact such a programme would create? Tim Chittenden Past president, The Nuclear Institute • With reference to your editorial, you might find it easier to offer a few more-favourable words about Hinkley Point C nuclear power station by regarding it as a (partial) replacement for the UK’s seven AGR stations, some of which have been in service for more than 40 years but all of which will reach the end of their working lives in a decade or two. As base-load generation, their replacement if not by new nuclear stations will necessarily be 100% by gas-fired plant. Think how much that will contribute to reducing national carbon dioxide emissions. Jim Waterton Glasgow • You rightly report the welcome news that future offshore wind power projects will produce electricity significantly cheaper than future nuclear power. But there are other established non-carbon methods that are even better. Significantly cheaper still for consumers are onshore grid-connected wind power (now effectively banned by government planning policy) and onsite locally sized self-generation, generally from solar photovoltaic panels, but also from site-dependent wind turbines and mini-hydro. In addition, there are the cost-saving possibilities of battery storage and of local energy cooperatives. Of course, the renewables options produce variable power because they draw from the natural environment with its diurnal and inter-seasonal characteristics. Consequently as an integrated resource they are not “intermittent”, which implies suddenly ceasing. Individual renewables generator variations average out when combined together with grid connection. This average is predictable from UK weather forecasts and certainly not “intermittent”. However the generation from nuclear stations is indeed “intermittent”, with total and sudden outages from predictable refuelling and unpredictable transmission failures. It is impossible that UK renewables could ever have the unwanted intermittency and cost characteristics of nuclear power. Dr John Twidell Horninghold, Leicestershire • It’s great to see your editorial on wind power – with offshore wind costs plummeting, solar costs halving in the last five years, renewable evolution is ramping exponentially. Germany, the strongest economy in Europe, has just broken green energy records by generating 35% of power from renewables in the first half of 2017. But here, sadly, inconsistent feed-in tariffs have meant a rush of investment then near collapse of the solar market. And we are still stuck on a large nuclear subsidy, even to the extent of distorting the UK energy market, backing an expensive technology come what may – finding ourselves in the surreal situation of planning the largest construction projects ever built on UK soil (Hinkley, Moorside and Sizewell), and contemplating buying reactors from bankrupt and disgraced companies using technologies that have failed wherever they have been built. The nuclear industry says that future UK energy should be nuclear and renewables – but because nuclear is so eye-wateringly expensive, the real choice is actually nuclear or renewables. And the reality is that, in an even market, renewables just make more economic sense. Dr Paul Dorfman UCL Energy Institute Prof Steve Thomas Greenwich University Duncan Bayliss UWE • As Rupert Jones says (Hurricane Irma has devastated British territories – so why such little aid?, 12 September), the UK government needs to be faster at responding to emergencies. But we also need people power to respond faster internationally to the underlying causes of those emergencies. Adapting to the risks of climate change needs to become a global system of assistance, ready and on call. This can be led by governments. Reducing the risks of further climate change needs new global campaigns of action, to bring governments into line. This can be led by civil society. The cooperative sector worldwide, with one billion members, is supporting reconstruction in hurricane-hit islands and flooded coastlands. A new financial appeal across the UK’s 7,000 coops has been launched this week with founding support by the Co-op Group. At the same time, cooperatives worldwide are campaigning for deep cuts in emissions, putting this into practice in our own businesses, and for a step change in energy policy. There are now 250 UK cooperatives helping to generate renewable energy or support energy saving. Emergencies like the hurricanes in the Americas or the floods in Asia are prompts not just for government action but also for a new spirit of self-help and mutual aid.

As part of the Arctic Dispatches series, reporting from Alaska, Oliver Milman asked whether the catastrophic melting of Arctic ice could be reversed using an unlikely substance – sand. It’s a compelling read that explores unusual ways technology and creative thinking could be employed to slow the effects of climate change. Our only strategy at present seems to be to tell people to stop burning fossil fuels. It’s a good idea, but it is going to need a lot more than that to stop the Arctic’s sea ice from disappearing. Steven Desch, lead physicist Last week it was announced that the British government would consider a ban on cotton buds, plastic drinking straws and other single-use plastics, following the success of the 5p plastic bag charge. But compared to the plastic bag ban introduced in Kenya last year – which threatens up to four years’ imprisonment and fines of up to $40,000 (£31,000) for anyone producing, selling or even carrying a plastic bag – Britain’s actions look like child’s play. Jonathan Watts has been in Nairobi and writes about the impact of the Kenyan ban eight months after it was introduced.

Samantha Bee “Like many of you, I am shocked by President Trump’s press conference with Vladimir Putin this week,” began Samantha Bee, before showing footage from the summit in Helsinki. “I guess we’ll never know who to believe: Trump’s own intelligence agencies and his Department of Justice, or the guy who smiles like he can only orgasm when a journalist dies. “Let me just say, as an American citizen and as a believer in a true and free world,” Bee continued, “seeing those two next to each other makes me think, how many phone books is Putin standing on? We do not talk enough about how Putin is tiny.” The host went on to say that “there is not one part of that groveling display that Trump hasn’t said before”, showing video of the numerous occasions where he has called into question the validity of US intelligence agencies’ claim that Russia meddled in the 2016 election. “The most shocking thing on TV this week wasn’t Trump and Putin standing on a platform and roasting the United States like a geopolitical Statler and Waldorf,” Bee said. “What shocked me was the fact that Republicans seemed shocked.” Bee then took aim at the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and House speaker, Paul Ryan: “Republicans could make sure that our next elections aren’t vulnerable to Russian hacks, which approximately no one is doing,” she said. “They could also pass a bill to protect the Mueller investigation, like the one Mitch McConnell killed in the Senate and Paul Ryan said wasn’t necessary. “Republican leaders are every bit as compromised by Russia as Trump,” she concluded. “McConnell and Ryan have so far put up with whatever Putin wants and, as far as we know, they haven’t been peed on by anyone.” Stephen Colbert CBS’s Stephen Colbert also weighed in. “They say that time heals all wounds, and they are wrong,” the host began. “Time can also fester all wounds and then you have to start lopping stuff off before it spreads. I’m beginning to think it’s time to reach for the bone saw because anybody who still believes Donald Trump at this point is gangrene on the body politic. “I’m about as shaky as I have felt since the night he won,” Colbert added. “Back then, my biggest fear was that we had elected an asset of the Russian government who would sell out America at every opportunity just to save his own hide. My biggest fear now is that I was right. “After getting caught publicly betraying the country he’s the president of, Donald Trump cunningly fixed it,” said the host, in reference to Trump’s claim that he intended to say “wouldn’t” instead of “would” in Helsinki. “Trump doesn’t even understand why people on all sides of the political spectrum are horrified,” Colbert said, reading aloud Trump’s tweet which stated: “So many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki.” “That, I believe,” Colbert quipped. “I’m sure the highest ends of Russian intelligence loved it.” Seth Meyers Finally, NBC’s Seth Meyers discussed the spectrum of the GOP’s reaction to Trump’s Helsinki comments. He began: “It’s tough to judge exactly how bad any given moment is for Trump politically, but one of the best barometers we have is the reaction of his closest allies, like Fox &amp; Friends, who’ve defended him relentlessly even in his worst moments.” Meyers proceeded to show footage from the show, where host Brian Kilmeade said that Trump missed the “one moment you had to stand up for your own country”. “But this actually captures the rift that Trump’s summit has opened up within the GOP,” Meyers said. “Because on that same show, after Fox &amp; Friends criticized Trump, they also had on one of his staunchest defenders, Fox anchor Jeanine Pirro, who flipped out at the suggestion that Trump could’ve been tougher on Putin.” In a clip from the interview with Pirro, the anchor suggests Trump was merely “recognizing” Russia as a nuclear power and is “doing what he’s supposed to be doing, and that is protecting us”. “Even when Republicans do criticize Trump, they seem much less interested in doing anything about it,” Meyers said. He then discussed the Republican senator Jeff Flake, who called Trump’s Helsinki performance “shameful” but demurred when asked on CNN what substantive legislation or action would come from it. Meyers replied: “I feel like at least once a week Jeff Flake tweets something about Trump that ends with ‘This is shameful’ and then votes with him anyway.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2016/apr/24/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-plant-decision-delayed-again-by-edf","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-24T17:34:38Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant decision delayed again by EDF","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/24/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-plant-decision-delayed-again-by-edf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/apr/24/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-plant-decision-delayed-again-by-edf","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant decision delayed again by EDF","bodyText":"The decision on whether to go ahead with the £18bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power project has been delayed again, after France’s economy minister said the country’s energy giant EDF may not give it the green light until September. Emmanuel Macron’s comments come a week after he said EDF would deliver its verdict on Hinkley Point, which is set to meet 7% of the UK’s energy needs, in “the coming week or month”. EDF said just days ago that it was expecting to make a final decision in the summer, having previously promised to do so by the time of its annual general meeting on 12 May. The fresh delay raises the prospect that even if the project does go ahead, it will not meet its scheduled completion date of 2025, already eight years later than originally planned. Macron told a French newspaper that three conditions must be in place before EDF, which is 85% government-owned, could proceed with building two reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset. He cited an improvement in EDF’s financial position, consultation with French trade unions and unspecified measures to ensure construction goes according to plan. “The final investment decision could be confirmed next September,” he said. Hinkley Point has proved controversial in the UK. There have been allegations that the project is too expensive and fears that a series of delays suffered on similar EDF nuclear projects in France and Finland could be replicated. EDF has also faced opposition from French trade union officials who say the project threatens the company’s financial stability. It has since approved a £3.1bn capital injection funded partly by the state, in a bid to shore up its finances ahead of the Hinkley decision. The fresh delay is likely to fuel criticism of the project from organisations such as Greenpeace, which last week said the project was an “utter mess”. Greenpeace’s director, John Sauven, responded to EDF’s previous announcement that a decision would not come until the summer by cautioning that the project was doomed. “This may now be the sign that the entire project is coming to a grinding halt and the UK government urgently needs to back renewable energy as a more reliable alternative,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/apr/19/extinction-rebellion-may-be-our-last-chance","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-04-19T16:12:14Z","webTitle":"Extinction Rebellion may be our last chance | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/19/extinction-rebellion-may-be-our-last-chance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/apr/19/extinction-rebellion-may-be-our-last-chance","fields":{"headline":"Extinction Rebellion may be our last chance","bodyText":"I hope Extinction Rebellion pushes climate chaos to the top of the political agenda, but Ben Smoke is right that glorifying arrest won’t advance the climate cause (Journal, 16 April). As well as diverting effort into battles with the criminal justice system, it distracts from thousands of ways to decarbonise the economy: pension funds, insurance companies and banks control $400tn in assets, making decisions daily about where to invest, as well as influencing company boards, as Larry Elliott points out (Threadneedle Street’s timely warning for banks and insurers to take climate change seriously, 16 April). Local authorities shape our environment (and own £400bn in assets), and soon voters will decide who should run them. Every employer, school and household can make decisions that turn away from chaos. The suffragettes’ battle for the vote is celebrated as a great victory for direct action, but 100 years later the struggle for women’s equality is still being waged within countless institutions. Creating lasting change takes political skill, as well as passion and persistence. For democracies to solve difficult problems like climate change and inequality, schools need to teach practical politics as a basic skill. Titus Alexander Author of Practical Politics: Lessons in Power and Democracy; convener, Democracy Matters • I agree with Ben Smoke that it’s important not to fetishise the number of arrests in relation to current protests. Extinction Rebellion places too much emphasis on number of arrests. Think the government will negotiate on matters of substance? Think again. I speak as one taking part in the actions this week. The urgency is real, and people need to know the truth. But it will take profound public pressure on other parts of our system that hold us in stasis – vested interests, fossil fuel companies particularly, MPs and ministers, the media, finance, and local government. We need to listen to our allies and work with them, community groups and NGOs particularly. Extinction Rebellion’s sophistication around direct action will need to be matched by effective political strategy to achieve the kind of changes needed. Gill Westcott Cheriton Bishop, Exeter • Thirty years ago I was chair of the Green party’s media committee. Caroline Lucas was the party’s press officer. We were working on the 1989 European election campaign – the one where the Greens won 15% of the vote but no seats (no PR then). Two days ago, I visited three of the four Extinction Rebellion sites and talked to activists. They were deeply impressive, committed people – non-violent, refusing to blame and shame, empathic, compassionate and universalist (Climate protesters target transport and Corbyn, as disruption hits traders, 18 April). Everything the Green party said 30 years ago is coming to pass. The planet can’t wait much longer. I commend the bravery, passion and wit of Extinction rebels. Recognised routes of influencing events have failed. Non-violent direct action led to the birth of civil rights for all in the US. Maybe it can lead to a Green New Deal here. This may be our last chance. Lyn Dade Twickenham, Middlesex • I read the article by Mark Carney, François Villeroy de Galhau and Frank Elderson of the Network for Greening the Financial System (Global finance must go green if we are to fight climate change, 17 April) on the way to an investor meeting, which I had to cancel due to the Extinction Rebellion protests at Oxford Circus. I’m raising investment for a reusable plastic-free biodegradable and compostable paint tin, to stop plastic single-use items ending up in landfill or the ocean in their hundreds of millions. I don’t disagree with the aims of the protest, but targeting all the business community is not right. Some of us get it and are doing something about it; please, activists, focus your protests on those who aren’t. Kim Thonger Finedon, Northamptonshire • The letter about HS2 from Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram (19 April), mayors of Manchester and Liverpool, might be persuasive if it were not written while Extinction Rebellion takes action against climate catastrophe and David Attenborough delivers his powerful piece on BBC One. The mayors’ letter is peppered with words and phrases that mean growth: economic potential, released capacity and, of course, the yearned-for “powerhouse”. But what the young people of Extinction Rebellion are saying is: how can you offer us a future based on growth? What is the point of releasing capacity if we run out of the planet’s fundamental resources: water, clean air, space to live that will not be flooded with seawater, soil in which food can grow? What we need is a plan – a transport plan, an everything plan – that considers every single aspect in relation to the threat to these resources. Alison Leonard Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire No more tall glass buildings Tall glass buildings have a devastating effect on our collective wellbeing (Global finance must go green if we are to fight climate change, Journal, 17 April). They produce more CO2 per metre squared in construction and operation for every higher floor they support. Their huge energy demand spikes at the hottest/coldest times of day/year, driving grids to the brink of collapse. In future extreme heatwaves, like that of 2003, they can cause power outages across whole regions and resulting citizen deaths. They increase pedestrian discomfort, even killing people with the superwinds created around their structures. When they burn catastrophically, people above the fire may not survive. They reflect heat on to adjacent buildings, driving up their energy consumption and discomfort in those opposite. They shade whole urban areas from winter sun and the ability to generate solar energy in their shadow. They can destroy the mental peace of neighbourhoods by their overbearing dominance of the skyline, like the Walkie Talkie in London. Who will pay to demolish them when they catastrophically fail, like Grenfell Tower did? Yet planners ignore such risks and fall over themselves to give permission for the next one. Norman Foster’s Tulip is the latest unnecessary London ego trip. The Tulip is indeed a huge (light) bulb heating up the sky and driving climate change. Bankers must take the responsible step of de-risking cities by never again financing these structures that should now be seen as gigantic climate risks. Susan Roaf Oxford Invest in low-carbon but not in nuclear In a week when Brexit for once did not lead the headlines, it is the world’s most critical problem that has come back to the fore – the dire concerns over climate change. Mark Carney’s warning to financial regulators, banks and insurers around the world to “raise the bar” can’t come soon enough. The Extinction Rebellion movement has very much focused attention this week on climate change, and whatever their methods, it is really important we focus public policy on this massive threat to our long-term wellbeing. Councils are fully aware of their important responsibility in this as local leaders, and the raft of climate emergency resolutions, coupled with developing programmes of radical action, is our contribution to dealing with this existential threat. It is about time the financiers picked up the baton, as the major societal change required to come anywhere close to dealing with this challenge needs both lots of money and the transformation of economies to work. So I encourage this sector to work more effectively with government at all levels and stop investing in high-carbon fossil fuels, but also in nuclear power, which is just too slow to realise and too expensive to deal with the urgency of the climate crisis. Billions, if not trillions, needs to be invested now in low-carbon energy, storage, efficiency, transport and heating solutions. Politicians can only do so much. Extinction Rebellion is right in that we should have been taking much more urgent action over the past 40 years, and as policymakers we should accept that common failure. Now is the time for rapid change so that all our grandchildren and future generations can have a real chance of a decent life. To the financial sector, I urge them to get on with supporting us in that endeavour. Councillor David Blackburn Chair of UK and Ireland Nuclear Free Local Authorities steering committee Vital that energy sector is nationalised The article by Clive Lewis MP was excellent (Labour’s message to UK’s young climate strikers, theguardian.com, 12 April). But Labour’s ambition for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century is not fast enough. We will be committed to at least 2C warming by then due to CO2’s long lifecycle. The scientists who publish the IPCC report have been clear – we have 12 years to transform our power infrastructure. That transformation will cost $45tn according to the International Energy Agency. Your article on Mark Carney’s warning to the financial sector cites a figure of $20tn for assets at risk due to climate change. There are only three choices regarding who will pay these gigantic bills: governments, consumers or shareholders. Only the government has the balance sheet, the borrowing capacity and the timeframe to mothball fossil fuel-driven power plants and build new renewable energy assets. As Gordon Brown taught the world in the 2008 financial meltdown, if you want to move fast, nationalise. The only practical way to turbocharge the energy transition is to nationalise the power sector, allowing existing shareholders an exit or opportunity to swap their shares into a renewable sector de-risked by government involvement. In simple terms, a government exists to do what citizens cannot do for themselves. The ability to mobilise resources in the face of an external threat led the UK to its “finest hour”, as Churchill observed. The first paper connecting CO2 and the greenhouse effect came out in the 1970s. Nearly 50 years later the nations of the world have failed to rein in the pollutants responsible for global warming. The next generation are demanding a response to the climate crisis and those with the experience to legislate, to finance and to procure must advance bold measures such as nationalisation to deliver a better future. John Curtis Director, Ventnor Botanic Garden Rebels cannot be all things to all people Regarding Andre Spicer’s article about Extinction Rebellion (The Extinction Rebels have got their tactics badly wrong. Here’s why, theguardian.com, 19 April), semantics are important on the left/right political axis, but what’s more important is the plurality of messaging. Extinction Rebellion cannot be all things to all people. In the wake of the current protests and David Attenborough’s Climate Change – The Facts programme, it’s now the job of other voices across the political and cultural spectrum to sound the clarion of change in language their respective demographics will understand. Extinction Rebellion and Attenborough’s team have opened the door to making that possible. Those of us in the media, the arts and beyond have a duty to get on with it. Blake Wellsted London Environment must top political agenda Sajid Javid referred to protesters “disrupting the lives of others” (Report, 19 April). Presumably far better to leave it until their lives are disrupted by rising sea levels, ferocious storms, flood, drought, crop failure, starvation, mass migration and extinction of much of the life of the biosphere. Any politician with the intelligence, or care for humanity, to see beyond the next election would be in Westminster right now urgently working out how to save the world from approaching catastrophe – but maybe that’s somewhere on the list, after the next-but-one Brexit extension. Hilary Lang Frome, Somerset • Thank you for the ideas to mitigate climate change (Team green: firms and nations with a conscience, 19 April).

Together, these constitute the two greatest nuclear accidents the world has ever seen. Even now, widespread confusion over these disasters still blights rational discussion on energy production; too often the debate becomes needlessly acrimonious, reliant on rhetoric in lieu of facts. Yet as climate change becomes an ever-encroaching factor, we need more than ever to have a reasoned discussion on nuclear power. To this end, it’s worth dispelling some persistent myths. The events in the Ukrainian town of Pripyat on the morning of 26 April 1986 have permanently etched the name Chernobyl, and all its connotations, into the public mind. With a dark irony, it was a poorly conducted safety experiment that was the catalyst for the worst nuclear disaster in history. The full odious sequence of events that led to the accident would constitute an entire article. In essence, however, the mixture of flawed design, disabled redundancies and a tragic disregard for experimental protocol all feature heavily in the blueprint of the disaster. The net result of this errant test was a massive steam explosion, replete with enough kick to blow the 2,000 ton reactor casting clean through the roof of the reactor building. Despite the sheer explosive force of the eruption, what ensued was not a nuclear blast. The spectre of the cold war has left an unfortunate conflation between nuclear weapons and nuclear power, but it is important to note that they operate on very different principles. The Chernobyl explosion was instead a conventional high-pressure failure due to excess steam. Seconds later, the remaining coolant flashed to steam and a second even greater explosion occurred, dispersing the shattered nuclear core and effectively terminating the chain reaction. This second explosion also ejected chunks of graphite moderator into the air, which caught fire, releasing radioactive fallout. It’s estimated that the second explosion released 40bn joules of energy - roughly equivalent to a staggering 10 tons of TNT. Contrary to all safety regulations, the roof of the reactor complex had been constructed with bitumen, which proved a highly flammable agent. The burning, highly toxic graphite rods ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor. To compound matters further, the night shift and engineering chief squabbled over whether the reactor should be shut downFor several hours workers were in situ with minimal protection. Firefighters arrived on the scene, completely unaware of the dangers they were being exposed to. In the commotion, a helicopter tasked with dumping 5,000 metric tons of sand and neutron-absorbing boron in an effort to quench the flames collided with a crane and spiralled into the ground, killing all four of crew members immediately - a tragic event caught on camera. By 5am the fire had been brought under control, but a number of men had been exposed to high radiation levels and lacked even the most basic protection. The Soviet response was an unmitigated disaster; rather than admit the fault and take preventative action, the authorities pretended nothing was amiss. In this interim of inaction, hazardous material released in the blast seeped unimpeded into the soil around Pripyat, chief among them radio-iodine 131. This radio-isotope has a half-life of a mere eight days, but if ingested it can accumulate in the thyroid, leading to illness and the potential emergence of thyroid cancer in later life. To circumvent this, those exposed to high levels of radio-iodine are generally given potassium iodide to prevent ill effect. But even this basic prophylactic response was not taken, and residents continued to ingest contaminated food. Finally, a full 36 hours after the explosion, the authorities gave the order to evacuate. This too was likely to have been covered up, had traces of radioactive fallout not been detected at a Swedish nuclear facility the next day, which revealed the scale of the problem to the world. Chernobyl was a perfect storm, a damning tale of ineptitude leading to needless loss of life. It was also unequivocally the world’s worst nuclear accident. To many, it is also heralded as proof-positive that nuclear energy was inherently unsafe, a narrative adopted by many anti-nuclear groups. The word Chernobyl became synonymous with death on a massive scale. But perception and reality do not always neatly align; in the wake of the disaster, the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) and others undertook a co-ordinated effort to follow up on health effects. In 2006, after two decades of monitoring they outlined the health effects; of the firefighters exposed to the huge core doses and incredibly toxic smoke, 28 died from acute radiation sickness. A further 15 perished from thyroid cancer. Despite aggressive monitoring for three decades, there has been no significant increase in solid tumours or delayed health effects, even in the hundreds of thousands of minimally protected cleanup workers who helped purge the site after the accident. In the words of the 2008 UNSCEAR report: “There is no scientific evidence of increases in overall cancer incidence or mortality rates or in rates of non-malignant disorders that could be related to radiation exposure. It added: “The incidence of leukaemia in the general population, one of the main concerns owing to the shorter time expected between exposure and its occurrence compared with solid cancers, does not appear to be elevated. Although most highly exposed individuals are at an increased risk of radiation-associated effects, the great majority of the population is not likely to experience serious health consequences as a result of radiation from the Chernobyl accident. Many other health problems have been noted in the populations that are not related to radiation exposure.” Of course, the fact that the health impact of Chernobyl is far less than people tend to believe should not detract from the tragedy: at least 43 people died as a direct consequence of the disaster and up to 4,000 others exposed in 1986 might yet exhibit some ill effect. Moreover, the scale of disruption in the wake of the incident was enormous, with around 115,000 people evacuated by the authorities from areas surrounding the reactor in 1986. To this day, a 30km exclusion zone around the reactor has been maintained for precaution, despite the radiation level in this boundary being far below that which would cause damage. Unmolested by human hands, the Chernobyl exclusion zone has become an incredible natural wildlife habit and a growing tourist attraction. But for ideological opponents of nuclear power, this reality is largely ignored; a Russian non-peer-reviewed report garnered headlines with the claim 985,000 died as a result of the accident, a number subsequently exposed as baseless by the Radiation Protection Dosimetry journal. The scientific evidence also undermined Greenpeace, who had long used the spectre of Chernobyl (and more recently, Fukushima) as a prop in their anti-nuclear narrative. They and European Greens scrambled to counter this by releasing “The other report on Chernobyl (Torch)” in 2006 as a counter to the Chernobyl forum. In it, they reported that more than 200,000 deaths might be attributable to the disaster. This figure too is devoid of merit, a transparent attempt to circumvent the scientific consensus. Such empty hyperbole and stubborn insistence on projecting ideology over reality isn’t merely intellectually vapid, it’s actively damaging to the psychological health of survivors. This is also explicitly touched on in a 2005 World Health Organisation report: “Designation of the affected population as ‘victims’ rather than ‘survivors’ has led them to perceive themselves as helpless, weak and lacking control over their future. This ... has led either to overcautious behaviour and exaggerated health concerns, or to reckless conduct.” Unlike the accident in the Ukraine, events at Fukushima in March 2011 were not the result of ineptitude but rather a massive natural disaster in the form of a deadly 15-metre high tsunami. The wall of rushing water flooded the Fukushima plant, water-logging the diesel generators that had been cooling the plant, resulting in the leakage of small amounts of nuclear waste product. While the world media fixated on the drama unfolding at the plant, it lost sight of the fact that around 16,000 had just been killed in a massive natural disaster. Despite the preponderance of breathless headlines since the reality is that five years later, radiobiological consequences of Fukushima are practically negligible - no one has died from the event, and is it extraordinarily unlikely that anyone will do so in future. The volume of radioactive leak from the site is so small as to be of no health concern; there is no detectable radiation from the accident in Fukushima grown-food, nor in fish caught off the coast. This of course hasn’t stopped numerous organisations employing Fukushima as an anti-nuclear argument, despite the lack of justification for doing so. It is important also to see these disasters in the wider context of energy production: when the Banqiao hydroelectric dam failed in China in 1975 in led to at least 171000 deaths and displaced 11 million people. Even windpower has resulted in more than 100 deaths since the 1990s. None of this is to denigrate the vital importance of such technologies, but rather to point out that every form of energy production has some inherent risk. Our reliance on fossil fuels is particularly costly, not only to the environment but to human health; each year, at least 1.3 million people are estimated to die from air pollution. More recent estimates put this figure at 5.5 million. Yet as I have expanded upon previously for this paper, ideological opposition is hard to overcome and nuclear is no exception. In the wake of Fukushima, Germany acquiesced to demands from lobby groups to shut down its nuclear sector, building heavily polluting fossil-fuel plants in their stead. Japan too suspended its nuclear grid, becoming the second-largest net importer of fossil fuels in the world. Some ostensible environmental campaigners lauded this, oblivious to the fact these decisions condemned the environmental to further damage. If this is “victory” for the environment, it is a resoundingly pyrrhic kind. Shutdown of the plants in Japan has led to not only increased pollution, but rolling blackouts and protests. By contrast, France has for decades produced 75% of its energy through nuclear, and enjoys the cleanest air and among the lowest carbon emissions of any industrialised nature. The IPCC stress that nuclear power must be considered if we are to halt climate change, with some estimates suggested nuclear capacity needs to double if we are to stave off the worst ravages of climate change. Even so, resistance to nuclear remains, and scare-stories about Chernobyl and Fukushima are too often employed as an empty rebuttal by those unwilling to countenance the situation we face. Nuclear energy is complicated, has drawbacks, and like any form of energy production it has risks. But it is also clean, safe and hugely efficient. If we truly want to have a rational discussion on how best to power our world, we need to confine ourselves to facts rather than fictions and weigh up the advantages and disadvantages without recourse to ill-founded ideological radiophobia. Our very future depends upon it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/13/carbon-dioxide-from-ships-at-sea-to-be-regulated-for-first-time","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T17:22:43Z","webTitle":"Carbon dioxide from ships at sea to be regulated for first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/13/carbon-dioxide-from-ships-at-sea-to-be-regulated-for-first-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/13/carbon-dioxide-from-ships-at-sea-to-be-regulated-for-first-time","fields":{"headline":"Carbon dioxide from ships at sea to be regulated for first time","bodyText":"Carbon dioxide from ships at sea will be regulated for the first time following a historic agreement reached after two weeks of detailed talks in London. Shipping companies will halve their greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 under the plan, brokered by the International Maritime Organization and binding across its 170 member states. The agreement will require a revolution among ships, which are overwhelmingly fuelled by heavy oils at present. In future, they will have to not only be more energy-efficient, but also make use of cleaner energy, in the form of batteries supplying electricity, solar and wind electricity generation, and perhaps even a return to sail in some cases, or more controversially to nuclear power, as some warships already use. Environmental campaigners said the plan was not enough given the urgency of tackling climate change, though they welcomed the deal, which has taken decades of work. Greenhouse gas emissions from shipping and aviation were omitted from the 1997 Kyoto protocol and have been excluded from regulations on carbon ever since, even though shipping is used for 80% of global trade. Although shipping accounts for only about 2% of global carbon emissions, it has been a cause of particular concern, both because of the increased need for transport under the globalising economy and because many ships use dirty, carbon-rich fuels such as heavy diesel, which would be banned in many countries from onshore transport. Campaigners said cuts of at least 70% from shipping emissions by 2050, compared with the 2008 baseline chosen by the IMO, would be needed to meet the aims of the landmark 2015 Paris agreement, under which countries have agreed that temperature rises should be limited to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. John Maggs, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition and senior policy adviser at the campaigning group Seas at Risk, said: “We have an important agreement and this level of ambition will ultimately require a sector-wide shift to new fuels and propulsion technologies. But what happens next is crucial. The IMO must move swiftly to introduce measures that will cut emissions deeply and quickly in the short term – without these, the goals of the Paris agreement will remain out of reach.” Sveinung Oftedal, chair of the negotiations at the IMO for the Norwegian government, compared the achievement to the space race, saying: “Like Apollo 11 returning to Earth, we knew we needed to land and we did.” Countries holding out against a stronger agreement included Brazil, Panama, Saudi Arabia and the US, according to Bill Hemmings, shipping director at Transport &amp; Environment, an NGO.

Further sub-sea tunnels are under construction, with a 10.6km tunnel linking Tórshavn and the island of Sandoy, and another connecting the southern ends of two peninsulas on Eysturoy. It would be possible for tunnels to link Millport and Bute and reduce the isolation of the Kintyre peninsula.

David Nowell New Barnet, Hertfordshire Animals breeding resistance Congratulations on your article “The world is facing an antibiotic apocalypse” (News, last week). However, as a GP, I would like to explore some of the points. According to NHS Improvement, in 2015-16, GPs cut antibiotic use by 7.3%. Some 2.7m fewer antibiotics were prescribed. The unnecessary use of broad spectrum antibiotics, used in the treatment of severe infection, fell by 16%. Some 80% of antibiotics handed out are prescribed by GPs, who recognise the problems of antibiotic resistance. In farming, the overuse of antibiotics in food animals is leading to a crisis in resistance. In the US, 80% of all antibiotics used are given to food animals. Globally, animals receive almost three times as many antibiotics as people. The use of antibiotics in food animals is often not medically necessary. They are used to promote growth and prevent illnesses that result from severe overcrowding and filthy living conditions. Dr Chris Woods Bury, Lancashire Gun lobby’s lethal cant Once again, after the mass shootings in Las Vegas, the US gun lobby and its apologists defend their constitutional right to “bear arms”. Apparently, daily shootings and occasional mass carnage is the price US citizens will have to pay. (“After Vegas, why do we still treat the US as a civilised state?”, Catherine Bennett, last week). Listening to the specious arguments peddled on behalf of the firearms industry reminded me of a quote by the US author Upton Sinclair: “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.” Barry Solomons Manchester Nuclear power still too costly The section on nuclear power in “How green is Britain’s record on renewable energy supply?” (Business, last week) gave a wrong impression. It gave the percentage of electricity generated by nuclear power as 23.6% in April and June this year and an EDF prediction for that percentage by 2035 as “around a third”. The article lists the requirements – completion of Hinkley Point C and three other power stations – without raising the probability that will not happen, partly because of the massive subsidies which would be required. Many planned renewable power installations are costed as producing electricity at half the projected cost of nuclear, and likely to decrease, whereas nuclear costs are projected to increase. Renewables could efficiently provide for our needs without the need for expensive nuclear power. Richard Wells Aberystwyth It’s us against the EU David Goodhart’s conclusion (“Britons need to rediscover the ties that bind”, Comment, last week) concurred with my thinking: the EU isn’t negotiating in good faith, but willing failure. David Davis ingeniously met the EU’s insistence on keeping the Irish border porous, only to be rebuffed. There was a refusal to enter into negotiations on even a transitional agreement on trade in goods and services. The EU wants its citizens to have more rights here than ours. Its attitude is so self-important and condescending that it’s beginning to justify our coming out. Because of the EU’s intransigence, we are coming together, willing to make a success of the hard Brexit in prospect. It will be unity against the EU and, I suspect, under a Tory government come the next election. I cannot conceive our admitting to the EU that we’ve made a mistake and asking permission to crawl back in, on whatever conditions it lays down.

He touts supremacy from behind thinly concealed contempt. In withdrawing America from the Iran nuclear agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Mr Trump risks pushing Iran out into the cold, triggering a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and handing power to the hardliners in Tehran. In place of the UN-approved deal is little more than Mr Trump’s bombastic promises of greater American independence and fewer unnecessary constraints. Mr Trump all but declared war on Iran in a speech largely estranged from fact. Contrary to his claims, Iran has abided by the agreement, as UN weapons inspectors attest. Tehran is not on the “cusp of acquiring the world’s most dangerous weapons”. In fact the deal allows Iran to continue to enrich uranium – but it is neither allowed nor technically able to use this process to produce weapons-grade uranium. Under the agreement, Iran cannot reprocess plutonium either, an alternative path to a nuclear explosive. Mr Trump’s invective should surprise no one; he relies on assertions that reinforce prejudices but have no basis in truth. The premise of the JCPOA was to allow Iran to benefit from the global economy in exchange for denuclearisation. It is now incumbent on the US to, in Mr Trump’s words, find a “lasting solution to the Iranian nuclear threat”. Yet there is no plan forthcoming from the White House. The absence of American leadership in the world will mean that the Europeans – principally the main powers of the UK, Germany and France – will have to work reluctantly with Russia and China to uphold the agreement. This will require protection for firms and banks engaged in trade and financial transactions with Iran. Without Washington’s support this may mean resorting to non-dollar deals to evade US sanctions. Like his rejection of the Paris climate deal, Mr Trump opposed the Iranian nuclear deal not because he understood the details and consequences of a complex agreement’s terms but because he wanted, scandalously, to signal that former US president Barack Obama did not necessarily have US interests at heart when he negotiated the agreement. When international agreements are not insulated from partisanship by constitutional principle, then deals are likely to be stop-gap solutions. North Korea will understand this lesson only too well. The US is the author of Iran’s success. Its disastrous invasion of Iraq saw Iranian influence grow along a Shia crescent in the northern Middle East. Tehran’s proxies prop up the murderous dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and have emerged as powerful political blocks in Lebanon and Iraq. The anti-Iranian outbursts by Mr Trump and his team create a narrative in which war with Tehran is the only viable policy. Goading Iran’s hardliners to restart weapons programmes is an extremely high-risk strategy likely to trigger to a military confrontation between the US and Iran and probably the Syrian regime. The problem is that such a conflict would most likely also involve Russia and Israel, the latter an undeclared nuclear power and Iran’s most vocal critic. Meanwhile Saudi Arabia is pushing for the right to either enrich or reprocess nuclear material. If it is allowed to then no doubt the United Arab Emirates, with its history of turning a blind eye to illicit nuclear weapons programmes, would want to do the same. Mr Trump is opening a Pandora’s box in the Middle East. The world needs to convince him to close it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/01/will-theresa-may-follow-richard-nixons-lead","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-01T18:32:35Z","webTitle":"Will Theresa May follow Richard Nixon’s lead? | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/01/will-theresa-may-follow-richard-nixons-lead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/01/will-theresa-may-follow-richard-nixons-lead","fields":{"headline":"Will Theresa May follow Richard Nixon’s lead?","bodyText":"If Admiral Lord West really believes (Letters, 25 January) that stability in the Middle East and Mediterranean calls for nuclear attack submarines, he is not living in the real world.

In 2014 the current generated by a forest of giant whirling fans out at sea was priced at around £150 per megawatt hour. In the latest auction this week the comparable cost dropped as low as £57.50/MWh. Even when the cost of providing back-up capacity for still days is added, the cost of producing energy from offshore wind is little more than £70/MWh. Compared to the new Hinkley C nuclear plant which produces electricity at a cost of £92.50/MWh, one has to wonder whether as a nation we should persist with nuclear energy as an option to reduce our greenhouse gas output. Hinkley looks like a dinosaur even before it arrives on earth. It’s unclear whether the unproven design will ever get built. If it does, the cost of complying with safety and anti-terrorism standards may well be prohibitive. Hinkley was conceived when the conventional wisdom was that we would start to run out of hydrocarbons. Fears of a runaway price for oil and gas now look overheated. The government has however supported plans to install a nuclear power plant, backed by French and Chinese state operators, costing £18bn. Nuclear power has a trump card: it is a zero-carbon technology which delivers a continuous, uninterrupted supply. This may be a consideration in the years ahead if the UK banned petrol engines and only allowed electric cars. Imagine, say nuclear fans, the surge of demand when everyone got home and plugged in their motors. But we are not there yet. Driving all this is Britain’s Climate Change Act, which stipulates that by 2050 the country’s net emissions of greenhouse gases should be 80% lower than in 1990. The latest “carbon budget” sets a cap on emissions between 2028 and 2032 and requires a 57% reduction in emissions by 2030. In this piece of work it was recommended that the power sector reduced the amount of carbon produced per unit of energy to less than 100g of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour. It also considered what would happen if the UK decarbonised without nuclear power and calculated that this carbon intensity limit would be breached by 20%. But the committee did not envisage how quickly the cost of electricity generated by offshore wind would fall, which suggests a greater role for it at the expense of nuclear power. So it is worrying that we have not heard a whisper from ministers about a clean growth plan to meet emission targets that takes into account the cost-effectiveness of wind. Instead, onshore turbines are currently banned. The last round of offshore wind contracts spent less than two-thirds of the budget allocated. Auctions for solar power last took place in 2015. Experts warn of a palpable chilling of the investment climate for renewables in the UK. Amazingly, under current plans nuclear spending will rise to five times that of offshore wind by 2025. Ministers are looking at nuclear deals with Japan and South Korean firms. Facts should drive Britain’s energy plans, not wishful thinking about sugaring putative trade deals in Asia once the UK leaves the European Union. Policy needs to boost, not restrain, renewables. Economics has sealed the fate of redundant technologies before: last year, thanks to a carbon tax – for the first time – the UK generated more electricity from wind turbines than from burning coal. Greenhouse gas emissions in the UK have now fallen to levels barely seen since the reign of Queen Victoria. In the coming weeks ministers must open the door to a greener, cleaner future where Britain meets greenhouse gas targets without more expensive nuclear plants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2016/dec/26/fake-news-story-prompts-pakistan-to-issue-nuclear-warning-to-israel","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-25T22:35:52Z","webTitle":"Fake news story prompts Pakistan to issue nuclear warning to Israel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/26/fake-news-story-prompts-pakistan-to-issue-nuclear-warning-to-israel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/dec/26/fake-news-story-prompts-pakistan-to-issue-nuclear-warning-to-israel","fields":{"headline":"Fake news story prompts Pakistan to issue nuclear warning to Israel","bodyText":"A fake news story has touched off a Twitter confrontation between nuclear powers Pakistan and Israel, the latest disturbing incident of fabricated stories having a serious impact in the real world. The exchange of tense public words between two countries with a difficult relationship and no diplomatic ties comes the same month that a fake news story about a child abuse ring prompted a gunman to fire shots inside a pizza restaurant in Washington. The spat appeared to have been prompted by the publication of a fake story headlined “Israeli Defense Minister: If Pakistan send ground troops to Syria on any pretext, we will destroy this country with a nuclear attack”. The story appeared on 20 December on the site AWD News, which has been identified by fact-checking organisations as a fake news site. Snopes, one of five organisations chosen by Facebook to vet questionable stores, said AWD News “doesn’t have more than a nodding acquaintance with facts, instead playing on nationalistic fantasy and conspiracy theory to create alarming … stories.” The article mis-identified Moshe Ya’alon as the Israeli defence minister when he actually resigned in May, changed the title of a senior official from the Pakistan government and was dotted with grammatical errors and strange syntax. Undeterred by those warning signs, Pakistan’s defence minister, Khawaja Mohammad Asif, apparently read the article as a genuine threat of a pre-emptive nuclear strike and took to Twitter to warn Israel that “Pakistan is a nuclear state too.” Israel’s defense ministry responded the next day, also on Twitter, saying the original story was “totally fictitious” and the quote had been invented. After the Twitter spat pushed the story into the spotlight, AWD updated it to identify Ya’alon as a former defence minister in the body of the text, but left the headline unchanged. It continued to mis-identify Tariq Fatemi, special assistant to the Pakistani prime minister, as minister of state for foreign affairs. There was no immediate reaction from Pakistan to Israel’s response, but Asif did take time to direct an oblique message at the New York Times. After the paper described his own tweet as a “nuclear threat”, Asif insisted that Pakistan’s nuclear programme “is only a deterrence”. Pakistan became a nuclear power in 1998. Israel officially neither confirms nor denies the existence of an arsenal, but its nuclear programme has been an open secret since the 1980s. Their dispute is the latest case of fake news, peddled by sites with political aims or simply to earn money from advertising, influencing the real world. Concern about real world spillover spiked in early December after a man opened fire in a pizza restaurant in Washington DC after becoming convinced by fake news reports that it was used for child sex abuse. He claimed he had come to investigate “Pizzagate”, a baseless conspiracy, which falsely claims Clinton and her campaign chief John Podesta were running a child sex ring from the restaurant’s backrooms. Tech companies have come under increasing pressure to roll out changes to attempt to thwart the trend, which has become a global problem. Germany’s political mainstream is getting increasingly nervous about the effect that the rise of fake news, hacking and misinformation might have on federal elections next autumn, particularly since the US election. Many in France are also concerned about the possible impact on Presidential elections in the spring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/sep/12/hurricane-florence-north-carolina-nuclear-plants-prepare","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-09-12T17:42:44Z","webTitle":"Hurricane Florence: North Carolina fears possible environmental disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/12/hurricane-florence-north-carolina-nuclear-plants-prepare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/sep/12/hurricane-florence-north-carolina-nuclear-plants-prepare","fields":{"headline":"Hurricane Florence: North Carolina fears possible environmental disaster","bodyText":"Hurricane Florence could cause an environmental disaster in North Carolina, where waste from hog manure pits, coal ash dumps and other industrial sites could wash into homes and threaten drinking water supplies. Preparations are also being made at half a dozen nuclear power plants that stand in the path of the 500-mile-wide hurricane, which is barreling toward the US east coast, expected to make landfall on Thursday night. More than 1.4 million residents across North and South Carolina have been ordered to evacuate. “Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,” the National Hurricane Center warned on Wednesday morning. Donald Trump has declared that his administration was “absolutely, totally prepared” to deal with the storm, despite warnings from the National Weather Service that Florence “will likely be the storm of a lifetime for portions of the Carolina coast”. The president insisted on Wednesday that – despite widespread criticism – his government had done an “under-appreciated great job” handling Hurricane Maria last year in Puerto Rico, which killed nearly 3,000 people. Georgia on Wednesday joined North and South Carolina and Virginia in declaring a state of emergency ahead of the storm making landfall. In North Carolina, computer models predict more than 3ft of rain in the eastern part of the state – and fears were exacerbated by the many environmental hazards lying in the path of the storm. There are 16 nuclear reactors in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, the states expected to suffer the most damage from Florence. Duke Energy, which runs reactors at six sites, has said operators would begin shutting down nuclear plants at least two hours before hurricane-force winds arrive. Brunswick nuclear plant, located south of Wilmington near the mouth of the Cape Fear river, was identified in 2014 by Huffpost and Weather.com as one of the nuclear facilities most at risk from rising sea levels and resulting floods. The Brunswick plant’s two reactors are of the same design as those in Fukushima, Japan, that exploded and leaked radiation following a 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Following that disaster, federal regulators required all US nuclear plants to perform upgrades to better withstand earthquakes and flooding. Duke Energy did not respond to requests for information about specific changes made at Brunswick, other than to say emergency generators and pumps will remove stormwater at the plant if it floods. The company issued assurances this week that it is ready for Florence, which is predicted to pack winds of up to 140mph and a 13ft storm surge. “They were safe then. They are even safer now,” said Kathryn Green, a Duke spokeswoman, referring to the post-Fukushima improvements. “We have backups for backups for backups.” The area in the path of the storm in eastern North Carolina is a fertile low-lying plain veined by brackish rivers with a propensity for escaping their banks. Longtime locals don’t have to strain their imaginations to foresee what rain at the level predicted from Florence can do. It’s happened before. In September 1999, Hurricane Floyd came ashore near Cape Fear as a category 2 storm that dumped about 2ft of water on a region already soaked days earlier by Hurricane Dennis. The result was the worst natural disaster in state history, a flood that killed dozens of people and left whole towns underwater, with residents stranded on rooftops. The bloated carcasses of hundreds of thousands of hogs, chickens and other drowned livestock bobbed in a nose-stinging soup of fecal matter, pesticides, fertilizer and gasoline so toxic that fish flopped helplessly on the surface to escape it. Rescue workers smeared Vick’s VapoRub under their noses to try to numb their senses against the stench. Florence is forecast to make landfall in the same region as a much stronger storm. “This one is pretty scary,” said Jamie Kruse, director of the Center for Natural Hazards Research at East Carolina University. “The environmental impacts will be from concentrated animal feeding operations and coal ash pits. Until the system gets flushed out, there’s going to be a lot of junk in the water.” North Carolina has roughly 2,100 industrial-scale pork farms containing more than 9 million hogs typically housed in long metal sheds with grated floors designed to allow the animals’ urine and feces to fall through and flow into nearby open-air pits containing millions of gallons of untreated sewage. During Floyd, dozens of these lagoons either breached or were inundated by flood waters, spilling the contents. State taxpayers ended up buying out and closing 43 farms located in floodplains. To prepare for Florence, the North Carolina Pork Council says its members have pumped down lagoon levels to absorb at least 2ft of rain. Low-lying farms have been moving their hogs to higher ground. The Environmental Protection Agency said on Tuesday that it would be monitoring nine toxic waste cleanup sites near the Carolinas coast for potential flooding. More than a dozen such Superfund sites in and around Houston flooded last year in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, with spills of potentially hazardous materials reported at two. Also of concern are more than two dozen massive coal ash pits operated by Duke Energy. The gray ash that remains after coal is burned contains potentially harmful amounts of mercury, arsenic and lead. Since power plants need vast amounts of water to generate steam, their unlined waste pits are located along lakes and rivers. Some of the pits were inundated during past storms, including during Floyd and Hurricane Matthew in 2016. After a 2014 spill at a Duke plant that coated 70 miles of the Dan river in toxic gray sludge, state regulators forced the Charlotte-based company to begin phasing out its coal ash pits by 2029. Because that work was already under way, wastewater levels inside the ash ponds have been falling, a Duke Energy spokesman, Bill Norton, said on Tuesday. “We’re more prepared than ever,” said Norton, adding that crews will be monitoring water levels at the pits throughout the storm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/dec/27/moment-complete-calm-how-guardian-readers-unwind","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-12-27T10:00:19Z","webTitle":"'I felt a moment of complete calm': how Guardian readers unwind","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/27/moment-complete-calm-how-guardian-readers-unwind","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/27/moment-complete-calm-how-guardian-readers-unwind","fields":{"headline":"'I felt a moment of complete calm': how Guardian readers unwind","bodyText":"Alfred Millan, London After a classic London renting situation, where my partner and I had to live with a leak just above the bed for a month, we finally got the savings together to get a shoebox of our own. No leaks yet, thankfully. It was on the first or second day, while we were eating on the floor over a sheet (with a bit of wine in tumblers), and were laughing and looking out of the window, surrounded by an endless pile of boxes and bags, that I felt a sense of calm I had never experienced before. Alison, Cardiff Lying on my swing seat in my garden, the sun shining and a gentle breeze through the leaves of the birch tree above me. My swing seat was the best purchase I ever made: I’m on holiday whenever I sit on it. Whatever my mood, it answers to it, whether I’m happy or sad, elated or exhausted, with friends or on my own, for breakfast, dinner, lunch or tea. It is the best thing. Rozelle Bentheim, London In the middle of a small barn, in May 2012 at the end of 48 hours of lambing, while sitting on a low hay bale; the only human in a barn full of sheep. I am no farmer, and in that barn I was no more than a nursery maid. Sheep mums being mums and lambs being lambs. The nursery had a rhythm: when the skipping and eating stopped, there was a calm that absorbed me. At that moment, life was good, and I was a part of it. I was one of the flock. Matthew, Toronto, Canada Social media has some great benefits, but it can easily become mentally and emotionally burdensome. So, when we went to Havana in Cuba we made the decision to stay in a casa particular, essentially a private home, that had no access to the internet, a phone signal or any of the other trappings of modern life. For two days, in a small farming town called Viñales, we truly switched off. In the months since, I have deleted my Facebook account, closed email accounts and use my phone only for keeping in contact with close family and friends. Gabrielle, New Zealand In the minute after my second daughter’s head had crowned. The midwives were chatting, laughing and taking care of everything. It would soon be just me and my baby, in a secluded newborn ward, where I could just breathe and see the changing light through the window. No criticisms, no complaints, no office politics, no prioritising other people’s moods, no factoring in bills to pay, no existing for others. Only this most real thing that we were still doing together. This was the start of our conversation, the one that will continue all our lives. Caroline Ellis, London Sitting on Pentire Head, near Polzeath, north Cornwall, on a sunny October day in 2013. Tucked out of the wind, feeling the sun on my face and listening to the waves crashing against the cliffs below. The sea was almost turquoise and I felt a moment of complete calm; all was well with the world. Colin Taylor, Exeter, Devon In July 2016, I tagged along for a day on my friend Ralph’s fishing boat, hauling lobster and crab pots for him around the Eastern Isles of the Isles of Scilly. The best bit was halfway through the day, when we were sitting there on the water in the sun, a mile out to sea, eating our cheese and pickle sandwiches, drinking a flask of tea, and lobbing the crusts and the odd bit of crab bait to curious fulmars that had joined us. Marvellous. Jill Strong, La Drôme, France An afternoon in hospital in Montélimar in 2009, after having had all four wisdom teeth removed. They had been growing horizontally and should have come out when I was a teen. One day, at 40 years old, with my first ever real toothache, I was told by a dentist that they had to come out straight away. I was waking up from the anaesthetic and staring out of the window at the intense blue sky, watching huge clouds of steam floating up from the nearby nuclear power station. I am self-employed with two children, and moments like that are incredibly rare. For once, I was without a care in the world. Sue, Somerset I had been having relationship difficulties for some years, and one day snuck away to visit my daughter at university. It was the first time in a long time that I felt free. I didn’t have to watch what I said or did, as I knew my daughter loved me unconditionally. Every minute was precious: we talked, laughed, ate out, shopped and hugged. That day was my first taste of what our life could be if I had the courage to leave, which eventually I did. Vic Leeson, Epworth, north Lincolnshire My first ever wild swim as an adult was September 2012 in a tarn in North Yorkshire, hunting for a friend’s lost mobile phone. However, I didn’t embrace the joys of intentional outdoor swimming until October 2017, and I’ve been addicted ever since. The impact of the water meant I could think of nothing else but what was happening to my body: the numbing of the fingers, the sense of needing to gulp air but attempting to slow myself down to regulate my breathing. The sense of foreboding that I woke up with that morning has gradually faded, and has been replaced with a sense of wonder at immersing myself in the elements. Susan Pearse, Stroud, Gloucestershire September 2016, lying on a sunlounger at night on the terrace of a hotel on a hill outside Fiskardo, Cephalonia, with my husband, Richard. Every night, we would sit there and look at the beautiful sky, with no light pollution, and watch the shooting stars. We did this for an hour, chatting or sometimes just staying silent. Sadly, Richard died suddenly from a heart attack the following April. Perhaps understandably, I haven’t felt as relaxed since as I did on that holiday. Kahina Chillaoui, Brighton It was a bright, clear day in September in a sleepy part of northern France, and I had stopped with my family at a lake. The water was gloriously cold, and I felt alive. Treading water, I turned to look at my family on the empty beach, waving and laughing at me, and I felt absolute contentment at being somewhere so beautiful with the people I love most in the world. The sunlight created an almost perfect reflection of the surrounding arc of trees and I realised that I was miraculously happy. Nic Woodthorpe-Wright, Dubai Being off-grid with no phone, no people, no food, books or noise (other than the occasional breeze and a few flies) in Rub’ al-Khali – AKA the Empty Quarter – one of the most beautiful, harsh and huge deserts in the world. Every year, I get dropped off deep in the desert and stay alone for three days, with enough water and shade to survive, and without any expectations on me or my time. There is no experience like it that has this level of silence and peace. Heather Grant, London Walking the Camino de Santiago in September to mark the end of four years of study. Two girlfriends and I walked the Camino Inglés, and the freedom from anything else other than the walk each day was incredibly liberating. Every morning, we convened at 8am, had breakfast and set off, walking steadily to our destination, pausing occasionally to take in different sights and appreciate the landscape as it unfolded before us. The feeling of release from our cares was amazing, and we are already planning our next walk, along the Portuguese coastal path. Joanna Dale, Lewes I recently started an oil-painting course. The first week was landscapes, and I spent three chilly hours in a field painting the view. It was the most relaxed and carefree I had felt in a long, long time. My painting was pretty dreadful, but it didn’t matter: I had tried something new and felt proud of myself. Poyraz Yapali, İzmir, Turkey In October, I went on a school trip to the Turkish resort of Kusadasi. After a long day of studying, my friends and I were free for the night and went swimming together. Maybe it was the lack of adult supervision, the scent of the sea or the general comfort I had from being with my friends that made me feel so relaxed. We were as free as a bunch of 16-year-olds on a school trip could be, which isn’t much, but at least I felt as if I could do what I wanted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2019/may/01/jared-harris-chernobyl-the-crown-mad-men-richard","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-01T05:00:42Z","webTitle":"Chernobyl's Jared Harris: My wife can't believe how I keep getting bumped off!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/01/jared-harris-chernobyl-the-crown-mad-men-richard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/01/jared-harris-chernobyl-the-crown-mad-men-richard","fields":{"headline":"Chernobyl's Jared Harris: My wife can't believe how I keep getting bumped off!","bodyText":"Jared Harris says that if only he had played Lane Pryce as he was meant to, he would have probably lasted the duration of Mad Men. Pryce, the financial executive at the TV drama’s advertising agency, was supposed to be a right bastard – and the show’s creator Matthew Weiner famously said baddies don’t get written out. But Harris doesn’t do bastards. He will always find a way to humanise a character – a sprinkling of vulnerability here, a dash of tenderness there. And sure enough, three seasons down the line, Lane departed. Harris is getting used to being bumped off. His quietly dignified George VI in The Crown was inevitably done for by a coronary thrombosis. In his latest TV drama, Chernobyl, Harris’s investigative scientist has died before the opening sequence is done and dusted. (Don’t worry, he’s still the lead.) “My wife said, ‘I can’t believe it. Why are they doing this to you again?’ It’s a problem career-wise.” Does he mean that? Well, he says, if he were more money-minded, it would be problematic. “If you die in everything, it means you’re not in a sequel – or, if you’re in a series, you’re not in the next one.” He smiles. “But I’ve never tried to jump on board a franchise, so I was being slightly facetious about that.” Perhaps it’s the lot of the character actor – fascinating parts that end with a bang. And in recent years Harris has established himself as one of our finest. He has also established himself as a man with immaculate taste. Mad Men, The Crown and The Terror, about the Royal Navy’s treacherous 19th-century trip into the unknown, are three of the great contemporary TV dramas. And Chernobyl looks like it’s going to be another. A tense, beautifully written five-parter about the 1986 catastrophe at the nuclear power plant, Chernobyl tells the story of one of the great attempted cover-ups of the 20th century. The Soviet Union was determined not to let the world know that the core of the reactor in Pripyat, northern Ukraine, had exploded. Telephone wires were cut, people were not allowed to leave the city, and the official in charge of the investigation announced that locals had been exposed to radiation equivalent to a chest x-ray. Meanwhile, Harris’s Valery Legasov is determined to tell the truth – whatever the cost. Officially 31 people died as a direct result of the explosion, but the World Health Organisation estimates that 9,000 died from radiation exposure, while another estimate puts the figure as high as 60,000. It is believed that the area won’t be safe for human habitation for 20,000 years. “They just didn’t want to accept the consequence of that reality,” Harris says. “In the end, it was the outside press that forced them to accept what happened. That’s shocking.” He believes that, 30 years on, the world is still facing an inability to confront the truth. “There’s a whole load of people that think climate change isn’t real, and in the meantime you’ve got a million young people marching around saying, ‘This is our future – for fuck’s sake take it seriously.’” The week we meet, 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg has addressed EU politicians in Brussels. “It’s awful that it’s being left to the kids to speak up,” he says. “Our generation – we’re not covering ourselves in glory, are we?” Harris now lives in the US, but we meet in a London hotel. As an actor he couldn’t be more different from his father – the notorious Richard Harris. While Richard was famous for his sound and fury, Jared is all about restraint and nuance. When his characters emote, they tend to do so with a barely perceptible twitch, the tiniest change in tone, a flush of the cheeks. He is brilliant at playing men who appear to have it all but are struggling inwardly – often silently. Although he identifies as Irish (through his father, a militant republican) and Welsh (his mother), he is now best known for playing characters defined by their Englishness – cut-glass accents, privileged, painfully restrained. But as a young actor he found it impossible to play these parts. “When I was at Central drama school I was failing so miserably to play British aristocratic parts that the principal took me for a personal session. At one point he had me lying on top of a piano, and there were all these different exercises to try to loosen this block I had in my mind. And he said, ‘Jared, maybe you’re just going to have to resign yourself to not being able to play these parts.’” Why does he think he had that block? “You’re so conscious of class growing up in Britain, and suspicious of that world and not feeling you belong to it.” But wasn’t he surrounded by posh actorly types when he was growing up? “No. My father had a massive mistrust of that world. The closest I would have got to that would have been through Rex.” Harris is referring to the actor Rex Harrison, the second husband of his mother, Elizabeth Rees-Williams. It seems she was just as formidable as his father. After divorcing Harrison, she went on to marry Peter Aitken (whom she refers to as “The Unmentionable”) and then his cousin, the Rev Jonathan Aitken, the former politician who served a prison sentence for perjury. “My mum has got a taste for very powerful men. She went from Dad to Rex Harrison and now she’s married to Jonathan and none of them are shrinking violets, and she holds her own against all of them.” His well-to-do maternal side (his grandfather was the 1st Baron Ogmore) were appalled when they heard Elizabeth wanted to marry his father. “My grandmother ran down the corridor screaming, ‘No no no no!’” It was his father who was known as the hellraiser, but Harris says that sobriquet could just as easily have been applied to his mother. “She was like a rock star. She was as much of that huge high-wattage personality as my father was. She’d had three kids by the time she was 25, and once their marriage broke up she decided she was going to live as wild a life as he did.” He remembers how she would turn up at his boarding school for visiting days, always late, always gorgeous in a giant hat and mini skirt. “The other boys would sit there and say why can’t your mother show up on time because their parents would turn up early and they couldn’t see the latest fashion she was wearing.” Richard Harris was famous for lost weekends – or weeks – when he would go out for a pint of milk and end up bingeing on drink and drugs. In 1978, he gave up drugs after almost dying from a cocaine overdose, and flushed $6,000 worth of the drug down the toilet. Harris says Richard was a great father – loving, caring, sharing. While the hellraiser reputation was deserved, he says it was also used to generate publicity. “He knew it was a story that would run and run, so he fed into it. To his detriment. There were times when he wanted to be taken seriously as an actor, and it was harder to do that if your reputation was as a mad, hard-living, hard-drinking Irishman who doesn’t give a shit about his career. And he really did. He cared about it massively. So did Peter O’Toole, so did all those guys. “There was nothing they cared about more when they were researching a part. They were like monks about it. When they had time off or were on a film set and there were big weeks between what they were doing, they would live crazy lives, but, when it came to the work, they were dedicated to it.” Harris was not close to Rex Harrison, the actor best known for My Fair Lady and Dr Dolittle. “He fell in love with my mother and we were just a package deal that came along with her. He wasn’t demeaning or cruel; he just wasn’t interested in kids. When you interacted with him, you did so as an adult. He wasn’t interested in your world. To give Rex his due, he was one of the finest light comedians ever.” He tells a story about storytelling that sums up the difference between his father and Harrison. “You’d be sitting at a lunch table and Rex would start to tell a story, and suddenly he could have lost the audience because the subject’s moved on, but he wouldn’t move on. He would finish telling his story, and he wouldn’t notice if people were paying attention or not. Whereas my dad would tell a story and notice people paying attention at certain parts, and he’d be like, ‘Oh, you like this part’, so he’d embellish it. I learnt a lot about storytelling from listening to Dad constantly reinventing his stories.” Harris may not have the presence of his father. Nor is he an obvious leading man. He is gap-toothed and speaks with a slight lisp. But there is something extremely attractive about him. He is at ease with himself and has a generous, life-affirming laugh. You sense he knows how to make other people feel good about themselves. It’s not surprising that he has been involved with so many high-profile women over the years – he dated Raquel Welch’s daughter Tahnee for five years, was married to Emilia Fox for four years, and wed his third wife, TV host Allegra Riggio, six years ago. When he falls for somebody, he falls big. Before proposing to Fox, he filled their entire home with flowers. When he and Riggio married, she wore angel wings with her dress. He smiles when I suggest he’s an incurable romantic. “Yes, I think that’s probably true.” He was a quiet child, in awe of the extroverts around him. “I enjoyed those personalities, but I wasn’t one of them. I was very shy when I was growing up.” His parents predicted he would become a lawyer or academic. Harris, aged 57, graduated from university in the US and was 25 by the time he went to drama school in London. As a youngster he was obsessed with the American independent movies of the 70s. He hoped that one day he would be cast in similar films. He did go on to appear in US indy movies such as Mary Harron’s I Shot Andy Warhol (playing Warhol) and The Notorious Betty Paige, but his best work has been done for TV. He says there’s a simple reason for that – it’s where the good work is being done. “I grew up loving movies like Dog Day Afternoon, The Conversation, The French Connection, Coming Home – amazing films, personal stories for the directors, and that has largely disappeared. That level of complexity of storytelling, nuance of character, is available to people in television now largely because the studios and the big feature films have given up on trying to attract adults. They are after a much younger core audience. They’ve surrendered that market to the TV.” What work is he most proud of? “I’d normally say my last job.” You’re not getting away with that, I say – choose between Mad Men and The Crown. “Oh God … that’s really hard … I .., I think that … I’d throw The Terror in there. I thought that was really remarkable … er… erm …” He’s in a torment of indecision. I’m going to have to hurry you, I say. “Erm … probably … I’d take Mad Men. It’s really difficult to answer. I learnt something from Mad Men, whereas I’m less curious about the English thing because you lived it, you grew up with it; it’s not so much of a learning curve. But both are brilliantly well done, and very smart writing. It’s no accident that you’re putting them on the same level.” He wipes his brow. And the work he’s least proud of? He relaxes at the very question that makes many actors tense up. “I pretty much will disavow Lost in Space because for whatever fucking reason they decided to dub half my performance with some other person, and watching it is an abomination. You think how drunk were they when they decided that the audience wouldn’t notice it’s two completely different people even within one line.” I ask him if he’s surprised that success had come relatively late in life. For the first time, he sounds slightly defensive. “Well, I was 28 when I got out of drama school. I started pretty late, so, given that, I’ve not done too badly.” But it feels as if you’re more in demand than you have ever been, I say. He nods, and says that, strangely, he may have been helped by Daniel Day-Lewis quitting the profession. “He was supposed to do the part in Chernobyl. Thank God he retired!” And he starts to list the parts he has played that were turned down by Day-Lewis. “He was offered Moriarty in Sherlock Holmes, too. They said, ‘I hope you won’t be upset.’ I said, ‘No, that’s pretty good company to keep.’ Everything gets offered to him first. Everything! Hehehe!” He laughs, long and warm. “I was really lucky he decided to retire.” • Chernobyl starts on 7 May on Sky Atlantic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
