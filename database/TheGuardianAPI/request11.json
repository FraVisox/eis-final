Will Gardiner, chief executive of Drax Group, said that the growing proportion of power forecast to come from interconnectors – physical links to transfer electricity across borders – would also fail to deliver the aims of the government’s industrial strategy. “The hot topic at the moment is what we do about interconnectors,” said Gardiner, who wants to build a vast new gas power and battery storage plant at the company’s North Yorkshire coal and biomass power station. The government expects imports to supply 22% of electricity by 2025, up from 6% last year. A slew of new electricity links are under construction or planned for the next decade between the UK and France, Belgium, Denmark, Norway and Germany. Three of those recently won contracts in a “capacity market” auction of government subsidies for supplying backup power in the winter of 2021-22. That drove contract prices too low to encourage large new gas plants to be built and saw two of Drax’s new small gas power stations miss out on contracts. Gardiner said the prices were a win for consumers, but added that interconnectors failed on other measures. “Improved security of supply is one of the objectives of the auction, and I don’t think interconnectors do that,” he said. “Will they show up when they’re called? Maybe they will.” While energy debates are currently dominated by cost, Gardiner said ministers’ priorities were likely to swing back to security of supply, driven by events such as the “beast from the east” cold weather, which put pressure on the country’s energy system. Gardiner said that because the UK carbon price was higher than on the continent, more electricity links meant the UK would be importing emissions. Interconnectors would not help the government’s industrial strategy, he said. “Are they supporting things that will bring jobs and technology to the UK that will ultimately be exportable? I don’t think interconnectors meet that test. I think a new gas plant using next-generation battery technology at Drax does.” Drax wants the government to further “derate” interconnectors in the capacity market, which would see them receive lower financial rewards. Gardiner, Drax’s former chief financial officer, took over the reins at the company in January when Dorothy Thompson stepped down after 12 years, having converted half of the plant to burning biomass instead of coal. In an interview with the Guardian, he said it was increasingly clear that electricity supplies globally and in the UK would be decarbonised by wind and solar. Both technologies had cut costs with “breathtaking” speed, he said, adding that the flexibility of biomass made it a natural partner for renewables. However, he ruled out diversifying into large solar and wind projects, saying other firms were better equipped. Gardiner said the UK’s other low-carbon option, nuclear power, was too expensive. “I am not a fan of sweetheart deals, the government sitting down with Hitachi and writing them a cheque. That’s not good economics,” he said, referring to Hitachi’s chairman meeting with Theresa May earlier this month to discuss a financial support package to build a new nuclear plant. Drax hopes its gas and battery plant project will get planning permission next autumn. But giving the green light on the investment will hinge on whether the company can secure a capacity market contract in an auction in winter 2019. The firm building a new interconnector through the Channel tunnel rejected Drax’s criticism, noting that countries such as Norway, Denmark and France were largely powered by hydro, wind and nuclear respectively. “We believe the argument that interconnectors import carbon emissions to be unfounded as the majority of interconnectors connect, or will connect, the UK to countries with a lower carbon intensity,” said Steven Moore, chief executive of ElecLink."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2021/mar/04/voting-rights-police-reform-george-floyd-for-the-people-joe-biden-covid-coronavirus-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-03-05T01:35:17Z","webTitle":"Kamala Harris breaks Senate tie to begin Covid relief package debate – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2021/mar/04/voting-rights-police-reform-george-floyd-for-the-people-joe-biden-covid-coronavirus-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2021/mar/04/voting-rights-police-reform-george-floyd-for-the-people-joe-biden-covid-coronavirus-live","fields":{"headline":"Kamala Harris breaks Senate tie to begin Covid relief package debate – as it happened","bodyText":"From Joan E Greve and me: Kamala Harris broke a Senate tie to begin debate on the coronavirus relief package. After the Senate deadlocked on whether to take up the package, the vice-president was forced to cast a tie-breaking 51st vote to approve the motion to proceed. Senate clerks are now reading the full text of the 628-page bill. Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican of Wisconsin, objected to waiving the reading of the 628-page bill in its entirety – in an attempt to delay the process. So, Senate clerks began reading the bill aloud. This will likely take at least a dozen or more hours in total before senators can move to 20 hours of debate on the bill’s content. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said the chamber would stay in session to pass the relief bill, “no matter how long it takes”. The Democratic leader’s comments come as Republicans have planned a series of maneuvers to delay the final vote on the bill, which may not happen until sometime this weekend. The US Capitol police has requested a two-month extension to the national guard’s mission at the Capitol, according to a Democratic lawmaker. The guard’s mission, which was launched in response to the 6 January insurrection at the Capitol, had been scheduled to end on March 12. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, downplayed the security threats at the Capitol. House leaders altered the voting schedule for the week after the US Capitol police warned of a militia’s potential plot to storm the Capitol today, but Pelosi said the schedule was changed mostly to accommodate Republicans, who were attending their issues conference today. The White House defended Joe Biden accusing Republican governors of “Neanderthal thinking” after they rescinded mask mandates. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said the president’s comments were “a reflection of his frustration and exasperation” about the governors ignoring public health guidance on limiting the spread of coronavirus. A Turkish court trying 26 Saudi nationals in absentia for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi has refused to admit as evidence a recent US intelligence report implicating the kingdom’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, despite a petition from the journalist’s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz. The declassified US report released last Friday said Washington believed that Prince Mohammed approved the operation to “capture or kill” Khashoggi. In the third session of the Istanbul trial on Thursday, Cengiz’s petition to add the report to the evidence case file was rejected on the grounds that it would “bring nothing” to the trial. The judge allowed her to file a new request with prosecutors leading the Turkish government’s case instead. Khashoggi went into self-imposed exile in 2017, moving to the US and becoming a columnist for the Washington Post. While visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018 to pick up paperwork for his marriage to Cengiz, a Turkish national, he was sedated, killed and dismembered by a 15-strong team of Saudi agents. His remains have never been found. After a series of shifting explanations, Riyadh eventually admitted the 59-year-old had been killed in a “rogue operation”, but it has strenuously denied that the heir to the throne was involved. Turkish prosecutors claim the Saudi deputy intelligence chief Ahmed al-Assiri and the royal court’s media chief Saud al-Qahtani masterminded the mission.

The daily doses administered topped 2m on Wednesday – and the US has now well surpassed Joe Biden’s goal of distributing at least 1.5m doses a day. The Times reports: Biden has also promised to administer 100 million vaccines by his 100th day in office, which is April 30. As of Thursday, 54 million people have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s one-shot vaccine was authorized for emergency use on Saturday, but those doses do not appear yet in the C.D.C. data. The milestone was yet another sign of momentum in the nation’s effort to vaccinate every willing adult, even as state and city governments face several challenges, from current supply to logistics to hesitancy, of getting all of those doses into people’s arms. Opinion: The George Floyd Act wouldn’t have saved George Floyd’s life. That says it all Guardian columnist Derecka Purnell writes: On Wednesday night, the House of Representatives voted to pass the George Floyd Act, named after the Black man killed by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin last summer. Among many reforms, the act seeks to ban racial profiling, overhaul qualified immunity for police, and ban the use of chokeholds. While these seem like good measures, they are woefully insufficient to stop police violence. These reforms could not have even saved George Floyd’s life. To be clear, Floyd did not die from a chokehold. A police officer put his knee to Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. A medical examiner’s autopsy reported “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression”. Floyd also had blunt force trauma to his head, face and shoulders. Banning chokeholds is important, as we should reduce the number of tactics that the police can employ to be dangerous. However, the problem with policing is precisely that – they can kill people using a diverse number of tactics. Shooting, kneeling, punching, suffocating, Tasing. Congress banned one practice, and not even the one responsible for the homicide. Floyd was also probably not racially profiled. He did not have to be if he was breaking the law. Reportedly, Floyd tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner store. The clerk called the police because using counterfeit money is illegal. The definition of racial profiling is when police uses someone’s race to suspect that they have committed a crime. Here, Floyd’s act may have constituted a crime and the police showed up to fix it. What’s more criminal than counterfeit cash is the society where people live off of these transactions in corner stores in the first place. The police cannot solve this problem. They can show up and attempt to stop the crime, but they can’t stop the underlying conditions that give rise to it: class exploitation and poverty. Floyd appeared to need cash, not the police. Congress has had several opportunities to give people what they actually need under the pandemic: money. George Floyd had tested positive for Covid-19 in April. By the time of his death, lawmakers had only distributed $1,200 to the public, and not everyone received this stimulus check. I wonder if Floyd would have used a counterfeit $20 if Congress would have issued $2,000 a month to the public as several activists and progressive legislators have been demanding. George Floyd’s blood is on their hands. But instead, Congress does what it always does when the police kill people: give cops more money. Read more: The Senate is now debating the coronavirus relief package Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican of Wisconsin, objected to waiving the reading of the 628-page bill in its entirety – in an attempt to delay the process. So, Senate clerks are now reading the bill aloud. This will likely take at least a dozen or more hours in total. Once the reading is finished, senators will have 20 hours to debate it. Lawmakers have just 10 days to pass the package before millions of Americans will lose their unemployment. An effort to restrict voting is under way across America, but there are few places where that assault is more clear, and more urgent, than in Georgia. I know we’ve talked about Georgia before, but this week, I want to dig in to exactly what Georgia lawmakers are proposing to make it harder to vote right now and why it matters. On Monday, the Georgia house of representatives approved a bill, HB531, that would implement sweeping changes to the state’s voting system. Among other measures, the bill would: Require voters to provide identification information both with their absentee ballot application and the ballot itself. Limit election officials to offer just two days of early voting on the weekends, one of which is required to be a Saturday. Restrict early voting from 9am. to 5pm, with an option for election officials to extend hours from 7am to 7pm. Give voters less time to request an absentee ballot. Shorten the period for a runoff election from nine weeks to four. In the state senate, there are also proposals to get rid of the state’s policy of automatically registering voters and to only allow voters to cast a ballot by mail if they are 65 or older or have a valid excuse. That would eliminate the so-called no-excuse absentee voting system Georgia Republicans – yes Georgia Republicans – enacted in 2005. While proposals in states across the country are deeply alarming, the efforts in Georgia matter significantly for a few reasons: They come after an election in which there was record turnout in the state, including surges among Black and other minority voters, which helped power Democrats to stunning upsets. Georgia officials, including top Republicans, loudly dismissed allegations of fraud and there were statewide recounts and audits to back them up. They evoke Georgia’s well-documented and ugly history of passing laws designed to make it harder for Black people to vote Read more: Alabama’s governor Kay Ivey has extended the state’s mask mandate, in a sharp break from fellow Republican governors. While Texas and Mississippi have lifted mask mandates - going against the advice of the CDC and top health advisors – Ivey has taken a different approach. “We need to get past Easter and hopefully allow more Alabamians to get their first shot before we take a step some other states have taken to remove the mask order altogether and lift other restrictions. Folks, we are not there yet, but goodness knows we’re getting closer,” Ivey said. The mandate is likely to expire for good on 9 April, she said. “Even when we lift the mask order, I will continue to wear my mask while I’m around others and strongly urge my fellow citizens to use common sense and do the same,” Ivey added. That’s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Kamala Harris broke a Senate tie to begin debate on the coronavirus relief package. After the Senate deadlocked on whether to take up the package, the vice-president was forced to cast a tie-breaking 51st vote to approve the motion to proceed.

Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Richard Luscombe reports for the Guardian from Miami: Florida governor Ron DeSantis, an ally of the former president Donald Trump, has bristled previously when questioned over the allegations of favoritism in the state’s vaccine distribution, and establishing pop-up vaccination sites in wealthy zip codes. At a press conference last month he threatened to take away vaccines from seniors. “If Manatee County does not like us doing this we are totally fine with putting this in counties that want it,” he said. “If you want us to send to Sarasota next time, or Charlotte, or Pasco, let us know. We are happy to do it.” On Thursday, DeSantis denied having anything to do with the decision to direct hundreds of vaccines to Ocean Reef. “That was one of the South Florida hospital systems [that] went to this community of seniors. I think they did a good job of doing that. We just weren’t involved with it in any way, shape, or form,” he said at a press briefing in Crystal River. “I’m not worried about your income bracket, I’m worried about your age bracket.” DeSantis’s denials, however, have failed to quell growing disquiet in Florida over his actions. Nikki Fried, the state’s agriculture commissioner and the only Democrat in the governor’s cabinet, on Thursday called for the FBI to investigate. “I will not stand by and let our vaccines be used as a political game and go to the highest bidders while so many of our Floridians are suffering, like my grandmother, like my mother, like your parents and grandparents,” she told journalists on Thursday morning. Richard Luscombe reports for the Guardian from Miami: Florida’s governor Ron DeSantis could face a federal inquiry into whether he diverted Covid-19 vaccines to wealthy supporters in return for campaign donations. Gary Farmer, the leading Democrat in the Florida senate, wrote on Thursday to the acting US attorney general Monty Wilkinson, asking him to look into the “troubling” reports. “Over the course of the past few months there have been several well documented reports of exclusive vaccination sites that limited access to paying members of private clubs and residents of affluent gated communities,” Farmer wrote. “In a number of cases the establishment of these vaccine sites have been preceded with or followed by substantial contributions to a political committee controlled by governor Ron DeSantis.” The latest claim, Farmer noted, came from a Miami Herald report on Wednesday asserting that more than 1,200 residents, aged 65 or older, of the exclusive Ocean Reef Club, a private gated community on Key Largo, had been vaccinated by mid-January. At the time, the Herald said, the rest of the state was still struggling to secure an allocation. Only a month before, state records show, 17 Ocean Reef residents donated at least $5,000 to a political action committee supporting DeSantis’s 2022 re-election campaign. And one, the former Illinois governor Bruce Rauner, cut a $250,000 check to DeSantis’s PAC in February after the vaccines were administered. The newspaper further claimed that DeSantis has been using the state’s vaccine initiative to “steer pop-up vaccination sites to select communities,” often affluent, disproportionately white areas. “Governor DeSantis’s clear vaccine priority for wealthy individuals appears to be intimately tied to political payments, an extremely troubling ‘pay to play’ scheme if the allegations are borne out,” Farmer wrote. He asked Wilkinson’s office to “conduct a full and thorough investigation into any potential wrong-doing on the part of Governor DeSantis.” Congressman Peter DeFazio, the Democratic chairman of the House committee on transportation and infrastructure, said his meeting with Joe Biden “went very well”. The president and the vice-president, along with transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, met with a bipartisan group of House members this afternoon to discuss a potential infrastructure package. “I was encouraged,” DeFazio told reporters after the meeting ended. “He’s very, very set on getting it done and getting it done pretty damn soon.” The congressman said he expected a standalone infrastructure bill to be introduced in May, although it’s still unclear whether such a bill could make it through the evenly divided Senate. DeFazio added that it was “refreshing” to talk to Biden, rather than Donald Trump, about infrastructure proposals. “The difference between talking to Joe Biden about infrastructure and what goes into it and how we’re going to get it done and Donald Trump is like, it’s just a whole different world,” DeFazio said. “It’s way better.” A second Senate clerk has now taken over the reading of the coronavirus relief bill, after the first clerk read the first 15 pages of the legislation. The reading of the full text is expected to take several hours, so multiple clerks will take turns reading the bill aloud. Earlier today, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer expressed gratitude for the work of the Senate clerks, while criticizing Republican Ron Johnson for forcing the reading of the full text. “We all know this will merely delay the inevitable,” Schumer said of the reading of the bill. “It will accomplish little more than a few sore throats for the Senate clerks who work very hard day in day out to help the Senate function.” The Democratic leader added, “We are delighted that the senator from Wisconsin wants to give the American people another opportunity to hear what’s in the American Rescue Plan. We Democrats want America to hear what’s in the plan.” After the Senate clerks finish reading the full text of the coronavirus relief bill, the chamber will move on to a “vote-a-rama” for the package. During the vote-a-rama, senators can introduce amendments to the legislation. Republicans have already said they intend to introduce many amendments, which will delay the final vote on the package. Earlier today, Senator Bernie Sanders said he would also introduce an amendment to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Speaking on the Senate floor this afternoon, Sanders described the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour as a “starvation wage”. The House’s version of the coronavirus relief bill, which the chamber passed over the weekend, included the $15 minimum wage provision, but the Senate took it out after the parliamentarian ruled the proposal did not meet the requirements for passage via reconciliation. Right on cue: Republican Senator Ron Johnson has objected to the measure to dispense with the reading of the full text of the coronavirus relief bill. Senate clerks will now have to read every word of the 628-page bill. The process is expected to take around 10 hours. Senate Democrats have criticized Johnson for forcing the reading of the bill, saying he is simply delaying the inevitable passage of the bill. Johnson said earlier today that he believed the reading was necessary to ensure Americans understood what was in the $1.9 trillion package. “I feel bad for the clerks who are going to have to read it, but it’s just important,” Johnson said. “So often, we rush these massive bills that are hundreds if not thousands of pages long. You don’t have, nobody has time to read them. So, you start considering something you haven’t even read. At a minimum, somebody ought to read it, and this will give everybody time.” The Senate has approved the motion to begin debate on the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. Vice-President Kamala Harris was forced to cast the tie-breaking 51st vote on the measure, after the evenly divided Senate deadlocked 50-50 on whether to take up the bill. Republican Senator Ron Johnson has signaled he will now ask the Senate clerks to read the full text of the bill, which could take around 10 hours. After the bill is read, the Senate can begin the “vote-a-rama” on amendments to the package. Republicans are expected to introduce many amendments to delay a final vote on the bill. Republican Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski have both voted “no” on taking up the coronavirus relief bill. The two centrist Republicans could theoretically still join Democrats in supporting the final passage of the relief package. But their early opposition to the bill provides further evidence that the $1.9 trillion package will likely pass in a party-line vote, which would force Vice-President Kamala Harris to cast a tie-breaking vote. Joe Biden is currently having a meeting with a bipartisan group of House members to discuss a possible infrastructure package. Vice-President Kamala Harris and transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg are also attending the meeting. “What we’re going to do to make sure we once again lead the world across the board on infrastructure,” Biden told reporters as the meeting started. While reporters were being escorted out of the Oval Office, one of them asked Biden whether he was comfortable with limiting the eligibility for direct payments in the coronavirus relief package. “Yes,” Biden replied. The Senate is now voting on whether to begin debate on the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill. The measure needs a simple majority to pass, and it is expected to be approved in a party-line vote. Once the chamber votes to take up the bill, Republican Senator Ron Johnson is expected to ask Senate clerks to read the full text of the bill aloud, which could take around 10 hours. The Senate will then proceed to a “vote-a-rama,” during which senators can introduce amendments to the bill. Republicans are expected to introduce many amendments, most of which will fail, in order to delay the final vote on the package. Here’s where the day stands so far: The US Capitol Police has requested a two-month extension to the National Guard’s mission at the Capitol, according to a Democratic lawmaker. The guard’s mission, which was launched in response to the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, had been scheduled to end on March 12. The White House defended Joe Biden accusing Republican governors of “Neanderthal thinking” after they rescinded mask mandates. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the president’s comments were “a reflection of his frustration and exasperation” about the governors ignoring public health guidance on limiting the spread of coronavirus. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said the chamber would stay in session to pass the coronavirus relief bill, “no matter how long it takes”. The Democratic leader’s comments come as Republicans have planned a series of maneuvers to delay the final vote on the bill, which likely won’t happen until sometime this weekend. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Guardian’s Daniel Strauss reports: Former president Donald Trump has released a wide ranging statement criticizing opponents within the Republican party, as well as The Wall Street Journal editorial page. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell and Georgia governor Brian Kemp were among Trump’s targets. Trump’s screed may have been prompted by a recent Journal editorial questioning Trump’s usefulness to the Republican party after his 2020 election loss. The Journal published an editorial titled “The Grievances of Trump Past” which criticized the former president’s speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) over the weekend. “Fortunately, nobody cares much about The Wall Street Journal editorial anymore,” Trump said in the statement, apparently unaware of the irony. Trump often criticizes the Journal for being out of touch with the Republican Party, McConnell for being out of step and ungrateful for Trump’s leadership, and Kemp for how the Georgia governor ran the state during the 2020 presidential elections. White House press secretary Jen Psaki was just asked whether Joe Biden should set an example to Americans and stop traveling to Delaware. “The president lives in Wilmington. It’s his home,” she replied. The CDC currently recommends that Americans avoid travel due to the Covid-19 pandemic. White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s comments that Joe Biden is “importing” coronavirus into the US by releasing migrants after they have been processed by border officials. “We’re about facts around here. It is not factual to say that,” Psaki replied. Abbott’s comments came after the president accused the Republican governor of “Neanderthal thinking” over his decision to rescind the statewide mask mandate in Texas. Psaki also noted that Texas is supposed to be testing migrants for Covid-19. White House press secretary Jen Psaki defended Senate Democrats’ decision to limit eligibility for the direct payments in the coronavirus relief package. Psaki noted that 98% of Americans who received stimulus payments in December will also receive them from this relief package. The press secretary also emphasized that these payments of $1,400 are much larger than the $600 payments that Congress approved in December. White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked whether the Trump administration deserves more credit for developing a playbook to distribute coronavirus vaccines. “I don’t think anybody deserves credit when half a million people in this country have died of this pandemic,” Psaki replied. Joe Biden has similarly criticized Donald Trump’s handling of vaccine distribution, claiming his administration was left “a mess” in terms of vaccination planning. White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked whether it was productive for Joe Biden to compare Republican governors to Neanderthals over their decisions to rescind mask mandates. Psaki replied by emphasizing that the president was comparing the governors’ actions to “the behavior of a Neanderthal, just to be very clear, the behavior”. Psaki said Biden’s comments were “a reflection of his frustration and exasperation” about the governors ignoring public health guidance on limiting the spread of coronavirus. “It’s imperative that people listen across the country, whether they live in a red state or a blue state, to the guidance of public health experts,” Psaki said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki has taken over the briefing, and she opened her comments by drawing attention to the latest weekly unemployment numbers from the department of labor. Psaki noted that initial jobless claims exceeded the pre-pandemic high for the 50th week in a row. “We can’t get numb to what this represents,” Psaki said, adding that the numbers represent hundreds of thousands of Americans who are financially struggling amid the pandemic. The press secretary argued that the latest numbers once again underscore the urgent need for Congress to pass Joe Biden’s coronavirus relief bill. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough said the department has been pleasantly surprised that vaccine hesitancy has been less than initially expected among VA patients. “The big challenge for us is supply,” McDonough said of the vaccine distribution process. The cabinet secretary applauded VA facilities for ensuring that vaccine allotments get in arms within two to three days of delivery. McDonough once again emphasized that passage of the coronavirus relief bill would help ensure VA facilities have the resources needed to get vaccines distributed to veterans. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough noted that more than 19 million appointments at VA facilities have been canceled since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. McDonough said that delayed care indicates VA facilities will need to spend more money later on to attend to patients who would have otherwise sought medical help earlier. The $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package will help VA sites address the expected increase in need as the pandemic comes to a close, McDonough said. “We urge the Senate to pass the much-needed plan as soon as possible,” McDonough said. Joe Biden’s press secretary, Jen Psaki, is now holding her daily briefing with reporters at the White House. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough opened the briefing by discussing the need for Congress to pass Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill. McDonough argued that the package was vital to ensuring veterans have access to coronavirus vaccines and other medical services amid the pandemic. The Senate is expected to pass the relief package this weekend, and it will then be sent back to the House for final passage. Republican Senator Ron Johnson defended his plan to force Senate clerks to read the full text of the $1.9trn coronavirus relief bill aloud, which is expected to take about 10 hours. Johnson, a Republican of Wisconsin, said the move was meant to return the Senate to being a “more deliberative body” before authorizing such a a massive bill. “I feel bad for the clerks who are going to have to read it, but it’s just important,” Johnson said. “So often, we rush these massive bills that are hundreds if not thousands of pages long. You don’t have, nobody has time to read them. So, you start considering something you haven’t even read. At a minimum, somebody ought to read it, and this will give everybody time.” Senate Democrats have criticized Johnson’s maneuver as a useless tactic to delay the final vote on the package. Moments ago, majority leader Chuck Schumer said Johnson was attempting to “merely delay the inevitable”. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer pledged that the chamber would stay in session to pass Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill this weekend, “no matter how long it takes”. The Democratic leader’s comments come as Senate Republicans plot ways to delay the final vote on passage of the relief bill. Republican Senator Ron Johnson has already said that he intends to force Senate clerks to read the full text of the bill aloud, which is expected to eat up about 10 hours of floor time. “We all know this will merely delay the inevitable,” Schumer said of Johnson’s strategy. “It will accomplish little more than a few sore throats for the Senate clerks who work very hard day in day out to help the Senate function.” Schumer added with a note of sarcasm, “We are delighted that the senator from Wisconsin wants to give the American people another opportunity to hear what’s in the American Rescue Plan. We Democrats want America to hear what’s in the plan.” Republicans are expected to introduce many amendments during the “vote-a-rama” on the relief bill, meaning a final vote will likely not occur until sometime this weekend. The Biden administration intends to transform some of the migrant detention centers in Texas into rapid-processing sites to allow families to be released into the US within 72 hours, according to the Washington Post. The Post reports: [DHS draft] plans show the Biden administration is racing to absorb a growing number of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border amid shortages of bed space and personnel. Republicans and some Democrats fear that relaxing detention policies will exacerbate a surge that is already straining the Biden administration. Transforming family detention amounts to a wholesale repudiation not only of Donald Trump administration policies but also those of former president Barack Obama, and presents a significantly different vision of how to handle the fast-changing character of mass migration at the southern border. The change will likely be sharply criticized on the right, given that Republicans have already attack Joe Biden’s immigration policies as too lenient. However, immigration activists will likely celebrate the news, after many of them criticized the Biden administration for reopening a migrant detention center for minors that had been used during Trump’s presidency. Nearly 90% of the people charged in the Capitol riot so far have no connection with militias or other organized extremist groups, according to a new analysis that adds to the understanding of what some experts have dubbed the “mass radicalization” of Donald Trump’s supporters. A report from George Washington University’s Center on Extremism has analyzed court records about cases that have been made public. It found that more than half of people facing federal charges over the 6 January attack appear to have planned their participation alone, not even coordinating with family members or close friends. Only 33 of the 257 alleged participants appear to have been part of existing “militant networks”, including the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers anti-government militia. The dominance of these “individual believers” among the alleged attackers underscored the importance of understanding the Capitol violence as part of a “diverse and fractured domestic extremist threat”, and highlighted the ongoing risk of lone actor terror attacks, the George Washington researchers concluded. Other analysts have argued the Capitol attackers should be understood as “not merely a mix of rightwing organizations, but as a broader mass movement with violence at its core”. At her weekly press conference moments ago, House speaker Nancy Pelosi said the National Guard troops should remain at the Capitol for “as long as they are needed”. But the Democratic speaker emphasized that she would leave decisions about National Guard troop deployments up to security officials at the Capitol. If the National Guard grants the US Capitol Police’s request to extend the mission by two months, Guard troops will be at the Capitol until at least mid-May. The US Capitol Police has asked the National Guard to extend its mission at the Capitol by two months, according to Democratic congresswoman Elissa Slotkin. The mission, which was launched in response to the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, is currently set to end on March 12. According to Slotkin, the National Guard is asking states to send troop contributions to Washington to continue the mission at the Capitol. Slotkin, a Democrat of Michigan and a former senior Pentagon official, requested an immediate briefing for lawmakers on the extension request. “Whether an extension has been requested or the mission is indeed terminating on March 12, it’s critical that members of Congress get a briefing on what’s behind these decisions,” Slotkin said. “We all have the same goal: to get back to the point where Capitol Police is capable of protecting us without the Guard’s help, and all parties feel confident we can protect the people’s business.” Democrats are determined to proceed with a debate on the Biden administration’s $1.9tn stimulus plan as Capitol Hill braced for a potential security threat on Thursday nearly two months after the deadly January 6 insurrection. The House adjusted its schedule to finish voting on Wednesday night, after Capitol police warned of a “possible plot to breach the Capitol by an unidentified militia group.” The threat of danger, Capitol police said, relates to an online QAnon conspiracy theory that falsely claims Donald Trump would return to power on March 4 – the day new presidents were sworn in prior to 1937. “We take these things very seriously,” said Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat of Michigan. “We are working closely with law enforcement and certainly will personally be taking extra precautions as we move into the Capitol today. But we’ve got to get this package because people are counting on us. And so we’ll do it in the safest way possible.” But Senate Democrats are under pressure to pass the massive stimulus package before crucial benefits expire at the end of next week. Republicans are expected to drag out the debate by requiring the clerk to read the entire 500+ page legislation in full as well as force votes on dozens of amendments. “We’re going to just keep drinking coffee and getting this thing done because this is about ... helping people get their lives back,” Stabenow said. “And we are committed, along with the president to do that, no matter how many hours it takes to get that done.” Asked if adjourning early sent the wrong message, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the chamber was already planning to end their legislative day early on Thursday to allow Republicans to attend their policy retreat. She noted that there were four times as member House members and that the fewer people in the Capitol, the easier it is to secure the building. House speaker Nancy Pelosi downplayed potential security threats at the Capitol, after the US Capitol Police warned of a militia’s potential plot to storm the building today. Asked whether House leaders changed the voting schedule for this week due to security concerns, the Democratic speaker said the change was approved “mostly” because Republicans needed to attend their issues conference today. “If in fact there are any troublemakers around, it made sense,” Pelosi said of the schedule change. Pelosi emphasized she did not want to get distracted by the “silliness” of a far-right conspiracy theory that claims Donald Trump will be inaugurated as president today. (Trump obviously lost the presidential election, and Joe Biden was rightly inaugurated as president on January 20.) Addressing how long National Guard troops will be protecting the Capitol, Pelosi said, “We should have them here as long as they are needed.” House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she is optimistic about the chances of the Senate passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The police reform bill passed the House last night, in a nearly party-line vote of 220 to 212. The Democratic speaker said progressive congresswoman Karen Bass will be negotiating with the Senate to help advance the legislation. Unless Senate Democrats eliminate the filibuster, they will need to win over 10 of their Republican colleagues in order to get the bill passed. House speaker Nancy Pelosi is now holding her weekly press conference on Capitol Hill. The Democratic speaker celebrated the House’s passage of the For the People Act, describing the election reform bill as a “giant step for democracy”. Pelosi said the legislation, which faces a difficult road to passage in the Senate, would help ensure that “big, dark, special interest money” do not flood the airwaves to impede progress. An earlier coronavirus relief package passed in the final weeks of Donald Trump’s presidency included $600 payments to individuals. After calling for $2,000 relief checks, Joe Biden then introduced a plan that would deliver $1,400 direct payments to millions of Americans, with aides arguing that the two checks amount to the promised $2,000. The changes introduced on Wednesday to appease moderate Democrats scale back the eligibility for the payments. Under the new structure, the individuals earning up to $75,000 per year and couples earning up to $150,000 per year would still qualify for the full $1,400 stimulus payment. But under the new structure, the checks would phase out at a lower income level than they would in Biden’s initial proposal, and in the version of the bill passed by the House. Under the House plan, the payments would phase out entirely for individuals making $100,000 per year and couples earning $200,000 per year. The Senate version will now cut off the benefit for individuals making $80,000 per year and couples earning $160,000 per year. Senator Ron Wyden, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said the changes to the payments would save $12bn in the overall stimulus bill. An estimated 12 million fewer adults would receive stimulus payments under the compromise plan, according to an early analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Democratic senators defended changes narrowing the eligibility for a new round of $1,400 stimulus payments, arguing that conservative proposals would have resulted in far steeper cuts to the stimulus checks. On a call with reporters Thursday, hours before the Senate was expected to begin debate on Joe Biden’s $1.9tn coronavirus relief bill. Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia, whose special election victory alongside Georgia Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock delivered Democrats control of the Senate, said they fought successfully to “hold the line” against deeper cuts to the payments. Asked if the changes amounted to a broken promise to Georgia voters, Ossoff insisted it did not. Taken together with the earned income tax credit and child tax credit provisions of the stimulus bill, “the direct economic relief for working families in Georgia will be even more generous than I had believed was possible during the campaign.” “This is why it’s so vital that we hold the line where there are GOP efforts to gut the direct payments,” Ossoff said. “This is what Georgians sent us to Washington to fight for, and this is what we’re going to deliver.” “Elections have consequences – and we are now in a position to deliver this aid,” he added. The Wall Street Journal has new details on the air strikes that took place in Syria last week, which were approved by Joe Biden in his first military action as president. According to the Journal, US forces were originally supposed to hit two targets, but Biden scrapped one of the targets at the last minute: After 10 days of deliberations, President Biden had ordered the Pentagon to conduct airstrikes on two targets inside Syria Feb. 26 when an aide delivered an urgent warning about 30 minutes before the bombs were scheduled to fall. A woman and a couple of children were in the courtyard at one of the sites, according to battlefield reconnaissance. With the F-15Es in flight to the targets, Mr. Biden scratched the second target but ordered the strike on the first objective to proceed. The previously undisclosed episode involving Mr. Biden’s first known use of force as commander in chief was an unexpected coda to a methodical decision-making approach in which the Biden administration sought to balance competing interests in the Middle East tinderbox. The airstrikes, which targeted Iranian-backed fighters in Syria, hit three trucks loaded with munitions and left 22 people dead. All of the dead were affiliated with Iraq’s state-sponsored Hashd al-Shaabi, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat of Oregon, said phasing out the direct payments in the relief bill at a faster rate will save $12bn. That is a small fraction of the overall cost of the relief package, which is $1.9tn. Reports emerged yesterday that Senate Democrats, at the urging of moderates like Joe Manchin, were considering phasing out the checks completely for individuals who make $80,000 a year. The first two rounds of stimulus payments were phased out completely for individuals making $100,000 a year. The impact of that change is that fewer Americans will receive direct payments from the relief bill that Joe Biden will sign, versus the two relief bills that Donald Trump signed. However, $1,400 is the largest of the three stimulus payments so far. Last night, the House also passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in a nearly party-line vote of 220 to 212. Like the For the People Act, the police reform bill faces a very uphill climb in the Senate, unless Democrats eliminate the filibuster. As Politico notes, the Justice in Policing Act, which the House initially passed last year in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd, has a lot of grassroots momentum. That momentum may indicate that Democrats will soon come under renewed pressure from progressives and activists to eliminate the Senate filibuster: Even as Democrats control all of Washington for the first time in a decade, a series of priorities that are hugely important to their liberal base — and to making good on President Joe Biden’s campaign promises — have begun piling up in the Senate. That backlog will grow over the next two weeks as Speaker Nancy Pelosi tees up votes on bills to expand voting rights, enact universal background checks for gun purchases and protect so-called Dreamers. The prospect of those historic measures sliding into Senate stasis after House passage is infuriating to progressives — particularly on issues like the party’s signature policing bill, which has overwhelming grassroots energy behind it. But with the upper chamber’s legislative filibuster remaining intact, Democrats have no way to get much of their agenda to Biden’s desk without winning at least 10 GOP votes while keeping their 50-member caucus united. That political reality in the Senate is likely to spur negotiations with the GOP about concessions that would be tough to stomach for many progressive Democrats, including longtime civil rights advocates who invested significant energy in the House’s policing bill. And as a result, pressure is sure to mount on Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to nuke the filibuster once and for all. Joe Biden released a statement this morning celebrating the passage of the For the People Act, Democrats’ election reform bill that they have been trying to enact for years. “In the wake of an unprecedented assault on our democracy; a coordinated attempt to ignore, undermine, and undo the will of the American people never before seen in our history; and a new wave of aggressive attacks on voting rights taking place in states across the country, I applaud Speaker Pelosi and the House of Representatives for passing H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2021,” Biden said. “I look forward to working with Congress to refine and advance this important bill. And I look forward to signing it into law after it has passed through the legislative process, so that together we can strengthen and restore American democracy for the next election and all those to come.” The bill passed the House last night in a vote of 220-210, but it faces long odds in the evenly divided Senate. Unless Senate Democrats eliminate the filibuster, they would need 10 of their Republican colleagues to support the bill in order to get it passed. This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Belam. The Senate is expected to start work on the $1.9tn coronavirus relief package later today, kicking off a days-long process to get the bill passed. Republican Senator Ron Johnson has said he plans to force Senate clerks to read the bill in its entirety, which will take about 10 hours. After the bill has been read, the Senate will begin its “vote-a-rama” on amendments for the bill, and Republicans plan to introduce many amendments to force Democrats to take uncomfortable votes on controversial issues. The vote-a-rama could potentially extend into the weekend, but once it’s done, the Senate will vote on final passage of the bill. Assuming it passes, the bill will then go back to the House, so the lower chamber can pass the final version of the package. With all that in mind, it seems likely that Joe Biden will be able to sign the bill sometime next week. The president has said he wants the bill on his desk by March 14, when extended unemployment benefits are currently set to expire. The blog will be covering all of the latest updates on the Senate vote, so stay tuned. As part of its clean-energy agenda, the Biden administration is reviving an energy department program that disbursed billions of dollars in loan guarantees to companies such as electric car maker Tesla and the failed solar company Solyndra, the energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, says. The loan program helped launch the country’s first utility-scale wind and solar farms as part of the Obama administration’s efforts to create “green jobs” but largely went dormant under Donald Trump. The program boosted Tesla’s efforts to become a behemoth in electric cars, but it stumbled with a major loan guarantee to Solyndra, the California solar company that failed soon after receiving federal money a decade ago, costing taxpayers more than $500m. Republicans and other critics cite Solyndra as an example of wasteful spending under Barack Obama’s stimulus program, and the loan guarantees have largely dried up in recent years. The energy department provided $12bn in guarantees for the Vogtle nuclear power station in Georgia, but few other loans were offered under Trump. When running for office, Joe Biden put forth a $2tn plan to eliminate all greenhouse gas emissions from the US electricity grid within 15 years, a goal that was applauded by climate campaigners but was criticized for the enormous overhaul it will require. The restart of the energy department’s loan program – which was once a major tool the federal government had to incentivize clean energy innovation – gives the Biden administration a chance to redeem it after Solyndra’s fall. Granholm said up to $40bn in guarantees will be made available for a variety of clean-energy projects, including wind, solar and hydro power, advanced vehicles, geothermal and even nuclear. “It’s got to be clean. That’s it,” she said. “And when I say clean, you know, it’s technologies that are being researched in the lab,” like projects to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions, so-called green hydrogen fuel and other energy sources, she said. Read more here: Biden’s energy department revives loan program to boost clean technology Why are Federal forces on high alert in the Capitol today? Well, 4 March is a date that conspiracy theorists have cited as when former president Donald Trump will be swept back into power. The significance of the date is that for the first 140 years of the US, that was the date (or near enough) when presidents were inaugurated. Geneva Sands and Zachary Cohen report for CNN that: US Capitol Police acting chief Yogananda Pittman told Congress earlier Wednesday that her department had “concerning intelligence” regarding the next few days in Congress -- but said it wouldn’t be “prudent” of her to share the “law-enforcement sensitive” intelligence in a public hearing or public format. Pittman assured lawmakers, though, that her department is in an “enhanced” security posture and that the National Guard and Capitol Police have been briefed on what to expect in the coming days. In a clear sign federal agencies are working to avoid the same communication failures for which they have been roundly criticized since the Capitol attack, DHS officials are stressing that law enforcement should not view intelligence solely through the lens of whether a threat qualifies as “credible and specific,” but use the warnings coming from DHS, FBI and other partner agencies to inform decisions about their security posture, even if the information provided falls short of pointing to an imminent attack or violence, the sources said. Violent extremists also discussed plans to persuade thousands to travel to Washington, DC, to participate in the March 4 plot, according to the joint intelligence bulletin. One source noted to CNN that it is mostly online talk and not necessarily an indication anyone is coming to Washington to act on it. The House moved its business forward a day so as to avoid being in session today. it is thought that the Senate will assemble as planned, with Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill on the agenda. Read more here: CNN – Feds on high alert Thursday after warnings about potential threats to US Capitol Winter storms, which crippled power sources throughout the US south, brought record low temperatures to parts of Mississippi. In Jackson, where 80% of residents are Black, the cold led to at least 96 breakages in the city’s ageing pipes, which, combined with power outages, lead to catastrophically low pressure throughout its water system. As of Monday evening 35 breakages remained, and although pressure was slowly coming back, thousands of residents are without water. Most of them in the city’s south, which sits on higher ground and is furthest away from the treatment plant. A citywide boil notice remains in effect and officials have offered no timeline for full restoration. Jackson’s mayor, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, has said the city requires $2bn to revitalize its ailing piping and treatment system. He compared the city’s pipes to peanut brittle, explaining that as repair crews move in to fix the pipes, one repair can lead to another breakage. Mississippi, American’s poorest state, has long faced chronic infrastructure problems. A 2020 report card published by the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the state a D+ grade, noting decaying systems across roads, energy, solid waste and a host of other essential services. On its drinking water systems, the report noted some were losing as much as 50% of treated water due to breakages and that certain systems were still dependent on pipes laid in the 1920s. “Many of these networks have aged past their useful life span,” the report notes. But at a press conference on Monday, Mayor Lumumba made clear that the changing climate was exacerbating the issue. “One thing that is clear is that our winters are colder, our summers are hotter and the rain we experience is more abundant,” he said, pointing out that the city’s outdoor water treatment facility was simply not built to endure the cold. “And so not only do we need this investment because of the ageing infrastructure we need this investment because of the increased pressure that these extreme weather conditions are taking.” Read more of Oliver Laughland’s report from Jackson, Mississippi here: ‘There’s no excuse for this’: thousands in Mississippi city still without water weeks after storms The House Oversight Committee is investigating the agency that operates the Texas power grid, seeking information and documents about the lack of preparation for the recent winter storm that caused millions of power outages and dozens of deaths across the state, report Associated Press. Rep Ro Khanna, a California Democrat who chairs an environment subcommittee, sent a letter to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), saying he is concerned that the loss of electric service “and the resulting human suffering, deaths and economic costs” will happen again unless ERCOT and the state of Texas adequately prepare for a predicted increase in extreme weather events. Severe winter storms in Texas “have occurred repeatedly over decades, and ERCOT has been unprepared for them,” Khanna wrote in a letter to ERCOT CEO Bill Magness. The group’s own consultant has predicted that severe winter weather events will continue to occur every decade, yet ERCOT and state officials have done little to prepare for them or build appropriate infrastructure, Khanna said. Magness was fired Wednesday amid growing calls for his ouster following the deadly storms, but will stay on for two months to “work with state leaders and regulators on potential reforms to ERCOT,” the organization said in a statement. “The failures of ERCOT and the state of Texas were costly,” Khanna wrote. At least 49 Texans have died, and more than 4.5 million people experienced power outages “Homeowners, renters and businesses face steep expenses to fix damage from frozen and burst pipes, with the Texas Insurance Council estimating that claims could be more than $20 billion,” Khanna wrote. Total economic losses in Texas could reach $50 billion. Because Texas is not connected to the national grid, “ERCOT has limited ability to import electricity from outside of the state,” Khanna noted, adding that nearby regions, such as El Paso, experienced the same extreme temperatures but fewer disruptions. A spokeswoman for ERCOT said officials received the letter and will respond to the subcommittee. Some Republicans have sought to falsely blame the power outages on the use of renewable energy, but Texas Gov Greg Abbott, has ultimately blamed the power failures on ERCOT. S three-member utility commission appointed by Abbott has oversight authority over the grid operator. The utility commission’s chair resigned last week, and at least six ERCOT board members have also resigned in the wake of the power failure, one of the largest in U.S. history. Last month’s storm followed similar winter storms in 1989 and 2011 that also caused massive outages, Khanna said. “It appears that lessons learned (again) in 2011 were not implemented either, leaving Texas vulnerable to extreme winter weather again in 2021,” he wrote. The subcommittee requested documents from ERCOT by 17 March 17 related to its preparedness for extreme weather events; decisions on where and when to implement rolling blackouts; and the disruption of electricity supply in the mid-February storm. Elaine Chao, the Republican who served as Secretary of Transportation in the Trump administration from 2017 to 2021, has been criticised in a report by the Transportation Department’s inspector general for repeatedly using her office staff to help family members who run a shipping business with extensive ties to China. Overnight Eric Lipton and Michael Forsythe reported for the New York Times that: The investigation of Chao came after a 2019 report that detailed her interactions with her family while serving as transportation secretary, including a trip she had planned to take to China in 2017 with her father and sister. The inspector general’s report confirmed that the planning for the trip, which was canceled, raised ethics concerns among other government officials. As transportation secretary, Chao was the top Trump administration official overseeing the American shipping industry, which is in steep decline and is being battered by Chinese competitors. “A formal investigation into potential misuses of position was warranted,” Mitch Behm, the Transportation Department’s deputy inspector general, said to House lawmakers on Tuesday in a letter accompanying a 44-page report detailing the investigation into “use of public office for private gain.” The inspector general referred the matter to the Justice Department in December for possible criminal investigation. But in the weeks before the end of Trump administration, two Justice Department divisions declined to do so. Read more here: New York Times – Inspector General’s report cites Elaine Chao for using office to help family A former Maryland police chief is accused of setting fires to multiple structures that belonged to his adversaries, report the Associated Press. Former Laurel Police Chief David Crawford, 69, was arrested Wednesday and is charged with over 50 felonies, including first-degree arson and first-degree attempted murder, in connection to a string of fires from 2011 to 2020 in Howard, Prince George’s, Frederick and Montgomery counties. Twelve fires were set in the nine-year span to multiple homes, vehicles and residential garages, authorities said. Investigators determined the fires were connected to people who had disagreements with Crawford, authorities said. Police said they found a target list of known victims and other evidence during a search of Crawford’s Howard County home in January. Some of the victims include a former City of Laurel official, three former law enforcement officials and two of Crawford’s former physicians. “People who are angry, they do bad things,” said State Fire Marshal Brian Geraci. “Clearly, our suspect, thought he was wronged in a lot of different cases and wronged by a lot of different people, and these are all, you know, spite-revenge fires.” All the fires were set at night. In six of the arsons, the victims were asleep in their homes with their families. Authorities said no one was injured in any of the fires. Crawford served as the Laurel police chief from 2006 until his resignation in 2010. Laurel Mayor Craig Moe, who appointed Crawford, said he was a staple in the community. Moe said some people in the police department were unhappy with Crawford, but that wasn’t unusual for a police chief, the Baltimore Sun reported. “It’s very disturbing,” Moe said. “Somebody who took an oath of office to protect and serve, that’s not how you protect and serve.” The idea of a Universal Basic Income is another one that highlights the sharp partisan divide in American politics. You can already guess who thinks it is giving people something-for-nothing, and who thinks it is potentially a valuable tool in the fight against poverty and social injustice. The Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration sought to test those contesting ideas. And, after receiving $500 per month for two years without rules on how to spend it, it emerges that 125 people in California paid off debt, got full-time jobs and had “statistically significant improvements” in emotional health, according to a study released today. The Associated Press report that the program was the nation’s highest-profile experiment in decades of universal basic income (UBI), and did not use tax dollars, but instead was financed by private donations, including a not-for-profit led by the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. When the program started in February 2019, 28% of the people slated to get the free money had full-time jobs. One year later, 40% of those people had full-time jobs. A control group of people who did not get the money saw a 5 percentage point increase in full-time employment over that same time period, from 32% to 37%. The researchers said that the extra $500 per month was enough for people with part-time jobs to take time off so they could interview for full-time jobs that offered better pay. They also said the money could have helped people who weren’t working at all find jobs by allowing them to pay for transportation to interviews. After a year of getting the money, 62% of the people were paying off debt compared to 52% before the study. Researchers also said most people moved from being likely to have mild mental health disorders to “likely mental wellness”. The money was delivered once a month on a debit card, which let researchers track how most of the people spent it. The biggest category each month was food, followed by sales and merchandise, which included purchases at places like Walmart and Target, which also sell groceries. The next highest categories were utilities, auto and services. Less than 1% of the money went to tobacco and alcohol – commonly cited as a concern. Not everyone was on board with the idea. Aside from conservatives who dislike big government programs, opposition also comes from labor unions that worry about what other types of social safety net programs would have to be sacrificed to pay for a guaranteed income. It could cost nearly $3tn a year to provide a guaranteed income to everyone. “What these experiments don’t tell us is what the impact would be as a result of the tradeoffs that are necessary to implement UBI on a massive scale,” said Steve Smith, the communications director for the California Labor Federation. It seems an unlikely sentence to be writing, but the reason we got a couple of landmark votes in the House yesterday was because they were rushing through business to ensure it wouldn’t be disrupted if there is an attack on the Capitol today. The FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the US Capitol police department have obtained intelligence pointing to a possible plot to “breach the Capitol by an identified militia group” today, the Capitol police said yesterday. From a distance it is hard to judge how credible the threat is, or whether authorities are simply acting out of an abundance of caution after the events of the 6 January. Those events were being discussed yesterday in a hearing before the Senate Rules and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees about the pro-Trump insurrection. Rebecca Kheel and Rebecca Beitsch have pulled out for the Hill what they thought the five key takeaways from the session were. Those included: The National Guard was hamstrung ahead of the attack – DC National Guard commanding general Maj Gen William Walker said there was an “unusual” 5 January memo from then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy restricting his ability to deploy a so-called Quick Reaction Force without McCarthy’s approval. Had it not been for that restriction, Walker said, he “would have sent them there immediately as soon as I hung up” from his call with then-Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund asking for help. Walker told the committees, “It was never really explained to me” why restrictions were placed on him. But he drew a stark contrast between 6 Janusary and the response to racial justice protests over the summer. Asked by Homeland Security committee Chairman, Michigan Democrat Gary Peters, whether he got immediate approval from McCarthy and Miller to deploy guardsmen in June, Walker replied, “Yes.” Pressed by Peters on whether he got immediate approval to deploy 6 January, Walker replied, “No.” Read more here: The Hill – Five takeaways from dramatic Capitol security hearing There was a brief period last night when the House Democrats could claim that their police justice bill had at least some bipartisan support, but not for long. Republican Rep Lance Gooden of Texas later tweeted to clarify that he had pressed the wrong button. “I have arguably the most conservative/America First voting record in Congress! Of course I wouldn’t support the radical left’s, anti-police act.” The official record has now been changed to record his vote as a no. Yesterday the US House of Representatives passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, the most ambitious police reform effort in decades. The legislation changes would ban chokeholds and “qualified immunity” for law enforcement and create national standards for policing in a bid to bolster accountability. California congresswoman Karen Bass, who authored the bill, cited the beating of Rodney King in 1991 and Floyd’s death as the catalyst for the ambitious reform while House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said the bill was “legislation which will fundamentally transform the culture”. The leader of the Democrats in the House, Steny Hoyer, said “I hope this bill is enacted to help save lives and restore trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.” It will face significant opposition in the Senate. Hi, and welcome to our live coverage of Thursday’s US politics. Here’s a run down of the main stories at the moment, and what is in the diary for today… Yesterday House Democrats passed a sweeping expansion of federal voting rights. The For The People act would be the most significant enhancement of federal voting protections in decades. They also passed the ambitious George Floyd Justice in Policing Act which would ban chokeholds and qualified immunity for law enforcement. The US Capitol Police warned yesterday that it has “obtained intelligence that shows a possible plot to breach the Capitol by an identified militia group” today. The House has cleared its voting schedule as a result. Joe Biden sharply criticized Republican governors for “Neanderthal thinking” as Texas and Mississippi rescinded their mask mandates despite public health experts’ concerns about another potential surge in coronavirus cases. “I think it’s a big mistake,” the president said. Andrew Cuomo said he would not resign after three women accused him of sexual harassment. The New York governor offered qualified apologies for his behavior and said he would “fully cooperate” with the state attorney general’s investigation of the allegations. The commanding general of the DC national guard told the Senate that the Pentagon curtailed his ability to rapidly deploy guard troops the day before the 6 January insurrection. President Joe Biden, vice president Kamala Harris and transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg will meet with a bipartisan group of House Members on infrastructure at 2pm ET (1900 GMT). Biden will also hold a call to congratulate Nasa on the successful landing of the Perseverance rover on Mars. Jen Psaki will give a press briefing at 12.45."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2019/feb/19/bernie-sanders-2020-donald-trump-latest-news-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-20T01:11:38Z","webTitle":"Trump-Russia: FBI had 'backup plan' to save investigation evidence –as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/feb/19/bernie-sanders-2020-donald-trump-latest-news-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2019/feb/19/bernie-sanders-2020-donald-trump-latest-news-live","fields":{"headline":"Trump-Russia: FBI had 'backup plan' to save investigation evidence –as it happened","bodyText":"Thanks for sticking with us, everyone. See you tomorrow! The Trump administration announced that it intends to pull funding for California’s high-speed rail project, one week after Governor Gavin Newsom tussled with the president on Twitter and one day after California led a coalition of 16 states in a lawsuit against the administration over the president’s decision to declare a national emergency for border wall funding. Attorneys for Nick Sandmann, the Kentucky student filmed in an apparent confrontation with a Native American elder at the Lincoln Memorial, filed a defamation lawsuit against the Washington Post, accusing the news organization of engaging “in a modern-day form of McCarthyism.”. CNN hired longtime Republican operative Sarah Isgur as the political editor charged with coordinating 2020 campaign coverage. Isgur once retweeted someone calling her new employer the “Clinton News Network.” One week after President Trump called California’s high-speed rail project a “‘green’ disaster”, the US Department of Transportation announced plans to cancel $929m in federal grant funds yet to be paid toward the $77bn endeavor. The department also “it is actively exploring every legal option to seek the return from California of $2.5bn in federal funds FRA (Federal Railroad Administration) previously granted,” according to the statement released Tuesday. The Federal Railroad Administration determined that the California High-Speed Rail Authority, the state-run organization tasked with overseeing the project “has materially failed to comply with the terms” of the agreement that promised $929m in federal funds for construction, wrote Federal Railroad Administrator Ronald Batory, in a letter to the Brian Kelly, the California High-Speed Rail Authority’s chief executive. The Authority “has failed to make reasonable progress, Batory wrote, and will not complete the project by the end of 2022, as was previously agreed upon, Batory wrote. In addition, Batory cited Governor Gavin Newsom’s recent remarks during his state of the state address, saying that Newsom “had “presented a new proposal that represents a significant retreat from the state’s initial vision and commitment and frustrates the purpose for which federal funding was awarded. Newsom had said that “the project, as currently planned, would cost too much and take too long”. Opponents of the ambitious project interpreted his comments as a declaration that “the train to nowhere has finally stopped” and that Newsom was canceling the leg of the plan that extended the railway from San Francisco to Los Angeles. But Newsom’s office later clarified that he meant only that “we have to be realistic about the project”. In response to his remarks, Trump sent out a tweet asking for the return of “three and a half billion dollars”. Newsom responded by tweeting that the money was “allocated by Congress for this project. We’re not giving it back.” “The train is leaving the station — better get on board!” the governor wrote. The transportation department’s announcement came one day after California led a coalition of 16 states to sue the Trump administration over the president’s decision to declare a national emergency for border wall funding. Attorneys for the Kentucky student filmed in an apparent confrontation with a Native American elder at the Lincoln Memorial filed a lawsuit against the Washington Post on Tuesday, accusing the news organization of engaging “in a modern-day form of McCarthyism.” CNN hired longtime Republican operative Sarah Isgur as the political editor charged with coordinating 2020 campaign coverage, Vox is reporting. According to a CNN spokesperson, Isgur, who most recently worked as the Department of Justice’s main spokesperson under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, will coordinate the network’s political coverage for the 2020 election cycle on TV and on CNN’s website. Isgur starts work next month, and will not be involved in coverage of DOJ. She will occasionally appear on TV. Isgur’s LinkedIn page indicates she has no journalism experience. She has, however, worked for a variety of right-wing organizations and campaigns, including the Carly Fiorina and Mitt Romney presidential bids, the Republican National Committee, and a Ted Cruz US Senate campaign. Coming as it does in the wake of a presidential cycle in which the mainstream media’s fixation on Hillary Clinton’s emails (among other issues) was widely criticized, news of Isgur’s hiring sparked concerns about the direction CNN is taking heading into 2020. News of her hiring comes on the heels of mass layoffs throughout the media industry that has some wondering why CNN couldn’t have hired someone with at least some journalism experience. Now that things have quieted down a bit, here’s a look at some of our coverage from earlier. Hey everybody, Vivian Ho on the west coast here, taking over for Sabrina Siddiqui. Let’s see what the rest of the day has in store for us, shall we? Ok folks, I’m handing over the blog to my ever capable colleague, Vivian Ho, who will take you through key moments for the remainder of the day. But first, a recap of what all has happened so far: Bernie Sanders officially launched his second presidential campaign, joining a crowded field of 2020 contenders. But while the Vermont senator inspired a grassroots movement in 2016, can he recapture the excitement with several other progressives in the race? The president reportedly asked acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker to install a loyalist at the helm of a federal investigation into hush money paid to women alleging affairs with Trump. If true, it would be yet another example of Trump seeking to influence the FBI and Justice Department and interfering with inquiries involving himself. House Democrats are investigating whether the White House pursued a project to share nuclear technology information with Saudi Arabia. Trunp’s close ties to the Saudis have already been a subject of controversy following the Kingdom’s hand in executing journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The FBI reportedly had a backup plan to protect evidence in the Russia investigation after Trump fired its director, James Comey. Michael Bennet, a senator from Colorado, is heading to the early battleground of Iowa as he tests the waters for a 2020 presidential campaign. That’s it from me, Sabrina Siddiqui, until next time.

According to a report in the New York Daily News, health inspections at Trump-owned properties in Manhattan have turned up live mice and roaches. The worst offenses appeared to be at the president’s eponymous tower in the city: City Department of Health inspectors visited the tower’s cafe and grill on July 11, 2018 and found ‘evidence of mice or live mice’ in and around the kitchen, according to records that haven’t previously been reported. The inspectors categorized the violation as ‘critical.’ The inspectors also deemed the restaurant ‘not vermin proof’ and said its ‘conditions’ are ‘conducive to attracting vermin’ and ‘allowing vermin to exist.’ Hold on, it gets worse. The report found that the Trump Tower restaurant has been cited for various health code violations every year since 2014, “including sightings of ‘live roaches’ in 2016 and ‘filth flies’ in 2017”. A Trump Organization official told the newspaper that the infractions would be dealt with “immediately”. If you have the stomach for it, read more here. Bernie Sanders has hired Faiz Shakir, a longtime Democratic Party operative, as his 2020 campaign manager. Shakir most recently served as the political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which has led many of the legal challenges against Donald Trump’s administration on civil rights and other constitutional issues. His previous stints include serving as an aide to former Senate majority leader Harry Reid and then-House minority leader Nancy Pelosi. Shakir’s experience spans Capitol Hill and progressive think tanks in Washington. He also informally worked on Sanders’ 2016 run. Activist Linda Sarsour, a Sanders surrogate in 2016, celebrated Shakir’s appointment as the first time a Muslim American has been put in charge of a major US presidential campaign. Good grief. While defending a Republican state legislator facing allegations of sexual assault, the Tennessee House speaker, Glen Casada, said the women who came forward should simply leave after being ostracized in their community. “If it’s important, and it is — it’d be important to me if I was raped, I would move,” Casada said. “And hell would have no fury.” Casada was confronted in a video, published on a liberal website, about his support for David Byrd, a state representative in Tennessee who has been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple former students. Three women came forward to allege that Byrd sexually assaulted them the 1980s, when they were teenagers playing on the high school basketball team he coached at the time. Despite calls for Byrd to resign, Casada appointed him to chair the state House’s education committee. Asked if he believed Byrd’s accusers, Casada said: “I don’t think they’re lying. I think they’re believing something that’s not true.” Trump had this to say at the White House when asked about Bernie Sanders making a second run for the presidency: “Personally, I think he missed his time,” Trump said. “But I like Bernie.” “He is one person that – on trade, he sort of would agree on trade. The problem is he doesn’t know what to do about it.” Trump went on to say Sanders was “not treated with respect” by Hillary Clinton while insisting he would prevail in his own bid to be re-elected to the White House. “I wish Bernie well, it will be interesting to see how he does,” Trump said. “I think what happened to Bernie Sanders four years ago was quite sad.” Update to the NYT report mentioned further down below: Donald Trump has denied making any requests of acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker with respect to a federal investigation into hush money payments to silence women. “No, not at all, I don’t know who gave you that. Just more fake news,” the president told reporters at the White House. “There’s a lot of fake news out there. No I didn’t.” Trump added that Whitaker was a “straight shooter” and praised his testimony on Capitol Hill from two weeks ago. “He’s a very fine man and he should be given a lot of thanks by our nation.” Trump also commented on his upcoming summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The president said while denuclearization remains the overall goal, he was confident at the pace of talks. “I’m in no rush,” Trump said. “I have no pressing time schedule. I really believe that North Korea can be a tremendous economic power when this is solved.” Trump did add, however, that if Pyongyang resumed nuclear testing, his calculus might change. Speaking of investigations, it appears the FBI had a backup plan to ensure the protection of evidence collected in the Trump-Russia inquiry. The Associated Press reports that the plan was created after the firing of then FBI director James Comey, who was overseeing the investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow: The plan was crafted in the chaotic days after Comey was fired, when the FBI began investigating whether President Donald Trump had obstructed justice and whether he might be, wittingly or not, in league with the Russians. The goal was to ensure that the information collected under the investigations, which included probes of Trump associates and possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, would survive the firings or reassignments of top law enforcement officials. Those officials included special counsel Robert Mueller, who was appointed eight days after Trump fired Comey in May 2017. Andrew McCabe, who became acting director after Comey was fired, asked investigators to develop a plan to ensure evidence would be protected, said the person, who was not authorized to talk about those discussions publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity to the Associated Press. A plan was then created, according to the person, who would not provide specifics. A second person familiar with the talks, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, also said the FBI discussed preserving evidence so that it would outlast any firing or effort to stymie the investigation. As I mentioned earlier, McCabe is currently causing quite the stir with revelations from his new book, The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump. Quite the literal book title, it seems! This one is quite the doozy from the New York Times: As federal prosecutors in Manhattan gathered evidence late last year about President Trump’s role in silencing women with hush payments during the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump called Matthew G. Whitaker, his newly installed attorney general, with a question. He asked whether Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York and a Trump ally, could be put in charge of the widening investigation, according to several American officials with direct knowledge of the call. Mr. Whitaker, who had privately told associates that part of his role at the Justice Department was to “jump on a grenade” for the president, knew he could not put Mr. Berman in charge, since Mr. Berman had already recused himself from the investigation. The president soon soured on Mr. Whitaker, as he often does with his aides, and complained about his inability to pull levers at the Justice Department that could make the president’s many legal problems go away. Allow me to refresh your memory... At least two women were paid six figures in hush money in 2016 to prevent them from speaking about their alleged affairs with Trump: one was adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who was paid $130,000 by Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen in exchange for her silence; the other was former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who received $150,000 from the National Enquirer, the tabloid owned by a close friend of Trump’s, for exclusive rights to her story that was then never published in a practice known as ‘catch-and-kill’. These payments are under investigation by prosecutors in the southern district of New York, which is also examining what Trump knew about them. Cohen, who struck a plea deal with federal investigators, has already said Trump knew about both payments. After firing attorney general Jeff Sessions in November, Trump installed Justice Department official Matthew Whitaker as the acting AG -- bypassing the chain of command and inviting questions over the legality of Whitaker’s appointment. Whitaker had previously been critical of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia and is widely regarded as a loyalist. This latest report now essentially suggests that Trump directly asked Whitaker to put another loyalist in charge of an investigation into the president himself. (It appears Whitaker declined to do so.) This is also notable because earlier this month, Whitaker testified before Congress and said, under oath, that he never discussed the Russia investigation with the president. He noticeably would not say if he had discussed the inquiry being led by the SDNY: The hush money payments are, of course, a separate investigation from Mueller’s -- but there is some overlap in the key players, and that Trump was trying to get Whitaker to make moves in his favor doesn’t exactly give credence to the notion that he avoided bringing up the Russia inquiry with the acting AG. You get all that? Donald Trump’s administration has launched a global campaign aimed at ending the criminalization of homosexuality, according to a new report. From NBC News: U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, the highest-profile openly gay person in the Trump administration, is leading the effort, which kicks off Tuesday evening in Berlin. The U.S. embassy is flying in LGBT activists from across Europe for a strategy dinner to plan to push for decriminalization in places that still outlaw homosexuality — mostly concentrated in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean. Although the decriminalization strategy is still being hashed out, officials say it’s likely to include working with global organizations like the United Nations, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as other countries whose laws already allow for gay rights. Other U.S. embassies and diplomatic posts throughout Europe, including the U.S. Mission to the E.U., are involved, as is the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Narrowly focused on criminalization, rather than broader LGBT issues like same-sex marriage, the campaign was conceived partly in response to the recent reported execution by hanging of a young gay man in Iran, the Trump administration’s top geopolitical foe. The move to focus the conversation on Iran could, however, cast a spotlight on other nations with which the Trump administration shares close ties, such as Saudi Arabia. The Saudi kingdom is among those to find homosexuality punishable by death; but Trump has continued to defend Riyadh amid human rights abuses that include the execution of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October. The Trump administration has also been criticized at home for rescinding protections enacted by Barack Obama that sought to weed out discrimination against the LGBTQ community. The president undid an Obama-era rule that had enforced workplace protections for LGBTQ people and banned transgender people from serving in the military. Some more on the donations pouring into Bernie Sanders 2020 via our stellar political correspondent, Lauren Gambino: In the first four hours after Bernie Sanders launched his campaign, he raised $1.2 million from 42,000 donors w/ sign ups and donations from all 50 states, according to a spokeswoman for his campaign. Senator Kamala Harris raises $1.5 from roughly 38,000 donors in the first 24-hours of her campaign, which was close to the amount Sanders raised in the first day of his 2016 presidential campaign. Sanders appears outpace to outraise Harris, which would be unsurprising given his sky-high name recognition and small-dollar fundraising prowess. His haul will be watched closes as a sign of whether his grassroots appeal is still strong. Small-dollar donations have become a litmus test of enthusiasm around a candidate, especially in such a crowded primary field in which voters have at least a dozen Democrats to support. Do you think there are enough Democrats already running for president? Well, too bad! Michael Bennet, a senator from Colorado, is heading to Iowa this week as he weighs whether or not to declare his candidacy for the White House. Iowa, as you might recall, is the first-in-the-nation caucus state and seen as a definitive test in the road to the nomination. Although not a household name, Bennet will likely try to appeal as a consensus-driven lawmaker who for 10 years has represented the purple state of Colorado. He was a co-sponsor of a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013 that would have granted a pathway to citizenship to the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US. The legislation died in the Republican-led House of Representatives after overwhelmingly passing the Senate. Not one to typically make headlines, Bennet’s recent speech during the 35-day government shutdown went viral for its emotional unpacking of Republican obstructionism and tirade against Donald Trump and the border wall. You can revisit the 25-minute speech here: Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, has said reports that the White House planned to share nuclear technology information with Saudi Arabia renewed questions over on whose behalf the Trump administration is working. “For the last two years, our committee has been concerned about allegations that the president and his advisers have been beholden to or sought to advance interests other than those of the American people, and that U.S. policy is being adversely impacted,” Schiff said in a statement, while adding the issues raised by the Saudi report “go to the heart of these concerns”. “We rely on those in government to make decisions based on the best interests of the nation, not for personal financial gain or to advance foreign interests,” Schiff added. “If the allegations are borne out, such an effort to enrich former business partners and benefit foreign governments is precisely the type of dangerous conflict of interest, serious compromise, and danger to national security that Congress has a duty to expose and root out.” Trump has claimed he has “no financial interests” in Saudi Arabia. But that is not supported by the facts, and as a candidate in 2016 Trump instead boasted of his business dealings with the Saudis. In 2001, the Saudi government purchased the entire 45th floor of the Trump World Tower in New York City for $4.5m and has since paid roughly $5.7m in fees over time. And in 1991, Alwaleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, bought a yacht repossessed by Trump for $20m. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, shares a close rapport with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman, and has sought to strength the alliance between Washington and Riyadh. Democrats on the House oversight committee are calling for a ‘full investigation’ of whether the White House pursued a nuclear technology project with Saudi Arabia: Representative Elijah Cummings, the oversight committee chairman, has just issued a statement that whistleblowers tipped lawmakers off to the proposed venture: The whistleblowers who came forward have expressed significant concerns about the potential procedural and legal violations connected with rushing through a plan to transfer nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia. They have warned of conflicts of interest among top White House advisers that could implicate federal criminal statutes. They have also warned about a working environment inside the White House marked by chaos, dysfunction, and backbiting. And they have warned about political appointees ignoring directives from top ethics advisors at the White House who repeatedly and unsuccessfully ordered senior Trump Administration officials to halt their efforts. The Committee’s investigation is particularly critical because the Administration’s efforts to transfer sensitive U.S. nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia appear to be ongoing. On February 12, 2019, the President met with nuclear power developers at the White House about sharing nuclear technology with countries in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia.” Cummings also noted that the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, is poised to embark on a tour of Middle Eastern capitals, including Riyadh, next week “to discuss the economic portion of the Administration’s Middle East peace plan”. JUST IN: House Democrats have launched an inquiry into an alleged push by Donald Trump’s administration to share nuclear power technology with Saudi Arabia. The latest via the Associated Press: A new congressional report says senior White House officials pushed a project to share nuclear power technology with Saudi Arabia despite the objections of ethics and national security officials. The Democrat-led House oversight committee launched an investigation Tuesday into the claims. The committee says whistleblowers within the Trump administration raised concerns about “abnormal acts” within the White House to support the proposal to build dozens of nuclear reactors across the Middle Eastern kingdom. The investigation comes as lawmakers from both parties have raised concerns that Saudi Arabia could develop nuclear weapons if the US technology is transferred without proper safeguards. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. More than six in 10 Americans disapprove of Donald Trump’s decision to declare a national emergency at the US-Mexico border, according to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released on Tuesday. Nearly 60% of respondents also said they did not believe there was an emergency at the southern border and backed a legal challenge against Trump’s move. The president issued a national emergency declaration last Thursday after threatening to do so for months amid an impasse over funding for the US government. Trump made his plans official as members of Congress reached a bipartisan deal to avert another government shutdown that did not include funding for his promised border wall. The action immediately drew backlash as a misuse of presidential powers, with even many Republicans on Capitol Hill criticizing Trump’s step. Democrats meanwhile vowed to challenge Trump in the courts, while also stating they would bring up a resolution for a vote that would terminate the national emergency. “All things related to the declaring of a national emergency, the president is striking out in the court of public opinion,” said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, one of the poll’s conductors. “He’s maintaining his base and little else.” Well, it certainly looks like there are lots of Americans out there who are still feeling the Bern ... So Donald Trump is suggesting the Washington Post factchecker only applies to Democrats ... or something. I think the president is trying to say the only people who get factchecked are him and Republicans, except he kind of also said they’re the ones with the ‘fake’ facts. As we are all well aware, Trump isn’t exactly the most eloquent or even coherent with his words ... In any case, the source of his ire is likely this latest update via the Washington Post factchecker: “In 759 days, President Trump has made 8,718 false or misleading claims.” But who’s keeping track really? Nothing gets in RBG’s way ... not even cancer! As Bernie Sanders makes his 2020 presidential bid official, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is meanwhile cautioning voters about the “radical left”. Schultz, who is contemplating an independent run for president in 2020, penned a Medium post on Tuesday reiterating his assertion that the Democratic party was becoming too liberal for its own good. “The stakes are too high to cross our fingers and hope the Democratic party nominates a moderate who can win over enough independents and disaffected Republicans, and even fellow Democrats, to defeat Trump next year,” Schultz wrote. “That any opponent can oust Trump, no matter how far to the radical left they are, is a fallacy.” Schultz has been criticized by Democrats for refusing to compete for the party’s nomination and engage in a direct debate over centrist versus progressive ideas. Democrats have expressed concern that the Starbucks CEO would simply act as a spoiler by taking votes away from the eventual nominee as the party seeks to limit Trump’s presidency to one term. Schultz acknowledged those fears in his post but insisted they were unfounded. “I hear and respect this overriding concern, and have repeatedly promised that I will not be a spoiler,” he said. “I am committed to ensuring that I will do nothing to re-elect Donald Trump. I mean it.” To say that early polling has not shown Schultz faring particularly well would be an understatement ... but the billionaire has continued to soak up media attention and make headlines. We interrupt the Bernie Sanders programming for some news via Andrew McCabe, the former acting attorney general ... In an interview with NBC’s Today Show on Tuesday, McCabe said he briefed a bipartisan group of lawmakers in May of 2017 on an investigation the FBI was launching into Donald Trump’s ties to Russia. “The purpose of the briefing was to let our congressional leadership know exactly what we had been doing,” McCabe said. “I told Congress what we had done ... no one objected. Not on legal grounds, not on constitutional grounds and not based on the facts.” McCabe has set off a firestorm while promoting his new book, The Threat, which recounts remarkable anecdotes from the former acting FBI director’s interactions with Trump and is inner circle. In the book, McCabe details discussions around invoking the 25th amendment – to remove the president from office – and even says deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein spoke with him about wearing a wire to secretly record Trump. Those revelations have invited an avalanche of criticism from the president and Republicans in Congress, who have claimed bias within the FBI and justice department against Trump. The president tweeted “Treason!” on Monday night while quoting from his friend and close ally Sean Hannity on Fox News. Asked by NBC host Savannah Guthrie if he was biased against the president, McCabe replied: “Absolutely not.” “I did my job. I worked on the facts and the law that were in front of us at the time,” he said, while also dismissing Trump’s attacks. “I don’t think really anybody takes those tweets by the president very seriously. I certainly don’t at this point,” McCabe said. “He’s been attacking me and my family and lying about us for two years now so it’s just really more of the same.” Watch McCabe’s interview here. The Republican National Committee also trotted out the “socialist” line against Bernie Sanders, moments after he launched his second bid for president. “Bernie Sanders is a self-avowed socialist who wants to double your taxes so the government can take over your health care,” RNC spokesman Michael Ahrens said in a statement. “The vast majority of voters oppose his radical agenda, just like they are going to oppose all the 2020 Democrats who have rushed to embrace it.” As mentioned earlier, Americans are not as averse to so-called “socialism” as Republicans might think. Be it single-payer healthcare or a wealth tax, polling shows such proposals are popular with the public. It is, however, true that most 2020 Democratic hopefuls have taken their cues from the movement Sanders launched in 2016. Several of his Senate colleagues, who are also running for president, have embraced the Medicare for All healthcare bill drafted by Sanders, including Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker. A number of Democratic contenders have also called for some variation of debt-free college tuition. But while Sanders can take some credit for pushing the Democratic Party more to the left, he also won’t be able to draw as sharp a contrast as he did nearly four years ago with Hillary Clinton. That is, unless the party gravitates toward a more centrist candidate such as Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, who said far-reaching progressive plans such as Medicare for All and the Green New Deal were “aspirations”. Former vice-president Joe Biden is also expected to make a decision on a possible presidential run soon, and will almost certainly pitch a more establishment-friendly vision. I wrote more on the internal debate within the Democratic party, and whether there’s room for centrists, here. Need to reacquaint yourself with Bernie? We’ve got you covered. Here’s our video explaining how Sanders rose up in his political career and where he stands on the key issues: If anything, he gets points for consistency. You can watch the Bernie Sanders 2020 announcement video here: “Our campaign is not only about defeating Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history,” Sanders says in the video. Our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice. “Our campaign is about taking on the special interests that dominate our economic and political life. I’m talking about Wall Street, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military industrial complex, the private prison industry, and the large multinational corporations that exert such an enormous influence over our lives. In other words, Sanders will build upon many of the same themes that formed the pillars of his insurgent campaign in 2016. Here’s a breakdown via FiveThirtyEight on what his path to the Democratic nomination would look like. The reactions to Sanders’ announcement are already pouring in ... Donald Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign responded with the familiar “socialist” attack that Republicans used against Sanders in 2016. “Bernie Sanders has already won the debate in the Democrat primary, because every candidate is embracing his brand of socialism,” Trump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement. “But the American people will reject an agenda of sky-high tax rates, government-run health care and coddling dictators like those in Venezuela. Only President Trump will keep America free, prosperous and safe.” In his State of the Union address earlier this month, Trump also sought to portray Democrats as socialists over economic policies that include single-payer healthcare, a guaranteed jobs program and debt-free college tuition. Those policies actually poll well with the American public. The real issue for Sanders is how he will fare in a Democratic field that has already been shaped in his mold. At least one progressive group that endorsed Sanders for president in 2016, Democracy for America, suggested the senator would have more work to do to distinguish himself in this race. “Blessed with a diverse field of candidates committed to inclusive populist reforms, we’re looking forward to seeing how Sanders and the movement behind him makes the case for ‘political revolution’ in a very different 2020 contest,” the group’s executive director, Yvette Simpson, said. “To win in 2020, Democrats need a leader committed to a visionary, progressive agenda who can win the enthusiastic support of the New American Majority of people of color and progressive white voters.” “With Sanders joining Warren, Harris, Gillibrand and a number of others, we’re more confident than ever that Democrats will find the candidate we need to defeat Trump and start delivering the kind of economic, social and racial justice needed to improve real people’s lives.” He’s back. Bernie Sanders announced on Tuesday he will run for president in 2020. In an email to supporters, the Vermont senator said it was time to see through the progressive movement he energized in 2016. “Together, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution,” Sanders said. “Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for.” Whereas Sanders challenged establishment favorite Hillary Clinton for the Democratic party’s nomination nearly four years ago, this time he joins a crowded and diverse 2020 field with no clear frontrunner. Others vying to claim the top of the Democratic ticket include Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. There are also a slew of lower-profile contenders, including the former San Antonio mayor and federal housing secretary Julián Castro, Pete Buttigieg, the young mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard. Read our full report on Sanders’ announcement here and watch this space for more. Good morning! It’s Sabrina Siddiqui, your blogger for the day, taking you through the late developments in Washington. We’re already off with a bang, as Bernie Sanders has declared he will once again seek the presidency. The Vermont senator proved unsuccessful in challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic party’s nomination in 2016, but will his fortunes change this go around? We’ll break down the reaction to Sanders’ announcement, what else is new with the emerging 2020 field, and of course the latest from the White House.

Today seven of our correspondents report on how Brexit upheaval has affected Britain’s image on the continent. Back home, official figures confirm the UK has suffered its worst year for GDP growth since 2012 – debunking the chancellor’s claim that Britain can reap an economic dividend if MPs vote for Theresa May’s Brexit deal. The economy grew by just 0.2% in the final three months of 2018, down from 0.6% in the third quarter. For 2018 as a whole, GDP growth slipped to its lowest since 2012, at 1.4%, down from 1.8% in 2017. As the Brexit deadline nears, car makers are stockpiling parts, banks have moved employees to Ireland and continental Europe, and Panasonic and Sony have moved their EU headquarters to mainland Europe. May hopes to convince the House of Commons today to give her another fortnight’s grace to keep pushing for changes to the Irish backstop – despite the insistence of Michel Barnier that it is Britain that must compromise. In Spain, farmers of polytunnel-grown strawberries are worried that Brexit will spoil access to the British market, which takes 15% of their fruit. * * * Trump and Beto hold duelling rallies – While party leaders worked last night to reach an in-principle deal on averting another damaging US government shutdown, Donald Trump held a pep rally for himself in El Paso. The president insisted a border wall had made the Texan city safer (local politicians disagree) and boasted that despite the shutdown being staved off, “just so you know, we’re building the wall anyway”. Beto O’Rourke addressed a counter-rally in El Paso before Trump spoke.

It stems from the unilateral referendum on independence that was held in autumn 2017 by the Catalan regional government, in defiance of Spain’s national government and the courts. Spain’s ambassador to London, Carlos Bastarreche, has said in a rare public intervention that the trial is not political and the proceedings are of “paramount importance to Spain’s reputation as a modern democracy”. The Catalan government has embarked on a vigorous diplomatic and PR campaign to portray the proceedings as a show trial. Nine of those on trial are accused of rebellion while those on the most serious charges could face up to 25 years in jail. * * * Tehran vs Trump in war of words – Iran and the United States have hurled epithets at each other on the 40th anniversary of the Islamic republic. Cries of “Death to America” rang out in Tehran while President Hassan Rouhani called Donald Trump an “idiot” and defied calls for a fresh agreement to curb Iran’s missile programme: “We have not, and will not, request permission from anyone for increasing our defensive power and for building all kinds of … missiles.” Trump tweeted that Iran could only mark “40 years of failure … The long-suffering Iranian people deserve a much brighter future.” The Israeli PM reacted to an Iranian Revolutionary Guard threat to “raze” Israeli cities if the US attacked Iran. “It would mean that they had celebrated their last Revolution Day,” said Benjamin Netanyahu. “They would do well to take that into account.” * * * Vane power – A windfarm off the Yorkshire coast that will eventually be the world’s largest is to supply its first power to the UK electricity grid this week. Hornsea One is planned to cover 407 sq km, five times the size of the nearby city of Hull, with 174 turbines providing 1.2GW of capacity – enough to power a million homes. It is due to be completed in the second half of this year by Danish developer Ørsted. About half of the components for the project are made in the UK, in places like Hull, Teeside and Campbeltown in the Scottish highlands. The UK has enough wind and shallow enough seabeds to “power most of Europe”, says Henrik Poulsen, Ørsted CEO. On a lesser scale, new windfarms could make up for cancelled UK nuclear power stations. * * * Something to process – More than half the UK diet is ultra-processed food that, according to researchers, is linked to risk of premature death. A study followed 44,000 people for seven years, monitoring how much of their diet came from foods made in factories with industrial ingredients and additives, such as dried ready meals, cakes and biscuits. Those who died by the end of the study were likely to have eaten a greater amount of ultra-processed food, the researchers found. Commenting on the study, Nita Forouhi, a professor of epidemiology at Cambridge, said such foods tended to be eaten disproportionately by poorer people: “They tend to be cheaper, are highly palatable due to high sugar, salt and saturated fat content, are widely available, highly marketed, ready to eat, and their use-by dates are lengthy, so they last longer. More needs to be done to address these inequalities.” Today in Focus podcast: My week at Guantánamo Bay The Guardian’s Julian Borger recently attended the 33rd pre-trial hearing of five 9/11 suspects.

Lunchtime read: Climate change and the collapse of everything Human-caused threats to climate, nature and economy pose a danger of systemic collapse comparable to the 2008 financial crisis, according to a new report that calls for urgent and radical reform to protect political and social systems. While many studies of environmental risk have examined threats in isolation – to the weather, to ecosystems, to the economy – the new paper, This is a Crisis: Facing up to the Age of Environmental Breakdown, assesses how the interplay of these factors can create a cascade of tipping points in human society as well as the natural world. The meta-study compiled by the IPPR thinktank shows that since 2005, the number of floods has increased by a factor of 15, extreme temperature events by a factor of 20, and wildfires sevenfold; topsoil is now being lost 10 to 40 times faster than it is being replenished by natural processes; the 20 warmest years since records began in 1850 have been in the past 22 years; vertebrate populations have fallen by an average of 60% since the 1970s; and insect numbers – vital for pollination – have declined even faster in some countries. Wider discussion is the first step, according to lead author Laurie Laybourn-Langton, who said he was shocked by the paucity of public debate relative to the scale of the problems: “It is the sort of thing mentioned at the end of a conversation, that makes everyone look at the floor, but we don’t have time for that now,” he said.

Tricastin, one of France’s biggest nuclear power stations, was closed by the French regulator in September so that works could be undertaken to address a flood risk. The plant’s reactors make up four of 19 currently offline in the French nuclear power industry, which experienced even worse outages last winter due to regulatory safety checks. The operators of Britain’s eight remaining coal power stations appear to have stepped in to exploit higher French prices, exporting power across the channel as temperatures have plunged. UK coal power generation has declined rapidly in recent years under the carbon tax. Most of the time, France sends electricity to the UK through 43-mile-long cables between Folkestone and a site near Calais, but in November there have been more hours when power has flowed in the other direction. On Friday, power through the interconnector was almost entirely flowing at maximum capacity towards France. “We are now exporting to France through the interconnector which is unusual. Normally we are a net importer from France but yet again towards the end of the year we are exporting,” said Andrew Crossland, who runs MyGridGB, a site that monitors power generation data. “Essentially this means that France is importing higher carbon electricity than it can produce at home,” he added. Data compiled by Crossland shows coal power has continued to decline in the UK this year after dramatically falling two-thirds in 2016. There have been 583 coal-free hours in 2017 to date – compared with 210 last year – with coal providing just 6.7% of electricity supply so far. Analysis by Iain Staffell, lecturer in sustainable energy at Imperial College and author of the Electric Insights report, came to a similar conclusion. “In short, coal usage has shot up in the last two weeks, both because we are now exporting to France and because demand is growing as it gets colder. We are still using less coal than we did this time last year though,” he said. Uniper, the German energy company that runs Ratcliffe coal power station in Nottinghamshire, said the higher usage was a response to the situation in France and colder temperatures. “Over the past few weeks, the French power market has seen relatively higher power prices compared to Britain. One of the impacts of this is that flows on the Britain-France interconnector have seen more of a flow to France than to Britain,” the company said in a statement. British coal power station owners may also be responding to one of Britain’s biggest nuclear reactors, Sizewell B, being offline for servicing until mid-December. The UK has pledged to phase out the country’s remaining coal power stations by 2025. This week it led the launch of an alliance of 19 nations, including New Zealand and Mexico, committed to quitting coal as quickly as possible. •Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here. • This article was amended on 19 November to correct the number of French reactors offline."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/mar/11/japan-naoto-kan-nuclear-power-unsafe-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-11T16:25:19Z","webTitle":"Ex-Japan PM: nuclear power remains unsafe and too costly","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/japan-naoto-kan-nuclear-power-unsafe-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/mar/11/japan-naoto-kan-nuclear-power-unsafe-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"Ex-Japan PM: nuclear power remains unsafe and too costly","bodyText":"Nuclear power is unsafe and too expensive to justify building new plants anywhere in the world, according to the Japanese prime minister at the time of the Fukushima nuclear accident. Speaking on the fifth anniversary of the disaster, Naoto Kan said he was against the idea of Japanese manufacturers such as Hitachi and Toshiba building plants in the UK. “Nuclear power is not safe. In the worst case scenario up to 50 million people would have had to be evacuated. Nuclear power is not a suitable technology and renewable power is much better,” Kan told the Guardian. The former prime minister insisted he did not want to tell other countries such as Britain what to do but he said he did not support the reactors being switched back on in Japan. His warning came as Britain’s nuclear plans are hanging in the balance because of delays over the go-ahead for EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C project in Somerset and concerns about the project’s financial viability. While the French company EDF is at the centre of the Hinkley scheme, Hitachi and Toshiba are behind similar intiatives being developed for new reactors at Wylfa on Anglesey, Oldbury in South Gloucestershire, and Sellafield in Cumbria. Kan said it “did not make sense” to construct new atomic plants because of the cost, especially in those countries where there were no long-term storage facilities for high level radioactive waste. This includes Britain and Japan. “What I experienced as prime minister made me feel that it does not make sense to rely on nuclear. New generation plant designs are supposed to increase safety but all these do is increase the cost.” Tom Greatrex, chief executive of Britain’s atomic lobby group, the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), said he was comfortable that Hinkley and the other reactors being planned in Britain would be safe because they would go through the UK’s most rigorous regulatory scrutiny. “The process of assessing the reactor design is done in a different way in the UK and that gives confidence that the reactor design (EDF’s European pressurised reactors) will be safe and that is what we need to see.” Asked about Kan’s wider concerns, Greatrex said: “Since that time [of the Fukushima accident], four reactors have come back on line in Japan … the reality of Fukushima was that all of the casualties were to do with the tsunami and then the evacuation process, not to do with radioactive material being released. In that respect it was a climatic catastrophe rather than a nuclear catastrophe. “But the most important thing in the UK context of Fukushima is what the UK government did five years ago which was to pause, to reflect, for Mike Weightman [chief inspector of nuclear installations] to do his assessments of what the implications of what Fukushima were for the UK.” A spokesperson from the Department of Energy and Climate Change also said the safety of British reactors would be paramount. “Any nuclear power station built in the UK will need to comply with our world-leading nuclear safety regulation. “The British government is backing new nuclear. It is an important part of our plan to give hardworking families and businesses clean, affordable and secure energy that they can rely on now and in the future.” The £18bn Hinkley Point C nuclear project was thrown into doubt this week after after EDF’s finance director, Thomas Piquemal, resigned after opposing the deal. He believes the costly agreement threatens the company’s future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/mar/29/majority-of-australians-support-phasing-out-coal-power-by-2030-survey-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-28T17:00:08Z","webTitle":"Majority of Australians support phasing out coal power by 2030, survey finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/29/majority-of-australians-support-phasing-out-coal-power-by-2030-survey-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/mar/29/majority-of-australians-support-phasing-out-coal-power-by-2030-survey-finds","fields":{"headline":"Majority of Australians support phasing out coal power by 2030, survey finds","bodyText":"A majority of Australians would support phasing out coal power by 2030, including half the people in a sample identifying as Coalition voters, according to a survey by a progressive thinktank. The research funded by the Australia Institute says 60% of a sample of 1,417 Australians surveyed by online market research firm Research Now supported Australia joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance to phase out coal power by 2030. The Powering Past Coal Alliance – spearheaded by the UK and Canada – was unveiled at the COP23 climate talks in Bonn. The agreement is not legally binding, and the membership does not include Australia or other major coal exporters and users. The survey suggests there is a core level of support across Australia’s partisan divide for signing on, with 50% of Coalition voters supportive as well as 67% of ALP voters. The significant dissenters were One Nation voters, with only 36% supportive. A majority of Australians also supported increasing ambition on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, with 58% support, including 47% of Coalition voters in the sample. “The strong majority support for phasing out coal power shows how far the community is ahead of the government on climate change,” said the Australia Institute’s deputy director, Ebony Bennett. She said the Turnbull government’s approach on climate and energy policy meant Australia was at risk of missing out on jobs and investment associated with a global boom in renewable energy, and was out of step with public sentiment. The research follows a declaration on Wednesday at the National Press Club by the resources minister Matt Canavan that he was not interested in contemplating a discussion about a just transition for workers displaced by any phase out of coal consistent with Australia’s international climate obligations. Canavan said workers suffered when industries shut down or were phased out so euphemisms like “just transitions” were best avoided. “I don’t like the term transition, let’s be frank, if you want to shutdown the coal industry, say it – that’s what will happen.” The resources minister said expanding the coal industry was “not inconsistent with the obligations we’ve got to reduce carbon emissions”. He said countries were increasing investment in high-efficiency coal plants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the Paris accord. Canavan did not mention that some countries, such as Japan, are increasing investment in high-efficiency coal because of a phase-out of nuclear power. Canavan also declared in response to a question about balancing his portfolio responsibilities to boost the resources sector with his responsibilities to the Queenslanders who elected him that he had been elected to parliament “on a platform that is unashamedly pro-coal”. While Canavan was elected because he was given a winnable position on the LNP’s Queensland Senate ticket, the resources minister said: “I got elected on the basis I will support the resources sector.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jul/07/nationals-leader-pushes-queensland-lnp-to-back-coalitions-energy-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-07T05:55:35Z","webTitle":"Nationals leader pushes Queensland LNP to back Coalition's energy policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jul/07/nationals-leader-pushes-queensland-lnp-to-back-coalitions-energy-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jul/07/nationals-leader-pushes-queensland-lnp-to-back-coalitions-energy-policy","fields":{"headline":"Nationals leader pushes Queensland LNP to back Coalition's energy policy","bodyText":"The Nationals leader and deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, has issued a subtle warning to the Queensland Liberal National party to fall in line with the government’s proposed energy policy, while leaving the door open for a coal-inclusive future. A somewhat tired-looking McCormack addressed the LNP state convention on Saturday, as the warm-up for an exuberant Malcolm Turnbull, covering issues such as infrastructure and dams, before turning to the party’s biggest fight – energy policy – in the last minutes of his speech. The Nationals, particularly Nationals-aligned Queensland MPs, where the Coalition is formally one party, have begun privately straying from the party line, prompting Josh Frydenberg to visit two Queensland Nationals electorates, leaving open the possibility of a new coal-fired power station in the state’s north. Nationals MPs have also begun pushing for a $5bn equity fund to be set aside for coal-fired baseload power generators as their price for supporting the national energy guarantee when it returns to the government party room following the Council of Australian Governments (Coag) meeting. But speaking to the LNP faithful, who hold 21 of the state’s 30 seats, of which Labor has identified 10 as potential election swingers, McCormack pushed for the party to support the Neg, name-checking two of the Queensland party’s most influential voices, Matt Canavan and David Littleproud, as also being in support. “Like all other Nationals, and those in the Liberals too, I support the Neg and its purpose to bring about consistency in the energy supply arrangements through a Coag process,” McCormack said. “All governments in Australia have a role to play in this process, especially in Queensland where the government already has the poles and wires and runs the generators. “My Nationals colleagues also know this all too well and Queensland senator Matt Canavan said this week, in an interview, an excellent one, as always, on Sky News, ‘we need to get on with the job of establishing a stable energy policy for Australia. That includes, the national energy guarantee. That includes a pathway to our Paris commitments in a way that is affordable and maintains a reliable power supply’. “I couldn’t have said it better myself. And like senator Canavan, I too want to get on with the job, of establishing the Neg, to provide reliable energy supply, while building towards the Paris commitments, to achieve the emissions reductions of 26%. We are already meeting them. In fact, we are more than meeting them and we have to play our part. “... and another of my Queensland colleagues, David Littleproud, also has an eye on pragmatism and in a speech in parliament he did in May last year, he said he was ‘proud to be part of a government which approached an industry policy in such a sensible and pragmatic way’. And of course, that is what it is all about.” But in a nod to the debate raging within the joint Coalition party room, flamed by Tony Abbott and Barnaby Joyce, McCormack assured the crowd that coal had its role in any future plan. “Of course, coal has to be part of the mix,” he said. “We are very pro-coal in the LNP. Of course we are.” Energy issues, including removing subsidies for renewables, committing to build a new coal-fired power station in the north, and investigating a nuclear power future in the uranium rich state, played a big role in the convention’s policy discussions, and the room was in favour of all three. A vote count was necessary, and the show of hands supporting the motions vastly outnumbered those that did not. Outside the convention, a Galilee Blockade protest, featuring a dinosaur costume, a paper mache Pauline Hanson and protesters in Malcolm Turnbull and Adani chief Gautam Adani masks, called attention to the largely forgotten – at least at this conference – issue of the Adani coal mine in Queensland, once billed as the largest in the southern hemisphere. “Politicians supporting new coal mines and power stations are stuck in the past,” the Galilee Blockade spokesman Ben Pennings said. “Thermal coal markets are disappearing with renewable energy the key to a cleaner prosperous future.” Inside, McCormack, who had been tasked with tackling the energy debate, freeing Turnbull to speak on the coming Longman byelection and Labor’s “failings”, rebutted that message. “... I would like to see some of those latte sippers from Sydney and Melbourne go up to Mackay, go up to Gladstone or Cairns, indeed anywhere, Rocky you name it, and you tell those hi-vis workers that ‘we don’t want you to work. We don’t want you to have your jobs. We don’t want you to dig up coal for exports, for domestic use’. “And of course they wouldn’t. Coal has to be part of the mix.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/16/japan-shinzo-abe-tipped-to-resign-june-cronyism-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T05:43:04Z","webTitle":"Japan's Shinzo Abe tipped to resign in June as cronyism scandals take toll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/16/japan-shinzo-abe-tipped-to-resign-june-cronyism-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/16/japan-shinzo-abe-tipped-to-resign-june-cronyism-scandal","fields":{"headline":"Japan's Shinzo Abe tipped to resign in June as cronyism scandals take toll","bodyText":"Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is likely to resign in June after two cronyism scandals sent his approval ratings to an all-time low and risk damaging his party’s fortunes in elections next year, according to one of Japan’s most popular postwar leaders. Junichiro Koizumi, a flamboyant reformer who was prime minister from 2001-06, told a weekly magazine published on Monday that Abe has found himself in a “dangerous” situation over the scandals, adding: “Won’t he resign around the time the current parliamentary session ends [on 20 June]?” Speaking to Aera magazine, Koizumi said Abe could harm his Liberal Democratic party’s chances in next summer’s upper house elections if he manages to cling on to the LDP presidency in a leadership election due in September. Abe has been badly bruised by allegations of cronyism centering on the heavily discounted sale of public land to the operator of an ultra-nationalist kindergarten in Osaka with links to his wife, Akie Abe. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and said he would resign if he or his wife were shown to have been intervened in the sale of the land. The finance ministry recently admitted to tampering with documents to remove references to Abe and his wife in papers relating to the decision to provide an 85% discount on the appraised value of the land. He is also alleged to have used his influence to help a friend secure permission to open a veterinary school – claims he has rejected. Last week, however, an official document emerged describing the veterinary school as “an issue that involves the prime minister”. Although he shares Abe’s hawkish views on defence, Koizumi has emerged as a vocal critic of the prime minister’s support for nuclear power. Abe wants to expand nuclear’s share of the energy mix, while Koizumi has called for its abolition following the March 2011 meltdown in Fukushima. His comments came after he speculated that Abe would find it “difficult” to secure the LDP presidency for a third three-year term this autumn, telling reporters: “He has lost trust and whatever he says sounds like an excuse.” New polls show the twin education scandals have caused dramatic slump in Abe’s support ratings, with many voters saying they were not convinced by his explanations. A survey by broadcaster Nippon TV released on Sunday showed Abe’s support had sunk to 26.7%, the lowest since he took office in December 2012. An Asahi newspaper poll published on Monday put his rating at 31%. On Saturday, protestors gathered in front of the national diet building to demand his resignation, with organisers claiming up to 50,000 people had taken part. Shigeru Ishiba, a former defence minister, was the most popular choice to replace Abe in a weekend poll by Kyodo news, with 26.6%. Koizumi’s son, Shinjiro Koizumi, came second with 25.2%, with Abe in third place with 18.3%. Abe will arrive in the US this week for talks with Donald Trump on trade and North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme. Despite his attempts to establish a close personal relationship with the US president, there are concerns Abe has been sidelined by a recent flurry diplomatic activity that will see the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, meet South Korea’s president, Moon-Jae-in, this month, as well as a possible summit between Kim and Trump the following month.

EDF said this week that it was taking reactor 3 of Hunterston B in Scotland offline for half a year, after inspections found more cracks than expected in the graphite bricks at the reactor’s core. The plant is one of seven Advanced Gas-Cooling Reactors (AGRS) switched on during the 1970s and 80s, several of which have seen their lifetimes extended into the 2020s. EDF maintains that the prospect of more old reactors having a sustained outage is highly unlikely, but experts said it would pose a significant challenge to power supplies if they did. Peter Atherton, an analyst at the consultancy Cornwall Insight, said: “Let’s say worst-case scenario they found a big graphite core problem and Hunterston never comes back on. “That would be a big hole in the plan [for electricity supplies]. The gas-fired power stations, we’ve probably got enough of them, but it would be pretty tight. It would also be a knock-back to carbon targets. You could build more windfarms, but that would take time.”The Hunterston outage is the longest yet over the graphite issue, which EDF calls a “unique challenge”, and company presentations concede the cracking “will probably limit the lifetime for the current generation of AGRs”. The graphite core is used to moderate the neutrons in a nuclear reaction, but over time the irradiation degrades the graphite, ultimately leading to cracks. These cause a series of knock-on effects that can impair control of the nuclear reaction. The UK nuclear regulator points out that the total number of cracks is well below specified safety limits. It has also welcomed more frequent inspections such as those that led EDF to take the Hunterston reactor offline. Experts estimate the 40% cut in the power station’s output – it normally supplies enough electricity for 1.8m homes – will cost the French state-owned firm £100m-120m in lost revenue. That is small compared with the impact of temporary safety closures at EDF’s French plants, which led profits to fall 16% last year, but it is still a blow the company could do without as it ramps up construction of the £20bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset. EDF will not be the only energy company affected by the outage. Deepa Venkateswaran, an analyst at Bernstein bank, said she thought it would also hurt the price British Gas’s parent company, Centrica, would fetch for its stake in the plants. Centrica recently said it hoped to sell its 20% share by 2020. Brian Cowell, EDF’s generation managing director, said he was very confident the Hunterston reactor would come back online in mid-November. So far, significant cracks have only been found at reactors three and four at Hunterston B. Hinkley Point B, which came online in the same year as Hunterston, is offline to carry out checks for cracks, which will be completed in three to four weeks. “The one that will be worrying them is Hinkley [Point B],” said John Large, a nuclear consultant who has advised the UK government. Hinkley Point has not only become an industry showcase for why new nuclear reactors should be built in the UK, but the old power station is providing electricity for the 3,500-strong workforce constructing the new plant. Nuclear provides about a fifth of UK electricity, but experts said this week that it would slump to 10% by 2027, as the old plants are retired. BMI Research said it did not expect Hinkley Point C to come online by 2025 as planned, given recent warnings of further delays to EDF’s Flamanville plant in France, which uses the same reactor design."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/19/huge-mistake-britain-throwing-away-lead-in-tidal-energy-say-developers","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"‘Huge mistake’: Britain throwing away lead in tidal energy, say developers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/19/huge-mistake-britain-throwing-away-lead-in-tidal-energy-say-developers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/19/huge-mistake-britain-throwing-away-lead-in-tidal-energy-say-developers","fields":{"headline":"‘Huge mistake’: Britain throwing away lead in tidal energy, say developers","bodyText":"Britain is throwing away its opportunity to rule the global wave and tidal energy sector due to lack of government support, a series of leading developers have told the Guardian. The nation is currently seen as a world leader in capturing renewable energy from the oceans but some companies are already heading for new shores. This is putting other countries, such as France and Canada, in prime position to capitalise on the jobs being created by the emerging industry, the companies say. Ocean energy is needed alongside other renewables to provide the huge amount of clean electricity that will be required to phase out fossil fuel use and fight climate change, proponents argue. Tidal energy has the particular advantage of being entirely reliable and the European Union predicts 100GW of ocean energy will be installed by 2050, the equivalent of 100 large conventional power stations. But despite good UK government funding for research and development, support to put the devices into commercial use is now missing. Ministers are soon expected to reject a tidal barrage scheme in Swansea as too costly, but to back a new nuclear plant in Wales. “I think the UK is making a huge mistake with this,” said Dr Martin Edlund, CEO of Minesto, which has invested £25m to install subsea kites that harvest energy from the currents off Wales. “The UK is a world leader in this emerging industry and it is just giving it away.” “The withdrawal of existing support systems – which are peanuts when compared to the huge [total] subsidies for the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant – leaves the industry without support,” he said. “I will just turn my back on the UK and go elsewhere.” Sustainable Marine Energy, a British company that developed and tested its floating tidal turbines in Scotland, is now taking its device to Canada, citing “more support” from the government there. Another tidal turbine company, Atlantis, whose MeyGen project in Orkney is the world’s first large-scale tidal array connected to the grid, is looking to France, where a major government tender is expected in the coming months. “I think France is sitting on a gold mine, whereas the UK has stalled,” said Drew Blaxland, at Atlantis. He said it is hard to understand the UK’s unwillingness to capitalise on the millions invested in research and development to date: “Why would you run a marathon and then stop at the stadium?” A leading wave power developer, Corpower, has been testing its bobbing device at the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney since January, where 20 companies have deployed new technologies. But Corpower may move after that. “We may go full scale in the UK, or we may go somewhere else,” said CEO, Patrik Möller. He is not confident of new UK support: “I’ll believe it when I see it.” Commercial scale tidal and wave power projects could get government subsidies until March 2017, but since then have only been able to apply to a “contracts for difference” (CfD) scheme open to all marine energy technologies. Offshore wind is a more mature industry and costs have fallen rapidly, meaning all the support has gone to these projects. Atlantis applied but did not win funding. “We just need 5% of the CfD pot to build an 80MW Meygen project,” said David Taafe, at Atlantis. The tidal and wave developers argue that a mix of renewables is vital – for when the wind does not blow – for example. But new technologies require support to scale up, which is when economies of scale and learning drive costs down. “It seems daft,” said one Scottish official: “The UK seems to have given up. France says it wants to be a world leader, Canada says it wants to be a world leader, but there can only be one world leader.’ “You have tidal and wave energy in Scotland and Wales, but Westminster [which controls subsidies] is not interested,” said Edlund. He said the UK had already failed to develop a significant domestic manufacturing industry in wind energy, despite an early lead – the largest wind turbine in the world in the 1980s was in Orkney: “You lost that one, now you are going to lose marine energy.” A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “We want our renewable energy sector to continue to thrive which is why this government will invest over £2.5bn in low-carbon innovation by 2021. But clearly investment in new technology must represent value for money for the UK taxpayer as well as the consumer.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2019/may/25/the-book-that-changed-my-mind-matt-haig-emily-maitlis-siri-hustvedt-hay-festival","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-25T10:00:40Z","webTitle":"The book that changed my mind: Matt Haig, Emily Maitlis and more share their picks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/25/the-book-that-changed-my-mind-matt-haig-emily-maitlis-siri-hustvedt-hay-festival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2019/may/25/the-book-that-changed-my-mind-matt-haig-emily-maitlis-siri-hustvedt-hay-festival","fields":{"headline":"The book that changed my mind: Matt Haig, Emily Maitlis and more share their picks","bodyText":"Matt Haig The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace-Wells. This is, unfortunately, non-fiction. If only it were fiction. In crystalline prose, Wallace-Wells provides a devastating overview of where we are in terms of climate crisis and ecological destruction, and what the future will hold if we keep on going down the same path. Urgently readable, this is as much an epoch-defining book as Naomi Klein’s No Logo was two decades ago. However much you think you might know about climate crisis, Wallace-Wells’s exhaustive but compelling study will open your eyes even wider. The crisis is so much more than sea level rises and isolated terrifying incidents, and this book is brilliant at showing how everything connects. Matt Haig is author of Notes on a Nervous Planet and Evie and the Animals, published by Canongate. Deborah Lipstadt When I teach courses on the history of the Holocaust, my lectures may stimulate the students intellectually and challenge them personally. Nothing, however, that I impart has the impact of a lecture given by a Holocaust survivor. She or he can say: “This is my story. This is what happened to me.” And so it is with memoirs. They too possess the distinct attribute of being able to speak in the first person singular. Ruth Kluger’s Still Alive leaves my students and I dumbfounded. Beginning with her childhood in Vienna and continuing with her “sojourns” in Terezin and Birkenau through to her life in America, Kluger writes with a unique honesty and forthrightness. Full of “piss and vinegar”, she is unafraid to speak the truth as she sees it. Deborah Lipstadt’s Antisemitism: Here and Now is published by Scribe. Caroline Criado Perez It is no exaggeration to say that Feminism and Linguistic Theory by Deborah Cameron changed my life. Before I picked it up I was not a feminist. Men and women were equal now, and there was nothing holding us back but ourselves: our irrational, trivial, overemotional, jealous and unintellectual selves. (Except, of course, my self wasn’t like that. I was more like one of the guys. And I had a sense of humour.) But Cameron’s book made me realise that words and language were not just simple tools I used to shape my thoughts. Grammatical rules such as the use of the generic male pronoun were not meaningless standards; they had taught me to unconsciously, reflexively, think of men as the default human. These tools were shaping my views – and I somehow hadn’t even noticed. It was quite the wakeup call. Caroline Criado Perez’s Invisible Women is published by Chatto. David Olusoga Many people have been turning to James Baldwin recently and, you have to hope, many of them have had their minds changed by his stark analysis of racial politics and history. The Fire Next Time, an essay Baldwin wrote for his nephew, is not an easy read and there’s little comfort to be found in the thought that it was written for another age, the early 1960s. It has been rediscovered, reassessed and reprinted now because it speaks powerfully to our historical moment. If, today, you want to understand what people mean when they talk about systemic inequality, and if you’re seeking to understand how racism damages and in some cases destroys lives, it is all laid out here, plainly and painfully. “One of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly,” Baldwin writes, “is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.” In the politics of 2019 hatred and divisions founded on hatred have become distractions, designed to draw attention away from the real and legitimate pain of economic exploitation and social marginalisation. David Olusoga’s Black and British: A Forgotten History is published by Pan. Siri Hustvedt The Restless Clock: A History of the Centuries Old Argument Over What Makes Living Things Tick by Jessica Riskin explores the history of ideas about agency – the capacity of living organisms to act in the world – and its connection to mechanistic thought, nature as machine. Riskin’s fascinating and lively book reframes the conventional narrative of the scientific revolution by tracing the passive and active strains in mechanistic philosophy. She convincingly demonstrates how the view of nature as inert passive matter was theologically based and that it contrasted with the view of nature as mechanical and active–. The book made me rethink several assumptions I had about the history of what we now call biology and brought further nuance to contemporary debates about machine and organic intelligence. Siri Hustvedt’s Memories of the Future is published by Sceptre. Max Porter I felt profoundly and gratefully changed on finishing Nathan Filer’s The Heartland. He is such a good storyteller, such a rigorous and careful handler of other people’s narratives, that by the end of the book I felt I had truly met and listened to them. He had taught me to listen more attentively, to interrogate and rely less on pre-existing formulations for understanding others’ pain. His book is about language. I realised I had been complicit in a system of linguistic entrapment whereby diagnostic language, the language of medicine and madness, the othering function of our deeply flawed system for helping and speaking about people with psychiatric illnesses, is causing great harm. He shows us how this harm is enacted, from individual gestures to governmental ideology. I therefore finished the book politically enlightened and personally inspired, not just in the context of mental healthcare, but in all my encounters with people, in the words I choose to use. Max Porter’s Lanny is published by Faber. Sara Pascoe Reading books I always fold the corners on pages that I want to return to, the pages that contain lines I need to revisit – want to redigest. Finishing King Kong Theory by Virginie Despentes, translated by Stéphanie Benson, I realised my system was useless as I had folded down every single page. It’s worth saying that Despentes is an incredible writer, but her thinking – her insight – is lightning. Scalding and illuminating. I’ve been bringing her up in every conversation. She is brilliant on ugliness, on anarchism and rebellion, but especially important on porn. On her experiences selling sex, transactional sex in general. Women and money, women and their pleasure. She writes near the end about how powerful women have to ally with men – have to “smile in subjugation” and dress attractively as “pledges of obedience”. She says the women “we hear speaking are those who know how to get on with men”. Despentes’s experiences will lead you to question your own: you’ll be moved and agitated. Sara Pascoe’s Sex Power Money will be published by Faber on 29 August. Mia Couto The Lies That Bind: Rethinking Identity by Kwame Anthony Appiah is a book I would recommend at a time when identities are presented as absolute and definitive truths. Appiah focuses on deconstructing these truths on the basis of brief family stories, his own personal experiences, or experiences that he was told about. The book analyses our ideas about race, gender, culture, religion, nationality and social class, and suggests that all these categories are lies that serve to unite us against those who are declared different in an age of extreme polarisation. What Appiah does is to debate such concepts, seeking out their histories and exploring their ambiguities. The author deals with the complex subject of ideas about identity – possibly the most important issue of the modern age – in a way that is vivid and appealing. Mia Couto’s Women of the Ashes, translated by David Brooksaw, is published by Picador. Bernardine Evaristo The African American lesbian-feminist poet and essayist Audre Lorde (1934-1992) is enjoying a renaissance. I first encountered her books in the 1980s when she was hugely influential in validating my desire to write as a young black feminist who felt like an outsider in British society. Her stirring 1984 essay collection, Sister Outsider, is a passionate, personal and political offering on the intersections of identities, and she articulates strategies of resistance to marginalisation and subjugation. This kind of book is often only read by those directly affected by the issues it explores but we are all part of a network of individuals who impact on each other. The inheritors of patriarchal power and privilege would do well to read this book. At a time when we’re experiencing a backlash against egalitarian social advances, Lorde’s voice remains as pertinent and prescient as ever. Bernardine Evaristo’s Girl, Woman, Other is published by Hamish Hamilton. Jessie Burton I have thought about Richard Powers’s novel The Overstory ever since reading it last year. It is ambitious, meditative, fundamentally quite weird, and both sprawling and specific. Nine very contrasting characters come to inhabit a world of trees, as Powers examines our interdependence with these natural miracles, our need for them, and how their beauty and strength need to be protected at all costs. For me, what was so radical and exciting about this novel was the fact that the trees are probably more important than the human beings who trundle around them causing chaos. It was the first “eco-lit” novel I’ve read that made me stop and truly realise how sophisticated trees are, how magisterially brilliant. And, in a world where finally, collectively, we are acknowledging the threat of climate crisis, it reminded me of how important they are to the planet’s survival. Jessie Burton’s The Restless Girls is published by Bloomsbury. Elif Shafak Thomas Page McBee’s Amateur is a fascinating book that stayed with me. It is brave, honest and touchingly human. The author, a trans man, tells the story of how he got into amateur boxing and what happened afterwards. At first glance, this is a story about manhood, fighting, power, survival … but the book is so much more than that. His voice is remarkably candid, compassionate, calm, thoughtful. “Why do men fight?” he asks. “I tried to look at masculinity with a beginner’s mind, and I asked questions even when I was embarrassed, or when my mouth was full of blood, or when I was afraid of looking stupid, or lost, or weak. Especially then.” McBee takes us on a journey of many transformations – physical, mental and even spiritual. From myths about testosterone to the construct of masculinity, from the stereotypes we internalise to the judgments we pass in life, it raises important and timely questions, such as how to be a man without being like your father. This is a beautiful book that will resonate not only with young men struggling with the pressures and social expectations of masculinity, or with women dealing with limitations due to patriarchy, but with anyone anywhere in the world who is determined to become a better, kinder human being. Elif Shafak’s My Last 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World will be published by Viking on 6 June. Steven Pinker In his American countercultural magazine Whole Earth Catalog, Stewart Brand changed the image of technology from corporate and malevolent to human and cool. In his more recent Whole Earth Discipline, he has exploded our understanding of how to protect the environment. The subtitle tossed one grenade after another: “Why dense cities, nuclear power, transgenic crops, restored wildlands, and geoengineering are necessary.” Before you rage, consider whether orthodox environmentalism – with its romantic, luddite, apocalyptic , and sometimes misanthropic streaks – is succeeding in safeguarding the planet, and open your mind to Brand’s “ecomodernist” alternative. Steven Pinker’s Enlightenment Now: The Case for Science, Reason, Humanism and Progress is published by Penguin. Emily Maitlis Back to Black by Kehinde Andrews has made me reassess my view of reparations for slavery. I used to think the idea of compensation seemed bizarre, undeliverable and risked reinforcing victimhood. It has become a live issue in the US among democrats in the 2020 presidential race, and through Kehinde I’ve started thinking about it more dispassionately and with greater openness and curiosity. I actually felt the shift happening. Emily Maitlis is a broadcaster and author of Airhead: The Imperfect Art of Making News (Michael Joseph). Michael Rosen While we’ve been talking about Britain in Europe, our role in relation to the rest of the world – historically and present – is becoming urgently scrutinised. One book that changed my perspective on this was Eric Williams’s Capitalism and Slavery, originally published in 1944. I was lucky to have been at university with Trevor Munro, who went on to become a politician in Jamaica. He quietly put this book in my direction as a way of making student radicals like me reframe our economic and political history. I instantly found it to be a book that made demands on me to take slavery and slave labour beyond the realm of cruelty (terrible though that was) and see it as a vast international process of wealth production. What’s more, Williams, a Trinidadian, asks readers in Britain to inspect the material means that enabled so much of what we neutrally call “culture” to have come into being. Michael Rosen’s Uncle Gobb and the Plot Plot is published by Bloomsbury. Serhii Plokhy As a historian, I have always been on the lookout for the events and processes in our everyday lives that are truly historic and have a lasting impact. I was surprised to find a hint to what I am supposed to look for in a recent work not by a historian, but by two scientists, Simon L Lewis and Mark A Maslin, co‑authors of The Human Planet: How We Created the Anthropocene. It turns out that our age will be remembered in the most distant future not for its wars, dictators or heroes, but for the nuclear tests we conducted and the nuclear accidents we allowed to happen. The traces of isotopes released during the atmospheric nuclear tests of the 1950s and early 60s and the Chernobyl accident of 1986 will be detected hundreds of years from now. The half-life of one of those, Plutonium-239, is 24,000 years. That is of course if we do not blow up our planet before that. Serhii Plokhy’s Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy (Allen Lane) won the 2018 Baillie Gifford prize for non‑fiction. Damian Barr So many people now live with pain that cannot be diagnosed conventionally but that nevertheless feels cripplingly real to them – back pain is most common. It afflicts sufferers, their families and our society and economy. The NHS estimates medically unexplained symptoms cost £3bn annually. It’s All in Your Head: True Stories of Imaginary Illness by neurologist Suzanne O’Sullivan brought this very real pain home to me when I read it as a judge for the 2016 Wellcome book prize. It gave me greater empathy for my own mother who endured inexplicable agony through most of my childhood, and made me rethink what illness and wellness are. It made me understand that we must take a holistic view of mental and physical health if we are to free individuals and avert a full-scale health crisis. Reading this book made me kinder. Damian Barr’s You Will Be Safe Here is published by Bloomsbury.

Opposition politicians in the state of Tamil Nadu have accused the police of committing mass murder against protesters opposed to the expansion of a copper smelting facility in the port city of Thoothukudi. Ten people were shot dead and about 80 wounded by police after crowds set fire to cars and pelted officers with stones on Tuesday. Another man, identified by Indian media as a 23-year-old named Kaliappan, was killed in further protests on Wednesday. The Madras high court ordered a halt to the expansion of the 400,000-tonne facility in response to the unrest, and ordered authorities to hold public hearings before granting environmental approval to the construction. The smelter, operated by an Indian subsidiary of London-based Vedanta Resources, has been repeatedly shut down over pollution complaints and was fined £10m in 2013 for breaching environmental norms and operating without the consent of the state pollution board. The same year, activists allege a gas leak from the plant left hundreds with breathing difficulties, nausea and throat infections. Residents and environmentalists have been protesting for the past three months against plans to double the capacity of the copper plant that they say is contaminating the air and fisheries around the site. Sterlite Copper, the Indian subsidiary that owns the plant, says the facility operates “within all the specified parameters” and blamed the unrest on “nefarious elements”. Outrage over the police killings grew on Wednesday, and was fuelled by a video showing a plainclothes police officer boarding a bus and firing his rifle at protesters. A voice could be heard in the background saying: “At least one should die.” MK Stalin, leader of the main Tamil Nadu opposition party, the DMK, said police were guilty of atrocities. “Mass murder of innocent people,” he tweeted on Wednesday. “Who ordered the police firing on protesters? Why were automatic weapons used to disperse the crowd and under what law is this permitted?” Rahul Gandhi, the national leader of the opposition Congress party, has called the deaths “a brutal example of state-sponsored terrorism”. “These citizens were murdered for protesting against injustice,” he said. P Mahendran, superintendent of Thoothukudi district police, said 18 officers were also wounded in the clashes. “The situation is tense but under control today,” he said. “The postmortem on the bodies is being conducted and they will be handed over to families today.” The plant, about 375 miles (600km) south of Tamil Nadu’s state capital Chennai, is currently shut as the company awaits a licence to expand the site. The protesters had set ablaze the local administrator’s office after they were denied permission to hold a rally at the plant. Police said efforts to disperse the crowd of several thousand with a baton charge and teargas volleys failed before authorities used live ammunition. Tamil Nadu chief minister, Edappadi K Palaniswami, ordered the judicial inquiry into the shootings but defended the police. “The police had to take action under unavoidable circumstances to protect public life and property as the protesters resorted to repeated violence,” he said. The families of each victim would be offered 1 million rupees (£11,000) compensation, he added. A spokeswoman for Vedanta Resources said it had witnessed the deaths at the protest “with great sorrow and regret”. “The company is working with the relevant authorities to ensure the safety of our employees, facilities and the surrounding community,” she said. Tamil Nadu is one of India’s most prosperous and industrialised states but, as elsewhere in the country, environmental regulations are routinely breached and poorly policed. Thoothukudi was also the site of violent protests in 2012 over a nuclear power plant in neighbouring Kudankulam district that left one person dead. Mobile internet services were cut in the district and surrounding areas and early on Thursday morning the state’s pollution control board ordered the closure of the copper plant, cutting off its electricity supply. The board claimed it had found evidence the plant was “carrying out activities to resume production” despite being ordered to wait until its license to operate was renewed.

The two line parliamentary bill published by the government last Thursday contained no detail, no plan, and no check or balance on the prime minister’s possible negotiation as it progresses. One thing that was included, albeit buried in the explanation notes, is a brief reference to also ending Britain’s membership of Euratom – an entirely separate treaty. The implications of this will be deep and far-reaching for the future of UK’s energy supply, science, industry and workers. There is no political or legal mandate for the UK to leave Euratom, in fact it was barely even a footnote in the referendum campaign, and yet we are heading for a nuclear Brexit. Euratom matters for the UK. Signed in 1957 as the European Atomic Energy Community, it is a separate treaty from the EU with the purpose of creating a single market for nuclear knowledge and resources in the peaceful pursuit of science and nuclear energy. Whilst currently its only full members are EU countries, it is in fact a legally separate organisation to the EU. The UK is a leading member of Euratom, and plays host to one of its most important research institutions – the Joint European Torus (JET), based in Culham, Oxfordshire. JET is performing extraordinary and groundbreaking research in the pursuit of fusion energy, and is part of an EU-wide project to deliver on the vision of this revolutionary, safe and clean energy source. On the way, new technologies, materials and expertise are being developed here. Euratom also provides safeguarding inspections for all civilian nuclear facilities in the UK, including Hinkley Point B, Sizewell and Torness in Scotland. It is the legal owner of all nuclear material, and is the legal purchaser, certifier and guarantor of any nuclear materials and technologies that the UK purchases. This includes our nuclear trade with the United States. This means that 21% of the UK’s electricity generation is based on our membership of Euratom. It means that EDF can rely on secure supply chains for construction at Hinkley Point C and it is responsible for safeguarding inspections. Whether people are in favour of nuclear fission power or not we can all agree we want it to be as safe as possible, which is why leaving Euratom makes no sense. Our own regulating authorities are not equipped to take over all of Euratom’s safeguarding work in the UK, and any British scientist will tell you that their work depends on international collaboration that is facilitated by this treaty. Given this, it is hard to overstate the effect leaving Euratom will have on the UK –and the British people did not give the government a mandate to leave Euratom. I think this is a bad decision, poorly thought out and with no explanation as to how our safety will be protected. The government must start at some point to put the national interest ahead of narrow party interest and Euratom would be a good place to start. Euratom is a separate treaty and the government should have the gumption to treat it as such – it requires separate and detailed negotiations. Our nuclear energy, safety and research must not be subjugated to the already chaotic wider Brexit negotiations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/dec/15/fossil-fuel-divestment-pesticides-and-some-very-funny-animals-green-news-roundup","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-15T15:46:07Z","webTitle":"Fossil fuel divestment, pesticides and some very funny animals – green news roundup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/15/fossil-fuel-divestment-pesticides-and-some-very-funny-animals-green-news-roundup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/dec/15/fossil-fuel-divestment-pesticides-and-some-very-funny-animals-green-news-roundup","fields":{"headline":"Fossil fuel divestment, pesticides and some very funny animals – green news roundup","bodyText":"Environment news English rivers polluted by powerful insecticides, first tests reveal ‘Explore lightly’: Palau makes all visitors sign pledge to respect environment Plans for major nuclear power station in Wales win green light Tesco faces legal threat over marketing its food with ‘fake farm’ names Arctic permafrost thawing faster than ever, US climate study finds World Bank to end financial support for oil and gas extraction Quarter of Christmas jumpers were worn once and discarded last year UK to bring back beavers in first government flood reduction scheme of its kind Macron awards US scientists grants to move to France in defiance of Trump Meat tax ‘inevitable’ to beat climate and health crises, says report In depth ‘A different dimension of loss’: inside the great insect die-off Fueling dissent: how the oil industry set out to undercut clean air EU must not burn the world’s forests for ‘renewable’ energy I wrote about farmers’ suicides – and the reaction has been overwhelming After years of toxic oil spills, indigenous Peruvians use tech to fight back Multimedia The 2017 comedy wildlife photography awards The week in wildlife – in pictures ‘Soul-crushing’ video of starving polar bear exposes climate crisis, experts say And finally ...

Sam Ting, from Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York, met Burton Richter, a leading experimenter at SLAC and said: “Burt, I have some interesting physics to tell you.” Richter responded immediately: “Sam, I have some interesting physics to tell you!” Neither realised they had discovered the same fundamental particle in two entirely different experiments, nearly 5,000km apart. Their breakthrough, which some regarded as the most important discovery in the history of particle physics, was so startling and far-reaching that Richter, who has died aged 87, and Ting shared the Nobel prize in 1976, making their award one of the most rapid in its history. The particle, which Richter’s team named psi, proved to be the first example of “charmonium” – a short-lived pseudo-atomic system comprising a quark and antiquark each of which carries the property known as “charm”. Up to that moment the idea of charm had been pure hypothesis, invented by theorists to bring a pleasing symmetry to the fundamental varieties of matter. So sudden and dramatic was the discovery, which within months led to a cascade of further breakthroughs in understanding of particles and forces, that the event became known in physics folklore as the “November Revolution”, recalling the October Revolution in Russia that changed 20th-century history. For the psi exhibited behaviour utterly unlike that to which particle physicists were accustomed. For example, while the psi was short-lived on the scale of normal experience, nonetheless it survived hundreds of times longer than the conventional wisdom expected. A popular description at the time said: “It was as if an anthropologist had stumbled upon a hitherto unknown tribe of people who lived seven thousands of years rather than seven decades.” This suspended animation was explained by the emerging theory of the strong force – quantum chromodynamics. Thus in addition to confirmation of the charm hypothesis, the November Revolution heralded the emergence of QCD in the physics lexicon. Meanwhile, the discovery of further examples of charmonium – psi-like particles – followed by the production of particles with explicit charm brought a symmetry to the basic picture of matter. The electron was known to be one of a family of four “leptons”, whereas the proton and neutron and related “strange” particles were built from three varieties of “quark” – whose existence had been confirmed by Richter’s colleagues at SLAC a few years earlier. The discovery of the charmed quark revealed that both quarks and leptons are linked in pairs (today we know of three such pairings or “generations”). The discovery of the psi was the dawn of this profound insight and the moment when the Standard Model of particles and forces began to be generally accepted. Until that time, there had been a 2,000-year quest, begun in ancient Greece, to identify the basic seeds and structure of matter. After discovery of the psi, with its novel properties, attention moved to understanding how different varieties of matter emerged in the Big Bang, leading to the forms that comprise our present experience; particle physics increasingly moved towards experimental cosmology. Thus, from a modern perspective, the November Revolution was the experimental boundary between two epochs in the field of particle physics. Burton was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Fanny (nee Pollack) and Abraham Richter, a textile worker. He attended Far Rockaway high school, which had already produced one Nobel laureate in physics – Richard Feynman; by coincidence the 1976 prize for Physiology or Medicine went to Baruch Blumberg, who had graduated from the school around the time that Richter matriculated. Richter went to university at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, graduating with a BSc in 1952 and PhD in 1956. His thesis work focused on the ability of high-energy gamma ray photons to liberate pi-mesons from atomic nuclei. His interest in photons took him to a professorship at Stanford University, where he worked on experiments at the electron linear accelerator, Slac. In 1972 he exploited its ability to generate positrons – the antimatter analogues of electrons – and designed a scheme to feed them into a circular accelerator called Spear (Stanford Positron-Electron Asymmetric Ring), which was small enough to fit into what had previously been a parking lot adjacent to Slac. The annihilation of electrons and positrons at Spear led to a raft of discoveries, of which the psi was just the beginning. Richter’s success with electrons and positrons at Spear helped inspire construction of LEP at Cern in Switzerland, from which the modern Large Hadron Collider has followed. These were indirect by-products of Richter’s success in designing Spear. More immediate was his recognition that the wasteful X-rays unavoidably produced by the circulating particles in Spear could be put to use as probes of materials and biological samples. During his tenure as director of Slac from 1984 to 1999, he encouraged the evolution of Spear into the SSRL – Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource – the world’s first synchrotron radiation facility. In later years his interests spread into nuclear power, climate change and energy technology. He was a president of the American Physical Society and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics. A member of the US National Academy of Sciences, Richter also won the US’s highest scientific honour, the National Medal of Science, in 2014. He is survived by his wife, Laurose (nee Becker), whom he married in 1960, their daughter, Elizabeth, son, Matthew, and two granddaughters. • Burton Richter, physicist, born 22 March 1931; died 18 July 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/mar/27/national-grid-backs-plan-for-earlier-petrol-and-diesel-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-27T13:31:43Z","webTitle":"National Grid backs plan for earlier petrol and diesel ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/27/national-grid-backs-plan-for-earlier-petrol-and-diesel-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/mar/27/national-grid-backs-plan-for-earlier-petrol-and-diesel-ban","fields":{"headline":"National Grid backs plan for earlier petrol and diesel ban","bodyText":"National Grid would support the government bringing forward its 2040 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales by a decade. The company, which runs the UK’s national electricity network and wants to build superfast car charging points at motorway services, told MPs it could cope with the demands of an earlier surge in electric car numbers. Graeme Cooper, the firm’s director of electric vehicles, told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee: “From Grid’s point of view, 2030 or 2040 is far enough out [to act].” Asked if the company could handle the challenge of managing energy supplies if sales of fossil fuel-powered cars were banned in 2030, he said: “Absolutely, no problem at all.” Questioned by Labour MP Vernon Coaker on whether National Grid would back a 2030 deadline, Cooper said the firm would support a more ambitious target. The Energy Networks Association, which represents local power grids, did not go as far as National Grid’s backing for an earlier date but said: “If the target was brought forward, energy networks are ready to deliver.” An environmental thinktank recently said a more aggressive target of 2030 would help almost halve the UK’s oil imports and virtually close the looming gap in the country’s carbon targets. Cooper also told the MPs that even with 9m electric cars on the road by 2030 – a huge rise from about 130,000 at present – there would be would be little need for new power stations, provided the vehicles were charged at off-peak times. “[We] could see much greater demand for energy [by 2030],” he said. “But if the charging is done smartly so you’re not adding to the peak of the day; then new generation, there’s not really a tremendous amount really needed.” He said that scenarios published last year by National Grid – which suggested the UK could need the equivalent of six Hinkley Point C nuclear power stations by 2050 to cope with electric cars – were the worst possible situation. He said that outcome was unlikely as drivers would not all charge at the same time. “The probability is close on zero,” he told Rachel Reeves, the committee’s chair. Cooper also hinted that its report this summer would revise up its estimate of 9m electric cars by 2030, given how fast they were developing. The firm is eyeing 50 sites across the UK to build superfast charging points at motorway service stations to end fears of “range anxiety”. Cooper conceded the rural location of most services meant energy network upgrades for such chargers could be costly, telling MPs they would need “targeted investment”. Ofgem said the cost of reinforcing electricity grids to cope with charging millions of cars should be largely paid for by electric vehicle owners, rather than all consumers via energy bills. Andrew Burgess, a partner at the energy regulator, said: “Those who impose an extra cost should bear a fair proportion of that and we should protect consumers in general. And not have consumers who don’t have electric vehicles subsidising those who do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/aug/03/northamptonshire-britain-council-bankruptcy-government-local-taxes","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-08-03T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"The crisis in Northants reveals a Britain heading back to pre-Victorian days | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/03/northamptonshire-britain-council-bankruptcy-government-local-taxes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/03/northamptonshire-britain-council-bankruptcy-government-local-taxes","fields":{"headline":"The crisis in Northants reveals a Britain heading back to pre-Victorian days","bodyText":"Is Northamptonshire Britain’s first banana republic? This once lovely county, much of it now a waste of wind turbines and warehouses, is close to bankruptcy. It must sack staff, freeze pay, close two-thirds of its libraries and stop all bus subsidies. It faces default on its statutory duty to public health, children in care and the elderly. While much of this is due to mismanagement, the National Audit Office says that 15 other counties, believed to include Somerset and Surrey, are in similar straits. Years of austerity are coming home to roost – and where least expected, among the rich shires. What is going on? Local councils cannot do what central government can do, which is tax and borrow to meet need. Each year Whitehall spends more. It can tip money into the NHS and triple-lock pensions – good causes both – as well as vanity projects such as aircraft carriers, high-speed trains and nuclear power stations. Councils have no such discretion. Since 2010 their spending has shrunk by over a third, with central government grants slashed by as much as NHS spending has risen. Ninety-five per cent of British taxation is controlled by the centre, against 60% in France and 50% in the US. Yet local spending must pick up the casualties of the welfare state – vulnerable children, elderly and infirm people. It must fund the day centres, youth clubs, care homes and visits to problem families. To do so, services that most modern communities expect from government must now be butchered, such as parks, libraries and museums. Local, not national, austerity is sending Britain back to pre-Victorian days. The solution is swift and easy. The government should uncap local taxes, free local spending, and allow local people to pay for what they want. It was how local government ran, perfectly well, up to the early 1980s. In most other countries it is still regarded as a normal feature of democracy. At present Britain’s meagre local revenue derives from a regressive household tax fixed on 1991 property valuations, which no government (except in Wales) has had the guts to revalue. Thus a billionaire’s flat in Knightsbridge costs just £1,421 a year, while a shop on the floor below can pay £244,000 in business rates. It is no surprise that the former goes to the council, and much of the latter is paid to central government. While this might be an extreme case, anyone wondering why high streets are in decline need look no further. Had council tax in Westminster risen in line with inflation since capping, its average property-owner would probably pay in the region of £8,000, and a multimillion-pound property many times that. Like so much of tax policy, this is not about money, but power. Starving local government of tax resources by refusing to let it raise local revenue has cost billions, some of which the Treasury has had to fund in grants. But this Treasury masochism is balanced by gaining ever more control. Thus, when councils began to raise revenue from uncapped parking charges and fines, the government won headlines by ordering that the money go only into road spending. Outside every closing care home is a road being resurfaced. Now the cynicism has reached new depths. When a national outcry broke out over cuts to local adult care, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in effect ordered councils to make a 3% increase in council tax, but only for adult care. When there was an outcry over police numbers, another 1% was allowed, just for police. Council tax is becoming just another central impost, like the nationalised business rates. I wonder what Hammond would say if we all told him exactly how we wanted him to spend our money. He would howl like a spoilt child. Council tax is absurdly regressive, which is why it is so hard to increase. The richest householder pays only three times the poorest. On any equitable basis it should be nearer 10 times. When Tory Westminster last year asked its top band-H payers – for houses valued at above £1m – if they would voluntarily pay double, 350 actually did so. The council leader, Nickie Aiken, openly called it a “mansion tax”. The amount raised, just £342,000, might be trivial, but it was a start that other councils have said they will imitate. Westminster had found a tax the rich are actually volunteering to pay. “Whitehall really would not mind if council tax just melted away altogether, and councils were reduced to acting as agents of the centre,” says Tony Travers, the London School of Economics’ local finance expert, who has studied this fiscal evolution over the years. “They could be blamed if things go wrong, while central government could take the credit for what goes right.” On this basis, every local service would be specified, paid for and accounted by Whitehall officials. It would be like universal credit now. According to Travers, this degree of centralised government is unparalleled in any major democracy. The growing economic imbalance between London and the rest of the country is now being matched by a democratic imbalance between centre and locality. No government is likely to introduce a new local tax, but the present one could at least do what other democracies elsewhere do – and allow a wide range of local services to be supplied through local decision. As used to be the case, resources could be redistributed between rich and poor areas, as between rich and poor citizens. Local tax should be uncapped and left free to do the job expected of it by parliament. If we must have banana republics, let’s at least vote for them. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2017/sep/13/michael-flynn-promoted-us-russian-nuclear-project-from-white-house","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T11:12:20Z","webTitle":"Michael Flynn 'promoted US-Russian nuclear project from White House'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/13/michael-flynn-promoted-us-russian-nuclear-project-from-white-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/sep/13/michael-flynn-promoted-us-russian-nuclear-project-from-white-house","fields":{"headline":"Michael Flynn 'promoted US-Russian nuclear project from White House'","bodyText":"US congressional investigators are examining whether Michael Flynn, Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, secretly promoted a plan by private business interests to build US-Russian nuclear power plants in the Middle East while he was serving in the White House. The retired three-star general, who once led a chant of “lock her up” against Hillary Clinton at the Republican national convention, has emerged as a central figure in multiple investigations into possible collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign. Among startling new details unearthed by investigators working for a congressional committee is that the nuclear power plan Flynn was allegedly secretly promoting, during the campaign and once he joined the White House, involved a Russian state-owned company currently under US sanctions. They are also examining whether the proposal is still being promoted by the Trump administration, months after Flynn was forced out of his role. A letter released on Wednesday by top Democrats who are investigating Flynn, who was forced to resign from his post in February because of questions about his links to Russia, accused him of violating federal law when he failed to disclose a trip he took to the Middle East in June 2015 to promote the US-Russia project, as well as several contacts with foreigners that they allege ought to have been declared. The lawmakers said the apparent disclosure violations carried a penalty of five years in prison and that new information they had discovered over the course of their ongoing investigation into the US-Russia project had been provided to Robert Mueller, the special counsel who is leading a federal investigation into whether Trump campaign officials colluded with the Kremlin in the 2016 election. Omissions of such meetings and trips could emerge as a powerful tool for federal investigators, who can use the threat of jail and other penalties to persuade subjects who are under investigation to cooperate in exchange for leniency. The congressional letter states that Flynn refused to provide the committee with any explanation of the trip, but did not deny allegations that the Middle East trip and other foreign contacts had been omitted from his security clearance renewal application in 2016, and concealed from investigators who were conducting a background check on him. It said that consulting groups that were allegedly working with Flynn on the project, X-Co Dynamics and ACU Strategic Partners, provided information to the committee and are being asked to provide more documents. There is no suggestion that either company is under investigaiton. The letter also alleges that Thomas Cochran of ACU, who provided the congressional investigators with some information, said that even after Flynn was fired from his post, the proposal the retired general promoted continued to be seen as part of the Trump administration’s diplomatic “toolkit”. Cochran said that he believed it was seen by both the US president and the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, as a “valuable private sector mechanism” for stabilising and improving relations with Russia. The joint project was also seen as a way to accelerate US-Russia cooperation in the Middle East. A copy of the letter, which was sent by Democratic congressmen Elijah Cummings and Eliot Engel to individuals who allegedly worked with Flynn on the proposal, reveals stunning new allegations about Flynn’s contacts with foreign business associates, all of which were allegedly kept from public view while he was serving as the nation’s chief intelligence official in the White House. At the heart of the investigation lies a proposal that was allegedly developed by Flynn and others before the 2016 election campaign to create a US-Russian partnership that would build and operate nuclear power plants in the Middle East. The committee said it had confirmed from three sources that, as part of this plan, Flynn travelled to Egypt and Israel in June 2015 to promote the project, where he met with government officials. According to Cochran, an official at ACU Strategic Partners, which worked on the project, Flynn made the trip in part to argue that the plan he was proposing would be in Israel’s best interests. The plan called for the creation of an international consortium of US, French, Dutch, Russian, Gulf Arab, British, Ukrainian, and Israeli companies to design and build 40 nuclear power reactors. The plan included a service to maintain control of dangerous spent fuel. One slide provided to the committee said that Rosoboron, a Russian state-owned weapons exporter that is under US sanctions, would provide “total regional security” for the project. Two email chains about the project that were provided to the committee were said to show that Flynn and others were in communication with Omar al-Khaldi, a major general and the chief executive of the design and development bureau of Jordan’s King Abdullah. Lawmakers said they had received no specific information about the identity of foreign government officials that Flynn communicated with before, during, or after his trip. Investigators are also still investigating the names of other Trump campaign officials who allegedly discussed the project with Flynn. The lawmakers said they were seeking all documents and communications from the two consultancy groups who were working on the project that refer to Flynn’s foreign travel and meetings with foreigners."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/25/turkey-election-victory-propels-erdoganelite-club-strongman-leaders","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T07:39:00Z","webTitle":"Victory propels Erdoğan into elite club of strongman leaders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/25/turkey-election-victory-propels-erdoganelite-club-strongman-leaders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/25/turkey-election-victory-propels-erdoganelite-club-strongman-leaders","fields":{"headline":"Victory propels Erdoğan into elite club of strongman leaders","bodyText":"Outright victory in the first round of Turkey’s presidential elections has propelled Recep Tayyip Erdoğan into the foremost rank of global strongman leaders in the style of Russia’s Vladimir Putin, China’s Xi Jinping and Egypt’s Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. But his unchecked political dominance may mark the beginning of a new dark age for Turkish democracy. Erdoğan’s triumphantly aggressive acceptance speech from the balcony of the Ankara headquarters of his neo-Islamist Justice and Development party (AKP) set an ominous tone. He vowed to continue to “fight decisively” against Turkey’s enemies at home and abroad, as defined by him. “We never bow down in front of anyone except God,” he declared. Erdoğan had no kind words for his defeated challengers. He offered no olive branch to the roughly 47% of the electorate that did not back him or his AKP-led parliamentary alliance. Given his daunting record since 2003, vanquished rivals have cause to fear political payback once the dust settles. Retribution is something Erdoğan excels at. Now it will be even easier as he assumes the quasi-dictatorial powers of executive president that were narrowly agreed in a referendum last year. These give him personal authority to appoint and dismiss ministers, dissolve parliament, issue decrees, appoint judges, direct the armed forces and declare war. Although Erdoğan has promised to lift the state of emergency imposed after 2016’s failed coup, it seems improbable thousands of Kurdish activists and MPs, lawyers, civil servants, judges and journalists who remain in detention will be released soon. About 160,000 people were arrested or sacked in the year after the coup. As in past elections, there were suspicions of fraud, particularly regarding the unexpectedly strong showing of Erdoğan’s ally Devlet Bahçeli’s Nationalist Movement party (MHP). The main opposition, the Republican People’s party (CHP), complained during the count that results were being declared before ballots were fully counted. In a strange twist, a pro-government television station accidentally aired election “results” showing an Erdoğan victory three days before Sunday’s polls. A report by the Oda TV news website claimed the station screened figures supposedly provided by the state news agency giving Erdoğan 53% of the vote and his CHP challenger, Muharrem İnce, 26%. In the event, Erdoğan officially won 53% on Sunday and İnce 31%. Prior to the election, unidentified Turkish security sources accused the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which sent monitors to observe the polls, of plotting to create a “shady perception” of the process. Some European monitors were banned. On Sunday, Turkey’s best-known independent newspaper, Cumhuriyet, whose journalists have been repeatedly harassed, said its website had suffered an unexplained distributed denial of service attack. But while İnce complained that the election was unfair, and state media biased, the defeated opposition’s protests seemed half-hearted. No official fraud investigation is expected – or indeed possible, unless Erdoğan orders it. Nor will he take any notice of anything the OSCE monitors may say. Instead, he warned critics not to challenge the results. One bright point for the anti-Erdoğan camp was the achievement of the pro-Kurdish HDP in passing the 10% threshold for parliamentary representation, even though its de facto leader, Selahattin Demirtaş, was forced to campaign from a jail cell. The AKP had its parliamentary wings clipped. It will rely on Bahçeli’s MHP for a majority – a marriage of convenience that will not necessarily endure over the next five years. Erdoğan’s reincarnation as a modern-day Ottoman sultan will be viewed with trepidation across the region and in Europe. But Putin, will be content. Despite bilateral strains early in the Syrian war, Moscow and Ankara have been drawing closer to one another, helped by Russian advanced missile sales and a joint nuclear power station building programme with Rosatom. Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, will not be wholly displeased, either. Although Erdoğan broke with him soon after the war began in 2011, his priority in Syria now is to curb the influence of Syrian and Iraqi Kurdish forces along the shared border, not regime change. Erdoğan can be expected to continue his alliance with Russia and Iran, in the teeth of US and Nato objections. In his acceptance speech, he also signalled a renewed military drive against Kurdish militants in south-east Turkey. This threatens to produce a repeat of the bloody events that followed the June 2015 elections. Likewise, Erdoğan will pursue his obsessive vendetta with the “terrorist organisation” of his bete noir, the exiled cleric Fethullah Gülen. His re-election is not the outcome most EU countries would have hoped for. They deplore his human rights abuses, his subversion of democratic institutions, and his perceived efforts to overturn Turkey’s secular tradition. But Europe needs Turkey’s help with its immigration and terrorism problems, so will keep mum. Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s rightwing prime minister, is an exception. He was the first foreign leader to send congratulations. People like Orbán, Putin – and Donald Trump – see in Erdoğan an unscrupulous strongman like themselves: ultra-nationalist, unilateralist, populist – and utterly ruthless.

The number of battery-powered cars on Britain’s roads will grow from around 120,000 today to 10m by 2035 and pass the 17m mark five years later, predicted Aurora Energy Research. If those millions of drivers return home from work and charge their cars immediately during the peak hours of 4-6pm, that would add around 3GW, the equivalent capacity of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, to peak power demand. The report said the alternative to that “dumb” scenario is “smart” charging, where car owners are encouraged to use cheaper tariffs at off-peak times or relinquish control of their charging to an energy firm. That scenario would add just 0.5GW of peak demand. “There are many scare stories out there suggesting our power system cannot cope with the growth in electric vehicles. On the contrary, our research suggests that, provided EV charging is smart, the GB power system can easily accommodate 15m-plus electric cars,” said Richard Howard, head of research at Aurora. He said the extra peak demand in a smart world was an insignificant increase, but it could not be taken for granted that motorists would change their habits. “You need to have the technology in place and suppliers offering tariffs and behavioural change. There is also a role for government,” he said. Smart charging could help drivers’ wallets too, costing them £110 a year to power their car by exploiting cheaper times of day, versus £280 for charging at peak times. Howard admitted that most chargers today are “dumb” and the technology for smart charging will not arrive for the next two to three years, but said he was confident that it would happen. “To an extent it’s fine [that it’s dumb] because there’s still only 120,000 electric cars on the road. But when you get to millions you have to have it right, and normalise it from the start.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/10/fukushima-residents-win-500m-yen-payout-over-nuclear-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-10T10:14:24Z","webTitle":"Fukushima residents win 500m yen payout over nuclear disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/10/fukushima-residents-win-500m-yen-payout-over-nuclear-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/10/fukushima-residents-win-500m-yen-payout-over-nuclear-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima residents win 500m yen payout over nuclear disaster","bodyText":"A court in Japan has ordered the government and the operator of the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant to pay 500m yen (£3.37m) in damages to residents affected by the March 2011 triple meltdown. The ruling by the Fukushima district court follows an earlier decision that also found the government accountable for the disaster, in which large quantities of radiation was released and tens of thousands of people were forced to flee their homes. The class action lawsuit, involving 3,800 plaintiffs, is the largest of about 30 similar cases filed by 12,000 Fukushima residents who say their lives were adversely affected by the triple meltdown and its aftermath. In March, a court ruled for the first time that negligence by the state contributed to the events at Fukushima Daiichi, the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl 25 years earlier. Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), which ran the plant when it was struck by a powerful earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011, has been ordered to pay damages in all three court rulings to date. The plaintiffs, who included Fukushima residents who were not told to evacuate, will each receive up to 360,000 yen, according to the verdict. The court rejected a demand for monthly compensation of 55,000 yen until radiation at the plaintiffs’ homes has fallen to pre-disaster levels. The cases hinge on whether the government and Tepco could have foreseen the disaster, which knocked out the plant’s cooling systems and destroyed backup generators that could have been used to prevent the fuel melting in three of its six reactors. The court in Fukushima said the government had failed to order Tepco to improve safety measures, despite being aware almost a decade earlier that Japan’s north-east coast, where the plant is located, was at risk of a powerful tsunami. The plaintiffs based their claim on a 2002 report in which government experts estimated there was a one in five chance of a magnitude 8 earthquake occurring and triggering a tsunami of up to 15.7 metres in height within the next 30 years. The court upheld the plaintiffs’ claims that the meltdown could have been prevented if the ministry responsible for Japan’s nuclear power industry had ordered Tepco to move emergency diesel generators from the plant’s basement to higher ground and make the reactor buildings watertight. The government and Tepco argued that there was no way they could have predicted a tsunami as powerful as the one that destroyed large swaths of coastline, and described the accident as unavoidable. Almost seven years after the disaster, more than 50,000 evacuees are still living in limbo. Many say they will never be able to return home, although some have moved back to communities where the government has lifted evacuation orders. • Agencies contributed to this report."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/15/saudi-arabia-iran-nuclear-bomb-threat-mohammed-bin-salman","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-15T21:11:50Z","webTitle":"Saudi crown prince warns it will build nuclear bomb if Tehran does the same","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/15/saudi-arabia-iran-nuclear-bomb-threat-mohammed-bin-salman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/15/saudi-arabia-iran-nuclear-bomb-threat-mohammed-bin-salman","fields":{"headline":"Saudi crown prince warns it will build nuclear bomb if Tehran does the same","bodyText":"Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has set out plans for Saudi Arabia to develop nuclear weapons if Tehran makes the same move in the event of a collapse of the international nuclear deal signed in 2015. The prospect of a Middle East nuclear arms race will unnerve European leaders who are urging Donald Trump to retain the Iran nuclear deal which imposed strict curbs on the Iranian nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. The Saudi crown prince is due in Washington on Monday, and is pressing the US to give it the reserved right to enrich uranium in return for Saudi Arabia choosing American nuclear technology. “Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb, but without a doubt, if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible,” bin Salman told CBS television. Saudi Arabia wants initially to build two nuclear stations as part of its medium term program to wean itself off oil. It plans to build 16 civil nuclear stations over 20 to 25 years generating 16 gigawats of nuclear energy. Although Saudi Arabia stresses it wants nuclear technology only for peaceful uses, it has left unclear whether it also wants to enrich uranium to produce nuclear fuel, a process which can be used in the production of atomic weapons. US administration officials have already met bin Salman in London to discuss the terms of a deal. Iran immediately hit back at the prince’s comments. “These words are worthless ... because they come from a simple mind full of illusions who speaks only bitterness and lies,” said Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi. Saudi Arabia, like Trump is a fierce opponent of the Iran nuclear deal, and US officials were due to meet their EU counterparts in Berlin on Thursday to discuss how to resolve their differences over whether the deal can be rescued. Trump has given the EU until 12 May to come up with revisions to the deal, or see him pull out, reimposing full blown economic sanctions and provoking a full scale crisis with Tehran. The EU signatories to the deal – UK, France and Germany – want to retain the deal, but are willing to discuss a supplementary memorandum that would seek to contain Iran’s ballistic missile program, one of Trump’s criticisms of the deal. Iran insists its ballistic program is separate to the 2015 deal. A range of countries including Russia, the US, the UK, France and Japan have been offering to partner with Saudi’s nuclear plans, putting the crown prince in a position to negotiate with the US on any restrictions covering uranium enrichment rights in exchange for US nuclear support. Reactors need uranium enriched to around 5% purity but the same technology in this process can also be used to enrich the heavy metal to a higher, weapons-grade level. Simon Henderson, a Saudi expert at the Washington Institute for Near East said: “Can Saudi Arabia be persuaded to forsake, perhaps even temporarily, enrichment and reprocessing in return for choosing US technology for its ambitious nuclear power plans? The wrong business deal could undermine the current fragile status quo and elevate regional antagonisms to a new level”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jul/20/97-of-house-republicans-foolishly-reject-carbon-taxes","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-20T10:00:03Z","webTitle":"97% of House Republicans foolishly reject carbon taxes | Dana Nuccitelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jul/20/97-of-house-republicans-foolishly-reject-carbon-taxes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jul/20/97-of-house-republicans-foolishly-reject-carbon-taxes","fields":{"headline":"97% of House Republicans foolishly reject carbon taxes","bodyText":"Yesterday, the House of Representatives voted on an anti-carbon tax Resolution. The Resolution was introduced by Steve Scalise (R-LA) with essentially the same language as he introduced in 2013 and 2016. On those past versions, every Republican House member voted against carbon taxes. This time, six Republicans rejected the Resolution and one abstained, voting ‘Present.’ However, 97% of the House Republicans on the floor voted against carbon taxes. House Democrats have been fairly consistent in their votes on these Resolutions as well. In 2013, 94% voted against the Resolution, and in 2016 and 2018, 96% voted ‘Nay,’ with six to seven pro-fossil fuel Democrats voting ‘Yes.’ The Resolution is wrong – carbon taxes can be good for the economy The text of the Resolution claims that carbon taxes are necessarily bad for America: Expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy … [and] to American families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States. This week’s Resolution ironically came right on the heels of a comprehensive study showing that a carbon tax whose revenues were returned to taxpayers either via rebate checks or by offsetting income taxes would have a negligible impact on the economy – significantly less than the cost of unchecked global warming. In fact, research has shown that it’s global warming that will seriously slow economic growth. Simply put, the only way to protect the economy is to stop global warming. Accomplishing that will require that virtually every world country implement climate policies aimed at curbing carbon pollution. That was the purpose of the Paris climate accords. Disgracefully, the Trump administration made America the only country in the world whose leadership rejects that international climate agreement. But a carbon tax would be one of the most effective and efficient ways to cut America’s carbon pollution. The text of the Resolution has it exactly backwards – a carbon tax would help protect the American economy by slowing global warming and its detrimental effects on economic growth. Cracks in the Republican anti-climate wall Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL) Executive Director Mark Reynolds characterized yesterday’s vote as progress, saying: The fact that six Republicans voted ‘no’ on an anti-carbon tax resolution is an indication that there are cracks in the wall separating Democrats and Republicans on climate change. At the CCL blog, Flannery Winchester also noted that the number of co-sponsors on Scalise’s Resolutions dropped from 155 in 2013, to 82 in 2016, to just 48 in 2018. That’s a nearly 70% decline over five years and an encouraging sign that the number of vehement anti-carbon tax members of Congress is dwindling. Given that the share of the Republican vote against carbon taxes only dropped from 100% in 2016 to 97% in 2018, the cracks are still small, but a crack is better than an unyielding wall of denial. Nevertheless, it’s frustrating that just four of the 43 Republican members of the Climate Solutions Caucus voted against the Resolution (with one more abstaining by voting ‘Present’). Especially given the conditions under which yesterday’s vote happened: Most 2018 primary elections are over, so Republican members of Congress don’t need to worry about challenges from the right-wing for another two years. Climate Solutions Caucus leader Carlos Curbelo (R-FL) plans to introduce a carbon tax bill next week. CCL volunteers lobbied their members of Congress to vote against the Resolution. 62% of Trump voters support taxing and/or regulating carbon pollution. This was a non-binding Resolution that wrongly suggested carbon taxes are necessarily bad. It really should have been an easy ‘Nay’ vote, and yet only a handful of Republicans voted the right way. Climate Solutions Caucus member Darrell Issa (R-CA) explained his ‘Yes’ vote, saying a “carbon tax isn’t the solution” and that the Caucus should focus on policies that can generate bipartisan support, like energy efficiency programs and keeping nuclear power plants open. Those are indeed valid climate policies. They’re also wholly insufficient to tackle global warming, and if Republicans can only support inadequate climate policies, they’re unbefitting the role of governance. The fossil fuel industry still owns the GOP The cracks in the wall should be much bigger by now. A new study by Robert Brulle identified why the CCL volunteer lobbying on this Resolution was relatively ineffective: Professional lobbying organizations are a permanent presence on Capitol Hill. Thus, the vast expenditures and continuous presence of professional lobbyists limit the impact of volunteer climate advocates. Brulle found that over $2bn has been spent lobbying Congress on climate change legislation since 2000 (an average of $125m per year). And an analysis by the Center for American Progress found that in 2009–2010 leading up to a vote on a cap and trade bill, the fossil fuel industry spent over $500m lobbying against it. In Washington DC, money talks, as Brulle noted: We seem to have a public opinion fetish where if we get public opinion to be supportive of climate change legislation, then it’ll happen. My answer to that is, gee, well, we should have gun control legislation then. Solution: vote them out Fortunately, Americans have an opportunity to remedy this problem in less than four months, when every House member will be up for election in the 2018 midterms. If we agree that climate change poses an existential threat (it does), that this should have been an easy ‘Nay’ vote, and that Republican members of Congress are beholden to the fossil fuel industry rather than voter preferences, then the answer is simple. In November, Americans should replace all members of Congress who voted in favor of the Resolution and who face opponents that aren’t in bed with the fossil fuel industry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/16/kim-jong-un-the-story-of-the-boy-dictator-who-bested-the-us-president","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T23:00:29Z","webTitle":"Kim Jong-un: The story of the boy dictator who bested the US president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/16/kim-jong-un-the-story-of-the-boy-dictator-who-bested-the-us-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/16/kim-jong-un-the-story-of-the-boy-dictator-who-bested-the-us-president","fields":{"headline":"Kim Jong-un: The story of the boy dictator who bested the US president","bodyText":"Kim Jong-un was never destined to rule North Korea. It was never preordained he would be the one to accelerate the isolated nation’s nuclear weapons program, and force the US president, Donald Trump, to sit down for a meeting of equals. But through a combination of ruthless ambition and luck, Kim achieved what no other leader of North Korea has, recognition as the head of a nuclear power and international statesman. The boy dictator went head-to-head with Trump and won. Kim Jong-nam, Kim Jong-un’s older half brother, was widely seen as next in line but fell out of favour in 2001 when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake passport so he could visit Tokyo Disneyland. Shortly after this incident, Kim began being groomed for senior leadership, attending the top officer training school in Pyongyang. When Kim came to power it was not so much his father’s shoes he slipped into as his grandfather’s. Where Kim’s father was a recluse who shunned public attention, the young leader is outgoing, frequently photographed embracing ordinary citizens, a broad smile across his face. Where Kim Jong-il would pen a New Year’s editorial, Kim Jong-un delivers a speech broadcast on television. “He’s much more willing to take risks than previous leaders, and he has shown a new side of admitting fault. That’s a whole different attitude that we haven’t seen before,” says Jenny Town, the managing editor of monitoring group 38 North. “Ultimately, these high-level summits, with the US and China, after all the war talk and the suffering the people endured, shows that in the end world leaders are treating North Korea as an equal, and that plays well domestically.” His sister, Kim Yo-jong, is a senior official in the Propaganda and Agitation Department and has reportedly worked to craft an image that evokes the revolutionary leader. In the beginning there was violence The early days of Kim’s rule were brutal. As he sought to consolidate power at the age of 27 in a society that reveres age, he purged those who he felt could be a threat. Kim’s uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who handled relations with China, North Korea’s closest ally, was publicly arrested in the middle of a Workers party meeting and executed. Kim would later be accused of ordering the assassination of his older brother in the Kuala Lumpur airport in February 2017. Public executions of military officers increased under Kim, according to North Koreans who escaped the country. He has also done nothing to dismantle the massive system of political prisons, which the United Nations says house as many as 120,000 people and is guilty of crimes against humanity. But he did break with his father in one crucial aspect. The elder Kim for years had pushed a military-first policy, or songun, where North Korea’s limited resources were foremost allocated to its costly nuclear weapons program. Kim Jong-un altered that formula and placed economic development on a par with weapons development. A construction boom in Pyongyang followed and when Kim declared at the beginning of the year North Korea had completed its nuclear force, analysts say it was a signal the economy would now be Kim’s priority. His meeting with Trump was the apex of that risk-taking behaviour. He left North Korea at a predetermined time, raising the possibility of domestic instability in his absence, but the reward for the summit was too good to pass up. World tour beckons “The goal for Kim Jong-un now is to get economic support, in terms of financial flows, blunting sanctions, and attracting investment in the special economic zones,” said Scott Snyder, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. There are likely to be summits with more world leaders, including Russian president Vladimir Putin and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, to “further Kim’s standing as an international statesman”, Snyder added. Even if Kim agrees to dismantle rocket testing facilities, as Trump has claimed, it would probably only scratch the surface, according to Snyder. There are signs that Washington’s “maximum pressure” policy is already cracking under Kim’s diplomatic push. China, which accounts for over 90% of trade with the North, is reportedly relaxing its enforcement of sanctions and South Korean companies are eager to begin investing. All of this has validated Kim’s strategy of taking big gambles, since each one has so far paid off. Kim gained legitimacy in his meeting with Trump, while the US walked away with a vague commitment that North Korea has said before, only to reverse course later. The document Trump and Kim signed, in the midst of a great deal of theatrics, confirmed positions North Korea has been espousing for years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/mar/29/will-self-on-walberswick-it-used-to-be-a-place-to-drop-acid-with-hippies-on-permanent-vacation-","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-29T10:00:14Z","webTitle":"Will Self on Walberswick: ‘It was a place to drop acid with hippies on permanent vacation’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/29/will-self-on-walberswick-it-used-to-be-a-place-to-drop-acid-with-hippies-on-permanent-vacation-","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/mar/29/will-self-on-walberswick-it-used-to-be-a-place-to-drop-acid-with-hippies-on-permanent-vacation-","fields":{"headline":"Will Self on Walberswick: ‘It was a place to drop acid with hippies on permanent vacation’","bodyText":"My father was friends with a remarkable woman called Francesca Wilson, who, besides being one of the first women to graduate from Cambridge University, worked at the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Francesca had a ramshackle cottage in Walberswick, a village on the Suffolk coast where we went for holidays when I was a child and which had a reputation for being mildly raffish and bohemian dating back to the interwar period. Other early adopters included members of the extended Freud family, and Eric Blair’s parents settled for retirement in adjoining Southwold, which is why the writer took his nom de plume from the nearby River Orwell. This part of the Suffolk coast is a low-lying landscape of sandy heathland and reedy marshes. Along the shingly shore from Walberswick you reach the remains of Dunwich, a large port in the medieval period, that long since slid beneath the erosive waves. And beyond, the great greige concrete block of the Sizewell nuclear power station. When my first marriage broke up in the early 1990s, I went back to live near Sizewell, looking for the bucolical and the peace to write, but also in search of the lost times of the late 1960s and early 70s, when I had come to a certain kind of consciousness in these weird environs. I say weird, because Creek Cottage – as Francesca’s establishment was known – came complete with its own hermit: an architect who’d had a nervous breakdown and read me passages from the Diamond Sutra over green tea. Weird, also, because if you walked along the creek from the cottage, after you’d passed the kids crab fishing with strings baited with bacon, you might well sight a coypu or two – strange giant South American rodents that had escaped from captivity and found a home in the marshes. And weird because the social ecology of Walberswick – when I look back at it now – seems redolent of those permissive times, when boundaries of all sorts were being broken willy-nilly. The inconceivably long and sunny days I spent running wild with other holidaying kids merged, subtly, with the inconceivably long and sunny days I spent dropping acid with hippies on permanent vacation. At some point, I stopped going to Walberswick with my parents – instead, I hitchhiked up the A12 from London, and camped on the beach by myself. Here I met Bob, an ex-RAF man, grown exceedingly hairy, who taught me how to shoot a rabbit with a .22 airgun, gut it, and jug it, together with beach-combed samphire grass in an old biscuit tin buried beneath a beach fire. After we’d eaten the rabbit stew, we’d snaffle down acid blotters and look up at the crystal of the darkening empyrean, while Bob acted as our guide, taking our astral bodies on walks through the village. Returning 25 years later, Walberswick’s air of raffish bohemianism had given way to Boden-catalogue embourgeoisification. WG Sebald’s anonymous alter ego passes this way in The Rings of Saturn, and, confronted with the monstrous solecism of a new gastro pub, I felt just as disembodied.

The government has promised the developers of small modular reactors a slice of a £250m funding pot in a race to position the UK as the place where the first generation of the power stations should be built. Polling by YouGov, however, believed to be the first survey of public attitudes towards the plants, found that 62% of people would be unhappy living within five miles of one. The poll, commissioned by the climate change charity 10:10, found that only 24% would be unhappy living near an onshore windfarm, which the Conservative party has stymied with tougher planning rules. The figure fell to 17% for community-owned windfarms. Ellie Roberts, a campaigner at 10:10, said: “These results show just how wildly out of step with public opinion UK energy policy has become.” Most small modular reactors (SMRs) would generate less than a tenth of the power the projected Hinkley Point C will provide, but are backed by industry as a cheaper option to big nuclear plants and an opportunity for British firms to be first in a new technology. The government’s multimillion-pound competition to help build the first one in the UK has, however, been repeatedly delayed. Ministers are expected to lay out their intentions later this autumn. Rolls-Royce, Britain’s leading multinational manufacturer, last week added to pressure on the government to give industry clarity on its plans for the mini nuclear power stations. Harry Holt, the president of nuclear at Rolls-Royce, said: “With demand for energy set to rise in the near future, in part due to the growing popularity of electric cars, we believe that a UK SMR programme is a vital addition to our national infrastructure.” The company predicted that once the reactor had been built, future ones could at some point after 2028 be built for a subsidy price of £60 per megawatt hour of power they supplied. Offshore windfarms to be built in 2022-23 recently secured a price of £57.50 per megawatt hour, a record low in the level of state support they require."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/oct/07/how-green-is-britains-low-carbon-energy-supply","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-07T15:19:47Z","webTitle":"How green is Britain’s record on renewable energy supply?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/07/how-green-is-britains-low-carbon-energy-supply","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/oct/07/how-green-is-britains-low-carbon-energy-supply","fields":{"headline":"How green is Britain’s record on renewable energy supply?","bodyText":"As one of the UK’s renewable energy chiefs has pointed out, electric cars won’t tackle climate change if they run off fossil fuels. Matthew Wright, managing director of Dong Energy UK, said that although plug-in cars could cut local air pollution, it would be a “pyrrhic victory” if they increased greenhouse gases from coal and gas power stations. “The fit between renewable energy and electric is a natural [one],” he argued. E.ON, one of the big-six energy suppliers, agrees: its dedicated new electric car tariff is supplied with 100% renewable power. Put simply, the greener the electricity mix, the greener your electric car. Today, around half of power generated in the UK comes from low-carbon sources. Here’s how that breaks down, and how it might look in the future. Wind Nearly a third of the UK’s electricity between April and June was generated from renewable sources – a new record, and up a quarter on the same period last year. The milestone was driven in large part by the growing number of windfarms on land and around the UK’s coast. It also helped that wind speeds were relatively high and overall electricity generation was lower than normal. The records have continued into autumn. Last Sunday night was the perfect time to plug in a car, as the carbon emissions from power generation were at their lowest level ever, because of windfarms. Offshore windfarms have been making headlines as well as power, securing record low levels of state support in a government auction last month. Three major offshore farms will be built in the early 2020s for a subsidy price well below nuclear, and half what the technology cost just a few years ago. The UK has more offshore wind power capacity than any other country in the world, and is helping set records in Europe too. Last Monday, Europe generated a new high of 263 gigawatt hours of power from offshore turbines, 95GWh of which came from the UK. Some industry-watchers think that offshore windfarms, where larger and more efficient turbines are driving costs down fast, could become so cheap that they eventually outcompete their onshore counterparts in Britain, too. But for now, those on land still provide 50% more power than those at sea. Solar The number of solar panels in the UK grew at a dizzying rate between 2011 and 2016, and now provide a significant source of power in the middle of the day. Solar is a large reason the national grid went without coal power for 24 hours in April, the first time the UK had done without the dirty fuel for a day since the industrial revolution. For one brief period on a Friday in May, solar even eclipsed the UK’s eight nuclear power stations for electricity generation. However, the outlook for the next five years is cloudier. Experts forecast the amount of solar installed will be a fifth of the capacity fitted in the past five years. Nuclear Nuclear power stations usually provide between a fifth and a quarter of the UK’s power, taking a 23.6% share during April and June. EDF, which is building Britain’s first new nuclear station in decades at Hinkley Point in Somerset, thinks that by 2035, nuclear’s share should grow to around a third of UK power supply. In the French state-owned firm’s vision of the future, another third will come from renewables and the last third from gas. Together, EDF sees the three as the best way of achieving reliable, affordable and low-carbon power. But seven of the UK’s eight existing nuclear power stations, which began generating electricity in the 1970s and 1980s, are expected to come off the grid late next decade. That means for atomic power to supply a third of the UK’s needs, Hinkley Point C will need to be finished on time, and three more plants of a similar size will need to be built. One of those could be by EDF itself, at Sizewell in Suffolk, if it can build the reactors for a subsidy price low enough that the government would agree it. EDF is also supporting a Chinese nuclear company, CGN, which is at the start of a four-year process to get regulatory approval for a plant at Bradwell, in Essex. Other international consortia are hoping to build a plant at Wylfa in Wales and Moorside in Cumbria. Biomass Although environmentalists dispute the idea that wood-burning is green at all, it is still officially considered low-carbon by the UK and EU. The UK’s biggest power station, Drax in North Yorkshire, has already converted three of its six units from coal to biomass, and is exploring switching a fourth. Later this year, an old coal power plant at Lynemouth in Northumberland is also slated to reopen as a biomass power station."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jan/15/uk-and-france-may-drift-apart-after-brexit-warns-former-ambassador","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-15T00:01:40Z","webTitle":"UK and France may drift apart after Brexit, warns former ambassador","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/15/uk-and-france-may-drift-apart-after-brexit-warns-former-ambassador","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jan/15/uk-and-france-may-drift-apart-after-brexit-warns-former-ambassador","fields":{"headline":"UK and France may drift apart after Brexit, warns former ambassador","bodyText":"Britain and France are in danger of drifting apart as a result of Brexit, undermining defence and security cooperation, according to Lord Ricketts, a former UK national security adviser and former ambassador to France. In order to counter this, the UK and France will have to work harder at the relationship, stepping up bilateral meetings, he says. Ricketts, who was ambassador from 2012 to 2016, issued the warning in a paper for the London-based defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, published on Monday. He was speaking before a security summit on Thursday between Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron at the Sandhurst military academy. Both the UK and France have said they are intent on maintaining as close a relationship as possible on defence, foreign policy and security issues after Brexit, but the strains are showing already, with Macron in September pushing for a common EU intervention force, defence budget and doctrine. Ricketts acknowledges that the UK, which sees Nato rather than the EU as the main focus of European defence, would have found Macron’s proposal “uncomfortable” if the UK had remained in the EU. Ricketts, who served as national security adviser, permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, chairman of the joint intelligence committee and representative to Nato, says: “Brexit will not weaken the case for close UK-French defence and security cooperation but it will change the context and create the risk of the two countries drifting apart.” Cooperation on counterterrorism and cyber threats has “become even closer in response to recent terrorist attacks. It is crucial that Brexit does not adversely affect this”, he added. He proposed deployment of a combined British-French joint expeditionary force in some troublespots and working together on military equipment projects. They could also develop cooperation on nuclear weapons, given “a more aggressive Russia, the emergence of North Korea as a nuclear power and the uncertainties about the longer-term US commitment to Nato following President Trump’s hesitations over reaffirming article 5”, Nato’s collective security pledge that an attack on one is an attack on all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2019/apr/28/britain-america-history-special-relationship-highs-and-lows-churchill-to-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2019-04-28T08:00:07Z","webTitle":"Love, hate … indifference: is US-UK relationship still special?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/28/britain-america-history-special-relationship-highs-and-lows-churchill-to-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2019/apr/28/britain-america-history-special-relationship-highs-and-lows-churchill-to-trump","fields":{"headline":"Love, hate … indifference: is US-UK relationship still special?","bodyText":"Donald Trump’s three-day state visit in early June, confirmed last week, will place unique strains on the so-called “special relationship” between the US and Britain – or so it is claimed. The 45th US president is undoubtedly a divisive figure. Polls suggest three quarters of Britons object to his policies and personal behaviour. Like a boorish house guest, Trump seems to delight in upsetting his hosts. Yet controversial visits by US presidents are nothing new. Ronald Reagan encountered furious protests in 1982 after a decision – agreed with Margaret Thatcher – to deploy nuclear-armed cruise missiles at British bases. George W Bush faced a similarly hostile reception when he came to stay at Buckingham Palace in 2003, months after invading Iraq. It was not always this way. When newly elected John F Kennedy flew in with his glamorous young wife, Jackie, in 1961, half a million people lined the route from London airport to catch a glimpse of the Camelot fairytale. In 1977, Jimmy Carter visited George Washington’s ancestral home in the north-east. To ecstatic applause, the peanut farmer from Georgia told the people of Newcastle: “I am a Geordie now.” These contrasting high and lows accurately reflect the inherent vagaries of a relationship that has rarely run as smoothly as politicians on both sides of the Atlantic often pretend. It is a relationship born in conflict: the 1775-83 American war of independence. There were more clashes of arms and interests in the 19th century. During the 1861-65 American civil war, Britain’s prime minister, Lord Palmerston, who viewed the US as a future imperial rival, hoped the confederate rebels would break the union. In the modern era, the relationship has been shaped by two mutually reinforcing trends: the steady expansion of US global power, and the decline and fall of the British empire. This evolution was accelerated decisively by the two world wars, which left Britain exhausted and indebted – and confirmed the American ascendancy. Britain’s standing, in 1900, as the world’s leading military and economic power was usurped in the space of less than half a century. The story of the post-1945 “special relationship”, a term attributed to Winston Churchill, is really the story of how successive British politicians and diplomats have tried, with mixed success, to guide, cajole and manipulate US leaders from a position of ever-increasing weakness. On the American side, it is a story of hard-headed exploitation of US advantage, rendered more palatable by spurious expressions of undying amity. The historian Max Hastings recalled last year how he warned Theresa May before she took office: “Please do not join the long line of British leaders who delude themselves that the Americans will do us favours.” It was an acknowledgement of a chronically lopsided relationship, propped up by an illusion of equality. But May, he wrote, took no notice. Window-dressing aside, modern US presidents view Britain as a moderately useful client state, junior military partner and gateway to Europe. Americans love the theme park pageantry, royal weddings and Fortnum &amp; Mason. But British prime ministers view the US as an essential, if overbearing, ally. The problem now is that this improbable balancing act, defying the laws of political gravity, is becoming ever harder to sustain. There is another difficulty. Like Britain, the US is changing – ethnically, culturally, politically. America has never been more detached from the anglosphere – English-speaking nations sharing historical links with the UK. This developing phenomenon could be termed Atlantic drift. In this respect, Trump, for all his exceptional awfulness, is merely a symptom of a larger British concern. Winston Churchill &amp; Franklin D Roosevelt For a proud patriot steeped in imperial lore, Churchill was remarkably self-effacing as he strove to enlist the US in Britain’s existential struggle against Nazi Germany. Roosevelt had been re-elected in 1940 on a pledge to keep America out of “Europe’s war”; 80% of Americans wanted no part in it. While sympathetic to Britain’s lonely plight, FDR was determined to restrict US involvement to supplying arms and aid. Churchill tried every tactic he knew to draw the US in. He warned Roosevelt that if Britain were forced to capitulate, the Axis powers would target America next. British agents in Manhattan waged a covert black propaganda and disinformation campaign to discredit American isolationists and appeasers. Churchill sold British assets at knockdown prices and offered leases on overseas military bases in exchange for clapped-out naval destroyers – a fateful step in the transfer of strategic power from Britain to the US. “No lover ever studied every whim of his mistress as I did those of President Roosevelt,” Churchill wrote after the war. Swallowing his pride, he even styled himself a “loyal lieutenant”. But Churchill had no illusions about American altruism. In the darkest hours of 1940-41, he knew Britain needed the US and must pay Roosevelt’s price. In the event, Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, followed by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, finally forced Roosevelt off the fence – not London’s blandishments and threats. Churchill knew then that Britain would survive. America “was up to the neck and in to the death”, he said. As victory neared, Churchill used his influence with Roosevelt to shape the post-war order, binding the US into a new great power system where Britain would remain a pivotal player. The two men co-authored the Atlantic Charter, embodying principles later adopted by the fledgling United Nations. Churchill ensured Britain kept a seat at the top table. He also argued presciently that a strong transatlantic alliance was essential in confronting a new global threat – Stalin’s victorious Soviet Union. Harold Macmillan &amp; John F Kennedy Like Churchill and Roosevelt, Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963, and Kennedy, who became president in 1961 aged 43, were distantly related. The more experienced Macmillan adopted a paternalistic approach, suggesting that, as the ancient Greeks had guided the Romans, so Britain had a duty to advise and counsel the young Caesar in Washington. Kennedy had other ideas. Like Dwight D Eisenhower, whom he succeeded, JFK was committed to a partnership with Europe, not least through Nato, and agreed in principle with the Macmillan-ish idea of the interdependence of the “free world”. But American unilateralism, and the exercise of what was now unmatched American power, were not to be so easily denied. As Britain looked on, Kennedy took the world to the brink of nuclear war in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. In the same year, he abruptly cancelled a joint nuclear weapons programme known as Skybolt. Whitehall was aghast. On Skybolt rested Britain’s hopes of remaining a front-rank nuclear power. Under pressure from Macmillan, Kennedy agreed to sell Polaris missiles to Britain instead. “Jack” and “Mac” got on well personally, with Kennedy boasting to the older man of his sexual conquests and seeking details of the Profumo scandal, according to biographer Christopher Sandford. They succeeded, to a degree, in repairing the huge damage caused by the 1956 Suez crisis, when the US humiliated Macmillan’s predecessor, Anthony Eden. But Suez left a lasting mark, signifying Britain’s increasing weakness and the hollowness of its unrelinquished imperial pretensions. Dean Acheson, Harry S Truman’s secretary of state, had caused lasting hurt with his mocking comment in 1962 that Britain “has lost an empire and has not yet found a role”. His friendship with JFK aside, Macmillan worried about US unreliability. Attempting to hedge Britain’s bets – the first of many such balancing efforts – Macmillan sought to join the European Economic Community, forerunner of the EU. It was a fateful moment. Margaret Thatcher &amp; Ronald Reagan The Labour governments led by Harold Wilson and James Callaghan that preceded Thatcher’s entry into No 10 in 1979 saw some fraught moments in the US relationship. A Soviet defector’s claim that Wilson was a KGB agent was laughed off in Britain, but was reportedly believed by the CIA. Such conspiracy theories fed fears of a US-backed MI5 plot against Wilson and fuelled the anti-Americanism of the British left. Wilson may have had reason to worry. He angered Lyndon B Johnson, Kennedy’s successor, by refusing his request to send troops to Vietnam. Despite its opposition to British colonialism, the US was also critical of Wilson’s “east of Suez” military pullback, believing Britain was not pulling its weight. Wilson, a quietly spoken former Oxford don, and Johnson, a foul-mouthed Texan hustler, did not get on. Wilson’s 1965 attempt to play Vietnam peacemaker infuriated LBJ, who told him to butt out. Thatcher’s arrival in Downing Street, and the personal rapport she established with Reagan, president from 1981, changed the US-Britain power dynamic, though not the underlying realities. The two instinctively conservative leaders shared a strong dislike of the Soviet Union, which Reagan dubbed the “evil empire”, and a passion for free market capitalism. For these “ideological soul-mates”, it was love at first sight. “Your problems will be our problems and when you look for friends we shall be there,” Thatcher cooed. In 1985, celebrating the 200th anniversary of diplomatic relations, she declared: “Our relationship … is special. It just is, and that’s that.” On one occasion, Thatcher was on the phone from London, berating Reagan over his importunate 1983 invasion of Grenada, when he put his hand over the receiver and said: “Gee, isn’t she marvellous!” Mutual admiration did not prevent deadly serious disputes, not least over Reagan’s unhelpful response to Thatcher’s pleas following the 1982 Argentinian invasion of the Falkland islands. Luckily for Thatcher and British forces, Caspar Weinberger, Reagan’s anglophile defence secretary, secretly authorised crucial assistance. But in a sign Britain could still make its voice heard in the Oval Office, Thatcher’s favourable appraisal of the new Russian leader, Mikhail Gorbachev as a man with whom she could “do business” helped to convince the hawkish Reagan that a peaceful end to the cold war was possible. In 1987 Reagan went to Berlin and demanded: “Mr Gorbachev, tear down this wall!” Two years later, Gorbachev complied. Tony Blair &amp; George W Bush The Thatcher-Reagan years marked a high point for the special relationship. The personal chemistry between the two was never quite replicated again. With the end of the cold war, the transatlantic alliance became less vital. China and the Asia-Pacific region were attracting growing US attention. By the mid-1990s, bilateral tensions were on the rise again. Bill Clinton, who became president in 1993, and John Major, prime minister from 1990 to 1997, were very different people, occupying opposite political poles. In a memorable pre-election faux pas, Major had appeared to endorse Clinton’s rival, George HW Bush. They fell out badly over intervention in the Bosnia war. And in 1993, Britain ratified the Maastricht treaty, which created the EU. The treaty increased British involvement in European foreign and security policymaking, separate from the US. Blair’s 1997 victory brought a reset, not least over the Balkans. He and Clinton launched a controversial military adventure in Kosovo in 1999. But it was Blair’s sycophantic embrace of Clinton’s rightwing successor, George W Bush, after the 2001 terror attacks – and specifically his support for the illegal invasion of Iraq – that exposed fundamental misgivings about the subservient nature of Britain’s US ties. If the Iraq gamble had come off, things might have gone differently. But it was a mostly unmitigated disaster. There were numerous casualties – civilian, military and political. One was Blair’s reputation, which never recovered. Another was trust in a now tainted special relationship. Many Britons felt betrayed by the Bush-Blair collusion, to use a topical term. Many Americans felt Blair should have known better, even if Bush didn’t. Iraq also estranged Britain from its main continental allies, France and Germany. Britain was caught between two camps, at odds with both – and this was a sign of worse to come. Theresa May &amp; Donald Trump Succeeding David Cameron in 2016, May inherited a relationship that had cooled significantly during Barack Obama’s presidency. Obama was no anglophile. He held strong views about British colonialism in Kenya, where his father was born, and imperial-era slavery – though he and Michelle enjoyed hobnobbing with the Queen. Unsentimental and cautious, Obama saw Germany, not Britain, as America’s principal European interlocutor. He drew down US forces in Europe, Iraq and Afghanistan, refused to intervene in Syria, and wooed China in a geopolitical “pivot to Asia”. If American disengagement posed a problem for May, it was nothing compared with what was to come. Trump’s 2016 election victory opened up a whole new world of pain. On Russia, Nato, the UN, Israel-Palestine, Iran, trade tariffs, climate change, migrants, Muslims and multilateralism, Trump noisily advanced a position directly at odds with established British beliefs and interests. Trump made plain his disdain for Britain’s world role even as he advertised holidays at his Scottish golf resorts. He patronised and insulted May, unctuously holding her hand when she first visited the White House, publicly criti cising her Brexit performance, and claiming without evidence that GCHQ spied on him. His retweeting of anti-Muslim messages from a British far-right group forced May to issue an embarrassing public rebuke. Trump’s brief visit last year was notable only for his rudeness to the Queen and how the police kept him out of sight of a disgusted British public. June’s high-profile state visit will be different. Security is a real concern. There will be no hiding place for Trump this time. And there will also be no hiding the fact the special relationship that Churchill fought so hard to manufacture is on its last legs. Britain’s 75-year balancing act is close to collapse. Brexit means Europe is no longer a viable strategic alternative to the US alliance, while the US is ceasing to regard Britain as an important European or global player. Trump’s words and actions, and the nationalist and unilateralist forces he represents, suggest the shared values and interests that bound Britain and the US together for 75 years are dissolving. Britain is heading blindly for the void. Perhaps Trump’s and May’s successors can salvage the wreck. But it will require something very special."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/jul/05/nuclear-is-to-wind-as-betamax-is-to-netflix-why-hinkley-point-c-is-a-turkey","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-05T18:44:36Z","webTitle":"Nuclear is to wind as Betamax is to Netflix – why Hinkley Point C is a turkey | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/05/nuclear-is-to-wind-as-betamax-is-to-netflix-why-hinkley-point-c-is-a-turkey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/jul/05/nuclear-is-to-wind-as-betamax-is-to-netflix-why-hinkley-point-c-is-a-turkey","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear is to wind as Betamax is to Netflix – why Hinkley Point C is a turkey","bodyText":"You report (4 July) that the cost of Hinkley C power station has just bumped up £1.5bn, and its completion date slipped 15 months. Notwithstanding, pro-nuclear politicians will assure us that it still represents good value for the consumer, despite the National Audit Office judging it “risky and expensive” (Report, 23 June). Had we invested that £1.5bn in green generation, what might it have bought? At current median project prices of £1.3m per megawatt (MW), we could have had 1,150MW of extra onshore wind turbine capacity. The Digest of UK Energy Statistics onshore wind load factor is 27.3%, therefore that extra hardware would on average generate 314MW of clean electricity, with no risk of reactor meltdowns, and without producing bomb material or the wherewithal for nuclear terrorism. Furthermore, wind turbine projects bring with them well-distributed inward UK investment, installation and maintenance jobs, wayleave revenue for landowners, rates revenue for local authorities, and local community income. They bring home-generated power – without the need for oil wars or fracking, and no damaging balance-of-payments issues. History tells us that this Hinkley cost increase and start delay is only the first of many such announcements; meanwhile, the failure of Toshiba’s nuclear power business surely casts doubt on the viability of even the largest nuclear equipment manufacturers. As almost every other administration quits nuclear power as fast as possible in favour of clean electricity, smart demand response and storage technologies, why are we still backing megalithic, inflexible, economically toxic EDF Betamax? Christopher Jessop Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire • Why do people like Jenifer Baxter of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers automatically respond to the revelation that a nuclear power station is delayed again by arguing that other power stations will need to fill the gap? When Hinkley Point C was initially mooted in 2006, electricity consumption levels were being forecast to increase by over 15% in the ensuing decade, but demand has actually dropped by 15.2% in 10 years. This consumption revolution has been prompted by vastly improved electricity efficiency in industry, in consumer white and brown goods, and in areas like lighting, where household consumption has dropped from 20.7 terrawatt hours (TWh) in 2007 to 14.2TWh this year. The real question is: is all this expenditure on energy supply really necessary? Andrew Warren Chair, British Energy Efficiency Federation • Your report says the head of EDF thought in 2007 that this year’s Christmas turkeys would be cooked by Hinkley Point C electricity.

The biggest driver has been liquefied natural gas, known as LNG. Science and policy institute Climate Analytics found that between 2015 and 2020 the emissions growth from LNG will effectively wipe out the carbon pollution avoided through the 23% renewable energy target. It leaves those watching the industry wondering why it is all but absent from national debates about climate policy – and just how long that can continue. “It’s been incredible that until now this industry has gotten away with being such a massive source of carbon dioxide – and particularly carbon dioxide growth – while barely being acknowledged,” says Piers Verstegen, the director of the Conservation Council of Western Australia. By any measure, LNG is booming. As projects have come online in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, production has tripled since 2012 and doubled in the two years to 2017. It is expected to expand another 18% this year as Australia closes on Qatar for the title of world’s largest LNG producer (though the US is expected to pass them both next decade). The government’s most recent Resources and Energy Quarterly report forecast the value of Australian LNG exports would increase from $31bn in 2017–18 to $48bn in 2019–20. It is already greater than earnings from thermal coal exports. Mass fossil fuel development has a side effect: heat-trapping gas. From a low base, LNG production – counting both fugitive emissions from the well during gas extraction and industrial emissions during processing – now contributes about 5% of national carbon dioxide emissions. That is expected to reach about 7% by 2020 and could hit 17% if all proposals under consideration are fully developed. LNG projects last year emitted roughly the same amount as 8m cars on Australian roads. That’s more than half (56%) of the national fleet. And by 2020, it could be closer to 12m cars, or 86%. Bill Hare, the managing director of Climate Analytics and an adviser to developing countries at United Nations climate negotiations, led an analysis of the WA gas industry earlier this year. He believes the failure to consider the rapid rise in LNG emissions is a problem-in-waiting domestically and internationally. “This industry is now responsible for what is a globally significant increase in emissions,” Hare says. “There will be implications for it under Australia’s commitment to the Paris agreement and there needs to be a plan to deal with that.” What is LNG and why has it grown so rapidly? LNG is natural gas compressed into liquid form so it can be easily and safely shipped. Once it reaches its destination, usually Japan or China, it is decompressed and either burned in power plants or used in industrial processes. The industry says this makes good environmental sense. Gas-fired electricity emits about 50% less carbon dioxide than coal. The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association argues this makes it a good substitute, particularly in Asia, where it can drive economic development and cut emissions. The association points to International Energy Agency (IEA) projections suggesting demand for natural gas will grow. But some analysts say evidence that gas is being substituted for coal is mixed at best, and the argument does not hold when it is substituted for emissions-free nuclear power or preferred to renewable energy. They say cleaner alternatives are becoming cheaper more rapidly than the IEA has forecast. Demand for LNG spiked after the 2011 Fukushima disaster shut down Japan’s nuclear industry, wiping out nearly a third of its generation capacity. Chinese demand was steadily growing about the same time. As global gas prices spiked, there was significant investment in the US and, for the first time, on Australia’s east coast. Three LNG plants at Gladstone started operating from 2014. Two Chevron-led projects in WA, Gorgon and Wheatstone, followed in 2016 and 2017 respectively. The creation of an export gas industry in Queensland had well-publicised ramifications for Australian households and businesses. As more than two-thirds of gas produced on the east coast was exported, domestic gas prices increased at least fourfold, pushing up already skyrocketing electricity prices. Political leaders scrambled to ensure an ongoing domestic supply. The country is now considering plans – much ridiculed in some quarters – to build LNG import terminals in southern states to replace the gas that Australia is selling offshore. While there was much discussion about gas, the emissions from the industry remained largely unmentioned. While it is true that gas burns cleaner than coal and is expected to have a longer life if the world acts on climate change as promised, LNG production is an emissions-intensive game. Carbon dioxide is emitted when gas is extracted from the reservoir and particularly during compression and decompression. The process also requires plenty of electricity. Bruce Robertson, an analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial analysis, says the LNG industry is the sole reason the amount of grid electricity used – affected by improving efficiency, manufacturing decline and the rise of solar panels – did not fall last year. “They are massive numbers. On the east coast, LNG is 25% of domestic gas usage and 3% of all electricity consumption,” he says. What can be done to limit LNG emissions? Several potential solutions have been raised, but few have been realised. From an emissions perspective, Australia’s most contentious LNG plant has been Gorgon, based on Barrow Island about 60km from the WA coast and co-owned by Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell. Billed as the largest resource project in Australia’s history, it includes three processing facilities (known as trains), a plant that processes gas for domestic use and pipes connecting the island to two offshore gas fields. It also includes a promise to limit emissions through the world’s largest commercial carbon injection project. Under an agreement with the WA government, the project is expected to capture and store 80% of its reservoir emissions – but not those from processing – over a five-year rolling average. The plan is to bury them in a reservoir 2km beneath Barrow Island. Nearly two years on from the initial LNG shipment from the plant and nothing has been buried. The equivalent of about 1% of annual national emissions has instead gone to the atmosphere. Chevron says technical problems with the injection and storage system discovered during commissioning are being addressed. It says it is confident the system will be operational early next year. The problems with the carbon storage development coincided with Chevron fighting suggestions it should have to pay to offset emissions from its other major WA LNG project, Wheatstone. The company was initially expected to offset 1.2m tonnes of emissions a year, but the requirement was dropped by the Barnett Liberal state government when a national carbon price was introduced in 2011. With the carbon scheme now long abolished, the McGowan Labor government has asked the state environment protection authority to advise on whether the offset condition should be reinstated. The company strongly opposes any change, arguing a national greenhouse reporting system introduced in 2007 should be the “single and consistent” policy to manage emissions. That system does not require emissions reductions. A Chevron spokeswoman says policy should be focused on maintaining Australia’s international competitiveness and increasing the supply of natural gas locally and internationally “to help realise the objective of low-cost solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions”. With carbon capture and storage still unproven, most of the discussion of how to deal with LNG emissions has focussed on offsets. Commonwealth officials proposed that Shell’s Prelude floating LNG project, currently under development, should not be allowed to result in a net increase in emissions but the condition was not enforced. A Northern Territory inquiry into fracking went further, recommending companies should have to offset all emissions related to its operation, including those from when it was burned overseas. But to date, these are largely theoretical discussions. Tony Wood, the director of the Grattan Institute energy program, says they are unlikely to stay this way. “It is a sleeper issue,” he says. “The industry has been fortunate in the sense that no one has been paying attention to it, but the tonnes [of carbon dioxide] involved with it are significant. At some point, whoever wins the next election is going to have to grapple with it.” Woodside is looking at another potential way ahead. Its chief executive, Peter Coleman, earlier this year said the company planned to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a combination of solar, batteries and gas to run its Karratha gas plant, reasoning 70% of its emissions came from power generation. He told reporters: “If you can start changing that out to far more efficient power generation then it’s got huge environmental benefits for us, as well as economic benefits.” Verstegen, of the WA Conservation Council, says this shift echoes polling suggesting the public is no longer persuaded that gas is a low-emissions solution. “People are much more accepting of renewables than they were five years ago,” he says. “They are starting to see gas as a fossil fuel alongside coal. But federal and state politicians haven’t kept up with that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/09/uk-electric-vehicles-abb-power-grid-formula-e","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-09T18:45:43Z","webTitle":"UK must be ready for rise of electric vehicles, says ABB chief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/09/uk-electric-vehicles-abb-power-grid-formula-e","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/09/uk-electric-vehicles-abb-power-grid-formula-e","fields":{"headline":"UK must be ready for rise of electric vehicles, says ABB chief","bodyText":"The UK should speed up preparations for the rise of electric vehicles, according to the chief executive of ABB, the world’s largest supplier of fast-charging points. Speaking as the Switzerland-based engineering firm became the first official sponsor of the electric street racing series Formula E, Ulrich Spiesshofer predicted a flood of consumer take-up of plug-in cars. And he added his voice to warnings that Britain must move faster to make sure owners of electric vehicles are not stymied by a shortage of charging bays. “E-mobility is unstoppable, it’s just a question of how fast and how deep it will be deployed,” he said. “The UK has a big population that really wants to contribute to a greener, more sustainable world. But there’s always a question of whether it’s quick enough. In the next couple of years, it’s in the interest of everybody to make sure the infrastructure is coming up.” He said this would include adding to the UK’s network of electric charging points, as well as ensuring enough energy capacity. There are 14,344 charging connectors in the UK, according to ZapMap, which charts the scale of the UK’s network. Those charging points served around 132,000 plug-in vehicles at the end of 2017, but the National Grid has predicted that the number of electric cars could surge to 9m by 2030. “In the next couple of years, it’s in the interest of everybody to make sure the infrastructure is coming up,” said Spiesshofer. He welcomed the government’s budget pledge to spend £400m on improving the UK’s charging point network but warned that the power grid also needed to be ready to meet the increased demand. Electric cars have been forecast to add about 18 gigawatts of power demand to the grid, the equivalent of six Hinkley Point C nuclear power stations. Spiesshofer said he hoped ABB’s sponsorship of Formula E, which will last until 2025, would help spur interest in electric cars and lead to technological breakthroughs.

The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, also confirmed the existence of the “unprecedented” letter on Friday, and claimed it demonstrated that the global sanctions regime against the rogue state was working. In September Trump used a speech to the United Nations to threaten to “totally destroy” North Korea “if [the US] is forced to defend ourselves or our allies”. The North Korean letter, published in full by Fairfax Media, labels that threat an “extreme act of threatening to destroy the entire world”. “If Trump thinks that he would bring the DPRK, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance,” the letter says. The letter says North Korea is a “full-fledged nuclear power” with “various kinds of nuclear delivery”. It urges other nations to restrain the “heinous and reckless moves of the Trump administration trying to drive the world into a horrible nuclear disaster”. The letter claims that from his first day in office “Trump has engaged himself in high-handed and arbitrary practice, scrapping international laws and agreements incurring his displeasure on the US-first principle”. It calls Trump’s America First mantra “the height of [the] American way of thinking that it is best if the US is well off at at the expense of the whole world”. The letter labels the international sanctions regime “illegal”, accusing the UN security council of breaching the UN charter and North Korea’s right to “normal economic development”. Speaking to 3AW Radio on Friday, Turnbull said the letter “doesn’t actually say anything about Australia so much, it’s basically a rant about how bad Donald Trump is”. “They’ve sent it to a lot of other countries, like a circular letter,” he said. Turnbull said the letter was “consistent with [North Korea’s] ranting and complaining about Donald Trump”. “The fact of the matter is that North Korea is the one who is in in breach of UN security council resolutions. It’s North Korea that is threatening to fire nuclear missiles at Japan, at South Korea, at the US ... threatening the stability of the world. “That’s the regime that has to return to its senses, to stop this reckless conduct, and that’s why we’re imposing sanctions.” Turnbull has strongly backed the US on North Korea, saying he is “of one mind” with Trump on the conflict and committing Australia to be involved in any conflict in the event North Korea attacks the US. Turnbull said he believed the letter was a sign sanctions were working, and gave “great credit” to China for restricting oil exports to North Korea. “The tighter the economic sanctions are applied, the greater prospect we have of resolving that situation without a conflict.” At a press conference, Bishop said it was “unprecedented” to communicate with the Australian government in this way, noting it is “not the way they usually publish their global messages”. “The collective strategy of imposing maximum diplomatic and economic pressure through sanctions on North Korea is working,” she said. “This is a response to the pressure.” Bishop said North Korea was trying to “divide those who are committed to ending its illegal nuclear weapons testing and ballistic missile testing”. “This is evidence, I believe, that our collective international strategy is working.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/sep/13/morning-mail-coalitions-women-problem-transport-failure-worlds-oldest-drawing","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-09-12T20:47:34Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Julia Banks attacks 'appalling behaviour'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/13/morning-mail-coalitions-women-problem-transport-failure-worlds-oldest-drawing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/sep/13/morning-mail-coalitions-women-problem-transport-failure-worlds-oldest-drawing","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Julia Banks attacks 'appalling behaviour'","bodyText":"Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 13 September.

Increasing women’s representation in parliament is not just about the increasing the number of women preselected – Anne Davies and Nick Evershed have crunched the numbers and found a disproportionate number of female candidates are still being placed in unwinnable or marginal seats. In the Coalition, there are only six women in safe seats with margins greater than 10% – or 17% of the government’s safe seats. Labor is a little better but the prizes of safe seats still fall mainly to men. There are 10 women in safe seats, which is 34% of those seats with a margin of 10% or more.

Transport-related emissions have increased by 63% since 1990 as Australia lags behind other developed countries, according to a new report by the Climate Council. Responsible for nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions in Australia, a lack of mandatory pollution standards, common in almost all other OECD countries, and a failure to incentivise the use of electric vehicles are major contributing factors. The report found that fuel emission standards, such as those have been in operation for at least a decade in the US, Japan or China, could prevent up to the equivalent of 65m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. More than 1.4 million residents across North and South Carolina have been ordered to evacuate, with concerns for half a dozen nuclear power plants that stand in the projected path of Hurricane Florence, expected to make landfall on Thursday night.

By no means a new topic, the issue of asylum in Australia has regained greater prominence with the publishing of a raft of new books detailing the refugee experience. Brigid Delaney looks at the Iranian journalist Behrouz Boochani’s work No Friend But the Mountains, not just as a harrowing recording of Australia’s detention regime, but also as a measure of hope. “The government does all it can to stop individual stories from being told, as well as images and names from circulating. In that way the existence of these books – and their readers – is an act of resistance.” After five years of rising house prices, the boom is over. It has left Australia in debt, and, while the Reserve Bank is mostly not worried, we will be more susceptible to collapsing house prices should the solid economic growth come to a halt, writes Greg Jericho. “Unless incomes begin to grow faster than debt, the ratio of debt to income will continue to grow, and that means when we do have our next economic downturn it will be at a time where households are in more debt than at any time in our history.” What’s he done now? Donald Trump has posted a video warning for residents of Virginia, North and South Carolina about Hurricane Florence, and once again claimed his administration did “a great job” in Puerto Rico, blaming “a totally incompetent Mayor of San Juan” instead. Media roundup Malcolm Turnbull has been lobbying Liberal MPs to refer Peter Dutton to the high court, claims the Sydney Morning Herald, with the former prime minister worth seeking clarity on “the uncertainty around Peter Dutton’s eligibility”. The Courier-Mail is running an extended feature on the “inside story of the Jones and Wagner feud” after the record $3.4m defamation payout judgment handed down against the veteran broadcaster Alan Jones and two radio stations. And the NSW family and community services minister, Pru Goward, has announced a recruitment drive for new foster carers based in Sydney’s west, reports the Daily Telegraph, offering a $75,000 tax-free cheque for those willing to quit their jobs and offer full-time care. Coming up Sir Frank Lowy will deliver the annual Lowy lecture himself when he will be considering Australia’s place in the world. The banking royal commission will continue its interrogation of Commonwealth Bank’s CommInsure.

Help me. You’re my only hope. In today’s headlines: Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Labor’s treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers faced off at the National Press Club, and two more leaders’ debates were confirmed. (And will Frydenberg lose his seat?). Prime minister Scott Morrison admitted he has not spoken to his Solomon Islands counterpart since calling the election. Morrison also doubled down on his Icac criticisms, despite being accused of being a “buffoon”. One Nation’s unseemly scramble to find candidates was revealed. A disaster has been unfolding in Wadeye, in the Northern Territory, and immigration detainees were sent from Melbourne to Christmas Island amid protests. And there were no pies for Labor leader Anthony Albanese today – catch up on the rest of the news in our election briefing. Thank you for being here today. Amy Remeikis will be back at sparrowfart to take you through tomorrow, along with the rest of the Guardian Australia team. Good night! Australia has dropped down a critical list on press freedom, the ABC reports: Australia slid from 25 to 39 out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders’ (RSF) World Press Freedom Index for 2022, ranking below close neighbours New Zealand in 11th place and Timor-Leste at number 17. “Ultra-concentration of media ownership, combined with growing official pressure, endanger public-interest journalism” in Australia, RSF said. As we get closer to the finale of May the Fourth ... yes, these were already in Josh Butler’s election briefing. Still worth a post of their own, I reckon: Here’s Caitlin Cassidy on the girl who was found unconscious – she’s still unconscious: First Dog On the Moon brings you... classic, no-cook chicken korma! NB: Do not read at dinner time: Remember that whole Solomon Islands – China palaver? Rather large foreign policy issue? Daniel Hurst reports that prime minister Scott Morrison has not spoken to his Solomon Islands counterpart Manasseh Sogavare since calling the election: Labor leader Anthony Albanese declines a pie, prime minister Scott Morrison declines a “buffoon” tag. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg faces off against Labor’s treasury spokesman, Jim Chalmers, and there are masses more debates to come. Josh Butler’s election briefing is here: From Calla Wahlquist: 12 detainees, including one person whose refugee status has been approved, were woken by guards at the Melbourne International Transit Accommodation centre early yesterday morning and told they would be moved to Christmas Island. Does this settle it? Continuing this afternoon’s teal-coloured theme – here’s the Campaign catchup! Sarah Martin and Jane Lee discuss treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s future: Daniel says independents can get legislation through the parliament “with alacrity” in the case of a hung parliament, and help major parties have difficult conversations: I think independents can provide cover for the major parties [who] are really very populist ... I am happy to provide that [cover], to raise those hard issues so that our major parties have to have that conversation. Her campaign has raised almost a million dollars from the community, she says, and that’s roughly double what she’s received from Climate 200. Zoe Daniel, the independent (and former ABC journalist) is on Aunty. She’s challenging Liberal incumbent Tim Wilson in Goldstein, and recent polling suggested she’d romp it home. She is suitably cautious, saying it’s hard to accurately poll a single seat. She also says her running is nothing personal against Wilson, but that people want a new option and more action on climate change. A reminder that Labor leader Anthony Albanese will be on QandA tomorrow night (or Q+A, as the ABC website puts it): Some candid moments from the campaign trail from AAP: A student at Holmesglen Tafe in Melbourne says: Oh cool. Anthony Albanese. I only ever see you on TV. Melbourne senior, Jill, on why she wanted to greet the opposition leader during his visit to Holmesglen Tafe: Because he’s there and I can. He has lovely, soft hands. Bandt says the Greens’ policies have been costed through the Parliamentary Budget Office, and that they have more announcements to make. The Greens’ promises, such as funding dental care through Medicare, will be funded through savings such as cutting subsidies to fossil fuel companies. He says: Everyday people don’t need to pay higher income tax. We need to start asking the big corporations that are currently paying no tax or very little tax to pay their fair share. The ABC’s Greg Jennett asks Greens leader Adam Bandt if the Greens are to Labor what the “teal” independents are to the Liberal party. Bandt says support is growing for the Greens (including in a couple of Queensland seats), and says the Liberal party is “terrible”, while Labor agrees with them on some key issues. He says: We are offering a vision and tackling the big issues. 7,367 Covid deaths in Australia: Despi O’Connor, the independent candidate for the seat of Flinders – currently held by retiring health minister Greg Hunt – will suspend her campaign after realising she may be in breach of the infamous section 44 of the constitution due to her employment in the Victorian Department of Education. In an email to supporters on Wednesday, O’Connor admitted she “may be in breach of section 44 vi of the Australian constitution”, which precludes anyone holding “any office of profit under the Crown” from sitting in parliament. O’Connor said she was “technically employed in the public school system”, but that she had been on leave without pay for 18 months from the Victorian education department. She said: This is something I should have picked up on. It was simply an error made in the rush of an election campaign. O’Connor said added she had been focused on section 44(iii) of the constitution, and renouncing her Greek citizenship. Her campaign manager told Guardian Australia: We are continuing to try to resolve the issue. We have been and will continue to work with legal experts with the hope of continuing the campaign. Everyday campaign operations have been put on hold, but the statement is not a withdrawal from the race. Ruston is also asked about comments from the former deputy Liberal leader Fred Chaney, which has been published in the Nine newspapers. He said the Liberal party had “lost its way”. Unsurprisingly, Ruston disagrees with that description, and says her party has a strong plan, particularly on climate change. Next, the ABC’s Greg Jennett asks her if she’d renegotiate health funding with the states if the Coalition wins (and therefore she becomes health minister). Ruston says: If I should be so lucky as to have that position, I will be seeking to work with all stakeholders in the health and aged care portfolios to find ways we can make sure that the world-class health system and world-class aged care system are continuously improved. Ruston also echoed calls for the big banks – all of whom swiftly passed on that cash rate increase – to also pass on an increase in interest on deposits. She said: If banks are going to reflect increases in mortgage rates, they reflect increases in deposits. We suggest the banks would ... pass on these interest rate rises to their members and the people banking with them because that would be the fair thing to do. Some more distressing news: Women’s safety minister Anne Ruston has been talking about those inflationary pressures. There’s “tremendous uncertainty” at the moment she tells the ABC, and that’s “having an impact on the ability to project into the future” She says the freezing of those deeming rates for pensioners (insulating them so people aren’t punished for interest rate rises) is: About making sure Australians know we have their back, and will provide them with certainty going forward so they can make decisions, how they reset their lives. Amanda Meade reports that the third and final election debate will be next Wednesday, but, well, a little later than one might expect: Seven is launching the reality franchise on Monday and nothing, not even matters of state, will be allowed to bump Big Brother. A distressing story here from the Northern Territory: Sky News is hosting a debate between the main candidates for the NSW seat of Hunter, and it certainly is spirited. Held by the retiring Labor MP Joel Fitzgibbon, Hunter is hotly contested and the main aspirants are the Labor candidate, Dan Repacholi, the Nationals challenger, James Thomson, and Dale McNamara for One Nation. Coal and mining is a major sector in the area, and much of the debate has centred on energy, climate and resources. It’s held by Labor on a 3% margin, with One Nation and the Nationals challenging hard (coincidentally you can read my seat profile on Hunter right here). Thomson said the Nationals wanted to have a discussion about nuclear power, and asked Repacholi if Labor would support a debate. Repacholi responded: “I’ll be honest with you, I don’t know.” McNamara said One Nation was strongly supportive of nuclear. Thomson said the Nationals would deliver more for the area than Labor, after the party has held Hunter for more than 100 years. Repacholi challenged that, claiming the Coalition had failed to come through on road bypasses in the area, and that Fitzgibbon hadn’t been able to deliver those roads because Labor hadn’t been in government. He said: It’s like going to grandma and asking for a chocolate biscuit. McNamara said he wanted to see Australia spend 5% of the gross domestic product on defence. Currently Labor and the Coalition have committed to spend more than 2% of GDP on defence. Repacholi and Thomson squared off directly on a number of occasions, including one on which party was better for the region. In response to criticism of the Liberals, Thomson claimed “the Nationals are our own party, unlike the Labor-Greens alliance” – an interesting claim, considering the formal Coalition alliance of the Liberals and Nationals, an agreement that Labor and the Greens definitely do not have. Repacholi criticised Thomson, a communications manager at a local school, as a “PR spin doctor”. Scott Morrison is in Glenelg, by the way. Glenelg is famous for being a palindrome, and for being the former home of Magic Mountain. It’s in Boothby, South Australia’s most marginal seat. The sitting Liberal MP, Nicolle Flint, is retiring at the election, and Morrison has been touring Glenelg with the new candidate, Rachel Swift. He’s announced an upgrade to the main drag, plus $2m to double an existing reef, and another $2m to build a new reef. Fine, these pics of Scott Morrison in the Adelaide sunshine quickly put the lie to my “soggy” claim. As you were. Good afternoon, all. Coming to you from a slightly soggy Adelaide (I know, east coast, we can’t complain!). There’s definitely a second-half-of-the-campaign busy-ness going on. Big thanks to Amy Remeikis for bearing the brunt of it! The campaigns are rolling on, with Anthony Albanese to spend part of his day tomorrow preparing for his solo Q+A appearance. No word yet on whether a leather jacket will be appearing with him, a la Malcolm Turnbull. After the rapid-fire nature of yesterday afternoon, here is hoping Tory Shepherd has a slightly more manageable one as she keeps you up to date into the evening. I’ll be back early tomorrow morning. Until then, take care of you, Ax. Josh Butler has taken a look at the contest for the NSW seat of Hunter: Victoria’s education union has warned that the state’s public schools are underfunded by almost $2,000 per student each year, as it launches a pre-election campaign blitz in three marginal seats. The Australian Education Union’s Victorian branch will deploy mobile billboards ads that will travel around the marginal electorates of Chisholm, Dunkley and Corangamite. The billboards demand that the next federal government create “proper and fair funding” for the state’s government schools. The union has released new public schools funding data, based on its analysis of federal government figures provided to Senate estimates. Its analysis found public schools in Dunkley were underfunded by $127.4m of their schooling resources standard (SRS) – a benchmark created in the Gonski review. Public schools in Corangamite lose out on $84.6m while Chisholm’s schools will be short-funded $50.4m. The analysis found each school in Victoria could employ an average of 10 additional teachers and provide additional learning programs if they received their full SRS funding. The AEU Victorian branch president, Meredith Peace, said Victorian public schools were missing out on $1,971 per student each year because they were not funded to their full SRS: Victorian public-school students continue to be the lowest funded in the country after almost a decade of reckless funding cuts perpetrated by the Morrison government. Qantas has cancelled one of its longhaul services, AAP reports: Qantas will stop using Darwin as a hub for one of its London services after the war in Ukraine restricted the number of passengers the airline could transport on the flights. The national carrier says the QF9/10 service will fly via Perth between Melbourne and the UK so more seats can be made available to travellers. “Our flights from Darwin to London are currently operating with reduced passenger numbers,” a spokeswoman said in a statement on Wednesday. “This is due to the effective closure of Russian airspace, which means we have to carry extra fuel to fly an alternative longer route.” Qantas said the Perth to London route was shorter, which meant less weighty fuel was needed and more passengers could be carried. The airline temporarily rerouted its London flights from Perth to Darwin in November after the West Australian government announced it was unlikely to reopen its borders to international travellers amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “The NT government and Darwin Airport went above and beyond so that we could operate these services when WA kept its borders closed, and we’re extremely grateful for their partnership,” the Qantas international chief executive, Andrew David, said. The QF1/2 service in and out of Sydney will continue to operate direct between London and Darwin as scheduled until 18 June when it will return to Singapore. The first Perth to London flight will depart on 23 May. They were previously scheduled to return to Perth from 19 June. Q: The government has said today they have done more than any other to help women. Amanda Stoker was at a pro-life event family ... we also know that Matt Canavan was also there. What message does that show to Australian women and what will Labor do to make sure women in this country are heard on decisions and choices around their body? Anthony Albanese: We respect women. We will have a very different approach. If you look at my campaign launch on Sunday, [we] had as a major policy differentiation the issue of the gender pay gap and addressing those issues. This is a government that sat back and, as a direct result of the way that women in particular felt about the government’s attitude towards women and women’s safety, had ... hundreds of thousands [of women] around the country ... march for justice. The prime minister couldn’t walk out the front of Parliament House. And then he stood up in Parliament and made the comments that, in other countries, people who were protesting would be shot. That was the response that women got. We still have a failure to adopt the 55 recommendations of the Respect@Work report. We have questions which still remain to be answered about the prime minister’s offers and what they knew about issues and just a roadblock put up. We have, I’ll lead a government that respects women, that makes sure that we recognise that one of the things that we can do to advance this country is to fully embrace the commitment of advancing women’s interests because that in our national interest as well ... A good government isn’t one that represents just 50%. It represents the whole society. Q: We have hard economic times with a lot of debt, if you get into government can you guarantee no cuts to education and health? Anthony Albanese: I tell you what will make a potential savings, it is in the rorts that have occurred under this government. ... They’re rorts in the allocation of funding on political basis with their colour-coded maps. That’s why we have said, we will have an audit conducted by Treasury and finance, and have a line-by-line examination of that. But Labor will always be be better on education and health. Labor will always be better on education and health than the government, then the Liberal Party. Because we believe that a healthy society is a productive society. We believe a society that invests in education is investing in growth and our future. Part of a better future for Australia is making sure that people aren’t left behind and people aren’t held back. What that means is investing in health and education, we’ve put forward during this campaign ... including here in Tafe and universities and early learning, the commitments we have made for health are all about improving the system. When it comes to the NDIS we have had a comprehensive plan announced by Bill [Shorten] with six points. One of the things we want to do is take pressure off people who will either have had their funding cut or worried their funding will be cut, take away some of that bureaucracy, the money that has been spent attacking people, and their packages, on the NDIS. Q: We know business costs are rising as well, it emerged today the price of printing for newspapers is going up 80%, putting regional newspapers across the country under threat. Do you support immediate financial relief to help the sector and how much of a loss would it be if regional newspapers were to close down, and those communities left without a voice? Anthony Albanese: It would be a massive loss, a massive loss. Regional newspapers play such a critical role in regional communities. If you live in the middle of a big capital city like the one we are now you are impacted by a range of factors, the thing about a regional community, Canberra or others as well, that are potentially impacted by this and it is circumstances beyond their control ... I’ve always been very sympathetic when I have met with regional media, Win [News] and others about the pressures they are under, I would take a constructive role on any of those issues. From now during [the] caretaker period of course, I would be prepared to sit down and I believe they play an important role, and it is legitimate to make sure they have substance. Q: People are doing a tough, it’s only going to get worse can you commit to a increase of the jobseeker rate under a Labor government and the pension rate? Anthony Albanese: What I have said on both those issues is that one of the things Labor governments should always do is assist people in need, and we know that people are doing it really tough, the jobseeker rate is under $46 a day ... I have said ... we don’t need a review to know people are doing it tough. What we need to do is, for each and every budget, to examine and do what we can do to assist people. The last time I was in government, I was proud to be part of a government that had the largest ever increase in pensions in Australia’s history. Q: Will you be increasing the jobseeker rate? You didn’t answer the question. Albanese: I did answer the question. I said in each and every budget we will consider what we can do on issues like that. Q: Tanya Plibersek, have you been shafted from the official Labor election campaign and is your appearance here today an effort to put those rumours to bed? Plibersek: We are here today to talk about education, which is my portfolio. I have been travelling around the country, working very hard for a Labor win. I have visited more than marginal seat so far, I’ll keep doing that. I don’t know how many media events I have done, last count about 30 of them. And can I tell you one thing? Not a single person has stopped me in the street and asked me the sort of question you just asked me now. You know what they are talking to me about? The cost of living. The interest rate hike they’ve just experienced, they’re talking to me about the fact it is harder and harder to make ends meet, under the Scott Morrison government. And you know what I tell them? It is only Anthony Albanese that has the plan to take a little bit of pressure off families by reducing the cost of childcare, by helping them with affordable housing, by reducing the cost of medicine, by making sure they can get a great job and when the business is doing well and employers are doing well, see the occasional pay rise as well. Albanese: Can I make this point ... everyone gets one question. I was criticised by some in the media yesterday for taking more than one question so I’ve taken that on board and now you only get one. ... I’ve got my education spokesperson here. Who is Scott Morrison’s education spokesperson? Who is it? This is a fundamental issue, education is so important. Scott Morrison can’t say who his education minister is, now. And he is the government. Today he has made more comments about Alan Tudge, what is Stuart Robert doing? I am proud to be captain of a fantastic team. It’s a ripper team. I will appear with all of them over the course of the campaign, and what we are doing is, coordinating people who are out there in every state and territory. I have shadow ministers today in Queensland, WA, South Australia, Tasmania, NSW and Victoria. Possibly Northern Territory as well. Scott Morrison has ministers who are in witness protection, ministers who are in witness protection, who can’t appear anywhere. Q: Referring to the Solomons as our backyard, Manasseh Sogavare [prime minister of Solomon Islands] has said, is offensive. What is your first order of business of repairing that relationship with the Solomon Islands if you win the election? Anthony Albanese: We will show respect to all the Pacific family. Q: Back on interest rates, what are you paying on your properties and here in Victoria, have you caught up with Daniel Andrews during his visit? Will he be out campaigning with you before the election? Anthony Albanese: I have been here for about an hour and a half which you would be aware. During that hour and a half I would assume the Victorian budget, because it was handed down yesterday [is keeping him busy] ... I certainly will be campaigning with Daniel Andrews during this campaign. He is asked about what interest rate he is paying and says reporters get one question again. Back to Anthony Albanese’s press conference which was cut short because of the debate. Q: On the gender pay gap there is a 28% difference between men and women when it comes to super when they retire, as Labor got a plan to address that difference? Albanese: We sure do, it’s called our childcare policy, it’s called a policy that doesn’t include a structural change which gives a disincentive for women to work a third or fourth day. It’s one of the reasons why the Business Council of Australia and other business groups have called for childcare reform. You need to recognise that one of the things that has an impact about the current mishmash and mess that as childcare subsidies, whereby, for some women if they work a fourth or fifth day, what that does is they can actually lose money or at least not earn any additional funds. That does a couple of things. One, it stops them being promoted, because they are not full-time participants, and they are at a competitive disadvantage in their workplace. Two, it holds back productivity of those businesses, but three, it means women retire with less superannuation than would otherwise be the case. And it’s also the case that the gap, and that’s what explains the gap that is there in terms of retirement incomes compared with the current wage gap, the gender pay gap which is 13.8%. Tanya Plibersek: There are two things we have to do to reduce the superannuation gap. The first is make sure women are paid equally with men, we have a great set of policies to make sure that happens, including more transparency in workplaces, including the Fair Work Commission having greater powers to make orders to pay men and women equally. The point Anthony makes about women being discouraged from working those last couple of days a week because it actually costs them money to go to work is a really important one. Families are making decisions all the time about how to best balance their budget. If it cost the secondary earner in the family money to go to work, I can tell you they’re not doing it. So cheaper childcare and reducing the gender pay gap, that’s how we reduces the superannuation gap. Josh Frydenberg didn’t dispute or address this from Jim Chalmers. He didn’t defend it in any future answers, he didn’t challenge it, and he didn’t say Chalmers was wrong, despite the opportunities offered. Well, the treasurer has just lied to you. In every way that you measure tax in the budget, this government has taxed more than the last Labor government, that’s just a fact. They have taxed more in total, they have taxed more as a share of GDP, they have taxed more per person and they have taxed more adjusted for inflation. So that’s a lie. And we need to call it out when we see it. It’s one of those big furphies that gets dragged out in election campaigns in particular. This tax cap that Josh talks about – 23.9%. In the history of this nation, that tax cap has been breached four times. Every single time was a Liberal government. Every single time. No Labor government has got anywhere near breaching the current tax-to-GDP cap. Let’s have some facts about this on the table. This government is the second highest taxing government of the last 30 years and the highest taxing was John Howard’s. So enough of this rubbish about tax. And the debate ends. Jim Chalmers sums up: This debate in this election can’t be exclusively about the past. It’s got to be partly about a better future and we’ve got to plan for a better future. And at the core of that is a stronger economy and more opportunities for people. And that’s the difference, really, the choice. The Labor side has a plan for the better future and the Liberals and Nationals want to bang on about the 2019 elections, and Australians deserve better than that. We are here for one reason, to remember, Josh, who sent us here and why we are here, and that is to deliver Australians in their communities. And the very troubling thing about this debate is that you either don’t know or don’t care what the impact of the real wage cuts in your own budget are to ordinary working people, $1,355 this financial year. And that speaks volumes, I think, about a government that has let inflation run out of control and dropped the ball on cost of living, a government that’s gone after wages and job security over the best part of a decade. And the consequence of that is a full-blown cost of living crisis and only Labor has a plan to strengthen the economy to deal with that and deliver the better future that Australians need and deserve. Closing statements. Josh Frydenberg goes first because he went second with the opening statements: [Jim] said earlier he respected me and I want to pay that complement, I respect him and he brings a great deal of experience to the role and off-camera we get on much better than we do on camera. But we’re here to debate the issues and the policies, we are here to debate the alternatives that the Australian people have for them at the next election. The Labor party would like to wish away the last few years but the reality is that we have faced the biggest economic shocks since the Great Depression and he set the test. He said the biggest test of the Morrison government’s management of the pandemic would be what happens to jobs and unemployment. We have delivered the lowest unemployment rate in 48 years and it’s going to go even lower – and each one of those people whose jobs are saved is a mum or dad or brother or sister – and we have the economic plan to set up the budget to make Australia even stronger for the future. Q: Labor have announced some plans for what they hope to see change in the public sector and my question for both of you is to invite a comment on how the public sector need more public servants or reform in other ways to help implement the bold economic vision you both put forward. Josh Frydenberg: I can only say how outstanding and professional the public service has been and I’m sure Jim will agree with me. We have relied more heavily on it than ever before, not just on the advice of Treasury but the advice of the Department of Health and we have also relied on them to implement the policies in record time, payments that have gone out to the community when they needed it most. I’ve only got the utmost respect for the public service. Numbers have actually increased under us for the public service. But it’s about making sure they work most efficiently and effectively because ultimately they are paid by the taxpayer. Jim Chalmers: I have the same view of Josh about the professionalism of the public service. We’ve both had the opportunity to work closely with Treasury in particular and we do agree that they are first-class public servants in that department and around the service. It’s one thing to respect and admire the public service but it’s another thing to invest in its capacity. One of the policies that my colleague Katy Gallagher has released as part of our trimming of spending of outsourcing on the public service is to invest in the capacity of the public service in key areas where it’s been especially hollowed out. We have high expectations here and so we should of the public service in Australia. It is one of the finest in the world and it’s got a lot to be proud of. As governments or alternative governments, we need to make sure we are investing the right amount in their capability and capacity. I worked closely in the past, in the portfolio Josh keeps mentioning, on public service reform. I thought there was a missed opportunity out of the review that was done over the course of the last term of government and so I think there are opportunities to pick up and run with some of that agenda. But part of that is investing responsibly in people in the public service so that they can continue to deliver the high quality of services and advice that we need in this country and Australians deserve for their taxpayer dollars. Josh Frydenberg: My greatest fear is that if Labor got over the line, they would revert to their natural instincts to tax more and to spend more. Instincts that were on full display when they thought they had the election in the bag last time. When you go to their national platform, it spells out increased spending on aid, increased spending on paid parental leave, increased spending on childcare. We have totalled up the cost of that increased spending – it’s more than $300bn. Yet any hard question and Jim will dodge the answer. And that’s the reality. He’s the same shadow treasurer that was shadow finance minister at the last election who described ... [Chalmers: “You’re doing it again, Josh”] ... He was proud and pleased of retirees tax and a housing tax. And he’s the same shadow treasurer that said a housing policy that did not tackle capital gains and negative gearing was a shocker. They’re not my words, they are his. If you ask me what my biggest concern is, it’s what he’s saying to you today is not what you can believe. You cannot take it to the bank because Anthony Albanese, who’s championed higher taxes his whole life, whether it was a carbon tax or a mining tax or the higher taxes at the last election, backed up by the then shadow finance minister, will do the same if they get half a chance. Q: Neither of you are really saying what you’re going to do in terms of spending cuts or tax rises after the election. So let’s try something different. Why don’t each of you tell us what you think specifically the other guy is going to do in terms of tax rises or spending cuts. You have been saying Anthony Albanese wants death duties, for example. Let’s see if you say that here. And while you’re at it, given we’re talking about debt, can Jim Chalmers ... name the net debt ... Laura Tingle: No. Q: OK. Jim Chalmers: Net debt $715bn for 22-23 in the budget that was just released. On the issue of what I fear from this government, I fear that they will continue to ignore this cost of living crisis. And I fear that this government will continue on the path that they have created for the best part of a decade now. The biggest risk at this election is that nothing changes at all. You know, it takes an especially out-of-touch Liberal treasurer in the context of skyrocketing inflation and falling real wages and rising interest rates and consumer confidence plummeting, his key argument at this election is he wants to stay the course. Why would Australian families want to stay that course? That course that this government has us on is punishing people. They’re falling further and further behind. Their household budgets are getting pummelled by this triple whammy, this cost of living crisis. And so my big fear and my message to anybody who might still be watching is that the biggest risk here, the biggest risk here in this election, is three more years of the same. Now only a Liberal government, a Liberal treasurer, a Liberal prime minister, this out of touch, would see the inflation numbers, the real wage numbers, rising interest rates, all the rest of it, and think what Australians really need is more of the same. More of the same from this government is absolutely punishing people and we can’t stay on this course. Q: What’s your plan to get tax-to-GDP and spending-to-GDP into line to get rid of the structural deficit? Josh Frydenberg: Well, obviously it’s about growing the economy. That’s what we’re seeking to do and, therefore, we can manage those higher debt burdens. But we have set our cap at 29%, bearing in mind in mind it’s about 22.4% today. We believe in the discipline of ensuring we don’t lift taxes beyond a certain amount. The Labor party will not have that discipline. As I said, and the reason why I asked Jim about his commitments at the last election, is because that would have seen tax-to-GDP go to 25.9%. And he’s seeking and the Labor party is seeking to go to the next election saying those things that were hand on heart fundamental principles and policies and philosophies for them little less than three years ago no longer is relevant. And that is just not being true to the Australian people. So we are seeking to end that emergency support. As I said, you had spending as a proportion of GDP above 30% during the height of the pandemic, that’s come down to around 27% today. That will come down another per cent to around 26%. Tax-to-GDP at 22%, just over 22% today, does go up over time, but because we have that speed limit with the tax-to-GDP cap at 23.9%, we’re prepared to say we will continue to cut taxes. The Labor party will never say that. Jim Chalmers: Well, there’s lots in that. Let me try to gallop through all of the furphies the treasurer just talked about. First of all, the issue about tax-to-GDP. I dealt with that partly before. Tax as a proportion of the economy averaged 20.9% under the last Labor government, 22.3% under this Liberal government. The only four times the gap catch has been breached in the history of this country was under the Liberal government. You asked about the relationship between the government’s so-called tax cap and their level of spending – there is an issue with the structural position of the budget and one of the reasons why I think a lot of the serious economists are critical of the approach that the government has taken is because they have capped one and not the other and that depending on the level of growth and the economy has the capacity to deliver a structural deficit. The IGR says there’ll be deficits for the next 40 years partly as a consequence of the way that the government is going about this. Now Josh knows, because he reads my transcripts more closely than any other human being on the planet, that we are only taking to this election one tax reform proposal, and that’s multinationals – that he has previously said that he supports. We have put on the table some responsible spending cuts, we have put on the table a process for the way forward to try to get the budget under control. When people at home hear the government talk about the budget position, particularly when they try to play politics with Labor, never forget that on the facts, indisputable facts, this government has taxed more and borrowed more and spent more than the last Labor government and delivered less. Q: If I could just follow up on Andrew’s question. How can the NDIS be fully funded if the plans are being cut back at a great rate of knots? And the Productivity Commission said one of the problems with the NDIS was not the scheme itself, was the fact that a lot of the care economy wasn’t properly funded. Is there a case for revisiting the arrangements with the states and local governments about the services they provide so that the NDIS is not ending up carrying services that were previously covered by other sectors? Josh Frydenberg: Well, I mean, in terms of federation, there’s always opportunities to sit around with your counterparts at the state level to work through these issues. Because ultimately we’re both heavily invested in the states and the federal government. So there will be those sort of discussions because we both mutually have responsibility for the scheme. But what I was pointing out, Laura, is that it’s the federal government that is shouldering the bulk of the load right now. Two-thirds of the increase in the NDIS costs have been met by the commonwealth. That’s lifting to 75% over time. And what we did do in the budget is we made an allowance for increased compliance. Jim Chalmers: We should always be looking for ways to improve the NDIS. The NDIS is a terrific idea which has not always been well implemented. If there are opportunities for discussions with all of the relevant stakeholders about how we provide a better level of care and service, and how we fund it most effectively, then both sides of politics should be up for that conversation. You know, as a local member in my part of the world, I know that there are a lot of concerns with the NDIS right now, about packages, about access to decent services, about the responsiveness of the service. And so as we have been saying throughout the course of this campaign and well before that ... we do think the NDIS can be better. That inevitably, necessarily, involves a conversation with all of the stakeholders. Jim Chalmers: We’re not proposing to introduce a levy to pay for the NDIS, as some of the predecessors that you mentioned have proposed in the past. We do recognise, as Josh just did, is that this is a big and growing part of the commonwealth budget, but it’s an important part of the budget as well. And I think what we need to do in this country is change the way we think about the care economy. You know, this is primarily about providing a level of services to the most vulnerable people in our society – that’s an important part of what we’re talking about here. But there’s also an opportunity for Australia, a vast opportunity for Australia, in the care economy whether it’s disability care, whether it’s aged care, or whether it’s childcare. And we need to also be seeing investments in this part of the budget as job-creating prosperity-creating productivity-enhancing investments and so they deliver a double dividend. The cost is substantial – not disputing that – but so are the benefits for individual people being cared for, but also for the economy more broadly. If you look at the way that our economy is changing and evolving, services, particularly in the care economy, will be a bigger and bigger part of our economy as our society ages. And so we need to see it that way as well. We get a benefit of it as a nation as well as a benefit for it at the individual level. We pay for that in the usual way and we’re not proposing to change the tax arrangements for it. Q: I wanted to ask about the NDIS and, firstly, your budget, treasurer, forecast the NDIS costing $70bn by 2030, well in excess of any expectation. Both sides of politics over the years have to their credit proposed ideas to pay for it. Julia Gillard in 2013 with an increase in the Medicare levy. Scott Morrison, too, by another 0.5% in the 2017 budget, you might remember he cited his brother-in-law, wants to give his brother-in-law funding certainty, but he ended up scrapping that idea a year later claiming the government had found source funding through unexpected extra revenue. Now, given the current circumstances, given there’s a trillion dollar debt, do either of you have the courage that Julia Gillard showed, the courage that Scott Morrison showed at one point, to propose a levy to fund the NDIS, which is blowing out in costs? And in anticipation you’re going to mention it, please don’t say it’s fully-funded because if it’s fully-funded, how do you explain that to people who are going to be lumbered, your children, my children, with $1tn debt? Josh Frydenberg: Our plans are set out in the budget, but you’re ... Q: That’s not an answer. Frydenberg: But that is the truth. You’re asking about future levies and I’m saying to you that what we have set out is the funding for the NDIS which is going to continue to grow and as I said earlier from 1.2 to 1.5 per cent of the GDP. What we inherited this from the previous government was a structure where the federal government, the commonwealth government, was up for the bulk of the expenditure increase in the NDIS. So today we’re picking up about two-thirds of the increase that will lift to about 75%. Now, I recognise that the NDIS, Andrew, is an absolutely critical program and it is providing support for the people who need it most. But it is increasing, both in terms of demand and in terms of cost, and today you have half a million people on the NDIS, half of whom are getting support for the first time. And those numbers will actually increase over time. So we’ve got to continue to fund it ... there was $30m in the budget to help the NDIA in terms of compliance, so there are measures there to ensure that we are getting value-for-money out of that scheme. So we put that in the budget – $30m in the budget. But what I recognise is that we need to continue to fund this scheme and we continue to provide those services even as it becomes more expensive. Jim Chalmers: How much, Josh, do the real wage cuts in your budget cost the average Australian worker this financial year? Josh Frydenberg: Well, firstly, we’re saying that wages will continue to rise and there’s about a $900 difference for somebody who’s on average full-time earnings between what the wages would be and what the inflation rate would be. But as you know, they get $1,500 in tax relief from 1 July, so that makes up for that difference between the WPI and the difference between the wages price index and the inflation rate. (Treasury’s forecasts on wage growth have been wrong 53 out of 55 times.) Josh Frydenberg: My question to Jim – he says we revisit the last election but it actually goes to the heart of the believability of the Labor party. They are trying to sneak into government and say that they will be handing down a budget after the election but not tell the people before the election what would be in that budget. Now, Jim, you said you were proud and pleased of $387bn of higher taxes, higher taxes on super, higher taxes on income, higher taxes on housing, higher taxes on retirees, higher taxes on family businesses, indeed there were media reports even less than a year ago about you revisiting the housing tax. Family business tax. What impact would have $387bn of higher taxes that you took to the last election have had on an economy that has just encountered the biggest economic shock since the Great Depression with Covid? Jim Chalmers: Josh, this might come as a big surprise to you, but it’s 2022 now. The 2019 election has been run and won. And I think it speaks volumes, frankly, and with respect of your approach to this job and to this economy and to the future of this country that when you’re given an opportunity to ask one question of your opponent, you ask a question about the 2019 election. I think that speaks volumes about what you’re offering the Australian people. Australians had their chance to cast their judgment in 2019, they cast that judgment and we respect the judgment that they made. We have been working around-the-clock since then to earn their trust and part of that has been acknowledging where we put forward a policy that wasn’t right and where we have found a better way to deal with some of these issues. Now contest this election on the policies we’re putting forward, not on the policies we’re not putting forward. Contest this policy on a plan for a better future, that’s what we’re trying to do. You should try it too. Laura Tingle invites the men to ask a question of each other. Josh Frydenberg jumps in: My question to Jim – he says that we’re ... Jim Chalmers: After you, Josh! Frydenberg: I’m sorry. You did speak first. Jim Chalmers on that same question: This is a long-term challenge, as you know, and it needs long-term policy and long-term planning and shouldn’t make your policy based on kind of near-term spikes in prices. We all recognise – at least the major parties recognise – that there will be a mix of energy sources and that that mix will change over time. And it’s not just the Labor party saying that energy costs will come down if we introduce cleaner and cheaper energy into the system. The investment community has been saying that for some time to their credit. The peak business organisations have been saying that to their great credit. The contribution they have made to this conversation. Now getting cleaner and cheaper energy into the system is Australia’s biggest opportunity over the next decade or two, and I think Australians are angry that we have been stuffing around with this for a decade now. All of this uncertainty created by a government where some of the members say that net zero is rubbish and other members say that net zero is locked in, depending on where they are in the country, whether they’re in Kooyong or Capricornia, OK. There’s a cost to that. There’s a cost to that to our economy and one of the reasons why we need a Labor government, and a key part of a better future for this country, is to finally get on with the job of grabbing this incredible opportunity that we have, probably the most important opportunity that we have as a country and as an economy is to grab this thing, because if we get that cleaner and cheaper energy, we will unlock tens of billions of dollars in investment. We will create hundreds of thousands of jobs and we’ll make energy cheaper, all the way from pensioners to working families to businesses as well. If we miss this opportunity, we should hang our heads in shame, but that’s what’s been happening. This opportunity has been going begging and it’s not good enough, it needs to change and it will change if there’s a Labor government. Q: Both of you claim to be able to control power prices. The government says you’re responsible for bringing the prices down, the Labor party says you can bring them down further. Wholesale power prices are on the march and they’re on the march because the price of coal is on the march. Can you both explain why that will not be the case in the future – that that will continue to set the price of power in the marketplace and as wholesale power prices go up, so will retail power prices? Josh Frydenberg: So commodity prices have gone up and coal is one of these and that’s largely out of what has been happening in the Ukraine and it’s the expectation of Treasury that those prices would start to normalise over time and that would play through to the energy system. I do point out that electricity prices for households are down by about 8% in the last two years under the Coalition and for small businesses down about 10% – and they doubled under the Labor party. The key here is to get the transition right and that is particularly important as we move to net zero emissions. I used to be the energy and the environment minister and I’ve got the scars to show it. What you’ve got to get right is that transition to more intermittent sources of energy. I remember when Hazelwood was closed. It was a dirty coal-fired brown coal source. Victoria went overnight from being a net energy exporter to being a net energy importer at times of peak demand. But they saw a spike in the wholesale price of about 80% at the time. And I remember getting calls into our office and indeed other offices from pensioners who couldn’t afford the heating and they would have to sleep in bed with extra layers of clothes and extra blankets, and the same pensioners were sweltering in the summer and couldn’t afford their cooling. So the point here is that unless you get that transition right, the cost to both households, particularly the most disadvantaged members of our community who spend a higher proportion of their income, their disposable income, on electricity, and businesses which are hugely price-sensitive to energy input costs, like glass, like manufacturers of paper, steel, and other manufacturing goods, are all hypersensitive to getting electricity prices. So our focus is about a proper transition, ensuring dispatchable power like gas, bringing in more renewables into the system, having back-up storage like pumped hydro and Snowy 2.0, all of which hopefully will smooth that transition because inevitably we’re moving to a smaller carbon footprint. That’s a good thing for the environment but also over time a good thing for the economy. Q: A question to you both. Can you tell us what you expect the annual cost of Medicare, aged care and the NDIS to be in 10 years’ time? And how you each believe the growing demand for these services should be paid for? And are either of you prepared to have an honest conversation with the Australian people about this looming challenge for the country? Josh Frydenberg: Well, we have set out the forward costs in the IGR and in the case of all of those areas, they’re going to continue to grow up because we have got an ageing population and we’re also spending heavily in another key area which is disability support. So the expectation is that while the NDIS today is about 1.2% of GDP, that’s going to go up to about 1.5% in the coming years as set out by the IGR. We’re going to have to pay for all those services, including hospitals, disability support, increased mental health support, and education. And the way to do that is to grow our economy and that is why I do defend the spending in productivity-enhancing areas. I do defend our record where we have created more jobs, so that nearly two million more people are in work today than when we came to government. The way we’re seeing an improvement in the budget bottom line is actually moving people from welfare to work. That’s how you improve the bottom line, that’s how you grow the economy, that’s how you pay for those increased expenditures and social services. (IGR is the intergenerational report.) Jim Chalmers: Every dollar that gets wasted or rorted in the budget is a dollar that can’t go to some of those fast-growing areas of important public spending. Medicare is one, NDIS, as Josh said, is another, aged care is another, the defence – defence spending will need to go up as well and we have acknowledged that too. And so what we need to be able to do is to flick the switch in the budget not to austerity but to quality, so we can fund the things that we care the most about, including those four things I mentioned a moment ago. If you take aged care, for a moment, we have got a $2.5bn commitment in aged care which recognises that people are not getting the care that they need and deserve, they’re not getting the food they need and deserve. The workers aren’t getting the support that they need and deserve, and that’s a meaningful, important commitment – a modest commitment which will make a meaningful difference to people’s lives. And so as we reorientate the budget away from the rorts and the waste that we have seen for much of the last 10 years towards more meaningful, more productive spending, then, of course, we need to factor in that some of the things we care most about are the things that cost more and more as time goes on. If you look at the intergenerational report, I think one of the great tragedies, as an economics nerd, one of the great tragedies of the release of the intergenerational report is that it didn’t get the attention that it deserved. What the IGR said ... is that unless we change the way we go about things, we’re up for 40 years where the economy is smaller than it’s been for the last 40, we’ve got 40 years of deficits, we’ve got an extraordinary amount of debt with not enough to show for it – and that’s why we need to start thinking differently about the budget. And we have nominated areas where we can begin that task, but the task should be there for whoever wins office in every budget until we can meaningfully pay for these commitments that we make to the Australian people. Josh Frydenberg on that: Well, the focus of our spending is creating more jobs and driving up productivity, and I think both Jim and I would agree that we need to lift our productivity here in Australia and it’s a global challenge right now. So the digital transformation, the 10-year $120bn infrastructure pipeline, you know, Melbourne to Brisbane inland rail, getting food from the paddock to the plate that much faster, a second airport for Western Sydney, Snowy 2.0 – a major energy project – they’re all nation-building projects that have begun on our watch and they’re all about driving higher productivity. So we have also made significant changes to childcare, including $1.7bn in last year’s budget which was designed to make it easier for 250,000 families who will save more than $2,000 a year. So I would defend our spending – we have turned off the emergency support. And with respect to taxes, our record is very clear – people are paying lower taxes under us than the Labor party, and if Jim had his way and introduced $387bn of taxes at the last election, the tax-to-GDP raise would have gone to a record high of 25.9%. Jim Chalmers: Josh is fighting the last election again. Look, the point that I would make about this is the quantity of spending in the budget obviously matters a great deal. We pay interest on the debt that the government has racked up and so it matters. So you need to get maximum bang for buck. But what matters just as much, if not more, is the quality of that spending. And if you stack up the record of the government against the commitments that we have made in this – well, before this election campaign, over the course of the last three years – let me give you a couple ... The government spent at least $5.5bn on submarines that will never be built. We think we should invest a little less than that, but around that, in childcare. But people can work more and earn more if they choose to. I can go through lots of examples of this. Our spending is responsible, it’s carefully calibrated to deliver an economic dividend, whether it’s productivity, whether it’s participation, whether it’s other forms of economic dividend. Because the big challenge in the budget, which gets missed in the kind of conversation around the headline figures, is that we’re just not getting value for all of this debt. And we want to get some value for it and we measure that by the economic dividend. There’s been a lot of waste, there’s been a lot of rorting of the budget over the best part of the last 10 years and we need to do much better than that. Laura Tingle brings them both back to the question: Well, neither of you have actually completely answered John’s question, which was about spending and tax and also reflected what I was saying – we’re now in a different economic environment of rising inflation to one we had certainly in the last 20 years. So the question I’d like both of you to answer is: Can you nominate actual discretionary spending cuts in terms of proportion of GDP that you’d be aiming for in the next three years? And with respect, Jim Chalmers, $3bn is big, you know, a big deal in a trillion dollar ... [Chalmers: It’s $3bn more than they have offered] ... And treasurer, you haven’t answered the question, the fact that you really haven’t engaged in any serious discretionary spending cuts either. What is the task that we have to face and the taxpayers have a right to know about in the next three years? Jim Chalmers has been waiting for this moment: Well, the treasurer has just lied to you. In every way that you measure tax in the budget, this government has taxed more than the last Labor government, that’s just a fact. They have taxed more in total, they have taxed more as a share of GDP, they have taxed more per person and they have taxed more adjusted for inflation. So that’s a lie. And we need to call it out when we see it. It’s one of those big furphies that gets dragged out in election campaigns in particular. This tax cap that Josh talks about – 23.9%. In the history of this nation, that tax cap has been breached four times. Every single time was a Liberal government. Every single time. No Labor government has got anywhere near breaching the current tax-to-GDP cap. There’s have some facts about this on the table. This government is the second highest taxing government of the last 30 years and the highest taxing was John Howard’s. So enough of this rubbish about tax. Now John’s question about how do we start to take seriously this fiscal challenge we have in the context of high and rising inflation? That is a key challenge that either of us will face, no matter who wakes up as the treasurer on 22 May – it is a key challenge. And we have already put on the table two ways that we think we can start to make a meaningful difference. John, you ask about discretionary spending cuts. We have announced $3bn in trimming a budget which has gotten out of control when it comes to outsourcing, and labour hire and contractors and consultants in the public service. And we have said that there is something that can be done responsibly, modestly, carefully, to change the way that we tax multinationals so they pay their fair share of tax. Josh has said before he supports that. So I don’t know why all of a sudden he says he opposes it. We need to take this seriously. The budget’s got a trillion dollars in debt with not enough to show for it. Only one side in this election is being up-front with people about the task ahead. Q: We have an inflation issue in this country now that’s been misjudged by the Treasury, the Reserve Bank, the budget forecast inflation at just 4.25%. The RBA says it’s now going to peak at 6%. So my question is to both of you: The budget tipped an extra $39bn of discretionary spending into the economy at the time we’ve already got inflationary pressures. More commitments [are] being made during the election. Labor has also pretty much matched most of the government’s commitments and has some of its own spending priorities too. Are either of you prepared to make discretionary spending cuts or tax rises to help take pressure off the RBA on inflation and lifting interest rates? Or is this just a job for the RBA to keep lifting interest rates as high as they need without help from fiscal policy? Josh Frydenberg: Our plans have been set out in the budget and have been announced subsequent to the budget. Treasury was asked at budget estimates whether the announcements we made to ease the cost of living would have a material impact on inflation and they said no. And then if you look at the statement, which no doubt you would have looked at the statement from the Reserve Bank yesterday, they were very clear. In their words – these are not mine – the main driver of inflation has been international factors. And you had Moody’s come out yesterday and criticise the Labor party for trying to politicise the cash rate increase. You see, Jim, can’t have it both ways. He was criticising the Coalition when interest rates fell and yesterday he was criticising the Coalition when interest rates rose. And Moody’s called him out just yesterday in a statement, which is very unusual. And so the point here is it’s been the Covid pandemic and it’s been the war in Ukraine which have been the main drivers of the inflation. Now importantly you raised the notion of higher taxes. Other countries in the world, like the UK and the US, have lifted taxes through the pandemic. We have not. We have cut taxes by $40bn for households alone. And we increased that tax relief in the budget. It is a very different approach between us and the Labor party and the Australian people need to know it. We are prepared for the discipline of a tax-to-GDP cap at 23.9%. They are not. They took to the last election $387bn of higher taxes, something that Jim said at the time he was proud and pleased of, yet now they’re trying to hide and not reveal what their true intentions are until they have a budget if successful after the election. That’s not good enough. We know the Labor party will always tax more, they’ll always spend more, whereas our plans are set out very clearly in the budget. (The government defended its net zero by 2050 plan, which was released with less than 13 pages, after criticisms it had released a “pamphlet”.) Jim Chalmers: One of the reasons why the government is maintaining almost exclusively a focus on Anthony and the Labor party is that they’re hoping they can get all the way to the 21st of May without having taken any responsibility for this cost of living crisis which is punishing people right around Australia. And they have their little slogans about Anthony and about the Labor party because they can’t defend their record. As I said before, spent more, taxed more, borrowed more and delivered less. And because they’re entirely bereft of a plan for the future. Now the two things you need if you want to pitch up for a fourth term is the ability to defend your record and a plan for the future, and they have neither of those things and that’s why we get this pathetic point-scoring about Anthony. Anthony is one of the most experienced candidates for prime minister that we have had in Australia. He was in a key economic portfolio of infrastructure and he performed extremely well in it and so I think you can take all of this other rubbish from the government in that light. Q: My question is directed at the treasurer. A lot has been made by the prime minister and yourself regarding Anthony Albanese’s lack of economic experience, in particular the economic portfolio and not having done a budget. In fact, you have said it earlier in your speech. Do you accept that many Australian prime ministers have been in the same boat including Robert Menzies, Tony Abbott, Bob Hawke, looking elsewhere you’ve got Angela Merkel and you could look to the president of Ukraine being a comedian before he entered politics. Do you accept that they are effective leaders or have been effective leaders? And aren’t you reflecting back on them? Josh Frydenberg: Certainly not. What our major concern is with Anthony Albanese is what we have seen to date – which is after three years in opposition, a lack of a detailed economic plan. I mean, Jim put out a 13-page pamphlet and that’s what he calls his economic plan. Three-quarters of it was sledging the Coalition and then the last few pages was talking about some multinational taxes that they wanted to introduce, which was a rehash of what Bill Shorten had talked about, and the other part of it was to have a review after the election and we know he wants to have a budget after the election if he’s successful, but he won’t tell us beforehand what’s to go into that budget. The other is some more public servants. So I look at what Anthony Albanese has done with respect to his economic opportunity over the last three years to put an alternative plan and he hasn’t done so. And so that is what is most damning of him. And he was found out early on in the campaign when he didn’t know what the cash rate was and he didn’t know what the unemployment rate was and, as the prime minister said, it wasn’t whether a per cent was missing here, you know, 0.5% here or 0.5% there, he was just way off. And I had said during the budget speech, of course, which was sitting across the table, the unemployment rate today is its equal lowest in 48 years at 4%. And he didn’t know what it was. Now, Jim would have known it because Jim has worked in this portfolio. But at the same time, he is the leader of the Labor party and the choice is very clear – who is going to lead a Labor government if they were successful? It would be Anthony Albanese, not Jim Chalmers. Jim Chalmers: I don’t think the chief minister will let me down for beating me to an Andrew Barr shoutout. I think this is one of the defining issues in the economy. We’re up for a sensible conversation about the optimal migration mix as we emerge from the pandemic. My colleagues including Kristina Keneally and others have talked about trying to get that balance right between permanent and temporary. I think that is one of the big challenges. But bringing people in, even in sensible ways, should never be a substitute for training people for opportunities as well. You know, I agree with something that Josh said, which is inevitably it is a mix between the two things. Too often I think in the public conversation about skills and migration, people pretend that it’s one or the other, and in reality, of course, it’s a mix of both. Now our issue that we have with the government is they spend a long time hacking away at training and skills and Tafe in our economy, and now all of a sudden the chickens are coming home to roost. If you look at the Reserve Bank governor’s statement yesterday, I thought one of the things that really leapt out at me was the issue that you raise about capacity constraints and skill shortages are probably the defining capacity constraint. Now training is a big part of it, we’ve got a policy for fee-free Tafe, more than 400,000 places – that’s part of the story. But also childcare is part of the story here. If we want a bigger workforce, we need to make it more attractive and easier for people to earn more and work more if they want to. That’s a story about parents returning to work as well. Our policies are geared towards this challenge specifically. We’ve got inflation running out of control, we’ve got real wages falling – part of that is capacity constraints domestically, not just the international issues that Josh likes to lean on. And so that’s what our policies are all about dealing with. Q: Capacity constraints in the economy supply side issues are a big part of the rise in inflation and now interest rates. And also a big part of that story, the supply constraint story, is around the labour market – there’s severe labour market shortages. Business want two things – skills and a greater investment in skills, more upskilling for the nation. You both agree on that. They also want a boost to skilled migration. So we can get over the hump in the near term while we skill up the country. Why is neither of the major parties prepared to come to this election with a commitment to increased temporary skilled migration, at least for a temporary – sorry, for permanent skilled migration at least for a temporary basis. Josh Frydenberg: You won’t see from us cheap political opportunism when it comes to skilled workers. You will see that from the Labor party and we have seen that from the Labor party. Those skilled migrants perform an absolutely vital role in our economy, helping to address some of those workforce shortages, whether it’s engineers on mining sites, whether it’s IT programmers in our telecommunications companies or whether it’s people working in our hospitality industry. And since we opened the borders in November, we saw more than 70,000 skilled migrants coming to Australia. But it’s not just about skilled migrants, it’s also about labour mobility across state borders. And Andrew Barr is in the audience and we worked together around the council of federal financial relations table to get an agreement to occupational licensing changes which stayed in the too-hard basket for more than a decade. And what that will see is more than 150,000 people benefit as they move between states without needing a new licence, paying a new fee, a new qualification. And that’s going to provide more than a billion dollars of lift-off or benefit to the economy more broadly. And then the third aspect of this – because there’s no silver bullet, but it’s skilled workers, it’s labour mobility and also training up the Australian workforce. And we put aside more than $3.5bn in the budget for 800,000 new training places with a fundamental structural reform to our skilling system, to replace what is known as the Naswad with the states and territories and to use the National Skills Commission front and centre, with more efficient pricing and a better model rather than untied grants to the states. Our focus is on addressing some of those workforce shortages which are very real. But I do point out to everyone here, it’s a very clear contrast with Australia’s previous experience after coming out of recessions. In the 80s and 90s, unemployment remained elevated for up to a decade. This time around, when you speak to employers, the biggest issues is: “Where do I get more workers?” That’s good news for young people entering into the workforce and ultimately for our economy. Both are asked when the reckless spending will stop. Josh Frydenberg: As you know the peak of the pandemic we saw payments go up to about just over 30% of GDP. Now they have come down to 27% of GDP and are going to come down further to just over 26% of GDP. What we are seeking to do is to end that emergency economic support and we were criticised by Jim and his party for doing so. Jobkeeper, the Covid disaster payments, we were criticised by Labor when we brought that spending to an end. What we want is the economy to normalise and that means ensuring that we focus on the things that will boost the productivity of the nation and will create more jobs – tax relief, investing in more roads ... investing in water infrastructure and investing in telecommunications infrastructure. Jim Chalmers: We don’t doubt the government’s ability to make announcements, we doubt their ability to deliver them. And when you look at the spending in the budget, Josh wants to make an issue out of the things that we agree with the government on. I think Australians expect us from time to time to have the same view about some of the initiatives that he’s talked about. But this is a government which has spent more, taxed more and borrowed more than the last Labor government, but delivered much less, but that’s because the budget is absolutely riddled with rorts and waste and that’s why it’s heaving with a trillion dollars in Liberal party debt. So what Katy Gallagher and I have said is that immediately if we are elected to office, we will audit the wasteful spending in the budget, the rorts in the budget, to try to get the budget on a more sustainable footing so the spending in the budget, the investment in the budget, delivers a tangible economic return. Josh Frydenberg responds: It’s, of course, the Labor Party is always holier-than-thou, even though the paper showed the Labor Party were providing small grants in a whole range of targeted seats and we do know that the Labor Party in which Jim Chalmers was a shadow finance Minister ahead of the last election also had a park and ride scheme and Bill Shorten was announcing ahead of the last election. They’re about projects to get more people on to public transport. But with respect to local community programs, they’ll always exist, have always existed and they’ll continue to exist but our focus in the lead-up to election day has been making a big announcement, big announcements about glucomonitoring for people with people with type 1 diabetes, big announcements about the income thresholds for concession cardholders to make it more available to 50,000 seniors, big announcements around the copayment for PBS medicines. And so for - and also bic announcements about deeming. All of which - of all which - the Labor Party has simply copied us. So this is the Labor Party’s strategy: A small target strategy to forget about their addiction to higher taxes and simply to copy the Coalition. There’s four policies that we have announced in recent weeks where - the Labor Party was quick to say, “Yes, we’ll do that.” Wasn’t their idea, but, yes, to do that, because they know we were the ones who came up with cost of living measures. We were the ones who took to a budget just matter of weeks ago measures to halve the fuel excise. Things that Jim himself was questioning before we announced it. We took measures to - to the budget which we’re implementing now to ease the cost of living. We recognise this is the number one topic of discussion around the kitchen tables of Australians. Australians are doing it tough right now and just as we had their back at the height of the pandemic, we have their back now. The Labor Party is simply trying to sneak into Government and to copy our policies which are designed to ease the cost of living for millions of Australians. Q: I love my dog, Scully. I know we all love dogs. [Chalmers: We all love Scully] I took Scully for a run this morning without incurring any cost on the taxpayer. But the Coalition has promised $320,000 for a dog park in the marginal Liberal-held seat of La Trobe and Labor’s promised 200,000 to upgrade two dog parks in the marginal seat of Macquarie. Given the level of debt and deficit, why is it a good use of taxpayers’ money to expend that money on pampered pooches in marginal seats? And is there any productivity gain to be made by spending money on dog parks? Jim Chalmers goes first: There is a time for investment in communities, but you need to make sure that that spending is well motivated, that it’s not politically-motivated, and what we have seen, partly because of your work and Katina Curtis’s work, is we have seen from the most wasteful government since federation, we have seen people in ministerial offices pouring over colour-coded spreadsheets, allocating money purely for political purposes. This is one of the reasons why Australia doesn’t have enough to show for Josh’s trillion dollars in debt. This is one of the big problems we have got. And one of the most egregious examples of this was the more than $600 million committed to commuter car parks. Every 10th dollar of that, Josh committed to his own electorate. In some cases at train stations which soon won’t exist and he had to walk away from that commitment. None of them were even built and completed. Now, there is a problem in the budget with spending in politically-motivated ways. Now, our commitments are typically working with local Governments or state governments or others to make sure that we’re getting maximum bang for buck, which should be the test. There will be commitments made by all parties around Australia, the key is to make sure we get value-for-money for that. There is not been enough value-for-money in the budget to last almost 10 years. That’s why we got these high levels of debt and why we haven’t got enough to show for it and we are committed to doing better and we’re also committed to auditing this wasteful spending in the budget. Treasury and Finance within the first year of a Labor Government because Australians deserve better value-for-money for their cherished taxpayer dollars. Jim Chalmers responds: You’ve got to hand it to Josh. Even in the midst of a full-blown cost of living crisis, the most wasteful government since federation, taking for the first time to an election a trillion dollars in debt and almost nothing to show for it, and he’s still managed to find a way to give himself a little pat on the back. And it is incredibly frustrating for Australians right around this country for the treasurer and the prime minister in the midst of this cost of living crisis for them to be telling Australians just how lucky they are. Now Australians have had enough of this self-congratulation, they know after a decade in office the challenges in the economy are acute and they know that only Labor has a plan to take seriously and deal with these challenges. And that’s why the economic plan that we released is all about how do we deal – how do we grow the economy in an inflationary environment? How do we give cost of living relief over the long term, not just to get themselves through an election? You know, how do we get real wages growing again? How do we get some benefit from this trillion dollars in debt? These are the key questions which are being ignored in this flurry of self-congratulation from the treasurer. Australians are not asking for too much from us. They just want us focused on their everyday concerns: How do they feed their kids? How do they provide for their loved ones? How do they service a mortgage with interest rates rising? How do they save for a holiday when their real wages have been going backwards for some time, not the last few months? These are the defining issues in the economy and they should be the defining issues in the election as well. Now all of the numbers that Josh will tell you about commodity prices and all the rest of it, they are cold comfort for people who are doing it tough, and you can’t take credit for high commodity prices without taking responsibility for the rest of the mess that Australians in real communities right around Australia are dealing with. Laura Tingle, as the moderator and president of the National Press Club asks the first question: Let’s take a stocktake of what one of you will face after the election on May 21. Got a budget with unprecedented debt and deficits and in the budget that you handed down, treasurer, there was over $70bn of new spending, no savings and you basically relying on the economy growing to improve the bottom line. It’s now pumping more money into the economy as we speak and there are more election promises to come. That stimulus is now working against interest rates and monetary policy which raised yesterday, of course, and with the [Reserve Bank] governor indicating we’ve got at least a year of rate hikes to deal with inflation. Further, the outlook for Australians based on what the Reserve Bank had to say yesterday was for further cuts in real wages in the next three years. So my question to both of you is: The arms of economic policy seem wildly out of sync now. What are you going to do about it? Josh Frydenberg goes first: You raise debt levels which of course are higher, as they are around the rest of the world, given the size of the shock that we have faced. But what we saw in the budget was a material improvement to the bottom line by more than $100bn, the fastest fiscal consolidation in more than 70 years in Australia. We’re seeing deficits more than halve over the forward estimates and more than halve again over the medium term. We’re seeing the debt, as a proportion of the size of the economy, more than five percentage points lower than what was previously forecast. We have done so on the back of conservative commodity price assumptions, unlike the Labor party when they were last in government who baked in iron ore prices $180 a tonne. I’ve got in the budget iron ore at $55 a tonne, even though you’re selling today at $130 a tonne. I’ve got thermal coal in the budget at $60 a tonne, even though today it’s $360 a tonne. And same with metallurgical coal – $130 in the budget even though it’s selling for $[I miss that] a tonne today. If these commodity prices stay where they are for another six months, that will be worth an extra $30bn to our budget bottom line. But we took conservative commodity price assumptions and we saw that more people are going into work – three-quarters of the fiscal dividend that we saw and we banked in this budget came from having more people in work and fewer people on welfare. So our goal is to grow the economy, an economy that is expected to grow by 4.25% this year and 3.5% next year, an economy that is leading the world. Josh Frydenberg finishes with this: This is the choice – the Coalition under prime minister Scott Morrison who’s delivered a budget, who’s held a treasury portfolio, and Anthony Albanese who’s never delivered a budget, never held a treasury portfolio, doesn’t know what the cash rate is, doesn’t know the unemployment rate. That’s the clear choice for 26 million Australians. Josh Frydenberg takes to the lectern and lays out what the government has done during the pandemic and in the last budget. He goes on: Now the Australian people will go to the ballot box in just a few weeks’ time. They will face a very clear choice between a Coalition that has delivered more jobs and lowered the unemployment rate and a Labor party which when they came to government the unemployment rate was 4.4% and when they left government the unemployment rate was 5.7%. Between a Coalition that has delivered lower taxes – $40bn alone since the start of the pandemic – and a Labor party when they were last in government increased taxes by $120bn and took to the last election $387bn of higher taxes. And a Coalition that has steered the economy through the biggest economic shock since the Great Depression, leading the world with our recovery, and a Labor party that got the big calls wrong like on jobkeeper, when Anthony Albanese said the economic roof would come crashing down when it was ended, and they wanted a Covid disaster payment to keep going and they wanted to splash $6bn of taxpayers’ money on people to get the jab when they already had the jab. You see, the Coalition has delivered lower unemployment, lower taxes and a strong economic recovery and we have the plan to take Australia forward. Whereas the Labor party has no plan other than the 13-page brochure which means more public servants, another review and Bill Shorten’s old multinational tax agenda. Jim Chalmers finishes his speech with: What we are proposing is responsible and meaningful change, not radical change. We know that we can’t undo all of the damage done over almost a decade in one budget or, indeed, even in one term, but Australians are asking for better than this. Their government at the same time just promises them more of the same. But more of the same government means more of the same punishing combination of skyrocketing cost of living and falling real wages from a government that takes credit for the good things but none of the responsibility for the difficult things. And a prime minister who has excuses for everything, but plans for nothing. You can’t pay your mortgage or feed your kids with the excuses that we get from this government. So Australians have had the enough of excuse-making and the buck-passing, the overpromising and the underdelivering, and what we commit is to put people at the centre of our vision for the economy and to put a stronger economy at the centre of our vision for a better future. Speaking of debates, the prime minister may have snubbed the ABC for an election leaders’ debate but Anthony Albanese has agreed to appear on a one-on-one special edition of Q+A with David Speers as host on Thursday at 8.30pm. Scott Morrison accepted invitations to debate the Labor leader on two commercial TV networks and Rupert Murdoch’s pay TV platform – but has refused to appear on the ABC. You can read more about that here. Morrison has also declined an invitation to appear on Q+A. Q+A also hopes you can put your questions to Scott Morrison and has extended a standing invitation to the Prime Minister for a one-on-one special at any time during the campaign,” the ABC said. The Thursday night episode includes a live performance from comedian Sammy J, casting his satirical eye over the voting process. Q+A is simulcast LIVE around the country on ABC TV, ABC iview and ABC News on radio. ABC Australia also broadcasts Q+A into Asia and the Pacific. Nine’s debate on Sunday 9 May is 90 minutes long and will go to air after Lego Masters at 8.45pm. Seven’s debate with Mark Riley as moderator will air at 9.10pm on Wednesday next week. Labor’s Jim Chalmers won the toss and is speaking first. He says cost of living is the defining issue of the election campaign: And it didn’t just show up when Russia invaded Ukraine. It showed up when the Coalition, the best part of a decade ago, started attacking the wages and job security of Australian workers. And neither a war in Europe in 2022 nor even a pandemic explains or excuses what has been almost a decade now of economic mismanagement. Now, last Wednesday, Australians got confirmation of something that they already knew – that costs of living are out-of-control, that wages are nowhere near keeping up with inflation, and then a rate rise yesterday just added to the pain that so many are feeling – and there’s more rate rises to come. No wonder consumer confidence is absolutely plummeting. This is the thanks that Australians get for the sacrifices that they have made for each other to get through this pandemic – a country which rose to the occasion and a government which fell back into old habits. Now, from this lectern not that long ago, my opponent, who I respect, said that his hero throughout the pandemic is Margaret Thatcher. Margaret Thatcher, of course, said that there is no such thing as society. Well, I couldn’t disagree more. My heroes are the essential workers and the shift workers who did so much to keep the wheels of the Australian national economy turning throughout the course of this pandemic and the reward for their efforts can’t be another three years of working hard, but still going backwards in this economy. And the broadcast leaves the Anthony Albanese press conference to go to the debate between Jim Chalmers and Josh Frydenberg. Laura Tingle: I’d like to say the press club, as a platform for national debates, has invited the major parties to take part in debates on health, foreign policy, aged care, women and climate change. We have not been able to get the parties to agree on those debates. Q: On public sector wages, should the public sector get a pay rise to put pressure on the private sector? And around the Solomon Islands, Jason Clare said you are seeking an urgent briefing regarding what happened in the Solomon islands. Have you received that briefing and if so has it changed your tack on what the government will do? Anthony Albanese: We have asked for that to be scheduled in Canberra and that will be taking place. What is extraordinary is that the prime minister today has indicated that he still hasn’t spoken to the prime minister of the Solomons. I find that quite extraordinary. Q: You didn’t answer the question on public sector pay. Albanese: You only get one question (he has previously taken two from the same reporter). Q: If you agree to this extension of two years, it was introduced as an emergency measure, isn’t that just an acceptance that the cost-of-living crisis is going to continue for another two years, irrespective of who wins on 21 May? Albanese: What it is, is the recognition that people are doing really tough and is a recognition that the government’s measure of a $250 payment done during an election campaign and then ending after an election campaign is not good enough. It’s also a wrecking mission, I note that the interest rate fell four times between 2015 and 2019. There was no change during this entire period. Scott Morrison had to be dragged kicking and screaming to make any changes to deeming rates. This is the same prime minister who wanted to increase the pension age to 70. Q: The federal court earlier today upheld the sacking of baggage workers by Qantas was unlawful [but rejected they should get their job back]. Will Labor’s same job, same pay policy extend to outsourcing arrangements like this, that outsourced workers are paid the same as what direct employees are and, secondly, here in Victoria, how confident are you you can win and pick up seats and hold the things you have got here? Anthony Albanese: I am very confident that we can hold all of the things we currently hold and I note that we have a prime minister who won’t be campaigning in seats like Kooyong and seats like Higgins – it is a no-go zone for the prime minister. You have senior members of the government who were not putting the Liberal party logo on material and on the issue of an anti-corruption commission you had Josh Frydenberg just this morning disassociate himself from the comments of his prime minister – an extraordinary split between Josh Frydenberg and Scott Morrison over whether it was appropriate to call the ICAC in New South Wales a kangaroo court. You have chaos within the Liberal party here in Victoria, but that is replicated right around the country. We support, of course, respect the integrity of core processes, including industrial ones. Our processes will be worked through in terms of the details of the legislation with businesses, with unions. The principal is very clear, that people who are doing exactly the same job should be receiving the same pay. But we will work through those issues, constructively. One of the things I’ve said is that I will bring unions and business together. They have common interests. Q: Scott Morrison has described a risk of setting up a too strong an integrity commissioner would create a public autocracy. What do you think he means by public autocracy? Anthony Albanese: What he means is the reason why there is no national anti-corruption commission is sitting all in his front bench or behind him. That’s the fact of the matter. You have had these extraordinary attacks on a legal process the likes of which no national leader I’ve seen, whether it’s John Howard or Malcolm Turnbull or Tony Abbott, we have not seen anyone from either side of politics call a legal process that is not a court, it is a legal process, that Scott Morrison has repeatedly referred to as a kangaroo court. That’s an extraordinary statement to make, which is why the outgoing, one of the outgoing Icac commissioners has referred to that as buffoonery, the comments that have been made. Dominic Perrottet, the premier of New South Wales, has also stood up to Scott Morrison on this issue and I give Dominic Perrottet absolute credit for doing just that. I think in terms of the issues that are there, there are so many integrity issues where this government has just failed to give answers, whether it is the Leppington Triangle, $30m for land that was worth $3m, whether it is sports rorts, whether it be commuter car park fund rorts, including here in Melbourne, where you had car parks committed for commuters where there are no train stations. The abuse of taxpayers’ money that we have seen under this government, scandal after scandal, we never get answers over questions including about what the prime minister’s own office knew about issues. We still don’t have answers about the issues relating to Alan Tudge and compensation and payments that were made. This prime minister just dismisses any integrity issues. What is very clear is that if Australians want a national anti-corruption commission and to clean up politics, they need a Labor government to do so. Q: What is the RBA’s cash rate? Anthony Albanese: It is at 0.35. Q: If you form a government, what will you do when rates go up, are you going to simply blame Scott Morrison for it or will you have a way in which you can prevent them going to 2.5%? Anthony Albanese: One of the things that the Reserve Bank governor said yesterday was he spoke about domestic capacity constraints. One of those is about skills. That is a real constraint on our economy. We have around about 1.5 million Australians who either are unemployed or want more work – the issue of insecure work is a big one – it is what I have been speaking about since I have been Labor leader. The casualisation of the workforce, the use of labour hire, contracting out means insecure work, people need more hours, and those capacity constraints are things we will deal with. One of the things we have to do is boost productivity. So when we have prioritised what our spending commitments will be, they will be in areas like childcare that will grow productivity, that will produce a return just like our Tafe investment will. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, is up for his press conference after a morning campaigning in the Melbourne seat of Chisholm which Labor hopes to win from the Liberals. He is all about cost of living and Plans with a capital P. Labor Plans, that is. Not those other plans. The combination of low-wage growth, rising inflation and rising interest rates is putting real pressure on working families in the suburbs and the regional towns of Australia and Scott Morrison seems to think that people have got it easy in this country. Scott Morrison has an excuse for everything and a plan for nothing. He wants to always take credit when things are going well, but never accept any responsibility when things aren’t. Labor has a plan for growth, but growth in a way which doesn’t add to inflationary pressure. That’s why we’ve targeted areas such as education, whether it be early education through childcare that will boost workforce participation, that will boost productivity, whether it be schools or right here at this Tafe with 465,000 fee-free places in areas of skill shortage, or whether it be the 20,000 additional university places. One of the big chasms in Australian politics is on the area of education, whereby Labor understands that education is about opportunity and aspiration, but it helps not just individuals, it helps the entire country. We need to compete in this globalised world based upon how smart we are, not trying to drive down wages. Another thing about this government is that low-wage growth was a key feature of their economic architecture. They themselves say that. They are oblivious to the pressure that working families are under. Labor has a plan, whether it be for the cheaper childcare, cheaper electricity prices, investing in new industries, making sure that we have our National Reconstruction Fund, creating new industries and new jobs, new energy apprenticeships, of which we will have 10,000, fee-free places in Tafe, additional university places, this is all about growing the economy in a way that doesn’t add to inflationary pressure and our cost of living. And Australians, when they cast their vote on 21 May, can think about this, is this as good as it gets? Because a government that goes into its fourth term doesn’t get better, they just get more out of touch, more complacent, more arrogant, and that’s what we’ve seen from this government. Earlier today we reported that Qantas lost its appeal over a ruling that it illegally outsourced the jobs of about 1,700 ground handlers in part to avoid enterprise bargaining and protected industrial action. Qantas now plans to go to the high court to appeal the decision handed down by the full bench of the federal court. In a statement, Qantas said it “has always said the decision to outsource our ground handling function was based on lawful commercial reasons in response to the unprecedented impact of the Covid crisis”. Qantas is arguing that it was actively investing in ground handling equipment and that this is a sign it had no plans of outsourcing its internal operations. It has previously argued the outsourcing could save the airline $100m a year. We’ve covered off on the complex legal saga that has followed the Transport Workers Union’s initial legal challenge of the outsourcing here. Now, the matter turns to the judge presiding over ongoing remedy hearings, who will decide on what compensation for affected workers and financial penalties Qantas will have to comply with, after reinstating all workers was ruled out. However, Qantas is now insisting “today’s judgment does not mean Qantas is required to pay compensation or penalties”. We will be asking the Court to stay any further hearings on this issue until after the High Court process,” Qantas said. 18% interest rates were bad, but mortgages weren’t up to six times your income at the same time. Tanya Plibersek, who has been leading Labor’s campaign in marginal seats, is at this press conference. This is after questions had been raised by journalists on the campaign about why Plibersek wasn’t appearing with Anthony Albanese at campaign stops. Josh Frydenberg and Jim Chalmers will be debating each other at the National Press Club in just over half an hour. We’re not sure when Anthony Albanese will be stepping up for his press conference (he is currently baking apple pies at a Tafe). Here are the latest coronavirus case numbers from around Australia on Wednesday, as the country records at least 56 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 1 Cases: 1,080 In hospital: 67 (with 4 people in ICU) NSW Deaths: 21 Cases: 11,939 In hospital: 1,510 (with 68 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 0 Cases: 399 In hospital: 37 (with 1 person in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 8 Cases: 7,668 In hospital: 504 (with 21 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 12 Cases: 3,591 In hospital: 221 (with 11 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 1 Cases: 1,078 In hospital: 50 (with 2 people in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 11 Cases: 10,779 In hospital: 473 (with 25 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 2 (historical) Cases: 9,782 In hospital: 242 (with 10 people in ICU) This is not the official Tasmania Health account, but the numbers match the state’s health reporting. Scott Morrison would say this isn’t a photo op, it’s being shown the skills Australia’s apprentices are learning and then having a go himself. We are slowly getting the other jurisdictions’ reports: Auspol just continues to set insane posting standards. Bob Katter has released an advertisement comparing himself to the major party leaders in what is, of course, the most Bob Katter way ever. At least he isn’t shooting anyone this time round. This time round, Eric Abetz is running the biggest below the line campaign after losing his guaranteed Senate spot on the Liberal ticket. Qantas has lost its appeal over a ruling that it illegally outsourced the jobs of about 1,700 ground handlers in part to avoid enterprise bargaining and protected industrial action. On Wednesday morning a full bench of the federal court dismissed Qantas’s appeal of a July 2021 ruling that the airline had acted against protections in the Fair Work Act when it terminated approximately 1,683 ground handling and fleet presentation workers amid restructuring in November 2020. Qantas had claimed the outsourcing decision was a necessary financial measure that could save it $100m annually. The legal saga grew in complexity in the months following. Qantas appealed the ruling – the outcome of which was made today – at the same time as remedy hearings were taking place between the airline and the Transport Workers Union – the party which brought the initial challenge against the outsourcing decision. The remedy hearings previously ruled out ordering Qantas to offer the outsourced workers their jobs back, in part due to the third-party agreements Qantas had since entered into. The TWU appealed this decision, pushing for reinstatement to be reconsidered. The full bench of the federal court also considered this separate appeal from the TWU, however it was dismissed by Justices Mordy Bromberg, Darryl Rangiah and Robert Bromwich. From here, the saga will now return to the judge presiding over the remedy hearings, who will decide on what compensation for affected workers and financial penalties Qantas will have to comply with. The TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, said “safety, service and sentiment for the airline have all plummeted over this unlawful decision to outsource” and called on Qantas to discipline those responsible for the decision. “There is only one appropriate response from the Qantas board – heads must roll,” Kaine said. And that there, in Scott Morrison’s last answer, is the Coalition’s re-election platform – vote for us because we are not Labor. As Murph laid out yesterday: Vote for us because we’ll do great things is compelling, it’s always electrifying, whether you agree with the things or not. But vote for us because we are not Labor is the most unfulfilling call to action in recent memory. Is this really it? All you’ve got guys? At this moment in history? But voters should not assume because Morrison’s arguments are tired, self-serving, and often internally contradictory, that this shtick won’t work. It might work, and we know Morrison will throw everything he has at making his message stick. Q: How can you credibly claim to be a better economic manager than anyone? Scott Morrison: Because unemployment is at 4% and falling. Because our AAA credit rating has been maintained through one of the worst economic crises we’ve seen through the Great Depression, because there are more now more in work – in fact, 400,000 more in work after the pandemic than there were before. Because our rate of growth in Australia is stronger than we’ve seen in countries like the United Kingdom, United States, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada. All of these things. Australia’s economic performance during the pandemic has beaten the strongest and most advanced economies in the world. And what’s real is the pressures on the Australian economy. And all we are simply saying is this – those pressures will continue and my argument is based on our proven performance and our strong economic plan, that our government will be better able to shield Australians, whether they be self-funded retirees here and their access to part pensions, or whether they be Australians who are working, ensuring they have lower taxes and ensuring they have sensible housing policies like our home guarantee and many others that have seen 300,000 Australians get into their own home over the last three years. What I’m saying is, that our economic policies are going to more strongly shield Australians from these uncertain times and the economic pressures that they are facing, whether they be on interest rates or costs of living. And I’m also going to be upfront with Australians about the pressure they’re facing. I’m not going to tell them a fairytale like the Labor party is, that somehow how you vote on that day is going to make international pressures just vanish. That is a statement which betrays either a complete lack of understanding of the Australian economy, or just political cynicism taken to a whole other level by the Labor party. I understand the pressures that the Australian economy is under. I’ve been managing, together with Josh Frydenberg and Simon Birmingham and my whole cabinet, for the last three and a half years, and that has ensured that Australia is in a stronger position today than it otherwise would have been. Jobkeeper – 700,000 jobs saved. The cashflow boost, which got thousands upon thousands of small businesses through, who know that and who understand that, and understand that their businesses would not be around today. 220,000 apprentices that we could have lost over the course of the pandemic, finishing their training, in training today, the highest level we’ve seen since 1963. Q: Prime minister, have you spoken to [Solomon Islands prime minister Manasseh] Sogavare since you suggested he was merely parroting Beijing’s lines? And given that war of words, how can Australians trust to you rebuild that relationship on such a critical national security issue? Scott Morrison: I have had no discussions with him since the election was called. And since he’s made those comments. And I’d be looking forward to the opportunity on the other side of the election to continue to mapping that relationship positively. We are Solomon Islands’ primary security partner. That is something that the prime minister has conveyed to me again. And that remains the case. So we have a strong relationship with … Q: [On your words about parroting Beijing] Morrison: They weren’t my words. That was others’ commentary. They were not my words. Q: You said they were the same lines from Beijing? Morrison: I said there was a remarkable similarity. At his press conference on 29 April, Morrison responded to Sogavare’s comments that he only found out about the Aukus deal through the media and said: And so I did have that conversation with the prime minister the day following the announcement, and no issues were raised at that time in that discussion. But obviously, as time goes on and new relationships are entered into, there’s obviously been some clearly other influences in the perspective taken by the Solomon Islands prime minister. Now, I understand that. A journalist sought clarity on what Morrison was implying: Are you saying he’s parroting China’s rhetoric? His reply: There’s a remarkable similarity between those statement and those of the Chinese government. Q: Prime minister, who will your education minister be if you’re elected on May 21? Scott Morrison: I’ve answered that before. It’s Alan Tudge. If he’s available to come back into the ministry, he will. Q: What do you mean if he’s available? Morrison: He decided to stand aside for his own personal reasons and should he be in a position to be able to step up again, I would welcome him back. Q: Has he expressed an interest in doing that recently? Morrison: I haven’t spoken to him recently. Q: Do you support his campaign? Morrison: He doesn’t need my help there. He’s done a fantastic job in Aston and he enjoys strong support in Aston. Q: Is he joining you on the campaign? Morrison: He’s campaigning in Aston. He’s the member for Aston. That’s where I expect him to campaign. Q: Will you support Dave Sharma and [campaign in Wentworth]? Morrison: My mum lives in Wentworth. Q: Will we see you in those seats and can we get a clear answer from you on this it’s a question you’ve been asked a number of times now? Morrison: I will go where I believe it is best for my campaign for me to go. I’ll flag where I go on the day. You’re on the bus. You know. You find out where we go each day, just like it works in the Labor campaign. I’m not going to be telecasting where I’m going each day. That’s not something we do in campaigns. And you know that to be the case. Anne Ruston: Today we do recognise the women of Australia who have died at the hands of an intimate partner. As you rightly point out, this is a completely unacceptable statistic in a first-world country like Australia that we continue to wake up to news stories of another woman who has been killed in a gender-based violence situation. But as the government, I think no government has done more to support women who face family, domestic and sexual violence than this government. The next national plan to end violence against women and their children, a $2.5bn commitment over the first five years of the first action plan, a commitment to support Indigenous Australians with their own dedicated action plan, that’s currently being worked on and prepared by a group of leading Indigenous women, to make sure that we’re addressing the unique circumstances that they find themselves in and the unique challenges for their communities. But we simply must address the core of gender-based violence, which is disrespect and that is why this government has made major, major investments and commitments, not just to respond to domestic violence and support those people when they find themselves the victims of domestic violence, but making sure that we put things in place to prevent domestic violence from happening in the first place. Because unless we can stop domestic violence, we will never end domestic violence and we have a plan, a very, very strong plan, a plan that has been enabled, obviously, by a very strong economy, that has enabled us to put $2.5bn against the first five-year plan to address all the things that make up domestic, family and sexual violence in this country, whether it be prevention, early intervention, and recovery, so we can help people who have victims through that journey of dealing with trauma, getting themselves self-sufficient, getting themselves back on their feet and becoming financially capable. No government has done more to support Australia’s women. But today we recognise so many women whose lives have been cut short, so many children who have lost their mothers and some children that have lost their lives and I commend Hayley Foster for what she’s done in supporting and making sure that this issue is front of mind for every Australian. Because unless every Australian accepts their responsibility to end gender-based violence, we will end it and today I thank her for bringing this to everyone’s attention. Q: Prime minister, 18 women at least this year have died due to domestic violence. The National Women’s Safety Alliance today has been calling for a number of things, including a significant increase to social housing specifically for domestic violence victims. Is that something you would consider? And secondly, your assistant minister for women, Amanda Stoker, was recently at an anti-abortion rally. Given we’re having what’s been described as a national domestic crisis in violence, why is that what your MPs are focusing on? And do you agree with her views on abortion? Scott Morrison: Well, on the latter matter, there is no change to policy on that issue. I’m aware of the reports that are coming out of the United States, but that’s in a different country. In Australia there are no changes to those laws. So I don’t see it, really, as an issue. Q: But why is your assistant minister at an anti-abortion rally? Morrison: Well, it’s a free country. It’s a free country. But on the issue of domestic violence, it has been our government that has put in place record investments in dealing with exactly, as you say, I think it’s one every 11 days, women are killed by someone they know, a partner, and this is an horrendous, an horrendous statistic, and it’s real. And that’s why under our national plan, we’re the one who is have invested over $2bn, including specifically on the issues of accommodation, to support women fleeing domestic violence. That has been a big part of our plan and I’ll ask Anne to speak more to because she’s the minister for women’s security, and we have been investing and listening very carefully to those voices about how we can ensure women in those circumstances can get access to emergency accommodation they need. It’s a partnership, of course, with state governments and state governments invest in this as well and will continue to under the national action plan. But that national action plan, which has been running since the Gillard government, which we have actually invested in far more than when it was first established under Labor, because we believe in it. We absolutely believe in it. And we’ve stepped up financially. And the reason we can do that is because of our economic management, which enables us to invest in these services. Q: Would you commit to funding increasing healthcare and hospital funding in South Australia in order to hold on to the marginal seat of Boothby, given the recent successful campaign run by state Labor, Peter Malinauskas, on hospital and ambulance ramping? Scott Morrison: Well, what we have done over the course of the pandemic is we’ve funded 50/50, hospitals here in South Australia and across the country for all of their Covid-related expenses and that continues out to the end of September, where it will be considered again. We also struck an agreement with all states and territories, Labor and Liberal, about our health reform agreement that takes us well out for many years yet, and we struck that agreement and we’ve honoured it. And what that means is that our increase in investment in public hospitals across the country outstrips, outstrips state government expenditure increases in public hospitals every single year. So we are increasing our investment and particularly over the next few years. We’re increasing it by another $5bn of further investment in public hospitals right across the country. What I’d like the state governments to do is use it wisely and run better hospital systems. Every government can say it is making record funding in heath, as it increases with the population. Q: Can I ask you about the RBA: are you disappointed the Reserve Bank indicated rates would stay at historic lows until 2024, misguiding many Australian people in their investment choices? And what does this mean for the nation’s debt repayments, interest repayments, as interest rates continue to go up? We’re obviously already carrying a record rate of national debt. How much do you estimate that the nation’s interest repayments will go up in terms of billions of dollars? Scott Morrison: Well, a couple of things. Retaining our AAA credit rating means that those impacts will be limited. And because of the debt profile that we’ve been able to secure through our bond issuances, then Australia’s management of those issues under our jurisdiction, I would say, in the short to medium term, will continue to be in the know. Those matters haven’t been recalculated on our most recent. But our current level of debt is on current bond issuances and those rates are fixed on those bond issuances and as you go forward and do further tranches of bond issuances – I was the treasurer to do the first 30-year bond. We did 30-year bonds, locking in those rates over 30 years and we did that smartly during the course of the pandemic, and earlier when rates were really, really low. We’ve done the same thing as a government that Australians have been doing with their own finances. We’ve been locking in lower rates while rates have been low with our own bond issuances. I was doing that as a treasurer well before the pandemic hit. And we’ve certainly been doing it over the course of the last few years. And because Australia’s AAA credit rate something only one of nine countries to have it, that means when we go to the market to support our programs and when we did this in the middle of the pandemic – I can tell you on my dashboard that I would see every single day, particularly in those early phases of the pandemic, I was watching our issuances on bonds every single day and how many times coverage we were getting on those bonds because that was essential to be able to do what we were doing on jobkeeper. Now, we were getting many times coverage on those bonds every single day and that says the world’s financial institutions knew Australia had a strong economy, strong economic management, which would be able to see Australia through. Now, that has been proven by the endorsement of our AAA credit rating, one of only nine countries to do so, through the pandemic. So in answer to your question, Jono, economic management and strong financial credibility means that those borrowing costs are as low as you can get them. Look, on the RBA, no one has a crystal ball, and everyone can be critical in hindsight. But in the last 12 months, we have seen Russia invade Ukraine. And to think that that is not going to have an impact, particularly on energy prices, and supply chains and disrupt the global economy, well, I think that would be unfair. And I don’t think that would be a realistic ... I mean circumstances change. Events change. That’s what volatility and uncertainty means. And what I’m saying to the people of Australia is that uncertainty will continue. It will continue past 21 May. I mean, the waters will remain choppy globally and the headwinds will still be there. And what you will need is a government that knows how to handle this, that has been through the testing times of these last three years and has brought the Australian economy through. Now is not the time to risk Labor, who over three years still do not have an economic plan* and a Labor leader that doesn’t even know what’s going on in the economy and couldn’t tell what the cash rate or the unemployment rate even was three weeks ago. It’s not that he just got it wrong. He didn’t know. *Labor has an economic plan Q: Do they accept any responsibility for rates rising considering they’re now predicted to go to 2%? Scott Morrison: I’d have to put the same question. Moody Analytics have said, incorrectly, they say, the most recent hike in the cash rate has already been politicised by the Labor opposition as an indictment on the Coalition’s economic management. This is not accurate. That’s what Moody’s Analytics says. May’s rate hike is in response to the Australian economy being able to increasingly stand on its own after the unprecedented support that was offered during the pandemic. Now, there was nothing – well, I’m saying, there’s nothing in the Reserve Bank governor’s statement, there’s nothing in the credible analysis, that suggests that the rate rise yesterday was any response to government policy whatsoever. Whatsoever. I mean the rate rise yesterday was a function of the Reserve Bank saying that in, frankly, in the same way that we ended jobkeeper when we had to, that the Reserve Bank’s emergency rates that they’ve had in place for some time, as the Australian economy is strengthening and returning to normal, that they are relaxing those arrangements as well. So what Moody’s have said, what the Reserve Bank governor has said, is that Australia’s economic policies have been working through the pandemic, which have provided a shield to the Australian economy, which has enabled it to strengthen and come back again. And as a result, the emergency supports that we’ve had in place, that have been supporting the economy – the economy is increasingly able to do that without those supports. And so that’s the situation. Now, these pressures that I keep saying will continue, as the Australian economy continues to strengthen, and as the pressures from overseas – some of which are hopefully temporary when it comes to the war in Ukraine – but others, which relate to global supply chains are very real and structural and ongoing. That’s what has led the IMF to increase their estimates of global inflation to more than double just in the last 12 months. See, the thing about the economy and the world today is it is very uncertain. No one has a crystal ball that can tell you every single thing that will happen, and provide a guarantee around that. But what you can count on is whether the government has a credible economic plan, and has demonstrated through its own management the ability to shield Australia from the many negative impacts we’ve seen through this pandemic. And Australians have seen that. And that’s why at this election they do have that choice about proven economic management against the risk and uncertainty of a Labor party whose leader didn’t even know what the unemployment rate was and the cash rate was just three weeks ago*. *Expect to hear this line a lot more over the next two and a half weeks Q: The New South Wales Icac commissioner has labelled anyone who refers to Icac as “a kangaroo court” as “buffoons”. You’ve done that. Firstly, your reaction to being called a buffoon? And secondly, is this why Josh Frydenberg has said that he would choose his words differently when describing Icac to the way that you’ve described it? Scott Morrison: Well, I stand by what I’ve said about why I don’t think that model is a good model for the federal jurisdiction. He can say whatever he likes. He can say whatever he likes. I’m not easily offended. I think you’ve learned that about me. I’m quite resilient when it comes to those. He’s free to disagree with me if he wishes. I just don’t think that their model is the right model at a federal level. Q: Prime minister, you talked about wage growth yesterday ... You’ve talked about how quick the big four banks are to pass on interest rate rises but slow to deposit-holders. What’s your message to big four bank CEOs who are thinking of being, perhaps, a little bit slower and stingy in passing along that? And just the RBA now sees inflation peaking at 6%. We’re probably going to be lucky to get WPI at somewhere between 3% and 4%, if things go well. What’s your message to households who are looking down the barrel of having a fairly decent backwards steep in real wages in the coming years? Scott Morrison: First of all, when it comes to deposit rates, deposit-holders have been doing things tough. Self-funded retirees have been doing things tough. They’ve been, you know, pushing through this pandemic like so many others have. And my message to the banks is to give them a fair go. Those deposit-holders have stood by banks and holding their savings in banks and banks have, through the pandemic, supported mortgage-holders, provided mortgage relief. I acknowledge all of that. They’ve done that for businesses as well through the pandemic and I acknowledge what they have done there as well. And that is a positive thing that they have done for their clients … Now, you’re right about the pressures on the economy. And the Reserve Bank made it very clear yesterday that the inflation outlook, based on world events, will see inflation continue to have pressure upon it before later falling. But the good news yesterday was the Reserve Bank said that they are seeing evidence of wages rising. Now, our plan has always been for wages to rise by getting more and more Australians into work. That is what puts, ultimately, pressure on wages to rise and the Reserve Bank chair said very, very clearly yesterday, the governor said very clearly, that they are now seeing that. Now, I’m getting the same feedback from businesses as well, that they’re moving because of the competition for labour force all around the country, when unemployment falls to these levels and the Reserve Bank yesterday was saying that their revised outlook for unemployment is now down to 3.5%. Now, that’s better than a 50-year low. And this shows, I think, the strength of where the Australian economy was it. It was only a few years ago when Jim Chalmers, the Labor shadow treasurer, was attacking the government and saying it was an economic failure for rates to be falling, and now he’s attacking the government when the Reserve Bank has said that rates are returning to more normal levels. So you can’t have it both ways. See, the Labor party is trying to con the Australian people about what’s happening in the economy. What’s happening in the Australian economy and the global economy is real. You can’t wish it away. You have to deal with the reality of these pressures. And after 21 May, our government, or the alternative with Labor and the Greens and a cavalcade of independents, will have to deal with exactly the same issues and exactly the same pressures. Scott Morrison moves on to the deeming rates announcement the Coalition made today: What we’re announcing here on deeming rates is about giving self-funded retirees and pensioners a fair go. They’ve saved hard for their retirement. They’ve been doing it tough over the last two or three years as well. And they’ve been [trying] to eke out their earnings on superannuation for reduced rates for a long time. And we want to ensure that they have a fair go going forward and that’s what our economic shield is all about. And we don’t want to risk that economic shield with a Labor party that we know does not have the economic record of the Coalition, a Labor leader who even just three weeks ago didn’t even know what the interest rate was, let alone how to deal with it, or a Labor party who we know just doesn’t know how to manage money. And it’s those it’s those self-funded retirees and pensioners I spoke to this morning, they’re the ones who experienced the 18% interest rates. They know what it’s like when a Labor party loses control of the finances. They know what it’s like to run small businesses as they did as they were saving for their retirement many years ago, when a Labor party has a recession that they had to have, as they were told by the Labor party. They understand the risk of what happens when you get a Labor party that doesn’t know how to manage money, because they paid the price and they paid a heavy price and I want to make sure they get a fair go. The prime minister is in Radelaide where the Liberal party is working to hold on to Boothby. But the press conference is all about the cost of living and the “shield” Scott Morrison has invoked for the last few days, in an attempt to head off blame for what has happened under the government’s watch. He is once again walking the line that the government had no control or influence over the cost-of-living pressures that have hit, but at the same time, his government is the only one which can manage and control those influences in the future: In making the decision they [the RBA] made, as Australia comes out of this pandemic there are many pressures that continue, whether they be on interest rates, whether they be on the cost of living, these pressures are real and after 21 May they remain as real and they will continue and that’s why our economic plan is about providing that shield to Australia from these pressures to mitigate and lessen the impact of these pressures that are occurring from around the world. That is why Australia has found itself in a stronger position when it comes to issues of pressures on inflation or pressures on rates. Australia is faring much better and that’s because of an economic plan that understands and pre-empts, in many respects, these impacts on the Australian economy. And that will continue in the years ahead. That’s why I’ve said from the outset of this campaign that this election is a choice and it’s a choice about who is going to be better able to manage these significant pressures on the Australian economy in the years ahead. Pressures that will impact on you and your family. On your income, on your retirement income, on your jobs, on your communities, because these pressures will continue to be real. The election doesn’t change what the pressures are. The election can change, though, who is managing those pressures on your behalf and the strength of the economic shield that is available to you because of the economic management credibility and policies of the government. And that’s why, with these pressures on the Australian economy, now is not the time to risk Labor and the risk of Labor is very real. They will tell you that simply a vote at the election will make these pressures fade away*. Australians know that’s not true. And they know that shows a lack of understanding about the very real economic challenges that the country continues to face. *Labor has not said this – it has been very clear that whoever wins will inherit the pressures and there will be no sudden turnaround. Property groups are expecting to see a slowdown in construction with the interest rate rise, as AAP reports: Rising interest rates are expected to curb demand in Australia’s construction industry, particularly in the residential sector, Ai Group says. The Australian Industry Group/Housing Industry Association performance of construction index eased 0.6 points to 55.9 in April, but held above the crucial 50-point market that separates expansion from contraction. Ai Group chief policy adviser Peter Burn said while new orders were growing at a faster rate than in March, the industry was finding difficulty sourcing materials and labour, as well as facing continuing prices pressures: The rise in interest rates announced yesterday by the Reserve Bank and the further rises foreshadowed can be expected to ease demand growth somewhat, particularly in the residential sectors. Burn said while both the federal and state governments were adding to their infrastructure pipelines, the ability of the industry to meet still higher levels of activity would depend on the supply of skilled labour, including from abroad, and on the success of efforts to repair disrupted supply chains. Comments from home affairs minister Karen Andrews have drawn the ire of Solomon Islands prime minister Manasseh Sogavare: It is not the first time Andrews has referred to Pacific nations as “our backyard”. This was her comment in a Sky News interview last month: Q: Minister, thanks so much for the chat. Let’s not muck around here; this is a sovereign country. A sovereign country can make its own decisions but also its own mistakes and it’s also very obvious that China – who has had it out for this government since you stood up to them on the pandemic – is more than happy for this to have played out like it has for the past week. Andrews: Well, that’s an observation that many people are making. Anyway, we’ve been very clear as a government that Solomon Islands is a very good neighbour of ours and we are a very good neighbour to Solomon Islands. The Pacific region is our region and what is happening there is effectively happening in our backyard. We are very conscious of the action that China has taken. Now, anyone who thinks that the only action that China is going to take is to sign an agreement with Solomon Islands and that will be it, is quite frankly quite naive in their thinking, because what China is doing – is more at the start, rather than at the end of what China is likely to do in our region. Now as a government, we are very mindful of China’s activities and we will always put Australia’s interests first, second, third and fourth, and that’s the way we will be proceeding. I think there are a lot of questions that people should be considering and really thinking about. The NSW teachers’ strike march has begun. Teachers and their union representatives want the government to come to the table on pay negotiations and address staff shortages. Negotiations have been called for since February 2021. The government asked teachers to wait until after the budget is handed down next month before striking. Industrial actions have been suspended in the past but negotiations have not moved forward, hence today’s strike. Michael McGowan and Joe Hinchliffe have taken a broader look at One Nation’s candidate selection: One Nation was still scrambling to find people to run for this month’s federal election just hours before the close of nominations, telling one prospective candidate to leave the electorate he was running in “blank” on his form while the party desperately tried to fill seats. Guardian Australia can also reveal that several of the candidates chosen to run for the party live in other states than the seat they’re standing in, including a husband-and-wife couple selected to run in separate seats in New South Wales and Victoria. After his op-ed was published in the Nine newspapers, former Liberal deputy leader, senator and minister in the Fraser government Fred Chaney spoke about why he is backing independents, like his niece Kate Chaney, who is running in Curtin, over Liberal candidates. Fred Chaney quit the Liberal party in 1995. Asked why he was speaking up now on ABC radio, he said: I’m sick of being a quiet Australian. I’m fed up of the way that parliament has operated and I think it’s time for a change. It will come only if the major parties are forced to change. The reality is that we’ve got people in parliament now whose primary interest is the business of politics and not enough interest in the business of good government. And I like to think that in previous generations there were people there whose primary concern was the national interest, who really looked at the facts and tried to get the right answers, rather than saying, ‘What’s the political answer we can get away with today and that’s the way we’ll go.’ I’m not sure who thinks politicians are hard done by or need less accountability than the public sector, but Scott Morrison seems to think it is a winning argument: Scott Morrison has ratcheted up his warnings against a powerful national anti-corruption commission, arguing handing control over to “faceless officials” could turn Australia into “some kind of public autocracy”. Amid growing political pressure on the Coalition over its failure to meet its previous election promise to legislate a commonwealth integrity commission, the prime minister told the Nine newspapers politicians were accountable to voters at elections. He argued elected members should be able to allocate funding for infrastructure and community grants and without undue fear of public servants investigating those decisions. The Antipoverty Centre is holding an online launch of its rental assistance overhaul policy this evening as it tries to drag the major political parties to a position that recognises the 21st century pressures people on income assistance face (Australia’s social security safety net has not really been updated since the 1990s): Details can be found here but some of the centre’s research has found: Only 39% of people on the JobSeeker payment are accessing rent assistance. The maximum assistance available is $48 per week for someone living in a share house or $73 for someone living alone. We have compared DSS data to show that the number of people who rely on JobSeeker (formerly Newstart) has increased by 41% to 786,139 people (83.84% of all people on JobSeeker) compared to 557,395 before the pandemic. Antipoverty Centre analysis of ABS and Department of Social Services data shows that while the unemployment rate has not been this low since before the global financial crisis in 2008 when it was also 4%, the proportion of working age people who rely on an unemployment payment has nearly doubled – from 3.3% in mid-2008 compared to about 5.9% today. A November 2021 Ipsos poll found 65–74% support for JobSeeker payments to be above the poverty line in Liberal-held marginal electorates. The electorates polled were Boothby, Swan, Longman, Blair and Dobell. Between 49% and 60% of voters in the five seats said they would consider changing their vote to a party that would lift the rate above $69 a day – an increase of 50% on the current rate. The Coalition is running a dual line at the moment, which is essentially – we had no control over interest rates, but you can only trust us moving forward to keep things under control. Here was Anne Ruston explaining how this wasn’t contradictory on ABC radio this morning: Q: You seem to take the responsibility when the news is good. But then say that there are global factors. This is the disconnect, isn’t it? Ruston: Not at all. I think what you’ve got to do is we’ve got a look at our track record, a track record where invariably interest rates have been lower. Certainly the unemployment rate has been low and under the government, under Coalition government, we inherited a 5.7% unemployment rate at 4% today and expected to go lower. And you also have to remember that Mr Chalmers has actually set a test for the government coming through the pandemic where he said the government would be judged on the unemployment rate in relation to how we handled the pandemic. We came out of the other end of the pandemic with unemployment rates that are actually now seeing wage growth, which is something that obviously all Australians welcome at the same time as we are opening the economy. Now, this is a supply-driven inflation increase, and it is true that supply issues are being driven by international factors, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and ongoing Covid shocks. But there are domestic issues at play too. And wage growth in some sectors is not matching inflation. Overwhelmingly, wage growth has been stagnant, which is compounding the inflationary pressures, and late last week we also learnt power prices would be increasing because of the growing price of fossil fuels – which Australia’s power grid still relies on and under the Coalition has been very slow to shift from. The government is relying on people hearing its message and not that disconnect. It’s not just new candidates who have problems with previous tweets. Those who have been in political life – in both opposition as well as government – haven’t seen all their tweets age so well either. We asked Border Force yesterday morning to confirm that asylum seekers were being moved from the Melbourne immigration transit accommodation centre to Christmas Island and, this morning, received this response: The ABF does not comment on the details of specific operational matters. The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said yesterday that it had spoken with people inside Mita who said some detainees had been handcuffed and loaded on to minibuses and were believed to have been taken to Christmas Island. Protesters, including Greens senator Lidia Thorpe, blockaded the centre yesterday afternoon. They said they were attempting to prevent the transfer of 12 people. The ABF would not say why people had been moved. The Morrison government reopened the Christmas Island detention centre in August 2020. There are now about 212 people held in detention on Christmas Island, 90 of whom had their visas revoked by home affairs minister Peter Dutton. Josh Frydenberg, who is one of those inner-city Liberals trying to hold on to their seat against an independent challenger, wouldn’t repeat the term “kangaroo court” when asked about it on the ABC today – but still tried walking both sides of the fence. Q: Just about out of time but integrity is one of the key platforms that [challenger] Monique Ryan is campaigning on. Do you agree with the prime minister that the New South Wales Icac is a kangaroo court? Frydenberg: He’ll explain his comments. What I would say ... Q: Do you agree with the prime minister the Icac in New South Wales is a kangaroo court, yes or no? Frydenberg: I would put it to you like this. I think the Icac has produced results where good people have left office without convictions being made and without huge amounts of evidence. Q: Would you use the words kangaroo court to describe that body? Frydenberg: I would use different words. Q: Are you angry with the prime minister for using those words? Integrity, a stronger anti-corruption body, is a key issue in your seat, as you well know. Frydenberg: We’ll all use our own words to explain our own positions. I support a commonwealth integrity commission. We have a model for doing so. It’s got a public sector division, it’s got a law enforcement division, I put more than $100m towards its establishment. It’s got to be the right model. In terms of having people proven guilty when they’re not. Your reminder that the government model does not look into non-criminal corruption, Icac does not make findings or pass judgment, it hands a brief of evidence to the Department of Public Prosecutions which makes the decision whether or not to press charges and take it to court, and Gladys Berejiklian and Barry O’Farrell both resigned. I was getting to this, because it is very important – despite the criticism from outgoing Icac commissioners, despite the reports that this rhetoric is playing very badly in inner-city Liberal-held seats and despite the untruths – Scott Morrison is continuing his attack on Icac. He told Nine Newspapers: Outgoing NSW Icac commissioner Stephen Rushton didn’t hold back while speaking to a parliamentary review about the attacks against the commission, taking aim at those who had called it “a kangaroo court” – a term Morrison has repeatedly used to describe the commission. Rushton: To those buffoons who have repeatedly described this commission as a kangaroo court, I would say three things. First, it is deeply offensive to the hard-working staff of the commission. It undermines the institution. Second, there are vast differences between the functions of the commission and a court. Those differences are readily accessible, and there has been much written about those vast differences. To describe us as a kangaroo court is not just misleading, but untrue. To make an uninformed comment that this commission is a kangaroo court has a real capacity to undermine the commission’s work, and just as importantly, public confidence in public administration. Covid continues to make an impact across the nation: Social services minister Anne Ruston is not exactly known for her communication skills. But the South Australian knows how to stick to a line when she has to. And stick to it she will, as she did on ABC radio RN this morning. Has the government done the numbers on how many mortgage holders will find themselves in economic distress from the rate rises (some reports put it at 300,000)? Ruston: Well, certainly the banking sector has indicated they believe there is great resilience being built into all people who have done, have taken out loans in recent times when the interest rates were as low as they have been through the pandemic and they have built into those those rates the buffer that allows people to have some confidence that they have got the scope for the normalisation of interest rates going forward. But we’re not under estimating in any way shape or form the pressures that are on Australians at the moment, and it’s not just about interest rates, it’s more generally about cost of living. And that’s why we put the measures that we did in the budget, things like the halving of the excise and the $250 hit people’s bank accounts last week, the extension of the low and middle income earners tax offset, as well as continuing to put tax relief policy in place for Australians and Australian families and Australian businesses because collectively the government understands that it’s a suite of measures that will support Australians. Here’s the official government announcement on that: A re-elected Morrison Government will guarantee the rate used to determine the income earned from financial assets will be frozen at today’s record low level for the next two years to ensure payments are not reduced as earnings increase from deposit accounts held by social security recipients. The Prime Minister said about 450,000 Age Pensioners and 440,000 other payment recipients would benefit from greater certainty around their fortnightly social security payments because of the Government’s deeming rate freeze. “This is another shield to help protect Australians from the cost of living pressures people could feel from an increase in interest rates,” the Prime Minister said. “In addition to our indexation of social security payments, we will guarantee the rate of income for people who could otherwise see their social security income drop because of the increase in interest rates.” The lower deeming rate will be frozen at 0.25% for financial investments up to $53,600 for single pensioners and $89,000 for pensioner couples. The upper deeming rate will remain at 2.25% on investment assets over the amount of $53,600 or $89,000 respectively. In a move designed to hold on to what is known as the “grey vote”, the government has announced a two-year freeze on deeming rates, in response to the interest rate rise. That means pensioners with cash deposits which will increase with the rate rise (interest rates on bank accounts go up too) won’t have to worry about hitting the cap of how much they can earn before their pension is impacted. Labor has matched it, with Kristina Keneally telling the ABC: We have always said where there are good ideas we will support them. We sought to be constructive during the pandemic and did support many of the measures and, you know, looking at this decision today, we have said, yes, this is a good idea and we will. Scott Morrison was by Josh Frydenberg’s side yesterday afternoon after the rate rise was announced but he hasn’t been playing a role in helping Frydenberg fight for his seat. ABC News Breakfast asked why. Q: When is the prime minister joining you in the hustings in Kooyong? Frydenberg: He already has, we went to a religious service at a local synagogue and no doubt he has many competing requests on his ... Q: It’s a pretty key seat. You know full well yours is a very key seat. You are a potential future Liberal party leader and prime minister if the government’s re-elected. Why won’t the prime minister campaign with you, go to local shops in the suburbs of Camberwell, side by side with you and speak to voters? Frydenberg: Well, thanks for that vote of confidences are but I think I’m the best advocate for myself. Q: What are you afraid of? Why are you scared to bring the prime minister into Kooyong. Frydenberg: I’d put it to you, to the contrary. I’d say to you – I am the best person to sell the government’s message to meet my own local constituents and to be out there campaigning myself as I have been doing for the last three years in my local area. I have to say, I have never taken my local area for granted. It’s been a privilege to respect them for the last 12 years. I fought hard for local infrastructure projects, I fought hard for local community organisations, I fought hard to support our ... Q: But why – why won’t you get the prime minister to say just that on your behalf? He is of course the leader of the country and your party in those suburbs in Kooyong? Frydenberg: There’s 151 seats in the country and he’s already been to my seat. Q: But that wasn’t, as you say, it was quite rightly to celebrate Passover, it wasn’t a full campaign stop in going to shops and speaking to voters on the street. Frydenberg: Can I just tell you once again – I think I’m the best advocate for myself and for the Liberal party in my own seat. I’m looking forward to debating Monique Ryan. I like to have debated her in another channel studio but she refused to do so. She’s a former longstanding member of the Labor party. She sought to conceal it, she won’t tell our local community how she will vote on the other side of election in the event of a hung parliament. I think that people is of Kooyong deserve better. Former longtime WA senator, deputy Liberal leader and Fraser government minister Fred Chaney (he quit the party in 1995) has an op-ed in the Nine newspapers today about how he believes the Liberal party has lost its way. His niece Kate Chaney is running as an independent in Curtin, where she is posing a strong challenge to Celia Hammond, who was elected after Julie Bishop retired. Fred Chaney wrote: Don’t expect the government to undergo a spiritual or moral conversion to the need for accountability, the need to use borrowed and taxpayer funds for public rather than party interest as shown by the absurd levels of pork barrelling, the need to repair the aged care system, the need to end the use of cruelty in our refugee policies and obscenities like the robo-debt approach that unlawfully pitted a bullying government against those least able to resist. The government will only change its approach if the parliament does not tolerate these things. The moderate Liberals have shown they do tolerate these things by supporting the government in doing them. Neither major party should be trusted with absolute power. Josh Frydenberg has also seized upon the RBA’s mention of international pressures: Well, ultimately what we’re seeing is the normalisation of monetary policy just as we saw the normalisation of fiscal policy and that shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone as they understand international markets and they have seen other central banks move globally in the same way that the central bank of Australia has done. You’re absolutely right – the Reserve Bank did say that the main drivers of yesterday’s rate rise were international global factors and particularly what that means is that the Covid pandemic has led to supply-side disruptions which have increased freight costs by up to fivefold and we have also seen the impact of the war in Ukraine with a spike in commodity prices, not just fuel, but also wheat and other commodities. Now, with respect to domestic challenges that we face, the biggest issue for employers today is how do they get more workers and that is one of the challenges that we’re seeking to meet with more than $3.5bn set aside in the budget to create 100,000 new training places. What we’re seeking to do is make it easier for workers to move between states to take jobs, and obviously we got skilled workers coming into our country as well. So that will help meet some of those supply-side constraints including our massive $120bn infrastructure plan and rollout, which is actually creating a more productive economy. Josh Frydenberg, meanwhile, says the government will only take responsibility for the factors he says it can control. He told ABC News Breakfast: Our responsibility is for the economy more broadly and, whether it’s interest rate changes or whether it’s the fall in the unemployment rate, or whether it’s the growth numbers, we take responsibility right across the economy for the factors that we can control. This seems to be a preview of where Jim Chalmers will be going at the press club today: You know, the economic jargon talks about capacity constraints and what that really means is whether or not the economy can grow strongly enough without adding to these inflationary pressures, and the key issues there are are you training people to deal with skill shortages? Are you reforming childcare so that more people can work more and earn more? Are you dealing with issues around infrastructure in the digital economy? Are you investing in new secure well-paid jobs. And those issues are absolutely central to our economic plan. The government’s got a plan to get themselves through an election. We’ve got to plan for a better future with a stronger economy at its core. Jim Chalmers is also everywhere this morning. He is asked, while on ABC radio RN, whether the Reserve Bank’s comment that there has been some increase in wages takes away one of Labor’s attack lines. Chalmers: Well, the last wages data we have has wages a bit over 2%, which is nowhere near inflation at 5.1%. We’ll get some more data on wages in a couple of weeks’ time and I genuinely hope that real wages begin to pick up because, even with that unemployment rate coming down in welcome ways, we’re not seeing the real wages growth we need for ordinary Australians to keep up with the skyrocketing cost of living, and that’s why they’re falling further and further behind. And the government has made 55 wage projections over the course of their almost decade in office. They’ve been wrong 52 of those times. It’s a government notorious for over-promising and under-delivering on wages, and we can’t see that again. And the last of the big four banks have passed on the rate increase. Rate rises tend to get passed along faster than rate cuts. Josh Frydenberg has been doing the media rounds this morning, defending the government’s record on the economy. He and Jim Chalmers are due to debate each other at the National Press Club today. It’s going to be a long day. There’s apparently 24 useful hours in every day. And on day 24 of the election campaign that won’t end, Australia will use them to talk about interest rates. John Howard, who not only lost the election, but his seat in parliament in 2007 – the last time an interest rate rise was announced during an election campaign – says there is no problem for the government. Scott Morrison won’t stop talking about the economic “shields” he says his government provided during the pandemic and choices about who should handle the economy. Anthony Albanese is all about the “triple whammy” and trying to get at least some of the blame to stick with the Morrison government. Meanwhile, people already on the bubble of economic stress are facing watching rates rise to 2.5 %. And while that’s not the 17% rates those in the 1990s experienced, people didn’t tend to have million-dollar mortgages then either, or have spent more than six times their earnings on their house. Wages have not increased in a real sense for close to a decade. That’s a problem in itself but it’s an even bigger problem when the cost of living inflates and suddenly your dollar doesn’t go as far. For those on income support, it’s even more dire. Rentals are already beyond reach. If you don’t think landlords won’t pass along any interest rate rises, then I’ve got a bridge I’d like to chat to you about taking off my hands. That’s on top of power prices increasing, basic, non-discretionary items increasing and transport costs increasing. So it’s not about what to eat, it’s about if you eat. If you go at all. If you use the power. Those have already been hard choices for people on low incomes. Now they are becoming impossible ones. In NSW, teachers will go on strike after the government didn’t come to the table with a pay rise to address shortages. Premier Dominic Perrottet asked teachers to wait until the budget is delivered next month to negotiate – unions said teachers had waited long enough, with the latest round of negotiations having been sought since February. Last year. So strap in for what’s going to be a pretty political day debating what is a very scary and real issue for many of us. Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Daniel Hurst, Josh Butler and Paul Karp are keeping watch and you have Amy Remeikis here on the blog. I’m not ready either.

Another blow to the UK economy: Philips has announced plans to shut a UK factory with the potential loss of 430 jobs. The Dutch company plans to close its baby bottle plant at Glemsford in Suffolk in 2020 and transfer most of the work to its home country. Newsflash: Theresa May will not be trekking to Davos next week to scoff fondue with the global elite. The PM’s office has just announced that she’s staying in London to focus on Brexit talks with MPs across the House of Commons, in the hope of reaching a breakthrough. That’s the third high-profile withdrawal in a week. French president Emmanuel Macron is remaining in Paris, where he’ll focus on the Yellow Vest protests. Donald Trump is also staying at home, perhaps concluding that swanking around a ski resort during a government shutdown isn’t a great look. Back in the markets, one of Apple’s key suppliers has sent shivers through the tech sector. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s largest independent semiconductor-maker, has slashed its revenue forecast by 14%, and is also reining in investment. It comes two weeks after Apple shocked the markets with a profits warning, as growth in the once-booming smartphone sector slows. The US shutdown is causing considerable pain to federal workers, whose pay checks are on hold. But it doesn’t seem to be driving up unemployment, yet anyway. New figures show that the number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits unexpectedly fell last week, by 3,000 people to 213,000. That suggests the labour market is still robust, extending a long run of impressive ‘initial claims’ figures dating back to Barack Obama’s presidency. Over in Greece, where the government has survived a late-night confidence vote, fears of snap elections have been put on the back burner. However, ministers’ relief is being clouded by warnings that, once again, Athens is dragging its feet on reforms. A jubilant Alexis Tsipras may have survived the vote - welcoming his narrow 151-148 ballot victory as “a vote of confidence in stability ” - but the challenges before him are far from over. The first is passage of the landmark Macedonia name-change accord that prompted the leftist leader to call the confidence motion after the Independent Greeks party, his coalition’s junior partner, quit in protest over it. Pulling the same hat trick is far from certain. With the centrist Potami party wavering, it remains unsure if he will win a decisive majority. Although Tsipras has touted the renewal of confidence in his government as the card he needs to push ahead with other initiatives – from increasing the minimum wage to implementing a new payment scheme for unpaid social security contributions - his government faces growing pressure from the creditors who have bailed out the debt-stricken country to keep up with reforms. Addressing the Greek-French chamber of commerce and industry in Athens on Wednesday night, the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said it was crucial that politicians stayed the course. “Greece has not yet reached the end of the road,” he said insisting that five months after exiting its third international bailout, foreign auditors were still watching the country closely. “The coming weeks will be decisive … it is very important that politicians don’t disengage from the agenda of reforms.” Auditors, who return to Greece next week, are especially worried about Tsipras’ pledge to push ahead with handouts – not least raising the minimum wage – and the high stock of nonperforming loans in Greek banks which have played a central role in impeding Athens’ hopes of returning to capital markets. Like every government before it, the Tsipras administration faces immense anger over enforcement of reforms with thousands of teachers taking to the streets- and civil servants walking off the job - today. Ouch. Over in New York, Morgan Stanley has just missed Wall Street forecasts. The bank posted profit of 80 cents per share, below the 89 cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Revenue declined by 10% to $8.55bn -- analysts expected $9.3bn. Both its trading and wealth management divisions missed forecasts. UK lenders have become pickier about who they hand credit cards to, the Bank of England’s credit conditions survey shows. It also highlights that risk appetite has been declining for the last couple of years: Economist Howard Archer of the EY ITEM Club says economic uncertainty is hitting demand for credit: Brexit is having an even bigger impact on credit card lending than the financial crisis of 2008, points out Andy Bruce from Reuters: NEWSFLASH: Demand for mortgages and credit is sliding as UK consumers brace for Brexit. The Bank of England has just reported that demand for new house loans in January-March is likely to fall at the fastest pace since 2011. Demand for credit card lending is also shrivelling, and expected to fall at the fastest rate since records began in 2007, the BoE adds. This suggests that worried consumers are putting house moves and purchases on hold, as they worry about the UK’s future, with parliament still deadlocked the way forward. This data comes from the Bank’s latest credit conditions survey, just released. It’s based on data from bank and building society lenders. The Bank says says: Lenders reported that demand for secured lending for house purchase decreased significantly in Q4, and was expected to decrease further in Q1. However, demand for secured lending for remortgaging increased slightly in Q4, but demand was expected to decrease slightly in Q1. Overall demand for unsecured lending increased significantly again in Q4; this was solely driven by a significant increase in demand for credit card lending. However, lenders expected a significant decrease in the demand for credit card lending in Q1, with demand for other unsecured lending expected to be unchanged. Here are the key charts: Overnight, we learned that UK house prices are now falling at the fastest rate for six years - another sign that exiting the EU is affecting the economy. The UK energy’s strategy has been plunged into a “full-blown crisis”, as Hitachi suspends plans to build a nuclear power station in Wales. China’s Ministry of Finance has hit out at US authorites for launching a criminal probe into Huawei. MOFa spokesperson Hua Chunying has told reporters that China is concerned by the “unusual handling” of the case by US prosecutors, suggesting it was driven by political considerations. Hua added that if civil cases are used “arbitrarily to suppress Chinese enterprises then this is not only a violation of free and fair business competition but a violation rule of law.” China’s media are also critical of the move, giving another insight into Beijing’s thinking. Global Times wrote in an editorial today in response to the WSJ story and the proposal from US lawmakers to ban chip sales to Huawei that the ‘persecution of Huawei’ is a form of ‘technological McCarthyism”. It says: “America’s treatment of Huawei is full of geopolitical daggers… The US is angry because of China’s progress. If China wants to keep developing, China needs to bear these kinds of setbacks.” “The US has prevented these companies from remaining separate from politics. The US has branded Huawei and ZTE as political, and this is a technological Mccarthyism.” Trade war concerns are weighing on the markets today. China’s Shanghai composite index has dropped by 0.5%, following the news that Huawei is being probed by US authorities. European markets have also opened lower, with the FTSE 100 losing 0.35% (or 24 points to 6,838). Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: The negative start follows reports that US Federal Prosecutors are investigating Huawei Technology for allegedly stealing trade secrets. The move comes as US - Sino relations were improving amid a 90-day truce. It goes right to the heart of the unresolved IP issues with China. China are unlikely to shrug this off which is creating a risk off environment. Signs of retaliation from China could see stocks sink further. Chinese technology giant Huawei is at the heart of the dispute between Washington and Beijing. Overnight, the Wall Street Journal reported that US authorities are in the “advanced” stages of a criminal probe into the company. Citing anonymous sources, the WSJ said the Department of Justice is examining allegations that Huawei stole trade secrets from US business partners, including a T-Mobile robotic device used to test smartphones. AFP says: Huawei and the Department of Justice declined to comment on the media report. However, Huawei noted that “Huawei and T-Mobile settled their disputes in 2017 following a US jury verdict finding neither damage, unjust enrichment nor willful and malicious conduct by Huawei in T-Mobile’s trade secret claim.” Earlier this week, Huawei’s founder gave a rare interview in which he denied that his company spies for China, and also praised president Trump. Ren Zhengfei’s daughter Meng is fighting attempts to extradite her to the US to face charges of breaching US sanctions. Newsflash: One of China’s top political leaders will head to Washington later this month to continue trade talks. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on January 30 and 31 for the next round of trade negotiations with Washington, China’s commerce ministry says. Aso’s comments came as one of Japan’s many tech companies revealed it had been hurt by the US-China trade dispute. Nidec, a Japanese precision motor maker, slashed its profit forecast by a quarter and warned that the trade war is deterring clients from spending. Nidec warned (via Reuters): “The company is seeing an adverse ripple effect of the current U.S.-China trade friction on its operations in many countries, particularly in China,” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With trade war fears bubbling, Japan is challenging the world’s top economies to push back against the rising tide of protectionism. Japanese finance minister Taro Aso has warned fellow G20 ministers that the global recovery is losing momentum. We risk falling back into a closed and fragmented world unless advanced economies stick to “international co-operation and openness”, he warns. Speaking at a meeting in Tokyo, Aso also warned that unhappiness over inequality is rising, and that “unfair trade practices” also create harm. Opening the gathering of deputy finance ministers, he said: “Dissatisfaction with economic inequality is growing. There is a serious risk that we will revert to a closed and fragmented world. “Protectionism and unfair trade practices lead to instability and perverse economic outcomes. We must renew our commitment to international cooperation and openness.” Aso’s comments come as the traditional international order wobbles in the face of the US-China trade war. Beijing and the US have just six weeks to reach agreement, before a fresh wave of tit-for-tat tariffs are imposed.

Samantha Bee “This week Donald Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un,” began Samantha Bee. “It was weird but flirtatious enough to warrant a second date. “Trump even made Kim a prom-posal video,” the host joked, in reference to the melodramatic four-minute movie trailer disseminated by the White House to drum up anticipation for the summit. “The meeting did produce a few concrete items, in that they’re the kind of hollow concrete Trump uses in his trashy hotels. “The president has agreed to give up conducting military exercises on the Korean peninsula,” the host explained. “This may sound like a huge concession from Trump but you have to remember what he said in The Art of the Deal: ‘I’m an idiot.’” Bee then noted that the South Korean government was blindsided by Trump’s commitment to halt joint military exercises and provide safety guarantees to North Korea. “He also announced a freeze on any new US sanctions against North Korea,” Bee added, “because Trump isn’t about to screw North Korea like they’re a bunch of savage Canadians.” Bee concluded: “The supreme leader left the summit legitimized as a nuclear power and glowing brighter than enriched uranium. And all Trump got in return was the same pledge of future denuclearization that North Korea has made and broken numerous time over the last 25 years.” Pointing out the distinction between a pledge to denuclearize and “complete, verifiable, irreversible” denuclearization, Bee said: “It’s kind of like the difference between holding on to your virginity and,” as she held up air quotes, “holding on to your virginity.” Stephen Colbert Stephen Colbert addressed the possibility that Michael Cohen, the president’s former attorney and fixer, may cooperate with federal investigators as his lawyers prepare to leave the case. “Sources say ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen is likely to cooperate with federal prosecutors,” Colbert said. “Yes, Michael Cohen is going to sing like a canary, which is ironic because it’s Trump that actually looks like one. “The first sign that Cohen is about to flip is that his lawyers are not expected to work with him going forward and replacements for the lawyer has not been named,” the host explained, noting that Cohen has been in legal jeopardy since documents were seized from his home and office in a 9 April FBI raid. “This must be a shock to Donald Trump because it comes at a critical time,” Colbert said, citing a Vanity Fair article. “Sources say Mueller is wrapping up his obstruction of justice investigation or, as one of them put it, it’s going to hit the fan pretty soon.” Cohen, Colbert explained, is considered one of the few people who can “blow up” Trump given their decades-long working relationship. “That gives Cohen leverage,” he added, “because the last guy who threatened to blow up Trump got his own summit. “The question is, will Donald Trump pardon Michael Cohen? Maybe, maybe not,” Colbert said, noting that the president blames Cohen for the ongoing Stormy Daniels saga. “Why did Michael make me have sex with that woman?” the host joked, mocking Trump. “And why did he allow me to be alone with her during Shark Week? He knows it gets my juices flowing.” Trevor Noah Finally, Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah, in a segment called “So Much News, So Little Time”, briefly touched on the merger between Time Warner and AT&amp;T, the World Cup, and Bill Clinton’s response to a question about Monica Lewinsky. “A federal judge has approved one of the biggest corporate mergers in American history,” Noah began, referring to AT&amp;T’s $85bn takeover of Time Warner, which was approved by a federal judge on Wednesday. “Finally, Time Warner and AT&amp;T are joining forces,” he added. “This is such great news for consumers because now we can get all of our horrible customer service in one place.” After mentioning this week’s World Cup, and the news that the US, Mexico, and Canada will host the 2026 competition, he went on: “I could spend a lot of time talking about the World Cup but this is America, so I know we’ve got to move on, which I bet is something Bill Clinton wishes the media would do, too.” Clinton, currently promoting his new novel The President is Missing, co-written by James Patterson, was asked about sexual harassment in an interview on NBC. “Norms have really changed in terms of what you can do to somebody against their will,” Clinton said. When asked if he owes Monica Lewinsky an apology, he answered: “No, I never talk to her,” adding that he “did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry”. The former president then said: “Someone should ask you these questions because of the way you formulate the questions.” “What?” Noah replied. “That is one the weirdest moments I’ve ever seen in an interview. He just flipped it and asked the journalist a question. You know who I really feel bad for? President Clinton’s co-author, James Patterson. Think about it: that poor dude just wanted to promote a book but now he has to sit there quietly through every interview and watch the disaster unfold.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2017/dec/30/bob-hawke-says-turnbull-is-still-ashamed-of-his-abbott-coup","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-30T00:05:39Z","webTitle":"Bob Hawke says Turnbull is 'still ashamed' of his Abbott coup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/30/bob-hawke-says-turnbull-is-still-ashamed-of-his-abbott-coup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2017/dec/30/bob-hawke-says-turnbull-is-still-ashamed-of-his-abbott-coup","fields":{"headline":"Bob Hawke says Turnbull is 'still ashamed' of his Abbott coup","bodyText":"The former Labor prime minister Bob Hawke says Malcolm Turnbull has an “unsound” basis for leadership, because he is still ashamed of taking power from Tony Abbott. Hawke, now 88, used his regular address to the Woodford Folk Festival in Queensland to urge Turnbull to put his shame behind him, and work in partnership with Labor on issues like climate change. “Malcolm is basically ashamed,” Hawke said. “If you’re ashamed of what you’ve done to get the leadership, it’s a pretty unsound basis for leadership,” he said. He then offered some advice to Turnbull. “Put any feeling of shame behind you, get on with the job and particularly see if you can get some bipartisan understanding with Bill Shorten about important issues, particularly climate change,” he said, according to Fairfax Media. “Get on with the job and get some bi-partisan leadership.” The former prime minister has become a regular speaker at the Woodford Folk Festival. His address on Friday was his ninth at the event. The talks typically attracts headlines for Hawke’s often frank and uncompromising assessments of modern politics. Hawke, dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and later drinking a “Hawke’s Lager” as he chatted to media, described both Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un as “both in their own way, lunatics”. He lamented the lack of leadership in the western world, and urged Australians to join a political party and become active in the democratic process. Hawke also outlined a path for a successful push for an Australian republic, saying it could only occur after the Queen passed away. “[Australians] think a vote for the republic would be kicking Her Majesty in her ancient dentures,” he said. Hawke slammed the glaring inequality between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians as “the greatest stain on this great nation”, according to News Corp.

Bomb disposal experts will carry out a controlled explosion on the 250lb (113kg) ordnance on Wednesday, two miles north-west of the power plants. HM Coastguard has set up an exclusion zone around the unexploded device and warned ships to avoid the area. Ieuan Williams, a senior maritime operations officer at HM Coastguard, said: “The explosive ordnance disposal team plans to detonate the ordnance at 6pm today. Until that time we have taken measures to … clear the area of vessels to keep the public safe.” The bomb was reported in the early hours of Wednesday by a diving team from the Hinkley Point plant. They were clearing the seabed for intake and outtake pipes for cooling water for the reactors on the Hinkley Point C plant. It is the third suspected second world war bomb to be found in the Bristol Channel in the past three weeks. On 8 August, a 500lb device was discovered 2.5 miles from the coast. On 16 August, a 250lb bomb was found less than half a mile from the power station. Both were destroyed in controlled explosions. Hinkley Point, near Bridgwater in Somerset, houses two power nuclear power stations run by the French company EDF: Hinkley Point B, scheduled to be decommissioned in 2023; and Hinkley Point A, which closed in 2000. Hinkley Point C will be the UK’s first new nuclear plant for more than two decades. David Eccles, EDF’s head of stakeholder engagement for the project, said: “It is normal practice to check the seabed before construction activity starts on any marine project. “The safety of the public and our workforce is our priority, and we have a team of 10 divers checking the seabed ahead of the construction of the main cooling water tunnels and associated seabed structures for Hinkley Point C.” An EDF source conceded that divers could find more unexploded ordnance before the exercise to clear the area was completed, as the channel was used as a former army training range. The project to clear the seabed is expected to take several more weeks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/17/beware-nuclear-industrys-fake-news-on-being-emissions-free","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-17T17:52:18Z","webTitle":"Beware nuclear industry’s fake news on being emissions free | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/17/beware-nuclear-industrys-fake-news-on-being-emissions-free","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/17/beware-nuclear-industrys-fake-news-on-being-emissions-free","fields":{"headline":"Beware nuclear industry’s fake news on being emissions free","bodyText":"I wholeheartedly agree with much of your editorial (14 September), as the economics of new nuclear is weaker than ever at a time when renewables are coming in cheaper year on year. You point out the crisis in the funding of renewables and we could not agree more. The UK desperately needs to reboot financial support for decentralised energy in order to maximise long-term benefits for all. Councils, in particular, are calling for the restoration of feed-in tariffs and other support that has been instrumental in the creation of innovative, local, low-carbon energy schemes, Passivhaus-accredited buildings, and energy efficiency programmes for dealing with the scourge of fuel poverty. While the dramatic cost reductions in offshore wind are to be welcomed, it has to be joined with renewed support for decentralised energy projects, approval for tidal energy schemes and the resumption of support for solar and onshore wind. The government must see that the energy landscape has changed dramatically. An energy review and reboot is urgently required. Cllr David Blackburn Vice-chair, UK and Ireland Nuclear Free Authorities • Your incisive editorial makes many strong points, not least highlighting the exigencies of potential security compromises and terrorism vulnerabilities of the planned new nuclear reactor at Hinkley Point. But there is a fatal flaw in the argument you set out. The editorial asserts: “Nuclear power has a trump card: it is a zero-carbon technology which delivers a continuous, uninterrupted supply.” This is demonstrably untrue. On the latter point, you only have to consult the published operating record of reactors to see this is an unsustainable claim. All reactors have lengthy planned outages (shutdowns) for operational reasons; some have significant unplanned outages due to operational failures; and in the extreme case of post-accident safety prudence, such as in Japan, their 54 reactors were all closed for years after the 2011 Fukushima disaster – and became hugely expensive “stranded assets”. On alleged zero-carbon status of nuclear plants, you repeat a similarly erroneous assertion made in your editorial of 1 October 2005 (Pre-empting debate), where you wrote: “The big advantage of nuclear generation is that it does not produce environmentally degrading emissions in the way that fossil fuel generation does.” You printed my response to this assertion (There is nothing green about Blair’s nuclear dream, 20 October 2005) in which I set out the various ways the carbon footprint of nuclear power is substantial, if the whole “cradle-to-grave” nuclear fuel chain (uranium mining, milling, enrichment, fuel production, in-reactor fuel irradiation, storage and final long-term management) is properly calculated. I pointed out that the nuclear industry’s proponents, such as those gathered at last week’s World Nuclear Association jamboree in London, are fond of spreading fake news such as describing nuclear energy as “non-carbon emitting”. It is about time this dangerous falsehood was confined to the dustbin of history. Dr David Lowry Senior research fellow, Institute for Resource and Security Studies, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA • With reference to your editorial, we are used to electricity being on tap. That will continue when we are recharging our car batteries in the years ahead. Accordingly, there is a requirement for a significant fraction of our supply to come from a source that is independent of wind and sun. Battery storage on the scale required is a pipe dream. Nuclear power is the obvious solution. To reject it in principle would be absurd, especially in view of our nuclear heritage. There is a better solution available than that pursued by our current planners. It is to build the remaining nuclear plants with CANDU-type reactors, pioneered by the Canadians. These run on any nuclear fuel and use heavy water as moderator. A heavy-water plant could be built and fed by off-peak renewables, of which tidal power would be ideal. In effect, this provides a solution to the energy storage problem – electricity is “stored” in the form of heavy water. David Hayes Formerly of the Central Electricity Generating Board, Bristol • Re your article Cheap, fast wind turbines are leaving nuclear behind (12 September) and your editorial: an even more persistent myth than nuclear being cheaper than renewables is its supposed usefulness in providing a reliable supply of electricity. Base load nuclear, as it is referred to, is incapable of increasing or decreasing its output in response to the daily fluctuation in demand. This is a significant drawback, given that peak daytime demand is twice that at night. During the day, nuclear has to be supported by gas or coal plants, in almost the same way as wind and solar. So much for nuclear’s green credentials, locking us in to the emission of greenhouses gases indefinitely.

Clive Lewis, the former shadow secretary of state for energy, singled out GMB for being too close to the nuclear lobby and said it was not speaking up for renewable energy because it did not have members there. He also questioned why unions “fight to the bitter end” for the arms industry. His comments reflect tensions within the Labour movement over union support for nuclear power and a nuclear deterrent. GMB, Unite and Prospect have tens of thousands of members in the nuclear and arms industries. Corbyn has called for a “nuclear-free world”. Lewis told a fringe event on energy at Labour’s conference in Brighton: “One of the problems with where trade unions are at the moment is that they have been so weakened that I think they have become, and have been used by big business as, a voice for big business. “Because big business understands that if you have a unionised workforce they also become spokespeople for you. They create a situation where you have a wide and broad spectrum politically of people supporting your particular position. “On nuclear, yes, GMB and other unions are staunchly supporting it because the jobs there generate union members. Contrast that to the highly self-employed solar sector: the unions have no trade unions there. They are not speaking up at all for them.” He said unions had thrown their weight behind plans for Hinkley Point C, the first new nuclear power plant to be built in the UK for 20 years. “That is one of the reasons that a big song and dance and hoo-ha about solar wasn’t made by the unions and yet they are getting staunchly behind Hinkley,” Lewis said. “It is also the reason why trade unions fight to the bitter end on the arms industry – because they have high-quality jobs and strong membership there and this is their lifeblood. Without the members they don’t exist.” He told a 60-strong audience at an event organised by Labour Energy Forum that the Labour movement needed to do more to get involved in the renewable energy sector. “There are obviously other things we could do – we could encourage unions and activism in the renewal industries as something that is good for business,” he said. A GMB spokesperson reacted furiously to Lewis’s comments. He said: “We’ll put copies of the Uber and Addison Lee judgments in the post for Clive. He can have a read about what taking on big business and organising ‘self-employed workers’ really looks like. “Our energy workers keep the lights on. Of course we want more renewables, and we want good renewable jobs here in the UK, but right now they don’t exist because the government isn’t investing. “GMB will always stand up for our members and their jobs – that’s who we speak for, that’s what a trade union does.” GMB has confirmed that its 3,000 members working at Sellafield in Cumbria will go on strike on Wednesday over a pay row."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/dec/12/us-ready-for-talks-with-north-korea-without-preconditions-tillerson-says","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-12T22:28:50Z","webTitle":"US ready for talks with North Korea 'without preconditions', Tillerson says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/12/us-ready-for-talks-with-north-korea-without-preconditions-tillerson-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/dec/12/us-ready-for-talks-with-north-korea-without-preconditions-tillerson-says","fields":{"headline":"US ready for talks with North Korea 'without preconditions', Tillerson says","bodyText":"Rex Tillerson has said that the US is ready to begin exploratory talks with North Korea “without preconditions”, but only after a “period of quiet” without new nuclear or missile tests. The secretary of state’s remarks appeared to mark a shift in state department policy, which had previously required Pyongyang to show it was “serious” about giving up its nuclear arsenal before contacts could start. And the language was a long way from repeated comments by Donald Trump that such contacts are a “waste of time”. Tillerson also revealed that the US had been talking to China about what each country would do in the event of a conflict or regime collapse in North Korea, saying that the Trump administration had given Beijing assurances that US troops would pull back to the 38th parallel, which divides North and South Korea, and that the only US concern would be to secure the regime’s nuclear weapons. Earlier this week it emerged that China is building a network of refugee camps along its 880-mile (1,416km) border with North Korea, in preparation for a potential exodus that could be unleashed by conflict or the collapse of Kim Jong-un’s regime. Speaking at the Atlantic Council thinktank in Washington, Tillerson made it explicit that the message to Pyongyang had changed and that the North Korean regime did not have to commit to full disarmament before direct diplomacy could take off. “We are ready to talk anytime North Korea would like to talk. We are ready to have the first meeting without preconditions. Let’s just meet,” Tillerson said. “And then we can begin to lay out a roadmap ... It’s not realistic to say we are only going to talk if you come to the table ready to give up your program. They have too much invested in it. “Let’s just meet and let’s talk about the weather,” the secretary of state said. “If you want ... and talk about whether it’s going to be a square table or a round table if that’s what you’re excited about.” However, he then laid down one condition and said there should be a “period of quiet” in which such preliminary talks could take place. He portrayed it as a practical consideration. “It’s going to be tough to talk if in the middle of our talks you decide to test another device,” he said. “We need a period of quiet.” Tillerson’s comments came as Kim Jong-un vowed to make North Korea the “world’s strongest nuclear power”. Kim told workers behind the recent test of a new missile that his country “will victoriously advance and leap as the strongest nuclear power and military power in the world”, in a ceremony on Tuesday, according to the state news agency, KCNA. Daryl Kimball, the head of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, said that the US would have to carry out confidence-building measures for meaningful talks to start. “Secretary Tillerson’s proposal for direct talks with North Korea without preconditions is overdue and welcome,” Kimball said. “However, in order to get to such talks going, the US side as well as North Korea must demonstrate more restraint. For North Korea, that means a halt to all nuclear and ballistic missile tests, and for the United States, refraining from military maneuvers and overflights that appear to be practice runs for an attack on the North. “If such restraint is not forthcoming, we can expect a further escalation of tensions and a growing risk of a catastrophic war,” he added. Informal talks between US and North Korean diplomats have taken place since Trump took office in January but they have been cut since Pyongyang tested a powerful thermonuclear warhead in early September. Tillerson has previously seemed at odds with Trump over talks with Pyongyang: earlier this year, shortly after the secretary of state said the US was attempting to find a way to resolve tensions between the two countries, Trump tweeted that his top diplomat should “save his energy” as “we’ll do what has to be done!” “I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man ... Save your energy Rex, we’ll do what has to be done!” the president tweeted. On Tuesday, the secretary of state made clear that full North Korean nuclear disarmament would be the ultimate goal of substantive negotiations. He argued that containment was not an option, as an impoverished North Korea would seek to earn money by selling its nuclear weapons on the black market. Tillerson said that US officials had had conversations with their Chinese counterparts about how to ensure those weapons did not end up in “undesirable hands”. China had rebuffed similar approaches from the Obama administration rather than give the impression Beijing was prepared to contemplate a North Korean collapse. “The US has been trying for years to talk to China about conflict scenarios without success. This is an encouraging sign that these talks have made progress,” said Adam Mount, an expert on North Korea at the Federation of American Scientists. “The Chinese are using coordination with the US to signal to Pyongyang that it is considering the prospect that North Korea could collapse, and that it should moderate its behaviour and shouldn’t step out of line.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/dec/06/google-powered-100-renewable-energy-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-06T14:40:50Z","webTitle":"Google to be powered 100% by renewable energy from 2017","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/06/google-powered-100-renewable-energy-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/dec/06/google-powered-100-renewable-energy-2017","fields":{"headline":"Google to be powered 100% by renewable energy from 2017","bodyText":"Google’s data centres and the offices for its 60,000 staff will be powered entirely by renewable energy from next year, in what the company has called a “landmark moment”. The internet giant is already the world’s biggest corporate buyer of renewable electricity, last year buying 44% of its power from wind and solar farms. Now it will be 100%, and an executive said it would not rule out investing in nuclear power in the future, too. “We are convinced this is good for business, this is not about greenwashing. This is about locking in prices for us in the long term. Increasingly, renewable energy is the lowest cost option,” said Marc Oman, EU energy lead at Google. “Our founders are convinced climate change is a real, immediate threat, so we have to do our part.” Technology companies have come under increasing scrutiny over the carbon footprint of their operations, which have grown so fast they now account for about 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, rivalling the aviation industry. Oman said it had taken Google five years to reach the 100% target, set in 2012, because of the complexity involved with negotiating power purchase agreements. “It’s complicated, it’s not for everyone: smaller companies will struggle with the documents. We are buying power in a lot of different jurisdictions, so you can’t just copy and paste agreements.” The company’s biggest demand for energy is its data centres and it admits their overall thirst for power is growing, despite experiments to improve their efficiency through AI. In 2015, Google bought 5.7 terawatt hours (TWh) of renewable electricity, a little less than the 7.6TWh generated by all of the UK’s solar panels that year. The majority of the power comes from windfarms in the US. Oman said that while the falling price of solar and wind meant they had been the cheapest technologies to get to 100% by 2017, Google was now looking to sign 10-year agreements for low-carbon power that was not intermittent, such as hydro, biomass and nuclear. “We want to do contracts with forms of renewable power that are more baseload-like, so low-impact hydro; it could be biomass if the fuel source is sustainable, it could be nuclear, God forbid, we’re not averse. We’re looking at all forms of low-carbon generation.” But he said new nuclear power was “controversial”, the safety implications were much more “dramatic” than with renewables, and the price was “much more difficult [to ascertain]” than when funding solar panels and wind turbines. “We don’t want to rule out signing a nuclear contract if it meets our goals of low price, safety, additionality and in a sufficiently close grid, we don’t want to rule that out, but today we can’t positively say there are nuclear projects out there that meet this criteria,” he said. The company’s 100% renewable energy does not mean Google is getting all its energy directly from wind and solar power, but that on an annual basis the amount it purchases from renewable sources matches the electricity its operations consume. Jodie Van Horn, a campaigner at the Sierra Club, an environmental group, said: “By transitioning global operations to run entirely on renewable energy, Google is charting a course for other corporations, institutions, cities and communities to take bold action that will create jobs, save money, and protect families from dangerous fossil fuel pollution.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/11/turkey-ever-closer-ties-with-russia-leave-us-lacking-key-ally-on-syria","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-11T12:02:06Z","webTitle":"Turkey's ever-closer ties with Russia leave US lacking key ally on Syria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/11/turkey-ever-closer-ties-with-russia-leave-us-lacking-key-ally-on-syria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/11/turkey-ever-closer-ties-with-russia-leave-us-lacking-key-ally-on-syria","fields":{"headline":"Turkey's ever-closer ties with Russia leave US lacking key ally on Syria","bodyText":"As the prospect grows of military confrontation with Russia in the skies over Syria, the US is counting on support from European partners such as France and the UK. But help from a key regional ally – Turkey – is less certain, despite its position on Syria’s northern border and opposition to Bashar al-Assad’s regime. There are echoes of 2003, when Turkey refused to back the US-led invasion of Iraq. Whose side Turkey is on is a question increasingly exercising Washington policymakers as Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s president, builds closer ties with Russia. Although Turkey is a Nato member, its growing defence cooperation with Moscow includes a recent $2bn deal to buy state-of-the-art S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. At the same time, military collaboration with the US has been scaled back. Faced with Turkish restrictions, US air force combat operations at the Incirlik base, close to Syria’s border, have been run down. In January a squadron of A-10 “Warthog” ground-attack jets was redeployed to Afghanistan, reportedly leaving only refuelling aircraft at the base. Last year Germany, another Nato member, was obliged to withdraw its forces from Incirlik amid a fierce row with Erdoğan over human rights and legal issues. The German aircraft, which like their American counterparts were engaged in attacking Islamic State forces in Syria and Iraq, were moved to Jordan. US-Turkey tensions rose after the failed 2016 coup attempt in Ankara, which Erdoğan claimed was instigated by opponents based in the US. They have since been exacerbated by rows over Turkish human rights abuses, Washington’s support for anti-Assad Syrian Kurdish forces, whom Turkey regards as terrorists, and by Turkey’s military incursion into Afrin, in north-west Syria. Erdoğan’s government, which has previously demanded Assad step down, initially blamed the Syrian regime for last Saturday’s chemical weapons attack in Douma – the focus of current tensions between Russia and the west. “The Syrian regime will have to pay the price,” İbrahim Kalin, Erdoğan’s spokesman, said on Monday. The government spokesman Bekir Bozdağ said the Assad regime was guilty of “barbarity and [a] crime against humanity”. But Ankara changed its tune after Erdoğan received a phone call later that day from Assad’s main backer, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Ensuing official statements pointedly avoided blaming Douma on the regime, calling instead for a “careful investigation” – Putin’s exact position. A menacing statement by Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, may also have changed Turkish minds. Russia has hitherto acquiesced in Turkey’s Afrin operation, obtaining assurances from Damascus that regime forces would not oppose it. But on Monday Lavrov said Moscow expected Turkey to hand over Afrin to Assad. Iran, Russia’s collaborator in Syria, made a similar call. Erdoğan angrily rejected the demands, but the message from Moscow was crystal clear: don’t mess with us. Turkey’s close collaboration with Russia – critics would call it subservience – is a relatively recent phenomenon. The two countries came to blows in November, 2015 when Turkey shot down a Russian military jet for alleged airspace violations. Moscow retaliated by imposing economic sanctions. To the dismay of Nato and the EU, the subsequent rapprochement has been rapid, fuelled by shared self-interest, especially in Syria. Both Erdoğan and Putin want to shape any post-war settlement to their advantage. To this end they launched, with Iran, the so-called Astana peace process, rivalling talks overseen by the UN. Putin personally commiserated with Erdoğan after the 2016 coup attempt, assuring him of Moscow’s full support. That was an important moment for two instinctive autocrats who fear the popular verdict of the street. Since then, bilateral cooperation on nuclear power, energy pipelines from Russia to Turkey and Europe, tourism, investment, arms sales and military-to-military ties have reached “unprecedented levels”, according to the IISS thinktank. Erdoğan and Putin share another aim: curbing US influence in the Middle East. And for Russia, courting Turkey brings additional benefits – sowing discord within Nato and limiting US military options in Syria when, as now, push may come to shove."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/mar/09/hinkley-nuclear-power-project-good-deal-ed-davey","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-09T09:42:51Z","webTitle":"£18bn Hinkley nuclear power project is a good deal, says ex-minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/09/hinkley-nuclear-power-project-good-deal-ed-davey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/mar/09/hinkley-nuclear-power-project-good-deal-ed-davey","fields":{"headline":"£18bn Hinkley nuclear power project is a good deal, says ex-minister","bodyText":"The deal to provide a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point would have cost even more if George Osborne had had his way, the former energy secretary Ed Davey has said. The Lib Dem former member of the coalition cabinet said the £18bn plan to build Hinkley Point C represented a good deal, and claimed the cost would have been higher without his involvement. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “We need lots of low-carbon electricity in the future. And I negotiated a good deal. My Conservative colleagues would have shaken at a much higher price.” Davey claimed Osborne was so keen to strike a deal, particularly one involving Chinese investment, that he would have agreed to pay more. He said: “They were gagging for nuclear. George Osborne in particular was wanting to have Chinese investment, big infrastructure projects to show off to the Tory backbenchers. It was me saying I’m going to walk away from this deal if we don’t do what we promised parliament, and that meant we had to get the price down to below £90 per megawatt hour, which I did.” The government disputes Davey’s account of events. A government source told the Times that Conservative ministers lost faith in Davey’s negotiating skills and insisted on Treasury involvement in the deal. But Davey pointed out that negotiations in 2013 were led by his permanent secretary at the energy department. He said: “My permanent secretary was the person I appointed to run it, and he worked with the Treasury because the Treasury were involved. But I was the one who was prepared to walk away.” Davey defended the cost of the deal, which guarantees the French operator EDF almost three times the current wholesale energy price. On Monday, the British and French governments said Hinkley Point C was still on track despite the resignations of EDF’s finance director and the project’s director. French nuclear workers’ unions have called for EDF to delay the deal. Davey said: “If it is such a bad deal, why are EDF not signing up straight away?” He added: “The thing I’m really proud about in this deal is that if it isn’t built we won’t pay anything. All the risk has been transferred to EDF and we only start paying in 2025 if it is built. “It is really important when you make decisions [that] you force whoever is producing the power to pay for their pollution. If gas was paying a carbon tax, the current price will be much higher.” Davey criticised the government’s record on renewable energy since the end of the coalition. He said: “The key thing that I did was to ensure that we had a diverse approach to energy. What the Conservatives are doing so badly is by destroying solar power, destroying on-shore wind, not proceeding with tidal power, ending the carbon capture and storage programme, they are putting Britain’s future energy security at risk.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/02/swansea-tidal-lagoon-project-faces-job-cuts-and-downsizing","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-02T12:10:48Z","webTitle":"Swansea tidal lagoon project faces job cuts and downsizing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/02/swansea-tidal-lagoon-project-faces-job-cuts-and-downsizing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/02/swansea-tidal-lagoon-project-faces-job-cuts-and-downsizing","fields":{"headline":"Swansea tidal lagoon project faces job cuts and downsizing","bodyText":"The £1.3bn Swansea tidal lagoon faces a major blow as the company behind the scheme braces for significant job cuts if UK and Welsh government talks on the project fail to yield a breakthrough. Tidal Lagoon Power has waited for 15 months since an independent review backed the scheme as a “no regrets” source of clean and reliable energy. In December, the Welsh government offered equity or a loan if Whitehall would support the plan with a subsidy. UK–Wales talks have since intensified, but are yet to yield a result. The financial stress of waiting for government funding means the company may be forced to lay off staff within weeks, substantially reducing the size of its operations this month. A source at Tidal Lagoon Power said: “It [the company] is being put in a difficult situation by the UK and Welsh governments.” They said it was crunch time for the project, and the headcount of 50 staff would have to be reduced if support from Whitehall does not materialise. Running down to a skeleton operation would make it harder to later resuscitate the scheme by 2020, when planning permissions expire. One of the potential large supply chain companies said: “A quick decision remains in everyone’s best interests.” More than 50 Conservative MPs, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Green party and unions have urged the business secretary, Greg Clark, to back the project in principle. But Clark has told Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister, that any public subsidy for the lagoon would have to protect consumers from high energy bills and consider the falling costs of alternatives. In a letter to Jones in January, Clark described tidal lagoons as “an untried technology with high capital costs and significant uncertainties”. Richard Graham, the Conservative MP in whose Gloucestershire constituency Tidal Lagoon Power is based, said last week that the company was looking at a subsidy deal no more expensive than the one awarded to EDF Energy for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. “It’s a clone of that contract,” he said. However, the price the government has guaranteed to buy power from developers building offshore windfarms in the early 2020s has already undercut Hinkley by 38%. Similarly, nuclear developers have been told they must come in well under the Hinkley price for future atomic power stations. The Swansea tidal scheme would harness the ebb and flow of tides in Swansea Bay, providing a predictable and low-carbon source of power for 120,000 homes. It is intended to be the first of six lagoons at sites on Britain’s west coast, including Cardiff. Tidal Lagoon Power has spent more than £53m developing the lagoons. But the government has yet to issue a response to the review by the former energy minister Charles Hendry, which warmly backed the Swansea project in January 2017. Last month, the energy minister, Claire Perry, said: “We want to reach the right decision on behalf of low-carbon technologies, but also British billpayers and taxpayers.” Even after a government response, negotiations would be needed between the company and officials to agree a contract for difference, a guaranteed price of power for decades. The offer of “substantial investment” from Wales could help bring down that price. One union on Monday urged the UK government to take a direct stake to further cut costs. Sue Ferns, the senior deputy general secretary of Prospect, said: “The Treasury has a direct role in ending delays around major infrastructure and in helping to kickstart new projects, such as the tidal lagoon and new-build nuclear, to guarantee low-carbon energy supply.” A spokesperson for Tidal Lagoon Power admitted the company “may have to accept a reduction in numbers in order to sustain the business”. “The business has sufficient funds to take it through to a decision and the trigger of our next funding round. We understand that the talks between the UK and Welsh governments have been positive, and we look forward to their conclusion,” they said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jan/28/letters-languages-bilingual-inuit-carillion-social-care-nuclear-energy-activist-shareholders","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-28T00:03:23Z","webTitle":"Cold facts about foreign languages | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/28/letters-languages-bilingual-inuit-carillion-social-care-nuclear-energy-activist-shareholders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/28/letters-languages-bilingual-inuit-carillion-social-care-nuclear-energy-activist-shareholders","fields":{"headline":"Letters: cold facts about foreign languages","bodyText":"I thoroughly enjoyed Tobias Jones’s article on bilingualism (“Two languages good”, Comment). But the claim that the Inuit people, whose language is called Inuktitut, have multiple words for “snow” needs some explanation. There is still some controversy about this, reignited five years ago by an article in New Scientist, but the complexities of word-formation in the language mean that in reality there are possibly infinite ways of talking about snow in Inuktitut, based on a small number of lexical roots that make the same sort of distinctions as English, which also has several words in this semantic area (snow, ice, slush, sleet, flurries, snowflakes, hail, powder etc). The point that is often overlooked is that, while a concept may not be “lexicalised” in a given language (ie there may not be a single word for it), that concept can still be expressed, in a more or less roundabout way. If the unnamed concept is sufficiently useful, the foreign word for it can be imported into the language, as happens with all languages in contact, English no less than any other. So I cannot but agree with Jones’s final statement that exposure to languages makes you more, not less, eloquent. Harold Somers Emeritus professor of linguistics Manchester University The code-mixing observed by Tobias Jones in his émigré children is a natural phenomenon for bilinguals, especially if they have moved countries at an age when their mother tongue was not yet properly crystallised and thus at a heightened risk of attrition. (Children who lose contact with a language before their 8th to 12th year can forget it almost completely within a very short time.) To help them achieve fully productive bilingualism it is now essential to counterbalance their increased exposure to Italian with amplified use of English. The conservative conviction, that in order to deserve the label “bilingual” one needs to have a native-like command of both languages, has long been abandoned by linguists in favour of less rigorous and more realistic expectations. Language policies today recognise that individuals have varying competences in their multiple languages, which complement each other and develop in line with communication needs. This does not mean that late bilinguals are barred from acquiring native-like proficiency, as shown by countless bilingual writers such as Joseph Brodsky, Joseph Conrad, Jerzy Kosiński, Milan Kundera, Czesław Miłosz, Vladimir Nabokov or Isaac Bashevis Singer. Michał B Paradowski Institute of Applied Linguistics University of Warsaw Absence of cash for sleep-in shifts devastating social care Following a change in guidance from HM Revenue and Customs, the continued absence of new funding to cover historical, current and future payments for care workers’ sleep-in shifts remains a significant financial risk to social care providers and councils and is causing continuing uncertainty in the market and anxiety for carers and those who use their services. We fully support care workers being paid fairly for the work they do and we urge the government to fund the cost of sleep-in payments with genuinely new money to prevent more care providers going out of business, contracts being handed back to councils, care workers losing their jobs and less investment in prevention. Without this, it will put further strain on informal carers and harm those who rely on social care and make it harder to mitigate the pressures on the NHS. The most conservative overall estimate of back-pay liability is £400m for the learning disability sector alone, at a time when demand is increasing. The Local Government Association estimates that there is a £1.3bn pressure just to stabilise the adult social care market today. The extra £2bn, over three years, for adult social care in the 2017 spring budget was not announced with sleep-in costs in mind and is not sufficient to deal with all immediate and short-term pressures. Adult social care is at a tipping point. Genuinely new funding is vital to help providers, personal budget holders and self-funders meet all funding pressures relating to sleep-in shifts.

Eddie Dougall Bury St Edmunds Carillion and capital Will Hutton’s article on the Carillion incident (Focus) was informative, stimulated debate and focused on the role of institutional shareholders in improving companies’ decision making. One of his suggestions was to “encourage” pension funds to invest in “purposeful companies”. This might be economically desirable for the UK economy but it is doubtful whether the pensioner clients of the individual pension funds would benefit from their fund managers searching for “purpose” in their analytical appraisal of company prospects. What sort of purpose would they be looking for? Funds make money by buying and selling shares in different companies at different times. However, many funds, particularly index-tracking funds, maintain large holdings in some companies simply because the companies represent a large proportion of the stock market. One way funds can and do make additional profits from these core holdings is by directly influencing company decisions by expressing intentions to vote in favour of or in opposition to board proposals. Plainly, this attention is usually paid to those companies in which the funds hold a large proportion of their portfolio. A way ahead could be to require all pension funds to include in their reports to trustees and clients a full account of their shareholder activism in improving management decision-making in the principal companies held in their long-term portfolio. With this approach, pension funds could concentrate on improving performance as well as acting with the longer horizon advocated by Hutton. Charles Ward, Chao Yin and Yeqin Zheng Henley Business School University of Reading Nuclear finance in meltdown It’s no wonder that EDF faced a “monstrous job” in securing finance for Hinkley Point C (“Finance aside, renewable energy will be nuclear’s real foe in the future”, Business leader). Who would want to tie up billions of pounds over several decades in nuclear power when the cost of renewables is dropping by the month? As well as invariably falling behind schedule and ending up billions of pounds over budget, nuclear plants’ decommissioning costs are huge. It cost $1bn to clean up after a plant in Vermont recently and $4bn to decommission an obsolete plant in California. But offshore wind energy (where the UK is world leader) is now cheaper than nuclear power for the first time: compare £92.50 per megawatt hour from Hinkley with Dong Energy’s offering of £57.50 per MWhr from its Hornsea Project Two offshore wind farm. Bigger turbines, higher voltage cables and other efficiencies mean that prices for wind power are 47% lower than they were in 2014. The pro-nuclear lobby may argue that abandoning the planned nuclear projects in Anglesey and Suffolk will commit us to having more gas-fired plants. Not so. According to a new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, by 2020 renewable energy as a whole will be a consistently cheaper source of electricity generation than fossil fuels.

I was on a train home from Paddington station, and the carriage’s air-conditioning was just about fighting off the heat outside. Most people seemed to be staring at their phones – in many cases, they were trying to stream a World Cup match, as the 4G signal came and went, and Great Western Railway’s onboard wifi proved to be maddeningly erratic. The trebly chatter of headphone leakage was constant. And thousands of miles and a few time zones away in Loudoun County, Virginia, one of the world’s largest concentrations of computing power was playing its part in keeping everything I saw ticking over, as data from around the world passed back and forth from its vast buildings. Most of us communicate with this small and wealthy corner of the US every day. Thanks to a combination of factors – its proximity to Washington DC, competitive electricity prices, and its low susceptibility to natural disasters – the county is the home of data centres used by about 3,000 tech companies: huge agglomerations of circuitry, cables and cooling systems that sit in corners of the world most of us rarely see, but that are now at the core of how we live. About 70% of the world’s online traffic is reckoned to pass through Loudoun County. But there is a big problem, centred on a power company called Dominion, which supplies the vast majority of Loudoun County’s electricity. According to a 2017 Greenpeace report, only 1% of Dominion’s total electricity comes from credibly renewable sources: 2% originates in hydroelectric plants, and the rest is split evenly between coal, gas and nuclear power. Dominion is also in the middle of a huge regional controversy about a proposed pipeline that will carry fracked gas to its power plants, which it says is partly driven by data centres’ insatiable appetite for electricity. Clearly, then, the video streams, digital photographs and messaging that pour out of all those servers come with a price. I was reminded of all this by the recently published book New Dark Age, by the British writer James Bridle. He cites a study in Japan that suggests that by 2030, the power requirements of digital services will outstrip the nation’s entire current generation capacity. He quotes an American report from 2013 – ironically enough, commissioned by coal industry lobbyists – that pointed out that using either a tablet or smartphone to wirelessly watch an hour of video a week used roughly the same amount of electricity (largely consumed at the data-centre end of the process) as two new domestic fridges. If you worry about climate change and a cause celebre such as the expansion of Heathrow airport, it is worth considering that data centres are set to soon have a bigger carbon footprint than the entire aviation industry. Yet as Bridle points out, even that statistic doesn’t quite do justice to some huge potential problems. He mentions the vast amounts of electricity consumed by the operations of the online currency Bitcoin – which, at the height of the speculative frenzies earlier this year, was set to produce an annual amount of carbon dioxide equivalent to 1m transatlantic flights. And he’s anxious about what will happen next: “In response to vast increases in data storage and computational capacity in the last decade, the amount of energy used by data centres has doubled every four years, and is expected to triple in the next 10 years.” These changes are partly being driven by the so-called internet of things: the increasing array of everyday devices – from TVs, through domestic security devices, to lighting systems, and countless modes of transport – that constantly emit and receive data. If driverless cars ever arrive in our lives, those same flows will increase hugely. At the same time, the accelerating rollout of the internet and its associated technologies in the developing world will add to the load. About a decade ago, we were being told to fight climate change by switching off our TVs and stereos. If the battle is now even more urgent, how does it fit with a world in which router lights constantly flicker, and all the devices we own will be in constant, energy-intensive communication with distant mega-computers? But some good news. Whatever its other ethical contortions, Silicon Valley has an environmental conscience. Facebook has pledged to, sooner or later, power its operations using “100% clean and renewable energy”. Google says it has already achieved that goal. So does Apple. Yet even if you factor in efficiency improvements, beneath many of these claims lies a reality in which the vast and constant demand for power means such companies inevitably use energy generated by fossil fuels, and then atone for it using the often questionable practice of carbon offsetting. And among the big tech corporations, there is one big focus of worry: Amazon, whose ever-expanding cloud computing wing, Amazon Web Services, offers “the on-demand delivery of computer power, database storage … and other IT resources” and provides most of the computing power behind Netflix. This sits at the heart of data centres’ relentless expansion. Green campaigners bemoan the fact that the details of AWS’s electricity consumption and its carbon footprint remain under wraps; on its corporate website, the story of its use of renewable energy suddenly stops in 2016. Besides, for all their power, even the most enlightened US giants obviously command only part of a global industry. To quote from that Greenpeace report: “Among emerging Chinese internet giants such as Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba, the silence on energy performance still remains. Neither the public nor customers are able to obtain any information about their electricity use and CO2 target.” Irrespective of the good work carried out by some tech giants, and whether or not you take seriously projections that the entire communication technology industry could account for up to 14% of carbon emissions by 2040, one stark fact remains: the vast majority of electricity used in the world’s data centres comes from non-renewable sources, and as their numbers rapidly increase, there are no guarantees that this will change. On the fringes of the industry, a few voices have been heard describing the kind of future at which most of us – expecting everything streamed as a right – would balk. They talk about eventually rationing internet use, insisting that people send black and white images, or forcibly pushing them away from binge-streaming videos. Their basic point, it seems, chimes with those occasions when the smartphone in your pocket starts to suddenly heat up: a metaphor for our warming planet, and the fact that even the most well-intentioned corporations may yet find that their supposedly unlimited digital delights are, in the dictionary definition of the term, unsustainable. • John Harris is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/17/uk-to-review-climate-target-raising-hopes-of-a-zero-emissions-pledge","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T13:23:54Z","webTitle":"UK to review climate target raising hopes of a zero emissions pledge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/17/uk-to-review-climate-target-raising-hopes-of-a-zero-emissions-pledge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/17/uk-to-review-climate-target-raising-hopes-of-a-zero-emissions-pledge","fields":{"headline":"UK to review climate target raising hopes of a zero emissions pledge","bodyText":"The UK is to review its long-term target to cut climate emissions as part of global efforts to curb rising temperatures, the government has announced. The announcement by clean growth minister Claire Perry during the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) raises the possibility the UK could implement a target to reduce emissions to “net zero” by 2050, tightening the existing goal to cut greenhouse gases by 80% by that date. Such a target would require more stringent cuts to carbon in the short as well as long term, and a much faster transformation of key parts of the economy – including energy, transport, industry and housing – than has yet been contemplated. The government’s statutory advisers would be expected to set out key choices on how this could be achieved. Under the global Paris agreement, countries have committed to curbing temperature rises to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep them to 1.5C, to prevent dangerous climate change. Such a move will require the world to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero in the second half of the century. The UK government pledged in 2016 to enshrine a zero target in law, but has not yet passed any legislation. After a global scientific review of the impacts of, and action needed to keep to, a 1.5C rise is published this autumn, the UK’s climate advisers will be asked to review the country’s 2050 target, Perry said in a speech on Tuesday. After the report, she said: “We will be seeking the advice of the UK’s independent advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, on the implications of the Paris agreement for the UK’s long-term emissions reduction targets.” The committee recently suggested the UK would have to meet the net-zero target by 2045-50 in order to do its bit to ensure global temperature rises do not exceed 1.5C. A temperature rise of 1.5C is seen by some countries, such as low lying islands at risk of rising sea levels, as the limit beyond which their very existence is threatened. Laurence Tubiana, a key architect of the Paris agreement and chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, said: “For a safe climate we need all governments to aim for cutting pollution to net zero levels by 2050. “This decision to review Britain’s long-term climate target sends a strong message to the EU and other big economies that London is committed to the Paris agreement, and now it’s time they too considered what more they can do.” Ways of meeting the net-zero target could include investing in projects to grow trees and restore soils, to take up greater carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as well as more controversial measures such as investing in emissions reduction projects overseas. Even with such methods, the UK is likely to have to bring forward targets on phasing out diesel and petrol engines, and expand renewable energy generation and, potentially, nuclear power. Many actions under Conservative-led governments since 2010, however, have dismayed climate campaigners and may have to be reconsidered. These include the failure to insulate the UK’s draughty homes, limits on renewable energy, the scrapping of carbon capture and storage projects and tax breaks for fossil fuels. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said the review was extremely important and could provide a “valuable lead” for other countries. “The data shows that the challenges posed by emissions from transport – land, sea and air – and our reliance on gas for heating will have to be confronted as a matter of urgency. “Fossil-fuel dependent cars and vans need to be removed from sale by 2030, a step-change in energy efficiency standards in our construction industry should be prioritised, and the government must accept that no new runway at Heathrow will fit inside our carbon budget,” he added. The government’s announcement was welcomed by others at the Commonwealth summit, where climate change has been seen as one of the key issues under discussion. Nearly half of the Commonwealth nations are classed as “small island developing states”, which are the most vulnerable to climate change. Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji, which currently holds the presidency of the UN’s climate forum, told the meeting: “I am encouraged by Britain’s undertaking to review its climate targets with a view to increasing ambition. The [targets] we all promised to make in the Paris agreement should be setting high standards for the rest of the world to follow. But just as importantly, we in the Commonwealth can show how cooperation based on trust can supply the finance, technology and skilled resources to deliver the necessary transformation in our economies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2020/jul/05/donald-trump-coronavirus-testing-fauci-fourth-july-kanye-west-protests-latest-news-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-07-05T21:28:34Z","webTitle":"Trump claims victory as US nears 130,000 Covid-19 deaths – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jul/05/donald-trump-coronavirus-testing-fauci-fourth-july-kanye-west-protests-latest-news-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2020/jul/05/donald-trump-coronavirus-testing-fauci-fourth-july-kanye-west-protests-latest-news-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Trump claims victory as US nears 130,000 Covid-19 deaths – as it happened","bodyText":"We’ll be shutting down today’s blog shortly. Here’s a glance at the day’s top news items: Trump celebrates Fourth of July by stoking division over pandemic and race. The US president celebrated America’s birthday by stoking divisions over a perceived culture war and dismissing the two most immediate threats to his presidency: a massive resurgence of coronavirus cases and a growing racial justice movement seeking an end to police violence across the nation. Ghislaine Maxwell to appear in court as fresh details of arrest emerge. More than 20 armed officers said to have taken part in raid leading to her detention at rural New Hampshire retreat. Bolton: Trump claim he wasn’t told of Russia bounty report is ‘not how system works’. Ex-national security adviser also says any decision to withhold intelligence would ‘certainly not’ be ‘made only by the briefer’. Texas mayors warn of ‘serious trouble’ as coronavirus cases surge across US. Two prominent Texas mayors have warned that hospitals in their cities will be “overwhelmed” by cases of Covid-19 inside two weeks, even as Trump continues to portray the coronavirus resurgence nationwide as the embers of a fire he is steadily extinguishing. Seattle police seek motive after driver hits protesters, killing one. One person died and one remained in serious condition after a car drove into protesters on a freeway in the Washington city. FDA commissioner says prospect of Americans refusing vaccines is ‘concerning’. Stephen Hahn appeared on ABC’s This Week and was asked about a poll that found 27% of Americans would be unlikely to accept a free coronavirus vaccine if it was available. Kanye West for president? Realities and rules say White House run unlikely. If the rapper is serious about running against Trump and Biden, he has significant obstacles to clear. Another of the former Minneapolis police officers charged in the killing of George Floyd has been released from jail, according to Hennepin County jail records. The Associated Press reports: Tou Thao, age 34, is the third former officer accused in Floyd’s death to be released on bond. He posted $750,000 bond on Saturday, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported. All four officers on the scene of Floyd’s death have been fired and face criminal charges. Floyd, who was Black and handcuffed, died on 25 May while being arrested. A white police officer used his knee to pin Floyd’s neck for nearly eight minutes as Floyd begged for air and eventually stopped moving. Besides the charges against the officers, Floyd’s death led to worldwide protests over police brutality and racial injustice. Thao is set to appear in court on 11 September on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. Two other former officers, J Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane, face the same charges as Thao. Derek Chauvin, the officer who pressed his knee to Floyd’s neck, is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter with culpable negligence. He remains in police custody. The Grim Reaper made a return appearance on Florida’s beaches over Fourth of July weekend. Daniel Uhlfelder, an attorney who made national headlines in May for dressing as Death himself in an effort to warn Floridians of the dangers of gathering in too close a proximity, brought his scythe-wielding personal to Jacksonville Beach during the holiday, where a number of colorful exchanges with Donald Trump supporters ensued. Florida health officials said on Sunday the state has reached a grim milestone with more than 200,000 people having tested positive for Covid-19. State statistics released Sunday show about 10,000 new people tested positive. Saturday’s numbers, with more than 11,400 cases reported, marked a record new single-day high. More than 3,700 people have died statewide. About 43% of the cases are in three counties: Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach. A spike in gun purchases during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic was associated with a nearly 8% increase in firearm violence in the US, according to a new estimate from researchers at the University of California, Davis. That increase translated into an estimated 776 additional shooting injuries in the US from March through May, the researchers found. The pandemic appears to have inspired Americans to make 2.1m more gun purchases than under typical circumstances. The new estimates, the first to quantify the effects of coronavirus gun-buying, come from the preprint of a study conducted by one of the leading US gun violence researchers. The results have not yet gone through peer review or been published in a research journal. “We wanted to get this research out as soon as possible, because obviously there are important implications for public health and public safety,” said Julia Schleimer, a research data analyst at the University of California Firearm Violence Research Center, and one of the study’s authors. The researchers looked at increases in gun purchases and changes in firearms violence across 48 states and the District of Columbia. They found that many demographic factors – including overall rates of firearm ownership, socioeconomic status, how urban a state was and levels of residential segregation by race – did not seem to make a difference in the relationship between increased gun purchases and firearms violence. But states that had lower levels of violent crime pre-Covid saw a stronger connection between additional gun purchases and more gun violence. The study used data from the Gun Violence Archive, which publishes information on shootings and firearms deaths based on media reports. The study did not examine the effect of firearms purchase increases on gun suicide, which represent the majority of gun deaths in the US. States that ordered gun stores to be closed at some point during the pandemic, rather than naming them as essential businesses that could stay open, on average had smaller overall increases in gun purchases. The White House press pool reports that Donald Trump is back at the executive mansion after a morning of golf at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia’s Loudoun County, his 124th round since taking office. CBS News has shared a few images of Trump in action. No word on who rounded out Trump’s foursome. His playing partner last Sunday was South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who claimed the US president shot a two-over-par 74 on the day, which feels, er, charitable. Artists and volunteers in Maryland have been putting the finishing touches on a 7,000 sq ft mural of Breonna Taylor in a historically black neighborhood in Maryland’s capital city. Taylor, 26, was killed in her Louisville home in March by police who were serving a no-knock warrant. Protesters have been calling for the officers involved in her death to be charged. The sprawling depiction of Taylor, the latest work by muralist Jeff Huntington, has been organized by Future History Now in partnership with Banneker-Douglass Museum and the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture. Huntington told the Capital Gazette his organization chose to paint Taylor to show support for the Black Lives Matter movement and to focus on a prominent female figure in the movement. Reuters has more on Kanye West’s surprise announcement on Saturday night that he will be running for president. Though it probably warrants mention that West released the lead single for his forthcoming 10th studio album God’s Country on Tuesday and he’s never been shy about cannonballing into the news cycle by hook or by crook for the sake of an album rollout. (Just saying.) If Kanye West is serious about running for president, the rapper and fashion designer will face major obstacles to mounting a serious campaign less than four months before the 3 November election. West said he was running in a Twitter post on Saturday, the Fourth of July holiday. If so, he will have to work fast to get his name on the ballot alongside Donald Trump and the presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia. There are two routes to doing so, said James McCann, a political scientist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. West could try secure the backing of a smaller political party. Without it, he could try to appear as an independent. Donald Trump will reportedly hold an outdoor rally in New Hampshire on Saturday, lending support to the theory his campaign has increasingly seen the New England state as crucial in the president’s reelection bid. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, and New Hampshire’s four electoral votes, by a narrower-than-expected 0.6% margin in the 2016 general election. One unnamed Trump adviser teased the campaign’s tactics, telling Politico that a win in New Hampshire combined with either Nevada or New Mexico (where Trump has also devoted significant resources), would create a path to victory even if Biden wins big in the Rust Belt. “We don’t need 306,” the person said. “We just need 270. We can lose Michigan and lose Pennsylvania and still win.” Austin’s Democratic mayor Steve Adler decried Donald Trump’s “ambiguous” messaging on the coronavirus pandemic on Sunday, calling on the governor to empower local governments to order residents to stay home amid an alarming surge in statewide case numbers. “It makes me angry,” Adler said on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday. “You know, I understand he has a tough job, but it is dangerous not to be sending a clear message to Americans.” “When they start hearing that kind of ambiguous message coming out of Washington, there are more and more people that won’t wear masks, that won’t social distance, that won’t do what it takes to keep a community safe,” he added. Adler estimated the hospitals in the Texas capital are “within two weeks” of being overrun if his state doesn’t “change the trajectory”. ICUs could face the same problem even sooner, he said. The mayor’s sentiments were echoed by Harris County judge Lina Hidalgo, who has been front and center of Houston’s response and agreed a stay-at-home order is needed in the state’s largest city. Texas reported its highest daily increase in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases Saturday with 8,258. The Republican governor of Arkansas, Asa Hutchinson, may not have made many friends in the White House today, given his comment that if Donald Trump decides to hold a campaign rally in his state, attendees will need to wear masks. Appearing on NBC’s Meet the Press, Hutchinson said he would expect people to follow his state’s guidelines by practicing social distancing or wearing masks. He understood the value of having national Fourth of July celebrations such as that at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota on Friday, he said, and that some Americans may be experiencing “virus fatigue”. But people who attended Trump’s event on Friday should have been wearing face coverings to “set an example”, he said. Trump has also recently held events in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Phoenix, Arizona; and Washington DC. He and many attendees did not wear masks. Here’s Richard Luscombe’s report on Trump’s somewhat unorthodox approach to a weekend meant for national celebration: Donald Trump’s claim not to have been briefed about intelligence suggesting Russia paid bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill US soldiers is “just not the way the system works”, former national security adviser John Bolton said on Sunday. Bolton was appearing on Face the Nation, the Sunday talk show from ViacomCBS, the communications giant which owns Simon &amp; Schuster, the publisher which put out Bolton’s Trump White House memoir, The Room Where It Happened, over the president’s objection. Elsewhere on Sunday morning, former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice said Bolton would have known about the bounties intelligence while he was in the role, which he left in September 2019. “I don’t buy this story that he was never briefed,” Rice told NBC’s Meet The Press. “I believe that over a year ago, when the information first came to light in 2019, that my successor, John Bolton, would have walked straight into the Oval Office, as I would have, and informed the president of this intelligence.” Bolton’s book, a bombshell tell-all which sold nearly 800,000 copies in its first week in stores, is named for the Oval Office. But it does not include mention of the bounties plot. “I’m not going to disclose classified information,” Bolton told CBS. “I’ve got the struggle with the president trying to repress my book on that score already. “I will say this. All intelligence is distributed along the spectrum of uncertainty. And this intelligence in 2020, by the administration’s own admission, was deemed credible enough to give to our allies. So the notion that you only give the really completely 100% verified intelligence to the president would mean you give him almost nothing. And that’s just not the way the system works.” Current national security adviser Robert O’Brien has said information about the Russian plot was withheld by a CIA officer, even though it was in the president’s brief. Bolton said any decision to withhold intelligence would “certainly not” be “made only by the briefer who briefs the president twice a week. That’s a decision that at least when I was there, would have been made by the director of national intelligence, the director of the CIA, myself and the briefer together.” Though his book is an extensive anatomisation of Trump’s personality and fitness or otherwise for office, Bolton sidestepped a chance to criticise O’Brien, saying: “I don’t want to make this a matter of personalities.” Nor would he say if he had known of the bounties intelligence or not. “What was made public in 2018,” he said, “was Russian assistance to the Taliban, and that’s been known for some time. That alone is troubling. “What is particularly troubling, if true, is this latest information that they were … providing compensation for killing Americans. And that is the kind of thing that you go to the president on and say, ‘Look … we may not know everything on this, but a nuclear power is reportedly providing bounties to kill Americans.’ “That’s the kind of thing you need to have in the president’s view so that he can think about it as he develops – well, at least as normal presidents develop strategy to handle Russia, to handle Afghanistan.” Maanvi Singh has news on California’s trouble coping with the Covid-19 pandemic: For a good while, it seemed California had skirted past calamity. It was the first US state to order residents to shelter in place in March, and its early, aggressive actions paid off. Despite it being the most populous state and an international hub with the largest number of direct flights to China, where the coronavirus first appeared, California’s death rate remained relatively low. By May, Disneyland announced plans to reopen. The nation’s top health official Dr Anthony Fauci praised Governor Gavin Newsom’s leadership. And as the weather warmed, Californians flooded back to beaches and bars. “We had reason to feel confident,” said Dr Bob Wachter, who chairs the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. “And then, we hit some trouble.” A few outbreaks sparked an explosion, with an average of about 6,000 to 7,000 new cases each day over the past week. Los Angeles county began to count more residents sick with Covid-19 cases anywhere else in the nation and Disneyland postponed its reopening. As hospitalizations surged, the death toll climbed past 6,000, and ICU beds in some regions began filling to capacity, California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, ordered bars, restaurant dining rooms, cinemas and other indoor venues in the hardest-hit counties to close back up. Now, health officials and epidemiologists sifting through the rubble are left wondering how the Golden state lost its status as the public health golden child. You can read the full article below: CNN has offered a rather pointed response to Donald Trump after the president attacked the network for “manipulating the words and meaning of my 4th of July Speech.” CNN, in fact, had disproven reports on the internet that Trump had made a historical error in his speech. “What. Are. You. Talking. About? CNN fact-checked and dispelled the video clip that made it seem like you’d said Desert Storm happened in Vietnam,” wrote CNN’s PR department on Twitter. Plenty of athletes have tested positive for Covid-19 as the sports world starts to resume. While most have proved to be asymptomatic, it is sobering to hear that even young, very fit people can feel the effects of the virus. The Atlanta Braves’ Freddie Freeman, one of the best first basemen in baseball, has tested positive and his wife, Chelsea, posted on Instagram that the virus has taken a toll on her husband. “He is someone who literally never gets sick and this virus hit him like a ton of bricks,” she wrote. “We’ve been really strict for the last 4 months. Haven’t gone to a grocery store, haven’t gone out to dinner once, haven’t seen our friends ... and still got it.” She added that her 30-year-old husband has suffered from “body aches, headaches, chills and a high fever.” “It’s a serious matter,” Braves outfielder Nick Markakis said. “I hope Freddie heals up quickly. I know he’s young, healthy. I hope he heals up and gets back as quickly as possible because as you know with 60 games, one week can change things quickly.” The Major League Baseball season is due to resume on 23 July. Just when you thought 2020 couldn’t get any weirder, rapper Kanye West declared his candidacy for US president. The unlikely challenger to Donald Trump – of whom he has been a vocal supporter – and Joe Biden, chose American independence day to make the surprise announcement on Twitter, triggering a social media storm. “We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future,” West wrote. “I am running for president of the United States.” The post was accompanied by a stars and stripes flag, an exclamation mark and “#2020VISION”. His wife, Kim Kardashian West, replied to the tweet with an American flag. With just four months to go before polling day on 3 November, it was not clear whether West’s tweet would have been more fitting on April Fools’ day than American Independence Day. Nor was it clear whether the 43-year-old had filed any official paperwork to appear on state election ballots. The deadline to add independent candidates to the ballot has not yet passed in many states. But after businessman and reality TV star Trump won the White House in 2016, perhaps the idea of Kim Kardashian as first lady could be written in the stars as America’s fate. And West, a 21-time Grammy award winner, picked up an immediate endorsement from Elon Musk, the chief executive of electric-car maker Tesla and another celebrity known for eccentric outbursts, who tweeted in reply: “You have my full support!” A West-Musk ticket is not what anyone was expecting in an election that has already delivered a cornucopia of the unexpected. West and his wife have visited Trump in the White House to discuss prison reform. At one bizarre meeting in 2018, West wore a red “Make America Great Again” cap and uttered words such as “motherfucker” and “infinite amounts of universe”. He said Trump made him feel like Superman, hugged him and declared: “I love this guy right here.” Asked if West could be a future presidential candidate, Trump replied: “Could very well be.” During his appearance on CBS’s Face the Nation earlier, Houston’s Democratic mayor Sylvester Turner was asked what he thought about Donald Trump’s comments that he wanted to fight the “radical left, Marxists, anarchists, agitators and the looters and the angry mob trying to tear down our statues and address our history.” Turner said those looking to take down Confederate era statues in Houston had not caused problems. “In Houston, we have taken them down, and they’ve been taken down very peacefully with the support, I would say, probably of most Houstonians in this city,” he says. “... The fact is that those monuments were placed, for example, in Houston 80 to 100 years ago to glorify the bad things that were done to people like my ancestors. It has been past due time for those statues to come down. We did it in a respectful way. We’re not trying to erase history, but we are trying to take the power of placing these statues in public spaces away and to place them where they can be told, where the history can be told and placed in its context.” Susan Rice, who served as national security adviser under Barack Obama, says she has trouble believing Donald Trump was not briefed on reports Russians paid bounties for the killing of American soldiers in Afghanistan. “The president of the United States has demonstrated absolutely callous disregard for the safety and security of American forces in a war zone and there’s no explanation for this, she said on NBC’s Meet The Press. “Why ten days after this story was first published has he not come out and said to the American people ‘My top priority is to protect our men and women in uniform and I will get to the bottom of this intelligence. I will figure out why it is that Russia appears to be targeting our forces, and I will give the American people and the soldiers the appropriate response that it deserves.’ He said nothing ... I don’t buy this story that he was never briefed.” She also did not rule out acting as a running mate for the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden. “Joe Biden needs to make the decision as to who he thinks will be his best running mate and I will do my utmost drawing on my experience of years in government, years of making the bureaucracy work,” she said. “I’ve worked on multiple campaigns, presidential campaigns, I’ve been on the campaign trail as a, as a surrogate and I’m going to do everything I can to help get Joe Biden elected and to help him succeed as president, whether I’m his running mate or I’m a door knocker, I don’t mind.” Houston mayor Sylvester Turner has appeared on CBS’s Face The Nation to discuss the Covid-19 outbreak in his city. He says staffing at the city’s hospital is a particular problem. “If we don’t get our hands around this virus quickly, in about two weeks our hospital system could be in serious, serious trouble,” he says. “... We can always provide additional beds, but we need the people, the nurses and everybody else, the medical professionals to staff those beds. That’s the critical point right now.” Turner says that, as we have seen across the US, it is people of color who are more impacted but no one is immune – and that includes younger people. “It’s having a disproportional impact on people of color. And right now, it’s especially within the Hispanic community,” he says. “But we are having young people being impacted as well. Just the other day, I now saw a young woman in her 20s with no underlying medical conditions that died as a result of Covid. So it’s anyone from their 20s into their 90s being impacted.” Turner, who is a Democrat, says that he thinks Texas reopened too quickly. “So from the beginning, when we started opening too quickly and when you layer that on top of everything else, all the other activities that were taking place and people starting to re socialize then you started to refuel the virus,” he says. “And that’s when the numbers started to increase”. New Jersey’s Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, has appeared on NBC’s Meet The Press. New Jersey has been one of the worst-hit states in the US during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, and he says a national strategy is needed to combat Covid-19. “This thing is lethal,” he says. “New Jersey’s paid an enormous price. We’ve [had] 13,000 confirmed fatalities from Covid-19. We’re starting to see small spikes in reinfection from folks coming back from places like Myrtle Beach and as well as in Florida, other hotspots. “To me, it says we need a national strategy. We’re only as strong as our weakest link right now ... We need a national strategy I think right now masking has got to be at the core of that.” He is asked whether facemasks should be required nationwide. “It’s become almost not even debatable,” he says. “Certainly when you’re going out and absolutely indoors. As I’ve mentioned, this virus is a lot more lethal inside than outside, but if you’re leaving your house, put on a mask. I think it ought to be a national, a national requirement.” Murphy has received backlash after delaying the reopening of indoor dining in restaurants, particularly from business owners who said they had bought supplies and spent money on cleaning their premises. “Listen, we have nothing but sympathy for them,” he says. “Believe me and it’s why we need direct federal cash assistance to states so that we can help those restaurants and small businesses out. But the choice is, either we open inside and or based on the data that we saw and as I said the lethality of this virus inside, or we lose people. We literally lose lives. When you combine indoors, lack of ventilation, sedentary, close proximity, and by definition, you have to take your mask off to eat, those are bad facts and we’re just not there yet. We’ll get there I hope, but we’re not ready for it.” FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said earlier today that it is “too early to tell” whether the Republican National Convention should take place in Florida next month as Covid-19 cases surge. Donald Trump’s campaign team relocated most of the convention to Jacksonville after a dispute with North Carolina over social distancing guidelines. On Sunday Republican National Committees spokesperson Mike Reed said the RNC is still committed to Jacksonville. “The RNC is committed to holding a safe convention that fully complies with local health regulations in place at the time,” said in statement to CNN. “The event is still almost two months away, and we are planning to offer health precautions including but not limited to temperature checks, available PPE, aggressive sanitizing protocols, and available Covid-19 testing. We have a great working relationship with local leadership in Jacksonville and the state of Florida, and we will continue to coordinate with them in the months ahead.” Richard Luscombe has the latest Covid-19 data from Florida. Worrying figures just in from Florida: the state recorded 10,059 new cases of Covid-19 overnight, bringing the overall total past 200,000. Florida’s death toll increased by 29 to 3,731, and the number of hospitalisations statewide rose by a further 160, to 15,595 since the pandemic began. The statistics show that in three of the five days of July so far, new coronavirus cases are above 10,000. Connecticut Democratic senator Chris Murphy has compared Donald Trump’s divisive campaign – and its reliance for racist dog whistling – to that of segregationist George Wallace. Wallace ran unsuccessfully for the presidency three times, and Murphy thinks Trump will meet the same fate this time around. “Last night the President called the words Black Lives Matter ‘a symbol of hate’. No turning back now. He’s running as George Wallace. Unapologetic racism and division. It won’t work,” wrote Murphy on Twitter. Samuel G Freeman wrote for a column for the Guardian last week on the similarities between Trump and Wallace - but he believes they are unfair to Wallace, who at least showed some contrition later in life. Here’s an extract below: On a Sunday morning in 1979, Wallace rolled his wheelchair down the aisle of Dexter Avenue baptist church in Montgomery, which had been Martin Luther King’s pulpit during the bus boycott in 1956, to ask forgiveness of its members. “I have learned what suffering means,” he said, according to a biography by Stephan Lesher. “In a way that was impossible, I think I can understand something of the pain black people have come to endure. I know I contributed to that pain, and I can only ask your forgiveness.” You can read the full article here: Judge Lina Hidalgo, of Harris county, where Houston is located, has appeared on ABC’s This Week. Houston has been at the center of the resurgence of Covid-19 in Texas. She paints a grim picture of the situation. “At this point, our hospitals here in Harris county, Houston, and 33 other cities, they are crossing, they’re into surge capacities. So their operational beds are taken up,” she says. “What we’re seeing is that wishful thinking is neither good economic policy nor good public health policy. We had initially this increase back in March. I had the authority to issue a stay home order, and I did quickly, early. We avoided the fate of most other communities our size. But since then the state reopened. Now we know too early, too much.” She adds that another stay-at-home order is essential. “We don’t have room to experiment. We don’t have room for incrementalism, we’re seeing these kinds of numbers, nor should we wait for all the hospital beds to fill and all these people to die, before we take drastic action,” she says. Various photos have emerged from across the US, and across all sections of society, of people breaking social distancing guidelines during the holiday weekend as Covid-19 cases rise across America. FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn has been a busy man today. After his appearance on CNN he’s now on ABC’s This Week and is asked about a poll that found 27% of Americans would be unlikely to accept a free coronavirus vaccine if it was available. “It is a sizable number,” he says. “And it is concerning. And, of course, the issue of vaccines in this country has been around for a number of years. “... One of the major reasons we issued this guidance was we wanted to give clarity about what we were going to look at, what we need to look at, and that the FDA has incredible scientific expertise and we will do our job to assess the safety and the efficacy of a vaccine candidate. I want to assure the American people of that and provide confidence that we’re on the job.” Phoenix’s Democratic mayor, Kate Gallego, is on ABC’s This Week. Her state, Arizona, has the highest daily new cases per capita in the US. “We opened way too early in Arizona,” she says. We were one of the last states to go to stay-at-home and one of the first to reemerge. “We had crowded nightclubs handing out free champagne, no masks. Our 20 to 44-year-olds, which is my own demographic, really led the explosion, and we’ve seen such growth in that area. We’re seeing a lot of people go to large family gatherings and infect their family members.” She says getting proper testing has been a problem, and some people in Arizona have had to wait for eight hours to be tested. “It’s awful to see people waiting in a car, while you’re feeling sick, people were running of gas,” she says. Gallego says that the messaging from the top has not helped matters. “President Trump was in my community, chose not to wear a mask, and he’s having large events while I am trying to push people that you need to stay at home and that events with more than 10 people are dangerous per the Centers for Disease Control,” she says. Miami’s Republican mayor, Francis Suarez, is on ABC’s This Week. On Saturday, Florida registered a record rise in cases of Covid-19. “We’ve been breaking record after record after record ... the last couple of weeks,” he says. “We instituted about a week ago a mask in public rule and we also increased the severity of penalties for businesses that don’t follow the rules. “Our county closed down the beaches for the July 4th weekend in the hopes that all these rules will have an impact – a positive impact. It takes a little bit of time to find out exactly but we’re obviously very closely monitoring hospitalizations and we’re very, very closely monitoring the death rate ... we have to take much stricter measures.” He is then asked by host Martha Raddatz if Miami reopened businesses too soon after lockdown. “I was criticized for waiting so long,” he says. But there’s no doubt that the fact that when we reopened, people started socializing as if the the virus didn’t exist. And what we saw was before the stay at home order is we saw an increasing slope of 35 new cases per day. Right after we implanted the stay at home order, we started seeing that decline almost immediately. “Just before this weekend, the incline slope was 91 new cases per day. So it’s almost three times a greater slope than it was prior to the stay at home order. So, you know, it’s extremely worrisome.” The FDA commissioner, Stephen Hahn, is on CNN’s State of the Union. He is asked about President Trump’s assertion that 99% of Covid-19 cases are harmless. Host Dana Bash points out that WHO says 20% of people diagnosed with the virus need hospital treatment. Is the president wrong in that case? Hahn, perhaps understandably given the scientific evidence against the president, dodges the question. “I’m not going to get into who is right and who is wrong ... [people should] follow the CDC guidance.” He then adds that the “data show [Covid-19] is serious”. He is then asked about Trump’s appearance at Mt Rushmore on Friday, where many people in the audience did not wear masks. Hahn is asked whether that was sensible behaviour. “If you don’t follow guidelines you are putting yourself and your loved ones at risk,” he says. Trump has said Covid-19 will “disappear”. Hahn, who you feel a bit sorry for at this point, is then shown a chart of US cases compared to the EU, Canada and South Korea. One line is going up sharply, the others are all going down - or are flat because they’re already way below the US’s total. Hahn is asked when he thinks the virus will “disappear”. He says “we’re seeing this surge in cases ... this virus is still with us. We have new therapeutics.” He admits the rise in cases across the US is “a concerning trend”. Finally, he is asked about the Republican National Convention, which is due to take place next month in Florida, a state which has been recording new highs in cases most days. Does he think the convention should go ahead or be moved. “I think it’s too early to tell,” Hahn says. “We’ll have to see how this unfolds in Florida and around the country.” News from Florida now, where Richard Luscombe reports on the status of Covid-19 over the holiday weekend. Florida was bracing for more bad news on Sunday after the 4 July holiday brought yet another record surge in Covid-19 - 11,458 new cases on Saturday for a statewide total fast closing in on 200,000. Of equal concern is the rising rate of hospitalisations. The Sun-Sentinel reported that almost a thousand patients were admitted with serious complications in the three days since Thursday. A month ago, that three-day figure was 429. Today’s figures are expected at some point this morning. Despite closures in the heavily-populated south-eastern counties of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach, most of Florida’s beaches remained open for the holiday weekend, raising fears of another rise in numbers similar to the one that followed Memorial Day at the end of May. Democrats are keeping pressure on Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, for his refusal to order a statewide mask mandate, similar to the one passed by his counterpart Greg Abbott in Texas last week. “We’ve raised this issue repeatedly and have called on Ron DeSantis to follow the lead of experts,” said Terrie Rizzo, chair of the Florida Democratic Party. “Ron DeSantis refuses to wear a mask most times when he appears in public, as does Donald Trump, which sets a bad example for everybody.” DeSantis has been vocal in criticising the media for covering what many see as a botched response to the crisis now threatening to overwhelm his state. The governor, however, is still waiting for the “apology” demanded by right-wing National Review in May. The LA Times columnist Michael Hiltzik has an apology of sorts: “Sorry, you’re even worse than I imagined.” Meanwhile, with coronavirus numbers continuing to soar, another troubling week looks to be in store for the Sunshine State state. Those looking to escape into sports are also set to be disappointed. The Miami Herald reports that four players from the Marlins, the city’s Major League baseball franchise, have tested positive for Covid-19. The Associated Press has the latest from Seattle, where one of two people hit by a car which drove into protesters early on Saturday morning has died: “Summer Taylor, 24, of Seattle died in the evening at Harborview Medical Center, spokesperson Susan Gregg said. Taylor and Diaz Love, 32, of Portland, Oregon, were hit by the car that barreled through a panicked crowd of protesters on Interstate 5, officials said. Love is in serious condition in the intensive care unit, Harborview, Gregg said. Dawit Kelete of Seattle drove the car around vehicles that were blocking I-5 and sped into the crowd about 1.40am, according to a police report. Video taken at the scene by protesters showed people shouting “Car! Car!” before fleeing the roadway. Love was filming the protest in a nearly two-hour-long Facebook livestream captioned “Black Femme March takes I-5” when the video ended abruptly. With about 15 seconds left, shouts of “Car!” can be heard as the camera starts to shake before screeching tires and the sound of impact are heard. A graphic video posted on social media showed the white Jaguar racing toward a group of protesters who were standing behind several parked cars, set up for protection. The car swerved around the other vehicles and slammed into the two protesters, sending them flying into the air. The driver, who was alone, fled the scene, Trooper Chase Van Cleave said. One of the other protesters got in a car and chased the driver for about a mile. He was able to stop him by pulling his car in front of the Jaguar, Van Cleave said. Troopers arrived, and the driver was put in custody. Kelete was described by offices as reserved and sullen, according to court documents. He also asked if the pedestrians were OK. Kelete was booked into the King County Correctional Facility on Saturday morning on two counts of vehicular assault. Bail was denied. He faces a second court hearing on Monday. Officials were trying to determine motive as well as where Kelete got on to the interstate, which had been closed by the state patrol for more than an hour. Authorities said they suspect Kelete drove the wrong way on a ramp and went through a barrier that closed the freeway. Troopers did not know whether it was a targeted attack, but impairment was not considered a factor. Seattle has been the site of prolonged unrest following the 25 May police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which sparked nationwide protests. Dozens of people were arrested this week after authorities cleared the “Capitol Hill Occupied Protest” zone Wednesday morning. The Washington state patrol said that it will no longer allow protesters to enter I-5 and will arrest pedestrians on the freeway, which protesters had shut down 19 days in a row.” Donald Trump is very exercised about statues and their place in US life, and wants a “National Garden of American Heroes” to be erected by executive order, a slightly Blofeldian project if ever there was one. There are all sorts of reasons why the project may never see the light of day, including Trump losing the White House in November and/or Congress refusing to pay for it. In the meantime, the president’s selection of such heroes – no Native Americans, Latinos or Asian Americans among them – is causing the expected fuss. The Washington Post reports that Karen Cox, a history professor at University of North Carolina at Charlotte, “struggled for several minutes to describe the order outlining the proposed monument”. “It’s just so random. It’s like they threw a bunch of stuff on the wall and just went with whatever stuck,” she said. “Nothing about this suggests it’s thoughtful.” Precedent would suggest Professor Cox might be on to something, there. Here’s our Washington bureau chief, David Smith, on how the capital is dealing with attempts to bring down statues of presidents and others: More on the coronavirus count in the US, which Johns Hopkins University says dipped below 50,000 a day on Saturday for the first time in four days. As the AP puts it, “the lower figure does not mean the situation is improving: it could be due to reduced reporting on a national holiday”. More from the AP: The US leads the world in coronavirus infections (2.8m) and deaths (130,000), though the true toll is likely higher, given undetected cases. It is also on a steep upward curve. US authorities were reporting fewer than 20,000 new infections a day as recently as 15 June. On Saturday, Florida and Texas reported more record daily increases in confirmed cases and virus-related deaths have begun to rise. Donald Trump spoke in South Dakota on Friday and Washington on Saturday, but elsewhere communities canceled Fourth of July parades and fireworks and cautioned against large gatherings. Texas, which reported a record daily increase of 8,258 confirmed coronavirus cases Saturday, is retreating from one of the country’s swiftest re-openings. Much of the state began mandating face coverings Friday, with a $250 fine. In Florida, which reported 11,445 confirmed infections on Saturday, bars are shut down and some regional attractions, such as Zoo Miami and Jungle Island, have closed. Officials in South Florida including in Miami-Dade county and the Florida Keys closed beaches through the weekend. Other beaches remained open. California governor Gavin Newsom has ordered a three-week closure of bars and many indoor establishments. Here’s Maanvi Singh’s report from Oakland on what went wrong in California: …and welcome to another day of politics, protest and public health crisis in the US. Donald Trump spoke at the White House on Saturday night, at a Fourth of July celebration, duly blaming China for the coronavirus outbreak and claiming “we’ve learned how to put out the flame”. As the New York Times put it, “After delivering a divisive speech at Mount Rushmore on Friday night, President Trump … again waved away objections from some officials and public health experts who were worried the virus could spread through the events’ crowds.” Masks were optional, social-distancing not exclusively observed. According to Johns Hopkins University, Saturday was the first day in four in which fewer than 50,000 new cases were discovered across the US. The figure was still 45,300, though, and the same source puts total US cases at 2.8m and deaths at nearly 130,000. White House task force member Dr Anthony Fauci told the Senate this week “it’s pretty obvious that we are not going in the right direction”, and said 100,000 cases a day could be on the way as states which reopened too soon, Texas and Florida prominent among them, bear the brunt of the resurgence. Trump, however, continues to insist more cases are only being found because more tests are being done. “Now we have tested almost 40m people,” he said. “By so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless. Results that no other country can show because no other country has the testing that we have, not in terms of the numbers or in terms of quality.” And so it goes on, as the Fourth of July weekend continues and many worry about the effects of gatherings for fireworks and cookouts in a land where wearing a mask has become a partisan issue. Here’s Robert Reich’s take: Elsewhere, Kanye West has declared a run for president (it’s less clear if he’s actually filed anything or will be on any ballot) and as Trump’s attack on “far-left fascists” continues to reverberate – the Washington Post: For Trump, the threat now isn’t immigrants or other nations. It’s other Americans – protests over racism and police brutality continue. In Seattle, one of two women hit by a car that drove into a crowd early on Saturday has died.

The two energy sources I am most interested in are wind and solar power; however, there are other sources that have great potential. Some people doubt how much wind and solar can supply to a country’s electricity grid. This is a particularly challenging question to answer in part because both solar power and wind power fluctuate in both space and time. We all know solar panels work well during the day, when the sun shines – they don’t work so well at night. And wind turbines only send electrons when the wind is blowing. Fortunately, these two sources of energy fluctuate in ways that complement each other. For instance, solar power generation is highest in the summer and lowest in the winter. Wind power is greatest in the spring and fall. Wind turbines work at night when solar panels are dormant. So, can these complementing variations help balance out the power that the two technologies can provide? This question was addressed in a very recent paper published in the journal Energy and Environmental Science. The author list included Dr. Ken Caldeira, who is extremely well known for his years of work in environmental science and energy. The authors analyzed 36 years of hourly weather data (1980–2015) in the US. They calculated the available wind and solar power over this time period and also included the electrical demand in the US and its variation throughout the year. With this information, the researchers considered two scenarios. In scenario 1, they imagined wind and solar installations that would be sufficient to supply 100% of the US electrical needs. In the second scenario, the installations would be over-designed; capable of providing 150% of the total U.S. electrical need. But the authors recognize that just because a solar panel or a wind turbine can provide all our energy, it doesn’t mean that will happen in reality. It goes back to the prior discussion that sometimes the wind just doesn’t blow, and sometimes the sun isn’t shining. With these two scenarios, the authors then considered different mixes of power, from all solar to all wind. They also included the effect of aggregation area, that is, what sized regions are used to generate power. Is your power coming from wind and solar in your neighborhood, your city, your state or your region? The authors found that with 100% power capacity and no mechanism to store energy, a wind-heavy portfolio is best (about 75% wind, 25% solar) and using large aggregate regions is optimal. It is possible to supply about 75-80% of US electrical needs. If the system were designed with excess capacity (the 150% case), the US could meet about 90% of its needs with wind and solar power. The authors recognized that sometimes these systems generate too much power to be used. Under this situation, you could store the energy for later use. Imagine a solar panel generating excess energy during the day and able to store that power for night use. Power can be stored in several ways, for example in batteries or by pumping water into elevated tanks and then letting the water fall at night and turn a turbine. The authors modified their study to allow up to 12 hours of US energy storage. They then found that the 100% capacity system fared even better (about 90% of the country’s energy) and the optimal balance was now more solar (approximately 70% solar and 30% wind). For the over-capacity system, the authors found that virtually all the country’s power needs could be met with wind, solar, and storage. This study considered only wind and solar. If other sources, such as hydroelectricity, biofuels, or even nuclear power were added, it would be relatively straightforward to reach 100% clean energy. Furthermore, people are learning to use energy more wisely, either by using more efficient products or purchasing electricity during off-peak hours. These behavioral changes can also help us reach a 100% clean energy target. The point is, the use of clean energy to power an entire country (or a group of countries) is achievable. It’s no longer viable to say “we can’t.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/30/uk-electricity-use-falling-economy-weather","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T12:29:56Z","webTitle":"UK electricity use falls – as rest of EU rises","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/30/uk-electricity-use-falling-economy-weather","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/30/uk-electricity-use-falling-economy-weather","fields":{"headline":"UK electricity use falls – as rest of EU rises","bodyText":"The UK was the only country in the EU to reduce its electricity consumption last year, with power use growing or stable across the rest of the bloc’s 28 member states. Britain’s appetite for power has been waning for more than a decade as industrial activity declined and businesses and households opted for more energy efficient lighting and appliances. But an analysis of official figures by campaign group Sandbag found the fall between 2016 and 2017 was one of the biggest in several years, marking a striking divergence with the rest of Europe. The UK’s power consumption fell nearly 2% from 355 terawatt hours to 348 tWh, while it rose across the EU as a whole by 0.7% from 3,239 to 3,262 tWh. “The 2017 fall is large and is at odds with other European country, and puts the UK clearly on the road to lower electricity consumption,” said Dave Jones, the carbon and power analyst at Sandbag. Overall, electricity demand has fallen by 9% in the UK in the past seven years, the sharpest decline in the union. Meanwhile, Poland chalked up the biggest rise, at 9% over the same period. The EU increase is the third year in a row, and suggests the push for economic growth is winning out over energy efficiency measures. The rise was driven by GDP growth, a growing population swelled by the influx of immigrants and more industrial activity, Sandbag said. The group said a small amount of the growth had also come from new sources of demand, such as the electricity needed to run bitcoin-mining servers and the 800,000 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in the EU by the end of 2017. The growing disparity between the UK and EU has puzzled experts. The gap cannot be explained away solely by shrinking industrial production in Britain or slower economic growth in 2017, of 1.8% versus a forecast of 2.3% for the EU. Weather does not explain the difference either. Britain was relatively mild last year with the average temperature 0.7C above the long-term mean, said the Met Office, but Europe as a whole was 0.8C above the long-term average, said the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Jones said: “Reasons are hard to identify. It is likely other EU countries’ air-conditioning binge has been much stronger than that in the UK. Perhaps UK shops are better at stocking energy-efficient appliances or UK consumers are shopping for energy-efficient products.” Simon Evans, the policy editor at analysts CarbonBrief, said: “This is one of the least-reported and most significant stories in the UK power sector. Since 2005, the UK has saved the equivalent of two-and-a-half Hinkley Point Cs [a nuclear power station], a trend that started several years before the financial crisis.” Sandbag also found that for the first time across the EU, renewable sources of power, excluding hydro, overtook coal. Together, wind, solar and biomass accounted for 20.9% of the union’s electricity mix in 2017, up from 9.7% in 2010. “This is incredible progress, considering just five years ago, coal generation was more than twice that of wind, solar and biomass,” the report said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/mar/07/hinkley-point-c-what-you-need-to-know-nuclear-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-07T16:46:28Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C: what you need to know about the nuclear power project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/07/hinkley-point-c-what-you-need-to-know-nuclear-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/mar/07/hinkley-point-c-what-you-need-to-know-nuclear-power-station","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C: what you need to know about the nuclear power project","bodyText":"The resignation of Thomas Piquemal, the finance director of EDF, has increased concerns about the French energy company’s ability to build Hinkley Point C, the nuclear power station due to generate 7% of Britain’s electricity from 2025. Piquemal is said to have quit because he believes proceeding with the politically charged £18bn project before EDF raises funds from selling assets could bring the company’s overburdened finances to breaking point. What is Hinkley Point and why is it so important? The government has staked the UK’s energy future on the building of two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point. The twin reactors planned for the Somerset site would be the first new nuclear plant to be built in Britain for more than 20 years. EDF is meant to build it with financial backing from China. The plant is also a big part of the government’s effort to cut carbon emissions. The stakes are high as it is the first of a planned new generation of nuclear power stations to replace the country’s ageing fleet. EDF eventually plans to build four new nuclear power plants in the UK which it said could power 40% of British homes. Hinkley Point is also politically significant: the chancellor, George Osborne, has given the project strong backing despite growing doubts about its viability. If Hinkley C were to be derailed, it would cast major doubts over how the UK will meet its energy needs in the long term. The alternative is likely to be gas-fired power stations, which would hamper the UK’s efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. As well as keeping the lights on, nuclear power is meant to increase Britain’s energy security by reducing reliance on sources in unstable regions such as the Middle East. Why is the project so expensive? Hinkley Point is a giant undertaking. Its two 1.65GW European pressurised reactors (EPR) would be among the biggest in the world. Of the original £16bn estimated cost, £14bn was for construction with another £2bn covering items such as the acquisition of sites, regulatory approvals and training future employees. In October, EDF increased its cost estimate by £2bn blaming the increase on inflation. How much is it costing the taxpayer? The ultimate cost depends on how the government’s deal with EDF compares with alternative energy sources, but the signs are not good. To get the French and Chinese to take on the cost of building the plant, the government agreed to pay £92.50 for each unit of electricity: more than double the market price now. On top of that basic tariff agreement, the government has offered generous loan guarantees and faces further costs if the plant is closed or there were an accident. The government has argued that its nuclear programme will save UK households £74 a year in today’s prices by 2026-30. If EDF is getting such a good deal, why is it wavering over whether to sign a final agreement? Hinkley Point could indeed be a money spinner for EDF but only in the long run. Until 2025 – if that really is the completion date – it has to shoulder the cost of building the plant. Since agreeing to do so in 2012, the company’s costs and commitments have mounted, while energy prices have tumbled. It faces large cost overruns on another nuclear plant in France and must set aside an estimated €50bn (£38bn) to upgrade existing French reactors after safety concerns raised by the Fukushima accident in Japan. It also faces increased competition in the French domestic energy market and is under pressure from the French government to buy Areva, the struggling designer of EPRs. Areva is said to need a cash injection of some €7bn to keep going. Martin Young, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, argues that proceeding with Hinkley Point would be “verging on insanity” for EDF. “A 35-year agreement that, by the company’s own admission, should give it double-digit returns is arguably attractive, but you have to have the financial wherewithal to be able to make the investment,” he said. “Quite clearly, the balance sheet is under a degree of stress.” What is the recent record for newly built nuclear power plants? It is not good. EDF needs look no further than Flamanville, the EPR it is building in Normandy. The plant was meant to showcase the joint credentials of EDF and Areva to the world, but the project has turned into a nightmare, beset by delays, regulatory trouble and rising costs. Another EPR, Olkiluoto in Finland, was meant to open in 2009 but is 10 years behind schedule. EDF is also building two EPRs in China that were due to open in 2013 but have been delayed by concerns over safety. What are the alternatives? There are many proposals. Analysts at City broker Jefferies argued last year that for about the same price as Hinkley Point C the government could build almost 50GW of gas-fired capacity. Doing so would replace Britain’s thermal generation capacity with “brand new, highly efficient, low-carbon gas generation”, Jefferies argued. Electricity generated by onshore wind is already cheaper than the agreed rate for Hinkley Point. Alternative energy sources such as wind and solar are unlikely to provide the necessary capacity in time, but campaigners have warned that building a vast nuclear power plant could make the government complacent about developing those sources. Environmental campaigners who have accepted the argument for nuclear power have argued giant plants such as Hinkley are outmoded and unworkable and that instead the government should use small modular reactors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-chinese-firm-to-submit-essex-nuclear-plant-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-15T16:07:02Z","webTitle":"China plans central role in UK nuclear industry after Hinkley Point approval","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-chinese-firm-to-submit-essex-nuclear-plant-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-chinese-firm-to-submit-essex-nuclear-plant-plans","fields":{"headline":"China plans central role in UK nuclear industry after Hinkley Point approval","bodyText":"China is set for a central role in Britain’s nuclear industry after the government gave the go-ahead for a new power station at Hinkley Point. The Chinese company involved in the £18bn project plans to submit a design for a nuclear power station in Essex within weeks. China General Nuclear agreed to take a 33% stake in Hinkley Point C in Somerset, alongside the French energy group EDF, in return for leading the project at Bradwell, Essex. CGN said it was “delighted” that Theresa May’s government had approved the power station at Hinkley Point. Hinkley Point C will be the first nuclear power plant in Britain since 1995 and eventually provide 7% of the country’s electricity. However, it has been dogged by concerns about its cost and safety. The plant could eventually cost British taxpayers almost £30bn in subsidies to EDF and its Chinese backer. The government provoked uncertainty about the future of the nuclear industry after it delayed giving final approval for Hinkley Point C in July. May was said to have had concerns about Chinese involvement in such a sensitive project. However, it is understood that as part of the government approving Hinkley Point C it has assured CGN that its plans for Bradwell are still welcome. Sources close to the Chinese state-backed company said it intended to formally submit plans to the regulator to build its own nuclear reactor at Bradwell soon, potentially within weeks and almost certainly this autumn. CGN is understood to be confident about winning approval for its plans for Bradwell, although the review process for proposed power stations can take years. It is also ready to press ahead with proposals for another power station at Sizewell in Suffolk. If approved, the plants would give CGN a pivotal role in providing Britain with energy for the next generation. This is despite May insisting on a “revised agreement” for Hinkley Point C and the government pledging to take a special share in future nuclear projects to protect national security. CGN said: “We are delighted that the British government has decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation. We are now able to move forward and deliver much-needed nuclear capacity at Hinkley Point, Sizewell and Bradwell with our strategic partners, EDF, and provide the UK with safe, reliable and sustainable low-carbon energy. “CGN and EDF have worked together in close cooperation for decades and this has laid a solid foundation for these three new nuclear projects. CGN looks forward to leveraging its 30 years’ experience in nuclear construction and operation and playing an important role in meeting the UK’s future energy needs.” Jean-Bernard Lévy, chief executive of EDF, said the government’s decision “marks the relaunch of nuclear in Europe”. CGN’s role in Bradwell B and Sizewell C were agreed with EDF in return for investing in Hinkley Point C. While EDF owns two-thirds of Hinkley Point C and CGN owns a third, this is likely to be reversed for Bradwell. It is intended that EDF will have an 80% share in Sizewell, with CGN holding the rest. China’s investment in nuclear power stations has attracted a mixed response. Justin Bowden, GMB national secretary, said the funding of new power stations should be separated from the design. He said: “With Hinkley now confirmed, attention must rightly shift to the other new nuclear power stations – including Bradwell in Essex and Sizewell in Suffolk – which we badly need across the country. The solution, however, is not to hand over the replacement of vital UK infrastructure lock, stock and barrel to China. “GMB strongly cautions that the funding of nuclear developments should always be kept totally separate from the regulation of the design and construction of new nuclear facilities and the transport and safeguarding of nuclear and radioactive materials. Chinese pop-up power stations are not a solution on their own.” However, business leaders welcomed the investment in Britain’s infrastructure and the introduction of a special share to protect national security. The changes to the Hinkley Point C deal mean the government will be able to block EDF selling its controlling stake in the project and have more influence over future developments. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, said: “The government is right to grasp the nettle to remove the potential for uncertainty surrounding a future sale by seeking a ‘golden share’ in critical infrastructure projects. “This is a well-considered approach to balance foreign investment, which the UK needs, against an uncertain future. This is an important dynamic to consider, especially in the context of critical infrastructure projects where decisions on ownership could have direct implications for businesses being able to operate.” A so-called golden share in Hinkley Point C was first muted by the Liberal Democrats when they were in government. However, George Osborne, then the chancellor, is understood to have opposed it. EDF has previously signalled that it could reduce its stake in the project to 50% by bringing in other investors. CGN could also include fellow Chinese-stated backed energy company CNNC. However, Nick Timothy, May’s joint chief of staff, pointed out in an article for ConservativeHome last year that CNNC stated on its website that it was responsible not just for “increasing the value of state assets and developing the society” but the “building of national defence”. Timothy claimed security experts were worried the Chinese could build weaknesses into computer systems that would allow them to “shut down Britain’s energy production at will” and argued against giving a “hostile state” access to the UK’s critical infrastructure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/03/short-term-thinking-of-uk-nuclear-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-03T18:05:38Z","webTitle":"Short-term thinking of UK nuclear policy | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/03/short-term-thinking-of-uk-nuclear-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/03/short-term-thinking-of-uk-nuclear-policy","fields":{"headline":"Short-term thinking of UK nuclear policy","bodyText":"Justin McCurry (Fukushima looms large as Japan plans to restart world’s biggest nuclear plant, 28 December) quotes critics of the proposed reopening of the 8.2GW Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant in Japan, who say chaos would ensue if the plant failed and the 420,000 people who live within 20 miles of it had to be evacuated. But when the three Fukushima reactors failed on 11 March 2011, the radioactive plume spread over 40kms from the plant to the north-west, engulfing a large number of towns and villages. Everyone within 20kms of the plant was immediately evacuated. Iitate village, located 40kms away, and in the path of the toxic plume, was also evacuated. Many in the 20km zone may never return home but in the “return zone” villages they began to trickle back in early 2015. A 20-40km long radioactive plume issuing from the Hinkley nuclear facility could engulf both Cardiff (348,000 population) and Bristol (428,000 population), causing the evacuation of at least a million people from the region. The UK government is the only organisation brave enough to take on that level of catastrophic risk, with our money – happy to do so no doubt because the individuals who make the decisions on our behalf will be long retired when the cesium hits the fan. Emeritus Professor Sue Roaf Oxford • David Lowry’s fact-finding mission to 1958 (Letters, 28 December) is correct – at the dawn of the nuclear age, the UK’s civilian nuclear fuel cycle was seen as a precursor to weapons-grade material. However, for technical and other reasons, it was soon realised that the route to weapons-grade material was not through the civilian nuclear fuel cycle. In the current (and real) world, the peaceful use of civilian nuclear energy specifically, clearly and strictly breaks any such linkage. This is enshrined in IAEA and the Nuclear Suppliers Group protocols. An example of this today is the Korean peninsula, where one part has nuclear weapons, but no access to civilian nuclear power, while the other has civilian nuclear but no nuclear weapons. Indeed, South Korea has a fleet of 24 reactors producing some of cheapest and cleanest electricity in the world. It further boosts a highly successful reactor export technology and construction arm – one of the few democratic countries that hasn’t emaciated its civilian nuclear sector due to anti-nuclear fear-mongering. A further example is Iran, whose access to civilian nuclear (and rejection of weapons) is enshrined in its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, aka the “Iranian Nuclear deal”. Dr Lowry’s theory that cabinet strategy from the 1950s is driving current nuclear policy in the context of Hinkley Point C is entirely egregious and unfounded.

After weeks of speculation, and despite a hastily called review by Theresa May, the government has given a green light to the most expensive white elephant of a project in British history. The nuclear power station proposed at Hinkley Point is no ordinary piece of infrastructure. Indeed, according to Greenpeace it will be the most costly object ever built on Earth. A large chunk of the funds for the construction will come from China as part of a deal that will see it lead on the development of another reactor in Bradwell, Essex. EDF, an energy company owned by the French state, will stump up the rest of the construction costs. Just months after people in this country voted to “take back control”, ministers want to place a big chunk of our energy system in the hands of foreign governments. The amount of cash for this project that is set to be provided by UK taxpayers is eye-watering. The National Audit Office produced a detailed report in July on the viability of nuclear power in the UK, significantly revising its estimates of the “contract for difference” subsidies, up from £6.1bn to £29.7bn. Essentially, UK bill payers and businesses are underwriting the whole project through a promise of unjustifiably high payments for every unit of electricity produced. This is a terrible deal that has been slammed by economists and environmentalists alike for locking us into paying twice the current wholesale electricity price for 35 years. Though the case against Hinkley can easily be made on financial grounds alone, it’s not only wasted money that marks this project out as extremely risky. At the heart of the problems with nuclear energy is the stark fact that there is still no solution to the nuclear waste problem. Over its lifetime Hinkley will produce waste equivalent to 80% of all the waste so far produced in the UK in terms of radioactivity. Having such highly dangerous spent fuel on site for up to 200 years will be a massive challenge. Earlier this month a terrifying exposé by the BBC revealed the risks associated with handling nuclear waste, with allegations that years of neglect have led to the nuclear-processing facility at Sellafield being “riddled with safety flaws”. Added to the waste issue are serious concerns about the viability of the reactor planned for Hinkley. It’s known as the EPR, and has not yet been shown to work anywhere in the world. Indeed every project in Europe and China using this kind of technology is facing huge cost overruns and delays. Vincent de Rivaz, EDF’s chief executive, had promised that Hinkley would be cooking Christmas turkeys in 2017, when even under best-case scenarios the project will have barely even been started by then. In fact, Hinkley is unlikely to provide power until the late 2020s – far too late if we’re serious about weaning ourselves off fossil fuels with the haste that’s needed. Perhaps the most absurd aspect of this project is that fact that it’s being waved through while cheaper and cleaner alternatives are being blocked. According to the National Grid’s energy scenarios, by 2020 small-scale distributed generation will represent a third of total capacity in the UK. But the government is now actively undermining progress. Beneath a layer of green spin, ministers are demolishing the UK’s renewable-energy and energy-saving policies. Last week it was revealed that only 10 new community energy organisations have been registered so far this year, compared with 76 last year. The evidence for alternatives is clear: smart meters, home and grid-scale batteries that store and release excess renewable power, and other modern solutions would be cheaper and more efficient than building new power stations to meet extra demand during relatively short periods. The cost of wind and solar has dropped significantly, and we know that a nationwide scheme of home insulation would hugely reduce demand, keep people warm in their homes and provide jobs in every constituency for a fraction of the price of Hinkley. With the evidence against Hinkley so overwhelming, it has been puzzling to see Labour swing behind the project. Indeed, just a week after Jeremy Corbyn launched a genuinely decent plan to decentralise energy production in Britain, it is baffling that his party now backs this monstrously expensive, centralised project that is going to be part-owned by the Chinese state. Ultimately the government, and opposition parties, need to decide what kind of Britain they want to build. Do we keep ploughing billions into mammoth infrastructure projects such as Hinkley, or do we refocus resources and build up an energy democracy from the bottom up? Make no mistake, nuclear power will suck resources away from building the energy infrastructure we need, and threaten our climate change targets because of the snail’s pace at which it will be built. Politics is all about choices. I’m urging ministers to choose a future where power is in the hands of the many, not the few – and where Britain puts to use its most abundant resources: the sun, sea and wind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-guide-uk-first-new-nuclear-plant-for-20-years","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-15T10:46:45Z","webTitle":"Your guide to Hinkley Point C – the UK's first new nuclear plant for 20 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-guide-uk-first-new-nuclear-plant-for-20-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/sep/15/hinkley-point-c-guide-uk-first-new-nuclear-plant-for-20-years","fields":{"headline":"Your guide to Hinkley Point C – the UK's first new nuclear plant for 20 years","bodyText":"What is it? Hinkley Point C will be the UK’s first new nuclear power station in two decades, after finally getting the green light from Theresa May on Thursday. The plant is expected to cost £18bn to build, most of which will be financed by the French utility company EDF. Chinese investment, via the CGN group, will cover one-third of the £18bn cost. The Hinkley deal also involves the Chinese taking a stake in a new project at Sizewell and an agreement to build their own power plant at Bradwell in Essex. Hinkley Point C will be built next to the two existing facilities, A and B, and will be the biggest construction site in Europe. Hinkley A was decommissioned in 2000, and Hinkley B is due to be decommissioned in 2023. Once complete, Hinkley C will deliver 7% of the UK’s electricity, when most other nuclear power stations will have closed down. The construction is expected to provide 25,000 jobs, while the finished power plant will employ 900 people. Why has construction been delayed? The government unexpectedly postponed a final decision on the project in July. The official reason given by Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, was that the government needed to “consider carefully all the component parts of this project and make its decision in the early autumn.” But it was thought that doubts about the reliability of the plant’s future financing as well as fears about Chinese involvement in the future of UK energy made ministers put on the brakes. The delay goes back much further than July though. In 2007, Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF’s UK arm, predicted Britons would be using electricity from Hinkley to cook their Christmas turkeys in 2017. Why is Hinkley Point C so controversial? Critics say that Hinkley C is too expensive, will take too long to build, is a bad deal for UK consumers, is potentially risky and leaves the UK too reliant on foreign powers for its energy. And some argue that UK energy policy should be focused on renewables, which are dropping in price. Let’s break these issues down: Chinese involvement Many suspect that the prime minister is not comfortable about Chinese involvement in the scheme. The former business secretary Vince Cable said that when she was home secretary May had raised national security concerns about the Hinkley Point deal in cabinet. She was “unhappy about the rather gung-ho approach to Chinese investment that we had, and that [then chancellor] George Osborne in particular was promoting and, as I recall, raised objections to Hinkley at that time,” Cable said. In October last year – on the eve of the Chinese president’s state visit to the UK – the prime minister’s joint chief of staff Nick Timothy wrote: “Security experts – reportedly inside as well as outside government – are worried that the Chinese could use their role to build weaknesses into computer systems which will allow them to shut down Britain’s energy production at will … MI5 believes that ‘the intelligence services of … China … continue to work against UK interests at home and abroad’.” Financing Critics argue that with the cost of borrowing so low following the vote for Brexit, the government should build its own new nuclear power stations. There are also doubts about the financial reliability of the French firm EDF, which is 80% owned by the French state. EDF’s market value has halved in the last two years and is now valued at only €22bn (£18.7bn), not significantly more than Hinkley C’s entire investment. EDF also needs to invest €50bn over the next ten years to upgrade existing French reactors, and the French government wants to end some state guarantees for EDF’s revenues. EDF’s finance director, Thomas Piquemal, resigned in March, reportedly because he believed proceeding with the project could jeopardise the company. Cost to consumers Much has also been said about Hinkley C’s “nuclear strike price” - the price the government has guaranteed EDF per unit of electricity produced. To secure French and Chinese investment, the last coalition government agreed in 2013 to pay £92.5 per megawatt hour (Mwh) of electricity – rising in line with inflation– for the first 35 years of the plant’s life. Critics say this now looks like a bad deal following the collapse in the wholesale price of energy in the last three years. Currently, £92.50 per Mwh is more than twice the cost of wholesale electricity. These guarantees could end up costing UK consumers up to £30bn, according to the National Audit Office – five times the original 2013 estimate. Technology Questions have been raised about the technology that will be used. The planned European pressurised reactor (EPR) for Hinkley C is a relatively new design, and its reliability is not yet proven. There have been problems at other EPR construction sites. In Olkiluoto in Finland, an EPR was due to come on stream in 2009 and is €2.6bn over budget. In Flamanville in northern France construction is also over budget and six years late. A serious flaw in the steel housing the reactor core at Flamanville was discovered in July last year. The UK government wants Hinkley to be fully functional by 2025 – the same year it wants to phase out “unabated coal” power. Alternatives Critics of Hinkley C argue that the government should not be investing in nuclear power, but instead pushing resources to wind, wave and other renewable power sources that would be cheaper and better for the environment. As few as four large offshore wind farms could match the 3.2Gw of power expected from Hinkley Point C. As wind is intermittent, gas could provide backup on windless days. Wind subsidies are guaranteed for 15 years at £120 per Mwh – more expensive than Hinkley – but costs are expected to fall as the industry matures. The cost of offshore wind projects fell 11% between 2010 and 2014. Proponents argue solar power is now cheaper than Hinkley, having fallen by half in the last five years.

With Thursday’s decision to approve the £18bn project - in which China will have a one-third share - May has given that special relationship a stay of execution. “I feel very happy about it,” said Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Shanghai’s Fudan University, reflecting Beijing’s glee. But May’s decision to give Hinkley the green light is far from a resounding endorsement of the UK-China relationship that was negotiated under her predecessor. When George Osborne – the golden era’s chief British architect – jetted out to China exactly one year ago he declared himself on a mission to become Beijing’s best friend in the west. May has been far more cautious in her language since taking power, and her influential chief of staff, Nick Timothy, is known to harbour doubts about Osborne’s attempts to woo China’s authoritarian rulers. “What are the Chinese buying with their gold?” Timothy wondered last October, questioning the wisdom of allowing a “hostile state” to become involved in sensitive sectors such as energy and communications. Hinkley’s approval does little to suggest those concerns have been buried. Nor will it entirely convince Beijing of London’s continued commitment to the golden friendship. For China, the key will be whether Downing Street allows it to follow up its involvement in Hinkley by helping build a second nuclear plant in Sizewell, Suffolk, and – more importantly – its own Chinese-designed plant in Bradwell, Essex. The latter project would allow Beijing to show off its nuclear prowess to the rest of the world and is considered the real prize for China’s communist leaders. The state-owned China General Nuclear Power said it was “delighted that the British government has decided to proceed. We are now able to move forward and deliver much-needed nuclear capacity at Hinkley Point, Sizewell and Bradwell”. Yet the 724-word UK government statement announcing Hinkley’s approval made no mention of Bradwell, or even of China. Rather, it said “significant new safeguards” would be introduced for future foreign investment in critical infrastructure. Steve Tsang, an expert in China politics at the University of Nottingham, said Beijing would now be “looking very hard” at the implications of these new conditions, “not so much about Hinkley but about Bradwell, which is the real deal for China.” The nature of those conditions would determine whether the UK-China romance continued to blossom or was consigned to the scrap heap, he predicted. “A negative decision on Bradwell will mean the ‘golden era’ will not last.” Additional reporting by Christy Yao in Beijing"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/feb/22/british-gas-cuts-4000-jobs-blaming-price-cap-and-tough-competition","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-22T09:32:23Z","webTitle":"British Gas owner to cut 4,000 jobs blaming price cap and competition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/22/british-gas-cuts-4000-jobs-blaming-price-cap-and-tough-competition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/feb/22/british-gas-cuts-4000-jobs-blaming-price-cap-and-tough-competition","fields":{"headline":"British Gas owner to cut 4,000 jobs blaming price cap and competition","bodyText":"Centrica, the owner of British Gas, will shed a further 4,000 jobs by 2020 as part of a cost-cutting programme, which it blamed on the government’s energy price cap and fierce competition in the market. Britain’s largest energy company reported on Thursday a fall of 17% in operating profit to £1.25bn in 2017, owing to poor performance in its business energy supply and North America divisions. Iain Conn, the Centrica chief executive, said: “The only thing I regret is we are going to see 4,000 more colleagues leaving Centrica and it’s partly due to this price cap and competitive pressures.” The majority of the 4,000 jobs lost will be in the UK, where 30,000 of its 35,000-person global workforce are based. The first thousand will go this year through natural attrition and compulsory redundancies. The new cuts of 4,000 staff are on top of an existing plan to reduce headcount by 5,500 by 2020, which will be partly offset by the creation of 2,000 jobs, so total losses are set to be 7,500. Conn refused to rule out additional job losses under the cost-cutting plan, which has deepened from £750m to £1.25bn a year. Matt Lay, the national energy officer at the union Unison, said: “Although Centrica has already shed thousands of jobs, it’s nowhere near out of the woods, and there’s much more misery to come. “British Gas staff shouldn’t be feeling the heat today. It should be Iain Conn.” GMB, the union for gas workers, said the job cuts were an inevitable part of a “failing plan” implemented by Conn. National officer Stuart Fegan said: “Iain Conn must immediately learn from the failure of other, now departed, battlefield generals that you cannot cut your way out of a crisis – GMB will fight these unnecessary job cuts.”British Gas lost about 750,000 customers, 10% of its total, over the year. However, Conn argued that the company was resilient and more than half of the accounts were loss-making, so the impact was limited. British Gas made a profit margin per customer of 5.5%, or £59 out of a typical £1,101 dual fuel bill. The government’s price cap is expected by the end of the year and will limit the bills of millions of British Gas customers on standard variable tariffs. Conn admitted this would dent profit margins. The company also faces a new rival in the form of a merged npower and SSE, as well as new entrants with financial muscle such as Shell, which bought First Utility last year. Despite these threats, Conn said he was confident things would get better, citing the company’s strategy, cashflow and balance sheet. “I don’t agree the worst is yet to come, I believe the best is yet to come,” he said. The company had warned last November of a weak performance in the second half of 2017, which was laid bare in the results announced on Thursday. Operating profit at the unit that supplies energy to businesses was down 67% to £161m. Its consumer energy supply arm dropped 1% to £890m, despite a price cap on 4 million vulnerable households and warmer weather. Conn said he was considering management changes at Centrica’s North American division. He said he deeply regretted the overall impact on shareholders, who saw the share price fall more than 40% last year. The company also announced that by 2020, it would sell its 20% stake in EDF Energy Nuclear Generation, which owns Britain’s existing eight nuclear power stations. “We are not a natural owner and it’s a minority stake with limited control,” said Conn, adding that buyers might include infrastructure funds. The company’s share price rose 4.46% to 138.10p, which was seen as a result of Centrica pledging to keep shareholder dividends steady. Analysts at Hargreaves Lansdown said cost-cutting would help, but overall, political pressure and rising competition meant the company faced “more headwinds than tailwinds”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/sep/11/huge-boost-renewable-power-offshore-windfarm-costs-fall-record-low","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-11T18:02:57Z","webTitle":"Nuclear plans 'should be rethought after fall in offshore windfarm costs'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/11/huge-boost-renewable-power-offshore-windfarm-costs-fall-record-low","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/sep/11/huge-boost-renewable-power-offshore-windfarm-costs-fall-record-low","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear plans 'should be rethought after fall in offshore windfarm costs'","bodyText":"The government is under pressure to reconsider its commitment to a new generation of nuclear power stations after the cost of offshore wind power reached a record low. Experts said green energy had reached a tipping point in the UK after two windfarms secured a state-backed price for their output that was nearly half the level awarded last year to Britain’s first new nuclear power site in a generation, Hinkley Point C. Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the breakthrough should prompt a rethink of the government’s energy plans, which have pencilled in atomic plants at Wylffa in Wales, Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex. “The spectacular drop in the cost of offshore wind is extremely encouraging and shows the need for a radical reappraisal by government of the UK’s energy provision,” he said. The government spending watchdog this year described Hinkley as a “risky and expensive” project that generations of British consumers will have to pay for through electricity bills. Experts hailed Monday’s auction results, for a group of windfarms that will open early in the next decade, as evidence that large scale renewable projects had come of age in Britain. “The epoch of renewables as the most cost competitive technology has arrived,” said energy analysts Cornwall Insight, while the Economist Intelligence Unit said they showed “the trajectory of cheaper renewable technologies is irreversible”. Ministers said the multimillion-pound pot of subsidies would generate clean power for 3.6m homes. Two windfarms – the Hornsea 2 project off the Yorkshire coast and the Moray offshore windfarm in Scotland – secured a guaranteed price for their power of £57.50 per megawatt hour (MWh) from the government. This is far below the £92.50 awarded to Hinkley last year. Richard Harrington, the energy minister, said: “The offshore wind sector alone will invest £17.5bn in the UK up to 2021 and thousands of new jobs in British businesses will be created by the projects announced today.” Although Hinkley’s operator, French state-owned EDF, has signed a contract to build the £20.3bn plant in conjunction with China’s government-owned nuclear firm, campaigners said Monday’s news called into question the rationale for the site in Somerset. Caroline Lucas, the Green party’s co-leader, said: “This massive price drop for offshore wind is a huge boost for the renewables industry and should be the nail in the coffin for new nuclear.” Green Alliance, a politically centre-ground thinktank, said the nuclear industry had to cut its costs or face the fate of carbon capture and storage (CCS) for fossil fuel plants, a technology that ministers previously supported but ditched in 2015. “The challenge for nuclear is they now need to drop their costs or risk being in the same situation as CCS,” said Dustin Benton, the group’s executive director. The auction results are unlikely to halt the Hinkley project. But they pose a serious dilemma for EDF, its Chinese partner and other consortiums hoping to build other new nuclear power plants around the UK and are likely to feed into a flagship government review of energy costs out next month. Most industry watchers had expected future nuclear projects to cost £80-£90 per MWh, a long way from the £62.14 average awarded to offshore windfarms. Unlike Hinkley, where the price was agreed in negotations between EDF and government officials, the offshore windfarms’ backers used an auction-style process to offer the lowest guaranteed price for their electricity. The government offers to underwrite a “strike price” which is a top-up payment above the daily market price for electricity, which is around £40 per MWh. The lower the strike price, the more electricity generating capacity can be built. The government had allocated £240m a year for the subsidies but the competitive prices mean it now expects them to hit £176m a year at most. The winning developers were Germany’s Innogy, which will receive £74.75 per MWh for Triton Knoll, off the coast of Lincolnshire, Denmark’s Dong Energy at £57.50 for its Hornsea project and Spain’s EDP with £57.50 for the Moray windfarm. The higher price for Triton Knoll reflects the fact it will be delivered slightly earlier, in 2021-22; the other two will come online in 2022-23. In total, they will have a generating capacity of 3.2GW, the same as Hinkley Point C, though they should be operational at least two years before the pair of new reactors. Matthew Wright, the managing director for Dong Energy UK, said: “This is a breakthrough moment for offshore wind in the UK and a massive step forward for the industry.” The industry body, RenewableUK, called the prices astounding. Industry and campaigners used the auction results to pile pressure on the government to commit to a timetable for the further £440m-a-year of subsidies that officials have allocated but which ministers have not confirmed since the general election in June. Keith Anderson, the chief corporate officer of Scottish Power, said: “The government should be pleased the industry has delivered and, with a healthy pipeline of projects ready to go, they should press on quickly with further auction rounds.” Energy UK, which represents the UK’s big energy companies, also urged the government to provide certainty on timing for future auctions. “Today’s exceptionally low results are further evidence of how the cost of clean energy is continuing to fall, and the move to a low carbon future is delivered at the lowest cost to consumers,” said Lawrence Slade, the group’s chief executive. The price of building offshore windfarms has fallen by nearly a third since 2012 as the technology matured. Developers believe that a new generation of even bigger turbines mean they can achieve further cost reductions. The sector is perceived by investors to be much less risky than it was five years ago, bringing down the cost of capital. In Germany, some new offshore windfarms have even secured contracts in auctions that are effectively subsidy-free. “Offshore wind’s success was undoubtedly buoyed by the decreasing costs of capital in the sector and the wider downward trend of subsidy levels witnessed in other European tender processes,” said Robert Marsh of law firm Norton Rose Fulbright."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/oct/11/fukushima-evacuee-un-japan-human-rights","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-11T10:27:04Z","webTitle":"Fukushima evacuee to tell UN that Japan violated human rights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/11/fukushima-evacuee-un-japan-human-rights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/oct/11/fukushima-evacuee-un-japan-human-rights","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima evacuee to tell UN that Japan violated human rights","bodyText":"A nuclear evacuee from Fukushima will claim Japan’s government has violated the human rights of people who fled their homes after the 2011 nuclear disaster, in testimony before the UN in Geneva this week. Mitsuko Sonoda, who voluntarily left her village with her husband and their 10-year-old son days after three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant went into meltdown, will tell the UN human rights council that evacuees face financial hardship and are being forced to return to neighbourhoods they believe are still unsafe almost seven years after the disaster. “We feel abandoned by the Japanese government and society,” Sonoda, who will speak at the council’s pre-session review of Japan on Thursday, told the Guardian. An estimated 27,000 evacuees who, like Sonoda, were living outside the mandatory evacuation zone when the meltdown occurred, had their housing assistance withdrawn this March, forcing some to consider returning to their former homes despite concerns over radiation levels. In addition, as the government attempts to rebuild the Fukushima region by reopening decontaminated neighbourhoods that were once no-go areas, tens of thousands of evacuees who were ordered to leave will lose compensation payments and housing assistance in March next year. The denial of financial aid has left many evacuees facing a near-impossible choice: move back to homes they fear are unsafe, or face more financial hardship as they struggle to build lives elsewhere without state help. “People should be allowed to choose whether or not to go back to their old homes, and be given the financial means to make that choice,” said Kendra Ulrich, senior global energy campaigner for Greenpeace Japan. “If they are being put under economic pressure to return, then they are not in a position to make an informed decision. This UN session is about pressuring the Japanese government to do the right thing.” Evacuees are being encouraged to return to villages and towns near the Fukushima plant despite evidence that some still contain radiation “hot spots”. In Iitate village, where the evacuation order was lifted this March, much of the surrounding forests remain highly radioactive, although homes, schools and other public buildings have been declared safe as part of an unprecedented decontamination effort. “You could call places like Iitate an open-air prison,” said Ulrich. “The impact on people’s quality of life will be severe if they move back. Their lives are embedded in forests, yet the environment means they will not be allowed to enter them. Forests are impossible to decontaminate.” After months of moving around, Sonoda and her family settled in Kyoto for two years, where local authorities provided them with a rent-free apartment. They have been living in her husband’s native England for the past four years. “We’ve effectively had to evacuate twice,” said Sonoda, who works as a freelance translator and Japanese calligraphy tutor. “My son and I really struggled at first … we didn’t want to leave Japan.” Concern over food safety and internal radiation exposure convinced her that she could never return to Fukushima, aside from making short visits to see relatives. “It’s really sad, because my village is such a beautiful place,” she said. “We had a house and had planned to retire there.” The evacuations have forced families to live apart, while parents struggle to earn enough money to fund their new accommodation and keep up mortgage payments on their abandoned homes. “Stopping housing support earlier this year was an act of cruelty,” Sonoda said. “Some of my friends had to go back to Fukushima even though they didn’t want to.” Greenpeace Japan, which is assisting Sonoda, hopes her testimony will be the first step in building international pressure on Japan’s government to continue offering financial help to evacuees and to reconsider its resettlement plan. It has called on the government to declare Fukushima neighbourhoods unsafe until atmospheric radiation is brought to below one millisievert (mSv) a year, the maximum public exposure limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. While 1 mSv a year remains the government’s long-term target, it is encouraging people to return to areas where radiation levels are below 20 mSv a year, an annual exposure limit that, internationally, applies to nuclear power plant workers. “Why should people, especially women and children, have to live in places where the radiation level is 20 times the international limit?” Sonoda said. “The government hasn’t given us an answer.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/mar/12/the-guardian-view-on-nuclear-fusion-a-moment-of-truth","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-12T18:24:26Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on nuclear fusion: a moment of truth | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/12/the-guardian-view-on-nuclear-fusion-a-moment-of-truth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/12/the-guardian-view-on-nuclear-fusion-a-moment-of-truth","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on nuclear fusion: a moment of truth","bodyText":"One of the cliches of nuclear power research is that a commercial fusion reactor is only ever a few decades away – and always will be. So claims that the technology is on the “brink of being realised” by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a private company should be viewed sceptically. The MIT-led team say they have the “science, speed and scale” for a viable fusion reactor and believe it could be up and running within 15 years, just in time to combat climate change. The MIT scientists are all serious people and perhaps they are within spitting distance of one of science’s holy grails. But no one should hold their breath. Fusion technology promises an inexhaustible supply of clean, safe power. If it all sounds too good to be true, that’s because it is. For decades scientists struggled to recreate a working sun in their laboratories – little surprise perhaps as they were attempting to fuse atomic nuclei in a superheated soup. Commercial fusion remains a dream. Yet in recent years the impossible became merely improbable and then, it felt almost overnight, technically feasible. For the last decade there has been a flurry of interest –and not a little incredulity –about claims, often made by companies backed by billionaires and run by bold physicists, that market-ready fusion reactors were just around the corner. There are reasons to want to believe that fusion will one day be powering our lives. The main fuel is a heavy isotope of hydrogen called deuterium which can be extracted from water and therefore is in limitless supply – unlike the uranium used in nuclear fission reactors. But fusion’s science is tricky and the breakthroughs rare. So far there has been no nuclear fusion reaction that has been triggered, continued and self-sustained. Neither has the plasma soup that exists at temperatures found in the stars been magnetically contained. Nor has any research group sparked a fusion reaction that has released more energy than it consumed, one of the main attractions of the technology. Perhaps the most successful fusion reactor has been the JET experiment, so far Europe’s largest fusion device, which ended up in the UK after the SAS stormed a hijacked German airliner in 1977 and Bonn backed the then prime minister Jim Callaghan’s request to host it. JET hasn’t even managed to break even, energy-wise. Its best ever result, in 1997, remains the gold standard for fusion power – but it achieved just 16 MW of output for 25 MW of input. Hopes for fusion now rest with the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (Iter), a multi-national $20bn effort in France to show that the science can be made to work. Within a decade Iter aims to control a hydrogen bomb-sized atomic reaction for a few minutes. It is a vast undertaking. At its heart is a doughnut-shaped device known as a tokamak that weighs as much as three Eiffel towers. Iter’s size raises a question of how large a “carbon footprint” the site will leave. Like JET, Iter uses a fusion fuel which is a 50-50 mixture of deuterium and a rare hydrogen isotope known as tritium. To make Iter self-sustaining it will have to prove that tritium can be “bred”, a not inconsiderable feat. Iter will also test how “clean” a technology fusion really is. About 80% of a fusion reaction’s energy is released as subatomic particles known as neutrons, which will smash into the exposed reactor components and leave tonnes of radioactive waste. Just how much will be crucial in assessing whether fusion is a dirty process or not. Iter’s worth is that it is a facility in the real world, where fusion’s promise can be tested. If it turns out to be better than expected then private investment is going to be needed to commercialise a fusion reactor. If it falls short then there must be a realistic rethink of fusion’s potential. After all, the money that has been poured into it could have been spent on cheap solar technology which would allow humanity to be powered by a fusion reactor that’s 150m kilometres away, called the sun."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/nov/13/npower-german-parent-company-innogy-427m-pound-headache","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-13T10:13:14Z","webTitle":"Npower hands German parent company a £427m headache","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/13/npower-german-parent-company-innogy-427m-pound-headache","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/nov/13/npower-german-parent-company-innogy-427m-pound-headache","fields":{"headline":"Npower hands German parent company a £427m headache","bodyText":"Npower has inflicted a €480m (£427m) writedown on its German parent company, Innogy, which it blamed on the worsening UK energy market and Prime Minister Theresa May’s price cap. Innogy said the planned merger of npower and the UK’s second biggest energy supplier, SSE, had not affected its assessment of the reduction in the value of the business. The German energy giant reported earnings before interest and tax up 9% to €2bn for the first nine months of 2017, but the results showed what a burden its UK retail business has become. Npower lost customers and earnings declined, leading Innogy to conclude: “The competitive landscape in the UK retail business remains very tough and pressure on margins is very high.” The company acknowledged the growing political heat, with the Conservatives, Labour and SNP all calling for some form of energy price cap. “The difficult market conditions and political pressure have intensified over the course of the year,” Innogy said. The company warned it would cut costs further in the face of stiff competition from smaller challenger firms and May’s price cap, which is likely to start in early 2019. “Overall, in the retail division, Innogy intends to counter this [regulation and competition] with additional efficiency measures and therefore currently maintains its outlook,” it said. It did not specify whether those measures would involve job losses, although industry figures have said the price cap risked having that effect. Bernhard Gunther, Innogy’s chief financial officer, said: “We are making good progress, also in the UK. Despite the difficult situation on the UK market, npower is a strong part of the planned combined retail company with SSE.” Innogy was one of the firms to recently secure a record low price from the UK government for power from an offshore windfarm to be built in the early 2020s. Separately, France’s EDF Energy revised down its earnings target for 2018 from at least €15.2bn to €14.6-15.3bn.

It is here that the second of two nuclear reactors will switch on in the middle of the next decade if all goes according to EDF Energy’s plan for Hinkley Point C, proving that Britain can still build new nuclear power stations and, more importantly, providing 7% of the country’s electricity. Only nine months ago the entire £18bn Hinkley project was at risk, after Theresa May ordered a review into China’s involvement. But since the French state-owned firm and UK government signed a generous 35-year subsidy deal in September, construction has started in earnest. The new reactors are being built adjacent to the existing Hinkley Point A and B nuclear power stations, on what was until recently green fields bordering the Bristol channel. Today it looks more like Mordor, from Lord of the Rings, a scarred landscape and hive of activity driven with a single purpose: ensuring these reactors do not repeat the delays and overspends on the other two European projects using EDF’s Hinkley reactor design, at Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland. “I think this is by far the most complex thing the country has tried to do,” said Nigel Cann, programme and construction delivery director at EDF, as he surveyed the near 500-acre (2 sq km) site. But he is adamant that they will avoid the problems encountered in Finland and France. “We’ve got the contractor in very early, that’s a lesson we’ve learned from Flamanville,” he said. Compared to Olkiluoto, where engineers had problems pumping concrete which was too thick, Cann said Hinkley has “stolen a march” by getting the process lined up much earlier. The other weapon in his arsenal is 4D modelling – 3D modelling over time – which was not available when construction began in Finland in 2005. Such technology is vital because so much is being crammed into a relatively small space.The sprawling site will be crowded with 52 tower cranes when construction is its peak, up from two now. The site already has the first of three huge concrete batching plants, where concrete mixing lorries queue. A seawall is being built along the coast, next to the steel pilings that will form a 500m temporary jetty to bring in construction materials such as sand and gravel. Vast piles of earth and rock abound – 3m cubic metres of an eventual 6m has already been excavated, most of it heading to a valley next door. The first concrete has begun to be poured for the arteries underneath the power station, carrying cables for power, pipes for water and more. Building almost a mile of these underground galleries is Cann’s “big ticket” goal for the end of the year, with five miles to be finished in total. But Hinkley Point C is big in other ways. It involves so many people that much of the current construction is to provide facilities to accommodate and feed them. Around 1,800 are working on the project now, rising to a predicted peak of 5,600. A 1,500-bed temporary hotel is being built to house workers in a £50m contract with a Nottingham firm. New offices are being thrown up. An internal bus service ferries people around the site, while a 100-strong security force run by G4S patrols it. One of the more unusual jobs is harbourmaster, although most of the work here now involves steel, concrete and earthworks. “I just wanted to spread my wings a bit really, move out my mum’s house and come down here,” said Ben Lewis, a 23-year-old from North Yorkshire, who is working on steel to reinforce the concrete. “It’s been a bit of a turbulent time for Hinkley, so it’s good that it’s up and running.” Both Lewis and Garth Young, a 31-year-old steel fixer supervisor, bought their first homes in the nearby countryside when they first landed jobs here. The subsequent hiatus on the project last year came as “quite a shock”, Young said, and the pair took work in London before coming back. Many here on site are veterans of another mega construction project, London’s Crossrail, and – given Hinkley’s location – a good number are Welsh. Half of the workforce are locals, defined as people within a 90-minute travel radius. The next generation of workers destined for Hinkley are up the road at Bridgwater &amp; Taunton College, which is part-funded by EDF. Molly Burns-Lalic, 23, is the first of a cohort studying for a fee-free degree in quantity surveying and commercial management. “It’s a growing industry, isn’t it? We’re all fairly local, and it’s a big thing round here,” she said of nuclear power’s appeal. “I never went to uni, so this course gives me a degree without having to go to uni and have all the debt.” While the construction workers preparing the site now are paid about £45,000 on average, not all are happy. Unions raised the threat of delays amid a dispute over bonuses between unions and EDF’s main civil contractor, the French-British consortium Bylor. “EDF have kicked the can down the road long enough on this bonus issue on civil construction. They now need to negotiate,” said Phil Whitehurst, national officer for construction at GMB . Unions are consulting soon on whether to ballot for a strike. EDF said it is “committed to a continuing dialogue” and Cann expects an agreement to be reached within a fortnight. At the entrance to Hinkley Point C, an electronic clock marks the 720 days until “J0”, jour/day zero, the moment when the first reactor’s foundation is due to be poured. EDF executives will be watching the industrial dispute anxiously, hoping they don’t have to put back the date. Hinkley Point’s potential pitfalls Concrete EDF has already built dummy buildings on the Hinkley construction site using nuclear grade concrete, to ensure it gets it right when it comes to building the project’s “nuclear island” in two years’ time. But the experience in Finland, while not a project run by EDF, suggests this could still prove tricky. Brexit Any post-EU restrictions on freedom of movement could affect Hinkley and its highly specialised work, as the EDF chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz, alluded to recently. The UK’s decision to leave the Euratom nuclear cooperation treaty while exiting the EU could also throw a spanner in the works. New bilateral deals must be put in place to ensure nuclear materials can continue to arrive in the UK. Manufacturing EDF’s nuclear building partner, Areva, has come in for unusually strong criticism from the UK nuclear regulator over irregularities at a key forge in France that was set to make parts for Hinkley. However, De Rivaz has said the forge’s problems will have “no impact” on Hinkley. EDF also has the option of using another forge in Japan. Unions The Unite union has described the bonus rate on offer for workers as “derisory” and insufficient to attract and hold on to the quality of workers that Hinkley needs for the project to be delivered on time. It remains to be seen whether the row will escalate. Politics The unexpected election of a Labour government would likely have little impact – the party supports new nuclear power stations – but the French presidential election could. Marine Le Pen’s aides recently said that if she won, she would review the contract for Hinkley Point C and look for exit options, to allow EDF to concentrate on nuclear projects at home."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2019/aug/11/no-logo-naomi-klein-20-years-on-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2019-08-11T10:00:46Z","webTitle":"No Logo at 20: have we lost the battle against the total branding of our lives?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/11/no-logo-naomi-klein-20-years-on-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2019/aug/11/no-logo-naomi-klein-20-years-on-interview","fields":{"headline":"No Logo at 20: have we lost the battle against the total branding of our lives?","bodyText":"Some political books capture the zeitgeist with such precision that they seem to blur the lines between the page and the real world and become part of the urgent, rapidly unfolding changes they are describing. On 30 November 1999, mere days before the publication of Naomi Klein’s debut, No Logo, the epochal “Battle of Seattle” began. Tens of thousands turned out to protest against the World Trade Organisation, and the global corporate interests it represented, and were met with tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and stun grenades. Seattle’s mayor declared a state of emergency, and a massive “no protest zone”, as the violence continued, while the chief of police resigned. Reading No Logo back then in my first year at university was hugely formative; the book, mixing eye-opening reportage with sharp-tongued analysis of consumer capitalism, was a bible for understanding the world my generation was growing up in and the motor behind a new kind of grassroots politics. The battle lines were clear, as ordinary citizens around the world stood in opposition to corporate greed, sweatshops, union-busting, “McJobs”, privatisation and environmental destruction: and the avatar for them all, the increasingly unavoidable logos of western “superbrands”. No Logo was published on the cusp not just of a new millennium, but a new phase of globalisation, in which household names such as McDonald’s, Nike, Shell, Starbucks, Disney, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Microsoft could trample over workers’ rights, local laws and civic opposition in pursuit of ever bigger profits, as western outsourcing crashed against the shores of the developing world, leaving behind human misery and environmental ruin as the tide rolled out. The book charted the dramatic rise in the west of youth-oriented, cool-hungry consumer capitalism, in which companies sold an idealised lifestyle, not the physical product on the shelf. With the factories and production lines moved out of sight, and out of mind, the superbrands could focus their North American and European operations on ever more elaborate and intrusive marketing schemes and protecting their brand through censorship and legal action. In one infamous case, Disney sued a small-town creche for painting an unauthorised mural of their characters. Privatisation, Naomi Klein observed in No Logo, “slithers into every crevice of public life”. Caustically funny and polemical in places, Klein’s book won plaudits for her dogged research and reportage, from the candid and stomach-turning declarations of the brand gurus and snake-oil sellers to first-hand reporting from the sweatshops in the developing world’s semi-lawless “export processing zones”. It became a new truism, for those of us schooled in No Logo’s worldview, that corporations were becoming more powerful than governments. Where previous generations had focused on the oppressive strictures of militarism, racism, nuclear power or patriarchy, the superbrands now became synonymous with all that was wrong with the world. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, they roamed across the globe unhindered and their marketing-first mentality took over party politics too: New Labour, reflected a piece in ad-land bible Campaign marking the tenth anniversary of the 1997 general election, was “perhaps the most brand-savvy political project in British history”. No Logo had a global impact far beyond anything Naomi Klein – only 29 at the time and unknown outside her native Canada – had expected. It became a bestseller in the UK (among numerous other countries) and was translated into more than 30 languages, with more than a million copies in print worldwide. The instant success propelled her to fame and Klein’s subsequent books The Shock Doctrine, No Is Not Enough and This Changes Everything were all bestsellers (her newest, On Fire, making the case for a green New Deal, arrives in September). No Logo inspired numerous musicians and artists: Radiohead were so swayed by the book that they toured Europe in a tent to avoid corporate-sponsored venues and considered naming their 2000 album No Logo, before finally alighting on Kid A. The book did so well, in fact, that Klein’s publisher tried to persuade her that they should copyright the title and logo; others, seemingly oblivious to the irony, even proposed a No Logo clothing line. Incredulous, Klein declined. A backlash from the corporate world inevitably followed: most famously, the Economist published a cover feature riffing on Klein’s book jacket design, with the splash “Pro Logo: Why brands are good for you”. But the protests continued, as in Seattle usually organised around gatherings of the WTO, the World Bank, the IMF or the G8. In the press, these were often described as “anti-globalisation”, though the activists preferred “the global justice movement” – they weren’t against internationalism, they argued, they just wanted it done very differently. “No Logo hit at this moment when a global movement was exploding and taking mainstream commentators entirely by surprise,” says Klein on the phone from the west coast of Canada. “It felt a bit like a dam breaking – every month, there was another massive demonstration, across the world, not just in the global north.” She had real trouble finding a US publisher for the book, she recalls. They would tell her how much they loved the manuscript, but that there would be no interest in it: “The perception among media and cultural gatekeepers in the late 90s was that young people were completely apolitical.” What strikes me, rereading the book now, is not that Klein was wrong in her diagnosis, but that the changes she was documenting are so much worse than we could have ever predicted – from PepsiCo exploring the idea of broadcasting its logos into space to KFC buying festival DJ slots for Colonel Sanders. We have reached an audio-visual climax of total brand dominance, as if Piccadilly Circus or Times Square were simply laboratories for how our world would look in the 21st century. So what happened to the focused anti-corporate anger Klein describes in the book? In an age of synergistic “brand personalities” with “strong voices”, integrated social media strategies, trend forecasters and micro-influencers, have we given in to the total branding of every aspect of our lives and culture? The critical moment for the global justice movement, when it was perhaps still to reach its full potential, arrived with the 9/11 attacks in the US less than two years later and the wholesale change in the political conversation that quickly ensued. The west was swept up by George W Bush’s “you’re with us or against us” rhetoric, the “war on terror”, the rise of surveillance and the neoconservative adventures in Afghanistan and Iraq. The urgency of the anti-war movement absorbed western energies. As well as shifting activists’ focus away from the sportswear and fast food brands, the Bush-era crackdown drove a wedge between the more radical anti-capitalist activists on the one hand and the bigger NGOs and trade unions. “When governments started equating the global justice movement with terrorists, a lot of them got spooked,” Klein says. “What had been so exciting about these coalitions was they were so diverse: you had scruffy anarchists, big shiny mainstream NGOs and auto workers’ unions all alongside one another, doing really hard and sometimes fractious work to find common ground, but they did it. In South America, India and elsewhere, these movements continued, but the north left them behind.” While our minds were elsewhere, the superbrands ramped up their cannibalisation of every aspect of our cultural lives. Earlier this year, KFC bought a five-minute DJ slot for Colonel Sanders – or a man in a cartoonish Colonel Sanders outfit – at major American dance music festival Ultra. Logos hover everywhere we look, like spots in our peripheral vision. It is strikingly rare, in 2019, to encounter an unbranded, unsponsored cultural experience. Every festival, programme, public-awareness campaign and event has a series of “partners”, a cluster of familiar icons at the bottom of the poster. Every charity is led by its marketing team. Every TV programme is “brought to you by…” – a name other than its production company. This reaches even more flagrant extremes as the companies that were initially paying for product placement in films and TV programmes become original content-creators. Where once we might have seen Jerry Seinfeld ostentatiously drinking Pepsi and wearing Nike trainers in an episode of his sitcom, we now have Pepsi Max TV and Nike TV channels on YouTube, producing their own content: not just adverts, but short documentaries, featurettes, competitions and interviews, with viewcounts often in the millions. Corporate brands swamp our digital lives, resulting in the uncanny spectacle of their social media accounts bantering with one another on Twitter, sassily posting pop culture gifs and responding to breaking news events “in voice”. Many of them have also developed their pre-existing corporate social responsibility programmes into a performance of “wokeness”, to both generate headlines and head off some of our boredom and scepticism. Whether it’s Dove soap challenging body fascism in the beauty industry or Gillette attempting to tackle toxic masculinity in the name of selling razors, our woke pounds are there for the taking. On another level to its rivals in this regard is Nike, most recently harnessing a portentous mixture of feminist (“breaking every single glass ceiling”) and self-help rhetoric via Megan Rapinoe and the US women’s football team. When the company made headlines last autumn with its Dream Crazy advert that featured NFL star Colin Kaepernick, controversial for kneeling during the national anthem in protest at police racism and brutality, the reports underneath told their own story. First, the advert was widely reported as appearing in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Just Do It campaign, a landmark purely because it was three decades since a previous ad campaign. Second, Nike CEO, Mark Parker, responded to the controversy by telling Marketing Week he was proud of the ad: it was a success because it drove “record engagement”. Not sales – brand engagement. “We’re motivated to inspire our consumers to connect and engage,” Parker continued. Not buy trainers. Inevitably, some were unhappy that Kaepernick allowed his bold political protest to be co-opted by Nike. For Klein, that’s unfair. “It’s obviously complex, but I think the athletes deserve a lot of credit for pushing back against their usual gagging,” she says, comparing Kaepernick to Robbie Fowler’s 1997 “support the dockers” T-shirt (a gesture of solidarity with striking Liverpool dockers that earned him a fine) and Megan Rapinoe wearing a Nike football shirt with civil rights activist Audre Lorde’s name on the back. “From Nike’s point of view, these ventures are not ‘brave’, this is what they have always done – this is literally their brand. But it’s also not as simple as a corporate co-option, because in response to being told ‘shut up and play’, what these athletes have shown is that it’s really powerful when they don’t. “Kaepernick is an incredible activist and what he’s done is historic – and he’s also given away a huge amount of money to grassroots groups. That doesn’t let Nike off the hook, but I think just condemning Kaepernick for taking their money is ridiculous.” In the UK, this balancing act is reflected in Stormzy’s simultaneous role as high-profile Adidas brand ambassador and outspoken critic of the Conservative government, the Daily Mail and others. Plied with free Adidas merchandise since he was an underground grime MC, cut him and you suspect he would bleed three stripes. When Paul Pogba signed for Manchester United (who also wear Adidas) in 2016 for a record £100m, the deal was announced by a special Adidas-produced video featuring the two of them, soundtracked by Stormzy, a perfect piece of four-way brand synergy. But did this affiliation stop Stormzy putting in one of the most powerful and controversial political performances in living memory at the 2018 Brit awards, calling the political establishment “criminals” for their betrayal of the victims of the Grenfell fire? Of course not. “When musicians and athletes don’t accept the idea that because they have corporate sponsors, they have to keep quiet, it can take us to some interesting places,” Klein avers. There are two things driving the brands’ ongoing territorial expansion. The first is that consumer capitalism is boring and so constantly requires innovative, ever more ridiculous stunts to hold our increasingly fragmented attention. That’s why “experiential marketing” (PR stunts, in old money) is the ad-land buzzphrase. Senior marketeer Hilary Bradley told Campaign magazine last autumn that millennials in particular needed “memorable experiences” to help them “emotionally connect” to a product. The second is that consumer capitalism is insatiable – it is the same reason businesses are pushing for cities to function around the clock, to fit in more shopping and advertising time, trying to effectively “colonise the night”, an idea the American art critic Jonathan Crary explored in his 2013 book 24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep. In April, the news broke that PepsiCo was working with a Russian “space startup” to look into projecting its logos into the night skies via a series of satellites. Like all empires, consumer capitalism always requires new territory to conquer. And we are often unwilling subjects. Consumers, marketing executive David Lubars told Klein in No Logo, in a moment of perfect candour, “are like roaches – you spray them and spray them and they get immune after a while.” Since 1999, the spray has become considerably more potent and it’s getting everywhere. Not just trainers, razors and soft drinks, but places, spaces, charities, local councils, human beings: all of them need a brand identity, because all of them are pitching themselves in the global marketplace. As the public sphere becomes ever more emaciated by cuts, corporations step in. Brands are literally filling in holes in the road with their logos: in Louisville, Kentucky, KFC filled in a plague of potholes, stamping them with a stencil that read “Re-freshed by KFC”. They paid what is small change in advertising terms – $3,000 – to fix 350 potholes in the city, or buy 350 adverts. “Cities are struggling all over America and you do what you can,” Louisville’s mayor, Jerry Abramson, told NPR. “We’re fortunate to have such an outstanding corporate citizen in this community.” Occupying physical space beyond a billboard has always been appealing; when Adidas signed its “tier one” £40m London 2012 Olympic partnership deal, it cannily struck an agreement to plant inner-city sporting “AdiZones” (outdoor gyms), and thus its logos, in public spaces across the country, for up to 20 years. It was a nod to the idea of trickle-down athleticism made by the Games, leaving what are essentially semi-permanent, 3D billboards in public spaces, in return for a minuscule investment – and some free publicity to boot. This was just the latest iteration of a 1990s scene Klein describes in No Logo – Nike marketeers visiting inner-city basketball courts in mostly black neighbourhoods in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia, branding the courts with the company’s logo, and giving out trainers to the most stylish alpha males, in a pre-digital version of “influencer” culture. One vital trend that was just emerging when No Logo was published and is now a near-universal experience – for those entering the job market, at least – is that of self-branding: commodifying and selling yourself, carefully “curating” your “socials” and general online presence, in response to the frenetic demands of the gig economy (the number of self-employed young adults in the UK has almost doubled since 2001). “It was really only celebrities who could actually be their own brand, in 1999,” Klein says. “The idea that a high-school student could have a ‘personal brand’ would have seemed absurd. “The biggest change since No Logo came out is that neoliberalism has created so much precarity that the commodification of the self is now seen as the only route to any kind of economic security. Plus social media has given us the tools to market ourselves non-stop.” This worries Klein because it hinders solidarity: “Brands don’t cooperate very well – they’re built to be selfish and proprietary.” In her position as the Gloria Steinem chair at Rutgers University in New Jersey, Klein has been teaching a course to undergraduates called The Corporate Self, tracing the journey from the birth of branding, and her own No Logo, up to Shoshana Zuboff’s acclaimed book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, published in the UK in January. Zuboff may do for big tech what Klein did for the superbrands 20 years ago. They watch and critique the Colin Kaepernick ads, Klein says, comparing them to the Michael Jordan equivalents from the 1980s and 90s. “It’s been fun to talk to them about surveillance capitalism, because they’ve grown up with it – they’ve grown up in it – and to follow the emerging ways people are confronting the tech giants.” She recently brought in as speakers some of the organisers of 2018’s Google walkout protest, in which thousands of the corporation’s employees walked out of work in protest at the handling of sexual harassment and gender inequality. It is functionally harder to live life away from 2019’s insatiable tech super-corporations, and some of the superbrands Klein covered in 1999 seem almost quaint in their aspirations to be part of our lives. It is certainly much easier not to buy a fizzy drink or eat at McDonald’s than it is to function day to day without helping generate profits for one or all of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple or Microsoft. Proud of yourself for not buying books or gifts from Amazon? Fair enough, but it is also the largest cloud service provider, with a 32% market share; your favourite activist website is probably using Amazon Web Services. “We’re more globally connected than ever before,” Klein says, “and also less connected to who makes our clothes, who grows our food, and I think part of that is down to information overload. And in terms of what social media is doing to our ability to stay focused, to not see the world in terms of these matrices of our own marketability and consumability, whether it’s views or likes or retweets…” She sighs. “Well, I think this may be the death of us. It’s not that people don’t care, it’s that they care for five seconds. That acceleration of emotion, and attention – it’s a pretty big shift in 20 years. “I think the next big battles will be over the information commons: the entire business model of these tech giants is an extractive model, based on people’s unpaid labour. It’s been the most incredible bait-and-switch, to simultaneously say, ‘Don’t be evil’ and persuade us to live our lives in public and online and share everything.” There is, however, one small part of our relationship with brands that the internet and social media have perhaps democratised – the ability to control the memes of production. “In No Logo, in the ‘adbusting’ chapter, I was writing about a few daring guys with ladders, defacing billboards,” she laughs, “and now you have millions of people able to do parody ads and share them with everyone, instantaneously.” While the images of black-clad protesters on the streets of Seattle in 1999 may have marked a rupture of sorts, the rapid decline of the global justice movement it heralded is not something to be entirely mourned by activists, Klein says, because another kind of progress has been made. “It’s easy to lose sight of just how hegemonic neoliberalism really was, in the late 1990s. There is an ascendant democratic socialist left in the west now and it’s liberalism that is in crisis.” The global justice movement was, she says, a movement of “nos” and not a lot of “yeses”. “It’s taken a while to get the political and intellectual confidence to not only say ‘no’ to the ravages of neoliberal austerity, but to propose bold and imaginative structural transformation. “The real sea change between then and now is that that critique of corporate power is utterly mainstream. If you look at the US presidential candidates, not just Elizabeth Warren’s or Bernie Sanders’s campaigns but even some of the more mainstream candidates – everybody has to talk about breaking up big tech and standing up to the fossil fuel companies.” Maybe it’s partly that our relationships with the companies behind the logos have changed dramatically since 1999 too. Another example of a new trend recorded in No Logo that’s become commonplace is the gig economy, or precarious work. People have no reciprocal relationship, no give and take, with their big-name corporate employers. In the Fordist era of production-line factory jobs after the war, many workers may have had miserably mundane nine-to-fives but at least those came with stability, pensions and as jobs for life. The gig economy is shattering any lingering sense of trust in or fidelity to corporations. “Wide-scale public rage at oligarchic power is very mainstream now,” Klein says. And that surely can’t be good for the brand. Perhaps it is a function of age, but recalling the world No Logo described when I was 18 – a world before 9/11 and the “war on terror”, before the global financial crisis and before the gig economy and big tech set the terms of your employment and social life respectively – does feel like harking back to a more innocent time. It would be easy for me to get an Uber to a WeWork office, order some Deliveroo and finish this article on Google Docs, while I stream Spotify, taking a break to browse Facebook and Instagram on my Android phone, finesse my personal brand on Twitter and wonder where the No Logo revolution all went wrong. But it was never as simple as merely boycotting brands you vaguely disapproved of; the thrust of the book, and the global justice movement in general, was not about making more tasteful shopping decisions, but understanding how corporations shape our lives and culture and using that knowledge to try to, at least, stop them from running riot. The stakes are higher now than they were in the 1990s and this time, thanks to books such as No Logo, we can’t say that we didn’t know."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/12/the-singapore-summit-is-a-global-exercise-in-damage-limitation-of-donald-trump","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T04:13:11Z","webTitle":"The Singapore summit is a global exercise in Donald Trump damage limitation | Richard Wolffe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/12/the-singapore-summit-is-a-global-exercise-in-damage-limitation-of-donald-trump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/12/the-singapore-summit-is-a-global-exercise-in-damage-limitation-of-donald-trump","fields":{"headline":"The Singapore summit is a global exercise in Donald Trump damage limitation","bodyText":"Let’s be honest. The sight of high-level talks with a bellicose, incoherent, nuclear-armed world leader is far better than the alternative. What good can come from isolating an impetuous man suffering from delusions of grandeur? Yes, it’s a relief to see the world trying to talk sense to Donald J Trump, even if those talks are doomed to fail. The imperative for the world’s leaders is how to manage the risks posed by an American president who can’t be trusted to keep his word or to distinguish his friends from his foes. What the world watched aghast at the G7 summit is the same dynamic it now sees in Singapore: a global exercise in damage limitation of Donald Trump. So far, so good in Singapore. Before he could begin talking to Kim Jong-un, Trump already declared his talks “tremendously successful” and the outcome of “a terrific relationship.” He also described his meeting with the world’s worst dictator as “my honor.” You shouldn’t hold your breath waiting for the condemnation of this belittling of the American presidency from the same conservatives who were disgusted by President Obama’s greeting of the Japanese emperor. Then again, who cares? As long as Trump can cool his own saber-rattling, the good citizens of South Korea can sleep soundly at night. After all, when North Korean fears reached fever pitch a few months ago, it wasn’t because of a spike in Pyongyang’s rhetoric. That has long been at a level of fire and fury that most of its neighbors choose to ignore. In 2010 a North Korean torpedo sank a South Korean warship, and three years later, it threatened to fire on US bases after B2 stealth bombers flew over the peninsula. What changed this year? The threats of fire and fury came from the American president, not the North Korean dictator. Suddenly the world was unsettled by Washington and a hotheaded leader who insisted his nuclear button was bigger than anyone else’s. So we should understand what the world is hoping for when we look at the Singapore summit, and appreciate the little wins that will keep war at bay. At the top of that list is a path to managing the unhinged conduct of the president of the United States. As for managing North Korea, we have been here before. The Stalinist state has been a nuclear power for more than a decade, with enough conventional firepower and long-range missiles to inflict mass civilian deaths on our allies in South Korea and Japan. President Clinton was close to a summit in 2000 after years of diplomacy and deals that his political opponents scorned. Republicans in those days were rightly distrustful of the North Koreans, who cheated on the Clinton deal. Still, President Bush joined the six-party talks and came to a deal, which the North Koreans promptly blew up with their own nuclear test. Presidential summits were of no value to Trump’s predecessors because they wanted to enhance the deal, not their own image. They chose not to meet with the North Korean leadership because there was no upside for them. Those deals hinged on sanctions and nuclear talks: the normal language of diplomacy and national security. For this president, the calculation is entirely different for all sides. Trump speaks the language of personal enrichment because, well, that’s who he is. When asked in the Oval Office last month whether North Korea was heading for a Libyan outcome, as his national security adviser suggested, Trump disagreed. “This would be with Kim Jong-un,” he explained, “something where he’d be there, he’d be in his country, he’d be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Personal enrichment is something the North Korean leadership understands as much as the Trump family. The Bush administration discovered this by chance when it blacklisted a Macao bank that turned into its greatest leverage over the North Koreans. It turned out that the bank held $25m belonging to just 52 people close to the Pyongyang regime. Freeing up that cash became a critical part of the Bush-era nuclear deal with North Korea. This is where the G7 allies are speaking a different language from the man who currently tweets about cable television from the executive mansion of the White House. They want to talk about communiqués, the rules of global trade and how to treat your allies like they’re your friends. They hold meetings about women’s empowerment and expect Trump to turn up on time. They agree the language of a joint statement and expect Trump to stay true to that agreement from morning to afternoon. They look at an American trade surplus with Canada and are shocked when he talks about a deficit. The sooner they understand that Trump cannot grow into a normal world leader, the better. Before conservatives cheer this moment in global politics, they should realize they are happy that Trump is finally taking on the great Canadian threat to our national security. Whatever will he protect us from next? Perhaps it’s time he challenged the international evil that is Switzerland. If there is a Trump doctrine, it’s certainly not America First. That might just involve promoting America’s interests by maintaining the largest number of powerful allies. No, the Trump doctrine is to create the Age of Outrage: a constant churn of outrageous statements designed to disrupt and distract. Some of that outrage is intentional, and some of it is just incompetence. For now, the permanently startled press corps can only ask the most serious questions of this least serious president. Before he flounced out of the G7 summit, Trump was asked how long it would take him to figure out if the North Korean leader was serious. “That’s a good question,” said the commander-in-chief. “How long will it take? I think within the first minute I’ll know.” “How?” asked the dumbfounded reporter. “Just my touch, my feel. That’s what I do.” That’s what Trump does: he gropes his way to his foreign policy, while the rest of the world just looks shocked. As long as he’s happy, we can rationalize his bad behavior as being good for the world. As long as he doesn’t grope his way to war, we might just have a chance to rebuild America’s alliances in 2021.

Tourists are promised safety, comfort and the ghoulish thrill of visiting the site where, at 1.23am on 26 April 1986, an explosion at the nuclear plant’s reactor No 4 created the largest peacetime nuclear disaster in history. The adjacent city of Prypiat, which grew up around Chernobyl, is a latter-day Pompeii. It has remained uninhabited since the Soviet authorities belatedly ordered the evacuation of its population 36 hours after the plant first began spewing lethal radiation into the atmosphere. When, in 2015, the Ukrainian parliament ordered the removal of all Communist party statues from the country’s streets and squares, Prypiat and the 18-mile radius exclusion zone around Chernobyl became a “time capsule” and a “communist preserve”. There, Lenin and co still gaze down triumphantly on the desolation. In this compelling history of the disaster and its aftermath, Serhii Plokhy presents Chernobyl as a terrifying emblem of the terminal decline of the Soviet system. The turbine test that went catastrophically wrong was not, he argues, a freak occurrence but a disaster waiting to happen. It had deep roots in the party’s reckless obsession with production targets and in the pliant nuclear industry’s alarming record of cutting corners to cut costs. Plokhy’s well-paced narrative plunges the reader into the sweaty, nervous tension of the Chernobyl control room on the fateful night when human frailty and design flaws combined to such devastating effect. Men with dozens of years’ experience in the nuclear industry were confounded when they found themselves unable to arrest the rising temperature in the reactor and an enormous explosion rocked the plant. After crucial hours passed in confusion and denial, they acknowledged that the core of the reactor was on fire and that it was emitting radiation into the night sky through a gaping hole in the roof. The authorities’ subsequent attempts to contain the fire were a signature Soviet mix of improvisation, heroism and ineptitude. Exposing themselves to lethal levels of radiation, helicopter crews made repeated flights over the burning reactor, dropping 5,000 tonnes of sand, clay and lead in an ultimately successful bid to extinguish the fire. In so doing, they prevented the very real possibility of a second much larger explosion that might have rendered the entire European continent uninhabitable. Woefully misjudging the scale of the disaster, the Kremlin insisted that the Ukrainian authorities go ahead with the organisation of the May Day parade in central Kiev just as radiation levels in the city were spiking. Crowds lined the streets to cheer the achievements of Soviet socialism while their leaders, who knew of the explosion only 80 miles away, looked down on families oblivious to the danger. With both radiation readings and the demand for information in western Europe rising and Ukrainian hospitals admitting hundreds of patients suffering from radiation sickness, the Kremlin finally broke its silence almost three days after the accident. The public clamour for detailed information about the threat to health quickly proved unstoppable. On the brink of glasnost, Chernobyl helped prise open the vice of Soviet censorship, forcing the regime to publicly confront its failings and their dreadful consequences for the country. If the Soviet command economy was the ultimate villain at Chernobyl, it came into its own in the Herculean clean-up operation. Close to 600,000 Soviet citizens, many of them army reservists, were mobilised at great personal risk to gather up radioactive debris scattered by the explosion, demolish irradiated villages and move contaminated soil. The military buried the “Red Forest”, a four-square-mile expanse of pine trees that had turned red after absorbing radiation. The clean-up was crowned by the construction of a metal and concrete “sarcophagus” over the entire reactor. Plokhy gives a balanced and sympathetic account of the experiences of the senior scientists, engineers and politicians who extinguished the reactor fire, organised the evacuation of the region and contained the radioactive contamination. Yet the firefighters, reservists, teachers, farmers, doctors and schoolchildren caught up in the disaster have only walk-on roles in his narrative. The Belorussian Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich’s harrowing symphony of interviews about the disaster Chernobyl Prayer: A Chronicle of the Future contains a rich trove of sources that here go mostly untapped. Plokhy’s most penetrating chapters deal with the political fallout. Attempts by Moscow to downplay design flaws in the reactor and to make scapegoats of a handful of managers and operators failed to reassure public opinion in a new era of open discussion. Chernobyl, Plokhy writes, “ended one era and initiated another”. It helped to transform the slow-burn of Soviet environmental protests into an explosive form of eco-nationalism. Where Ukrainian intellectuals had once embraced nuclear power as an emblem of modernity, they now shunned it as a baleful symptom of Soviet imperialism. The poet Ivan Drach, one of the leaders of the democratic movement Rukh, later recalled that “Chernobyl roused our souls, showing us in real terms that we were on the edge of an abyss”. The only way to safeguard Ukraine from a repeat of the disaster was independence from Moscow. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 was powered by a wave of popular revolts in the non-Russian republics. The catalyst of the Ukrainian revolt was reactor No 4. • Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy is published by Allen Lane.

Charles Hendry, a Conservative politician and former energy minister, enthusiastically supported the scheme a year ago as a source of clean power and UK jobs. Since then, the government has not indicated whether it wants to move ahead with the project, and ministers were recently reported to have gone cold on it. But Hendry told the Guardian he was still hopeful that Swansea would receive backing, because the plan would have been ruled out before now if it was not being given serious consideration. “I remain optimistic that government will decide to move ahead, especially in light of [this week’s] announcement from the Welsh government,” he told the Guardian. On Wednesday it was revealed that Carwyn Jones, first minister of Wales, had written to prime minister Theresa May offering “substantial” investment in the form of a loan or equity stake to help the lagoon move forward. “This investment could help to reduce the cost of capital for the project and reduce the subsidy requirement over the lifetime of any contract for difference,” he said. The last offer tabled by the Tidal Lagoon Power company was £89.90 per megawatt hour over 90 years, though Hendry prefers a 60-year timescale. The Welsh offer should bring the number down, but it could still appear expensive compared to rival low-carbon sources of power. New offshore windfarms to be built in 2022-23 have won contract for difference subsidies of £57.50 per MWh over 15 years. EDF Energy was awarded £92.50 per MWh over 35 years for Hinkley Point C, the nuclear power station due online by 2025. Business secretary Greg Clark has refused to be drawn on whether he will back the lagoon, which could be the first of several. Government sources insist a decision has not been taken either way yet. Hendry said that the delays were understandable and should not be mistaken for officials turning lukewarm on the scheme. “I was always clear that government would require some time to consider my recommendations. With an election and ministerial changes that process was inevitably going to take longer,” he said. Swansea city council has sent birthday cards to May, Clark and the Welsh secretary to remind them it is one year since Hendry recommended supporting the lagoon. Rob Stewart, the council leader, said: “Post-Brexit, this is exactly the kind of innovative project the UK government should be wholeheartedly backing because it will lead to a new global industry in the UK that will benefit British workers and British businesses.” There have also been warnings that a thousand jobs could be lost in the Midlands if the lagoon does not go ahead at GE plants in Stafford and Rugby, which had been earmarked to make the lagoon’s underwater turbines. The government said a response to the Hendry review would be published in due course. A spokesperson said: “We want to ensure that the UK has a diverse, secure and affordable energy mix but it must provide value for consumers.” Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/mar/10/japan-fukushima-nuclear-disaster-evacuees-forced-return-home-radiation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-10T07:52:17Z","webTitle":"Fukushima evacuees face 'forced' return as subsidies withdrawn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/10/japan-fukushima-nuclear-disaster-evacuees-forced-return-home-radiation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/mar/10/japan-fukushima-nuclear-disaster-evacuees-forced-return-home-radiation","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima evacuees face 'forced' return as subsidies withdrawn","bodyText":"Thousands of people who fled the meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant six years ago will soon lose their housing subsidies, forcing some to consider returning despite lingering concerns over radiation in their former neighbourhoods. The measure, condemned by campaigners as a violation of the evacuees’ right to live in a safe environment, will affect an estimated 27,000 people who were not living inside the mandatory evacuation zone imposed after Fukushima became the scene of the worst nuclear accident in Japanese history. The meltdown in three reactors occurred after a magnitude-9 earthquake on 11 March 2011 triggered a powerful tsunami that killed almost 19,000 people along Japan’s north-east coast and knocked out the plant’s backup cooling system. As a “voluntary” evacuee, Noriko Matsumoto is among those who will have their subsidies withdrawn at the end of this month, forcing them to make a near-impossible choice: move back to homes they believe are unsafe, or face financial hardship as they struggle on living in nuclear limbo. “Many of the other evacuees I know are in the same position,” Matsumoto said at the launch of Unequal Impact, a Greenpeace Japan report on human rights abuses affecting women and children among the 160,000 people who initially fled from areas near the plant. As of last month, almost 80,000 were still displaced. Matsumoto said: “They would still have to contend with high radiation if they returned, but the government is forcing them to go back by withdrawing housing assistance – that’s tantamount to a crime.” At the time of the incident, Matsumoto was living with her husband and their two daughters in the city of Koriyama, 43 miles (70km) west of the stricken facility, well outside the area where tens of thousands of people were ordered to leave. Matsumoto initially stayed put, but three months later, with her youngest daughter, then aged 12, having nosebleeds, stomach ache and diarrhoea, she left her husband behind and took their children to Kanagawa prefecture, more than 150 miles south of Fukushima. She said: “The government is playing down the effects of radiation exposure … Yet people who don’t return to places like Koriyama after this month will be left to fend for themselves. They will become internally displaced people. We feel like we’ve been abandoned by our government.” Many of the people who left their homes of their own volition after the triple meltdown were mothers and their young children, who experts say face greater risks to their health from prolonged exposure to relatively low levels of radiation. The voluntary evacuations have forced families to live apart, while parents struggle to earn enough money to fund their new accommodation and keep up mortgage payments on their abandoned homes. Kazuko Ito, a lawyer and the secretary general of Tokyo-based NGO Human Rights Now, said: “The government has a responsibility to protect the human rights of evacuees but it doesn’t recognise this obligation. Instead, it downplays the health impact of the accident, especially the dangers associated with long-term radiation exposure.” In an arrangement repeated among thousands of other Fukushima families, Matsumoto’s husband decided to stay in Koriyama, a city of 330,000 people that was never subject to an evacuation order, and run their restaurant, rather than risk becoming unemployed by joining his wife and children in Kanagawa. The high cost of travel means the family gets together once every two months. The housing subsidy for households of two or more people from Matsumoto’s neighbourhood is typically 90,000 yen (£640) a month, according to local officials, who say some households will receive smaller sums after the subsidy is withdrawn. Matsumoto said: “The nuclear accident is to blame for this situation, yet it’s been turned around to make it look like it’s our fault, like we are being selfish.” Residents who were not living in the mandatory evacuation zone when they fled have been campaigning to retain housing subsidies, in a challenge to the authorities’ attempts to convince more evacuees that some neighbourhoods have been properly decontaminated. Campaigners have called on the government to declare Fukushima neighbourhoods unfit for human habitation unless atmospheric radiation is brought to below one millisievert (mSv) a year, the maximum public exposure limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. While 1 mSv a year remains the government’s long-term target, it is encouraging people to return to areas where radiation levels are below 20 mSv a year, an annual exposure limit that, internationally, applies to nuclear power plant workers. Matsumoto said the unprecedented decontamination effort in Fukushima had brought radiation levels in and around her home to below government-set limits, but insisted that children were still at risk from “hotspots” in places such as parks and forests. “Those areas have not been decontaminated,” she said. “It’s true that atmospheric radiation has been lowered, but that’s not the case on the ground and in the soil.” At the end of this month, evacuation orders will be lifted in four more towns and villages near Fukushima Daiichi, with only those closest to the plant, where radiation is more than 50 mSv a year, still off-limits. The headline, subheading and first two paragraphs of this article were corrected on 11 March 2017. The evacuees have not been told they must return to their homes if they want to keep their subsidies, as originally suggested. The subsidies are being withdrawn regardless, which will force many to return out of financial necessity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/feb/25/sa-state-election-first-big-opportunity-for-cory-bernardis-party","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-24T20:00:02Z","webTitle":"South Australian state election first big opportunity for Cory Bernardi’s party","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/25/sa-state-election-first-big-opportunity-for-cory-bernardis-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/feb/25/sa-state-election-first-big-opportunity-for-cory-bernardis-party","fields":{"headline":"South Australian state election first big opportunity for Cory Bernardi’s party","bodyText":"He’s the high-profile South Australian politician challenging the big parties with his own upstart political movement – and no, we’re not talking about Nick Xenophon. It is a sign of the deeply unusual manner in which the SA state election campaign is panning out that senator Cory Bernardi’s Australian Conservatives party has hardly rated a mention, despite the 17 March contest shaping up as both the first big test and first major opportunity for the ex-Liberal’s new political force. The Australian Conservatives are running 33 lower house candidates – three short of the number Nick Xenophon’s SA Best have announced to date – but the real opportunities lie in SA’s legislative council, where Bernardi already has two well-established members out of a merger with Family First. Dennis Hood, the leader of the South Australian branch of the party, is not up for re-election, but his collegue Robert Brokenshire will be fighting for his spot, and Riverland businesswoman Nicolle Jachmann rounds out the upper house ticket. If Bernardi can retain enough of Family First’s significant SA support base and bring on board some of his own fans, the Australian Conservatives could prove highly influential in what is likely to be a fractured 22-member legislative council. What’s more, One Nation failed to register in time for the election, meaning the Australian Conservatives will have a clear run at voters who inhabit the space to the right of the Liberal party. That space is larger than usual given that the campaign of Liberal leader Steven Marshall, himself a moderate, has responded to the Xenophon threat and Labor’s popular renewables strategy by edging to the political centre on a number of issues. In an election where the centre-right party is offering $100m in means-tested grants to help people buy home battery storage systems and a 10-year moratorium on fracking in a farming region, Bernardi has a lot of conservative touchstones to himself. His proposals include repealing $3bn in state taxes, completely ending renewable energy state subsidies, and undertaking a cost-benefit analysis to either bring coal-fired power back to SA or build a nuclear power plant. The nuclear ambitions don’t stop there, with the Australian Conservatives proposing to follow through on Labor’s abandoned push to establish a $445bn state wealth fund seeded from importing and storing high-level radioactive waste that could remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years. A lower house seat is a long shot, but the Australian Conservatives could play a deciding role in many electorates, firstly by making it more difficult for the Liberal party to win seats outright in an election where going down to preferences promises to be a chaotic affair, with Liberal, Labor and SA Best evenly divided in many areas. Australian Conservatives preferences are, however, expected to flow back to the Liberals and could prove decisive in the many marginal seats up for grabs. Their conservative values and policies appeal to some, but the key question is whether anyone is actually listening, with all the attention on Xenophon. Of course, it is not so easy to start afresh without the formidable Liberal party machine backing Bernardi as it once did. Like Xenophon and SA Best, Bernardi’s personal brand is well known, but his new party’s name is not, and Australian political history is littered with the floating corpses of startup political parties drowned out by more established voices. Voters had a decade-and-a-half to become familiar with Family First, but the Australian Conservatives are in a sense starting afresh, and will also be distracted by the federal byelection in Batman that concludes on the same day as the SA election. Unlike Xenophon, Bernardi is not himself running as a candidate as he continues with his federal Senate commitments, and besides is a great deal more divisive a figure than the SA Best leader is. Xenophon might have questionable taste in advertising jingles, but he has never linked bestiality to same-sex relationships as Bernardi has. After spending three months in the US during the 2016 election campaign, Bernardi might be confident that divisiveness can be a vote winner. His election slogan is a familiar one: “Make South Australia great again.” The original version worked for US president Donald Trump, but how will it go down in SA?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/mar/09/fukushima-nuclear-cleanup-falters-six-years-after-tsunami","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-09T01:23:34Z","webTitle":"Dying robots and failing hope: Fukushima clean-up falters six years after tsunami","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/09/fukushima-nuclear-cleanup-falters-six-years-after-tsunami","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/mar/09/fukushima-nuclear-cleanup-falters-six-years-after-tsunami","fields":{"headline":"Dying robots and failing hope: Fukushima clean-up falters six years after tsunami","bodyText":"Barely a fifth of the way into their mission, the engineers monitoring the Scorpion’s progress conceded defeat. With a remote-controlled snip of its cable, the latest robot sent into the bowels of one of Fukushima Daiichi’s damaged reactors was cut loose, its progress stalled by lumps of fuel that overheated when the nuclear plant suffered a triple meltdown six years ago this week. As the 60cm-long Toshiba robot, equipped with a pair of cameras and sensors to gauge radiation levels was left to its fate last month, the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), attempted to play down the failure of yet another reconnaissance mission to determine the exact location and condition of the melted fuel. Even though its mission had been aborted, the utility said, “valuable information was obtained which will help us determine the methods to eventually remove fuel debris”. The Scorpion mishap, two hours into an exploration that was supposed to last 10 hours, underlined the scale and difficulty of decommissioning Fukushima Daiichi – an unprecedented undertaking one expert has described as “almost beyond comprehension”. Cleaning up the plant, scene of the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl after it was struck by a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami on the afternoon of 11 March 2011, is expected to take 30 to 40 years, at a cost Japan’s trade and industry ministry recently estimated at 21.5tr yen ($189bn). The figure, which includes compensating tens of thousands of evacuees, is nearly double an estimate released three years ago. The tsunami killed almost 19,000 people, most of them in areas north of Fukushima, and forced 160,000 people living near the plant to flee their homes. Six years on, only a small number have returned to areas deemed safe by the authorities. Developing robots capable of penetrating the most dangerous parts of Fukushima Daiichi’s reactors – and spending enough time there to obtain crucial data – is proving a near-impossible challenge for Tepco. The Scorpion – so called because of its camera-mounted folding tail – “died” after stalling along a rail beneath the reactor pressure vessel, its path blocked by lumps of fuel and other debris. The device, along with other robots, may also have been damaged by an unseen enemy: radiation. Before it was abandoned, its dosimeter indicated that radiation levels inside the No 2 containment vessel were at 250 sieverts an hour. In an earlier probe using a remote-controlled camera, radiation at about the same spot was as high as 650 sieverts an hour – enough to kill a human within a minute. Shunji Uchida, the Fukushima Daiichi plant manager, concedes that Tepco acquired “limited” knowledge about the state of the melted fuel. “So far we’ve only managed to take a peek, as the last experiment with the robot didn’t go well,” he tells the Guardian and other media on a recent visit to the plant. “But we’re not thinking of another approach at this moment.” Robotic mishaps aside, exploration work in the two other reactors, where radiation levels are even higher than in reactor No 2, has barely begun. There are plans to send a tiny waterproof robot into reactor No 1 in the next few weeks, but no date has been set for the more seriously damaged reactor No 3. Naohiro Masuda, the president of Fukushima Daiichi’s decommissioning arm, says he wants another probe sent in before deciding on how to remove the melted fuel. Despite the setbacks, Tepco insists it will begin extracting the melted fuel in 2021 – a decade after the disaster – after consulting government officials this summer. But Shaun Burnie, a senior nuclear specialist at Greenpeace Germany who is based in Japan, describes the challenge confronting the utility as “unprecedented and almost beyond comprehension”, adding that the decommissioning schedule was “never realistic or credible”. The latest aborted exploration of reactor No 2 “only reinforces that reality”, Burnie says. “Without a technical solution for dealing with unit one or three, unit two was seen as less challenging. So much of what is communicated to the public and media is speculation and wishful thinking on the part of industry and government. “The current schedule for the removal of hundreds of tons of molten nuclear fuel, the location and condition of which they still have no real understanding, was based on the timetable of prime minister [Shinzo] Abe in Tokyo and the nuclear industry – not the reality on the ground and based on sound engineering and science.” Even Shunichi Tanaka, the chairman of Japan’s nuclear regulation authority, does not appear to share Tepco’s optimism that it will stick to its decommissioning roadmap. “It is still early to talk in such an optimistic way,” he says. “At the moment, we are still feeling around in the dark.” ‘The situation is not under control’ On the surface, much has changed since the Guardian’s first visit to Fukushima Daiichi five years ago. Then, the site was still strewn with tsunami wreckage. Hoses, pipes and building materials covered the ground, as thousands of workers braved high radiation levels to bring a semblance of order to the scene of a nuclear disaster. Six years later, damaged reactor buildings have been reinforced, and more than 1,300 spent fuel assemblies have been safely removed from a storage pool in reactor No 4. The ground has been covered with a special coating to prevent rainwater from adding to Tepco’s water-management woes. Workers who once had to change into protective gear before they approached Fukushima Daiichi now wear light clothing and simple surgical masks in most areas of the plant. The 6,000 workers, including thousands of contract staff, can now eat hot meals and take breaks at a “rest house” that opened in 2015. But further up the hill from the coastline, row upon row of steel tanks are a reminder of the decommissioning effort’s other great nemesis: contaminated water. The tanks now hold about 900,000 tons of water, with the quantity soon expected to reach 1m tons. Tepco’s once-vaunted underground ice wall, built at a cost of 24.5bn yen, has so far failed to completely prevent groundwater from leaking into the reactor basements and mixing with radioactive coolant water. The structure, which freezes the soil to a depth of 30 metres, is still allowing 150 tonnes of groundwater to seep into the reactor basements every day, said Yuichi Okamura, a Tepco spokesman. Five sections have been kept open deliberately to prevent water inside the reactor basements from rising and flowing out more rapidly. “We have to close the wall gradually,” Okamura said. “By April we want to keep the influx of groundwater to about 100 tonnes a day, and to eliminate all contaminated water on the site by 2020.” Critics of the clean-up note that 2020 is the year Tokyo is due to host the Olympics, having been awarded the Games after Abe assured the International Olympic Committee that Fukushima was “under control”. Mitsuhiko Tanaka, a former Babcock-Hitachi nuclear engineer, accuses Abe and other government officials of playing down the severity of the decommissioning challenge in an attempt to win public support for the restart of nuclear reactors across the country. “Abe said Fukushima was under control when he went overseas to promote the Tokyo Olympics, but he never said anything like that in Japan,” says Tanaka. “Anyone here could see that the situation was not under control. “If people of Abe’s stature repeat something often enough, it becomes accepted as the truth.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/feb/21/ai-security-threats-cybercrime-political-disruption-physical-attacks-report","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T06:01:13Z","webTitle":"Growth of AI could boost cybercrime and security threats, report warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/21/ai-security-threats-cybercrime-political-disruption-physical-attacks-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/feb/21/ai-security-threats-cybercrime-political-disruption-physical-attacks-report","fields":{"headline":"Growth of AI could boost cybercrime and security threats, report warns","bodyText":"Wanton proliferation of artificial intelligence technologies could enable new forms of cybercrime, political disruption and even physical attacks within five years, a group of 26 experts from around the world have warned. In a new report, the academic, industry and the charitable sector experts, describe AI as a “dual use technology” with potential military and civilian uses, akin to nuclear power, explosives and hacking tools. “As AI capabilities become more powerful and widespread, we expect the growing use of AI systems to lead to the expansion of existing threats, the introduction of new threats and a change to the typical character of threats,” the report says. They argue that researchers need to consider potential misuse of AI far earlier in the course of their studies than they do at present, and work to create appropriate regulatory frameworks to prevent malicious uses of AI. If the advice is not followed, the report warns, AI is likely to revolutionise the power of bad actors to threaten everyday life. In the digital sphere, they say, AI could be used to lower the barrier to entry for carrying out damaging hacking attacks. The technology could automate the discovery of critical software bugs or rapidly select potential victims for financial crime. It could even be used to abuse Facebook-style algorithmic profiling to create “social engineering” attacks designed to maximise the likelihood that a user will click on a malicious link or download an infected attachment. The increasing influence of AI on the physical world means it is also vulnerable to AI misuse. The most widely discussed example involves weaponising “drone swarms”, fitting them with small explosives and self-driving technology and then setting them loose to carry out untraceable assassinations as so-called “slaughterbots”. Political disruption is just as plausible, the report argues. Nation states may decide to use automated surveillance platforms to suppress dissent – as is already the case in China, particularly for the Uighur people in the nation’s northwest. Others may create “automated, hyper-personalised disinformation campaigns”, targeting every individual voter with a distinct set of lies designed to influence their behaviour. Or AI could simply run “denial-of-information attacks”, generating so many convincing fake news stories that legitimate information becomes almost impossible to discern from the noise. Seán Ó hÉigeartaigh of the University of Cambridge’s centre for the study of existential risk, one of the report’s authors, said: “We live in a world that could become fraught with day-to-day hazards from the misuse of AI and we need to take ownership of the problems – because the risks are real. There are choices that we need to make now, and our report is a call-to-action for governments, institutions and individuals across the globe. “For many decades hype outstripped fact in terms of AI and machine learning. No longer. This report … suggests broad approaches that might help: for example, how to design software and hardware to make it less hackable – and what type of laws and international regulations might work in tandem with this.” Not everyone is convinced that AI poses such a risk, however. Dmitri Alperovitch, the co-founder of information security firm CrowdStrike, said: “I am not of the view that the sky is going to come down and the earth open up. “There are going to be improvements on both sides; this is an ongoing arms race. AI is going to be extremely beneficial, and already is, to the field of cybersecurity. It’s also going to be beneficial to criminals. It remains to be seen which side is going to benefit from it more. “My prediction is it’s going to be more beneficial to the defensive side, because where AI shines is in massive data collection, which applies more to the defence than offence.” The report concedes that AI is the best defence against AI, but argues that “AI-based defence is not a panacea, especially when we look beyond the digital domain”. “More work should also be done in understanding the right balance of openness in AI, developing improved technical measures for formally verifying the robustness of systems, and ensuring that policy frameworks developed in a less AI-infused world adapt to the new world we are creating,” the authors wrote.

Vincent de Rivaz is the longest-serving CEO among the heads of the UK’s big six energy suppliers and will be replaced on 1 November by Simone Rossi, who leads the company’s international division.

He also oversaw its acquisition of Britain’s ageing nuclear infrastructure in 2008. De Rivaz did not say why he was stepping down, but it is understood that he was satisfied after getting the much-maligned and heavily delayed Hinkley contract over the line. He has been at the French state-owned company for nearly 40 years. In a message to staff, De Rivaz said that during his leadership: “I have no doubt that at the same time we will have strengthened even more our confidence in our future”. He said a decision on him leaving was made several months ago, but an announcement had been deferred until a successor was in place. De Rivaz promised staff he would ensure a “a seamless handover”. Rossi, an Italian who joined EDF as chief financial officer in 2011, will face the Herculean task of ensuring the reactors at Hinkley are delivered by 2025. Projects in Finland and France utilising the same reactor design have run hugely over budget and behind schedule.

Hard choice, wrong call","bodyText":"Theresa May has taken her first major strategic decision. Hinkley C will go ahead, seven weeks after a pause instigated when the champagne to celebrate final approval was already on ice. The only change from a move that infuriated the Chinese and flummoxed the French investors appears to be a British veto on any sale of the Gallic interest during construction, and in future a new national security test for all foreign investment in critical infrastructure. All the pause really illustrates is that when it comes to nuclear, Britain is no longer a player in a world in which Russia and China vie to dominate. Hinkley C is an unproven design that comes at a punitive cost. Given the bill that will finally be picked up by the British taxpayer, it could well be no riskier to make a commitment on a similar scale to building a smart energy network that delivers power efficiently. This approach could be complemented by investing more heavily in reducing demand through measures such as better insulation, while expanding renewables, whose costs are falling. Already offshore wind is the only source more costly than nuclear. But nuclear clearly has some advantages. It is low carbon and Britain would struggle to meet its target of carbon-free energy by 2050 without it. It will keep the lights on in a way that most renewable energy cannot yet be relied upon to do, although the gap is narrowing as storage technology improves. Unlike onshore windfarms, fracking or even extensive solar installations, all of which arouse powerful local opposition, most of the neighbours at Hinkley C want the investment. It will safeguard existing jobs and it will deliver new ones – as many as 25,000, it is estimated. British business is eagerly anticipating a supply-line bonanza. Most of all, after the shattering blow of the Brexit vote and its potential impact on foreign investment, it is hard to see how Mrs May could really risk withdrawing approval for Hinkley C. In trying to exercise power, the prime minister has instead illustrated the constraints on her scope for action in an area where she has to maintain a fragile balance between national security, global investment and the demands of climate change politics. She could be forgiven for wishing she was starting somewhere else. For nearly a decade, Hinkley C has been presented as the magic bullet that will keep the lights on for generations to come, and a prelude to a huge expansion of nuclear power to meet the rapidly increasing demand for energy and the need to take old, dirty and inefficient capacity out of service. But after some costly experiences, Britain has lost its nuclear know-how: by the time it was completed in 1995, the last nuclear power station to be built, Sizewell B in Suffolk, was 40% over budget and successive governments have retreated from such ambitious infrastructure investment. When, in 2006, Labour tentatively proposed putting nuclear back in the energy mix, it already appeared certain that new nuclear would be built with foreign expertise and capital. British consumers will not bear the £18.5bn construction costs of Hinkley C. But nuclear is far too costly and too slow to produce a return to attract private sector investment without huge incentives. That is why EDF secured a guaranteed price for its electricity that is nearly double the current wholesale cost, for half of its planned lifetime; it is why the government has also underwritten construction costs by £2bn, and it explains the decision which so worried Mrs May, to allow Beijing to pick up a third of the cost as a quid pro quo for future permission to build at least one nuclear power station to its own design, at Bradwell in Essex. The decision is made, but implementation will matter too. The benefits that the government is claiming for the project must be realised. The consumer must not end up with the bill for construction, jobs must come to Britain and above all, the technology has to work. But there is more to it than that. This is a tale that illustrates one of the basic lessons in the No 10 manual of governance: in a competitive field, energy policy is one of the hardest to get right. Keeping the lights on without adding to global warming at a price that consumers can afford is complex. And nuclear, with its lethal waste and high decommissioning costs, is no long-term solution; the worst judgment of all on Mrs May’s first big strategic choice is to find that it drives out investment in other, smarter, solutions which are the real technologies of the future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2017/apr/14/toshiba-us-nuclear-problems-uk-cautionary-tale","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-14T07:00:27Z","webTitle":"Toshiba's US nuclear problems could provide cautionary tale for UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/14/toshiba-us-nuclear-problems-uk-cautionary-tale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/apr/14/toshiba-us-nuclear-problems-uk-cautionary-tale","fields":{"headline":"Toshiba's US nuclear problems provide cautionary tale for UK","bodyText":"The roots of Toshiba’s admission this week that it has serious doubts over its “ability to continue as a going concern” can be found near two small US towns. It is the four reactors being built for nuclear power stations outside Waynesboro, in Georgia, and Jenkinsville, South Carolina, by the company’s US subsidiary Westinghouse that have left the Japanese corporation facing an annual loss of £7.37bn. Construction work on the units has run hugely over budget and over schedule, casting a shadow over two of the biggest new nuclear power station projects in the US for years. Events came to a head last month when Westinghouse was forced to file for bankruptcy protection to limit Toshiba’s losses. Westinghouse’s problems in Waynesboro and Jenkinsville could provide a cautionary tale for the UK, which is also embarking on a nuclear power station-building programme. Experts said the delays and cost problems were due to America’s lack of recent experience in building atomic power plants. “I don’t think it is necessarily because of an inherent issue of US skills but rather the lack of practice,” said Richard Nephew, a professor at the Centre on Global Energy Policy, Columbia University. “There simply have not been as many new reactor builds in the US and this has reduced the overall pool of skilled labor, no question.” The absence of a mass production supply chain, due to the small number of the Westinghouse-designed reactors being built, played a part too, he added. Regulatory issues had also delayed construction. Toshiba’s losses stem from Westinghouse’s acquisition in 2015 of the nuclear construction business CB&amp;I Stone &amp; Webster, which it hoped would solve the delays on the two sites. That deal has now backfired spectacularly, pushing Westinghouse and its parent company to the brink of financial collapse. The regulator for one of the projects, Plant Vogtle, in Georgia, has said Westinghouse’s bankruptcy means the project will require more “time and money”. Meanwhile the utility company paying for the Virgil C Summer Nuclear Generating Station, near Jenkinsville, South Carolina, warned this week that abandonment of the project was one of the options it was now considering. Nephew said: “This experience may push the US into a different model, perhaps focused on smaller modular reactors, or less complicated designs.” The US energy secretary, Rick Perry, signalled the Trump administration’s support for nuclear this week, issuing a statement at the G7 summit in which he said the US backed “advanced civil-nuclear technologies”. That suggested support for next-generation reactors rather than the sort being built by Westinghouse. Richard Morningstar, chairman of the Global Energy Centre at the international affairs thinktank Atlantic Council, said: “What is happening to Westinghouse and Toshiba only emphasises the need to double down on research on new, safe, nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors. If we do not do so in the US, leadership will be ceded to other countries.” One such aspiring atomic leader is the UK, where the government wants to build a new generation of nuclear power stations to help satisfy the country’s power needs for decades to come. But there are obvious parallels between the two countries on the issues of recent experience and supply chains. The UK has not completed a new nuclear power station since Sizewell B on the Suffolk coast started generating power in 1995. EDF, the French state-owned company which has started pouring concrete at Hinkley Point in Somerset, where it plans to have two reactors operational by 2025, maintains it has had plenty of recent practice. The EPR reactor design for Hinkley is the same as that for the reactors it is building in Finland, and at Flamanville, in France, though both of those are running late and over budget. The other new nuclear projects proposed around the UK, all by foreign companies, look less certain and all are still years from construction starting in earnest. Toshiba said this week it would consider selling its shares in the consortium behind another plant planned at Moorside, in Cumbria, which would utilise three of the same AP1000 Westinghouse reactors being built for the two crisis-hit US plants. The South Korean power company Kepco last month expressed an interest in buying into the project, and the business secretary , Greg Clark, went to South Korea last week for talks on collaboration on nuclear power. However, any rescue by Seoul is far from certain. The two leading candidates in South Korea’s elections in May said this week that they favoured rowing back on nuclear power and switching to renewable energy. Kepco would also face a regulatory delay of several years if it wanted to use its own technology at Moorside. Unions in the UK said the uncertainty showed that the government should intervene more directly, by taking a stake in Moorside. Justin Bowden, GMB national secretary, said: “The big moral of the story is what on earth we are doing as a country, leaving our fundamental energy requirements to foreign companies or foreign governments?” While the government has argued that it has plans in place to keep the lights on if new nuclear projects do not materialise, others said the deepening crisis at Toshiba this week showed the need for ministers to consider a new energy policy. “It’s time to come up with a new plan A,” said Paul Dorfman, of the Energy Institute, at University College London, who believes the Moorside project is dead. “It’s time for a viable strategy that talks about grid upgrades, solar, energy efficiency, and energy management.” A report published on Thursday highlighted another alternative: a U-turn on the Conservative party’s manifesto commitment to block new onshore windfarms. Analysis for the trade body Scottish Renewables suggested wind turbines on land had become so cheap they could be built for little or no subsidy, compared to the lucrative contract awarded to EDF for Hinkley. But the prospect of a rethink by the government on wind power looks about as likely as new nuclear power stations being built on time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2019/sep/02/second-world-war-80-years-on-culture","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-02T07:00:42Z","webTitle":"Culture and conflict: how the second world war transformed  fashion, food, arts and tech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2019/sep/02/second-world-war-80-years-on-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2019/sep/02/second-world-war-80-years-on-culture","fields":{"headline":"Culture and conflict: how the second world war transformed  fashion, food, arts and tech","bodyText":"Architecture, by Tribune culture editor Owen Hatherley The second world war had seismic effects on architecture, with reconstruction aimed not just at repairing war damage, but at creating a new society that would never let anything like fascism and world war happen again. As we get more distant from the events and actual memory, the war is increasingly remembered in terms of nostalgic kitsch Royal Victoria Hospital Tearooms, Southampton, 1940 This wooden tearoom was built for the massive increase in staff and patients the war brought. As a small reminder that Britain didn’t exactly “stand alone” in 1940, the timber for the building came from 100 different locations across the global empire. Tin Town, Manchester, 1946 Many wartime factories were converted to build emergency prefabricated houses for those made homeless in the bombing. Some became permanent estates, including one in Wythenshawe in south Manchester, with its brightly painted modular metal houses. Templewood School, Welwyn Garden City, 1950 Mass-producing new schools was a speciality of Hertfordshire county council. Templewood is one of the best, a lightweight structure in a miniature wood, with a mural of Russian folk tales inside, a remnant from when the Soviets were our allies. The architect, A Cleeve-Barr, was a communist. Memorial Gardens, Walsall, 1952 On a hill above the Black Country town, this is one of the subtlest of war memorials – a formal garden, which opens out to an axial circus of council houses, coordinated as part of the same project by the architect Geoffrey Jellicoe; the sacrifice and the reward. Coventry Cathedral, 1962 The centrepiece of what was once a globally praised exemplar of postwar reconstruction, Coventry Cathedral, built around the ruins of the medieval cathedral destroyed in 1940, is both a war memorial of astonishing forgiveness and generosity, and an unrivalled showcase of mid-century British art, with its Graham Sutherland tapestry, John Piper stained glass and Jacob Epstein sculptures. Bomber Command memorial, London, 2012 Various new war memorials were built in the 2000s, all of them with a sentimentality and aesthetic conservatism that clearly wasn’t shared by the wartime generation. One in Green Park, generously funded by Lord Ashcroft – as it tells you in big letters – is in a class of its own of retrograde imperial kitsch; ironically, just the sort of badly scaled neoclassicism that Hitler so fervently admired. It won the award given out by the late Gavin Stamp, Private Eye’s “Piloti”, for worst new building in 2012. Broadcast, by Observer arts and media correspondent Vanessa Thorpe Although television services were shut down for the duration, lessons learned from wartime radio still shape output today. The BBC was the power in the land and by 1944 George Orwell, a former BBC propagandist, noted that the phrase “I heard it on the BBC” had come to mean “I know it must be true”. Radio Hamburg’s ‘Lord Haw-Haw’, 1939 to 1945 Enemy propaganda broadcasts in English from Anglo-Irish defector William Joyce were heard by 6 million listeners, as were those of his Japanese female equivalents, known collectively as Tokyo Rose. These dripping taps of “fake news” attempted to deflate Allied morale. Charles de Gaulle’s ‘Appeal of 18 June’ 1940 The exiled French general’s appeal to Free French forces, transmitted from London’s Broadcasting House, is thought to be the origin of the French resistance movement. The influence of his speeches cemented the future role of the foreign language output of the BBC World Service as an unofficial diplomatic boon. Wynford Vaughan-Thomas’s live report from a bombing raid on Berlin, 1943 Four years into the war the RAF offered the BBC the chance to send a radio crew on a bombing raid. On 3 September Vaughan-Thomas took to the sky in a Lancaster bomber headed for Berlin. His live account opened up the idea of broadcasts that were not just a sombre list of military positions and casualties. Holocaust: 1979, US TV series Twenty million people, a third of West Germany’s population, watched at least part of this series starring Meryl Streep when it was shown on WDR and 86% of its German audience went on to discuss the issues with friends or family. Many who telephoned the broadcaster afterwards to express their shock were in tears. Dad’s Army, by Jimmy Perry and David Croft, broadcast on the BBC from 1968 to 1977 Half-affectionate and half-parodic, this sitcom about a chaotic Home Guard troop of volunteers serving in Sussex, under imminent threat of German invasion, has proved one of the most enduring narratives of wartime life. It’s still so popular that lost episodes are being reshot with a new cast. Theatre, by Observer critic Susannah Clapp Flare Path, Terence Rattigan, 1941 Written while Rattigan was serving in the RAF: he salvaged a draft of the script when jettisoning stuff from a damaged Sunderland. A group of bomber pilots and their wives are followed over a weekend: in detail, tenderly, with a keen eye for fraudulence and a sharp ear for slang. Tickety boo. Operation Mincemeat, SpitLip, 2019 This spring the new company Spitlip staged a gloriously inventive response to the second world war. Inspired by a singularly preposterous intelligence operation, they created a frisky high-speed musical with a finely varied score and some of the most inventive lyrics of the last 20 years. The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, Bertolt Brecht, 1941 The “parable” plots the career of an imaginary Chicago mobster, who deal in cauliflowers. An allegory of the rise to power of Hitler and the Nazi party, the play embodied some new directions for the theatre: less drawing-room, more political forum; a busting out of the proscenium arch. Bent, Martin Sherman, 1979 A revelatory study of the Nazis’ treatment of homosexuals follows a gay man from hedonism in Weimar to hell in Dachau. The play has been performed in more than 60 countries – and filmed in 1997, with Mick Jagger appearing as a drag queen. South Pacific, Rodgers and Hammerstein, 1949 The Broadway hit features an American nurse stationed on a South Pacific island. Some of the action (such as the courtship of a young Tonkinese girl by a much older serviceman) looks queasy now. But the songs – which include Some Enchanted Evening – linger on. Kindertransport, Diane Samuels, 1993 Samuels drew on the historical experiences of Kindertransport children to imagine the life of a Jewish girl sent from Nazi Germany to be fostered in Manchester. Her study of displacement has since been performed in Japan, Sweden, Germany, Austria, Canada and South Africa. Copenhagen, Michael Frayn, 1998 Set in the occupied Danish capital in 1941, Frayn’s play features human uncertainty and the atomic physics of the period, rewinding its scenes as if to cast doubt on its subject. Michael Blakemore’s crystalline production ushered in a new era of science plays. Soldiers, Rolf Hochhuth, 1967 The play, that found fervent advocates in Kenneth Tynan – and David Irving, debated the saturation bombing of German cities and alleged that Churchill was involved in the murder of the Polish prime minister General Sikorski. Hochhuth was successfully sued for libel by a Polish pilot. Cabaret, Kander and Ebb, 1966 Based on Christopher Isherwood’s novel Goodbye to Berlin, and set in the glitzy grime of the Kit Kat Club, the musical charted the rise of Nazism and at different times starred Judi Dench and Jane Horrocks as Sally Bowles. An Inspector Calls, JB Priestley, 1945 This drawing-room thriller was first staged in the former Soviet Union. In 1992 a ground-breaking (and design-cracking) production by Stephen Daldry, suggested it should be seen not only as reflecting the post-war move to Labour but as prophesying Thatcherism. Chosen by Susannah Clapp Fashion, by historian Amber Butchart “Keep up the morale of the Home Front by preserving a neat appearance,” ran a 1940 Board of Trade slogan in 1940, a reminder that the war infiltrated every aspect of daily life, and that fashion and beauty were part of the battleground. Many trends that proliferate today can be traced back to the 1940s, from workwear to vintage, though personal maintenance is no longer a national duty Britain as a fashion capital The Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers (IncSoc) was established in 1942. It promoted British style and established London as a fashion centre. IncSoc designed luxury export garments to raise money for the war effort and, with the couturier scheme, also created clothing for mass manufacture in what we would now call a high street/high fashion collaboration. Workwear The current trend for boilersuits and jumpsuits owes much to the siren suit – an all-in-one (often with hood) that was functional yet stylish and developed to be worn during an air raid. Even Churchill wore them. Vintage Secondhand clothing was not rationed, so the rag trade thrived. Not yet called “vintage”, pre-owned clothes helped people negotiate wartime restrictions (in place from 1941 to 1949). This is where the slogan “Make Do and Mend” came from, a phrase firmly back in fashion today. Slogan clothing Mayfair-based company Jacqmar created silk scarves emblazoned with propaganda prints, ranging from “Salvage your rubber” to “Free French” (a reference to General de Gaulle’s rallying speech and the Free French army). Grooming “Make up is cherished, a last desperately defended luxury,” wrote Vogue in 1942. Beauty became part of the call to arms as women were encouraged to keep morale high on the home front through a neat appearance. Helena Rubinstein created a lipstick shade called Regimental Red. Food, by historian Polly Russell Despite nostalgic rhetoric that suggests Britons merrily coped with 14 years of rationing, the reality was grim. The war had a long-lasting and, arguably, devastating impact on British food. Restaurants and hotels stopped training chefs, the variety of food was severely limited and, for good reason, quantity was prioritised over quality. The population became so fed up with the situation that one of the contributing factors for Labour losing the 1951 election was people’s frustration with continuing food shortages. Overall the war transformed food production and had a huge impact on the nation’s diet, changing tastes and attitudes as well as introducing a number of new foods still familiar today. Spam From the Boer war to the first world war “bully” beef was the meat enjoyed or, more likely, endured by soldiers. But during the second world war another tinned meat took centre stage. Invented in Minnesota in 1937 by Jay C Hormel, Spam was easy to transport, long-lasting and cheap. Introduced to Britain in 1941, it was widely adopted by the forces and civilians alike. By the 1950s Spam fritters and Spam, eggs and chips had become British staples. Coca-Cola American soldiers were paid more than five times as much. They arrived in the UK with chewing gum, stockings, cash and the ultimate sign of American culture, Coca-Cola. When America joined the war in 1941, company president Robert Woodruff ordered that “every man in uniform gets a bottle of Coca-Cola for five cents, wherever he is…” By the end of the war, Britain had gained a taste for coke – and the glamour it symbolised. Instant coffee In 1901 a Japanese chemist in Chicago invented instant coffee and first world war American military personnel were downing on average 36lb of the stuff a year. US soldiers stationed in the UK introduced tea-drinking Brits to instant coffee during the second world war. By the end of the 1940s tea was still the national drink but instant coffee was coming up on the inside. Margarine Margarine was invented in 1869 thanks to a competition set by French emperor Napoleon III to invent a butter replacement. It was seen as a solution to food shortages. It was cheap to produce and longer lasting than butter – the ultimate industrial food product. During the war it was included in rations and so became a kitchen staple. Despite its widespread adoption, however, it was always associated with poverty and culinary compromise. Only in the 1970s and 1980s, with dubious health claims made about its benefits for weight loss, did its reputation rise. Cheese The story of the war and cheese is one of regional culinary traditions being all but destroyed. In the first decade of the 20th century the UK had more than 3,500 farmhouse cheese-makers. By the end of the second world war there were around 100. The Ministry of Food policy during the war stipulated that only one type of cheese could be made – by all accounts a bland cheddar mass produced in factories. For decades decent cheese in the UK was all but limited to French imports but in the 1990s, thanks to collapsing milk prices, a new generation of dairy farmers revived regional cheese production. Science, by Observer science editor Robin McKie Winston Churchill was a keen reader of scientific works, including books by Darwin and HG Wells. He liaised closely with scientists as wartime leader – mainly through his contact with Frederick Lindermann, his chief scientific adviser. Churchill was also fervently pro-American and constantly tried to get US industry to support British scientific ideas, a task that became much easier after Pearl Harbor. Radio astronomy The first practical radar system was produced in 1935 by the British physicist Sir Robert Watson-Watt. By 1939 the UK had established a chain of radar stations along its coasts to detect incoming bomber planes. The system played a key role in the Battle of Britain. Two scientists, Tony Hewish and Martin Ryle, both worked on developing radar and used the technology to pioneer the field of radio astronomy, opening up a new way to investigate the heavens. Penicillin The world’s first antibiotic was discovered by British researcher Alexander Fleming in 1928. Attempts to mass produce penicillin failed until the outbreak of war when efforts began in earnest. Patients were first treated with the drug in 1942. By the end of the war more than 600 billion units were manufactured each year. The pharmaceutical industry remains one of Britain’s key revenue earners. Nuclear power In 1940 scientists Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch at Birmingham University realised a critical mass of uranium-235 would explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite, prompting Britain to create an atomic bomb project, known as Tube Alloys. After the US entered the war, the UK decided to shelve this and participate in the American programme, the Manhattan project. After the war, Britain established the world’s first civil nuclear programme. The UK now has 15 reactors generating about 21% of its electricity, although almost half of this capacity is to be retired by 2025. Computers British codebreakers deciphered many of Germany’s messages from the start of the second world war. However, this work was boosted by the development in 1943 of Colossus, the world’s first programmable, electronic, digital computer. These machines – installed at Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes – played a crucial role in unravelling the plans of German generals after the Allied landings in Normandy in June 1944. All information on the Colossus was kept classified and the machines were destroyed. It was only relatively recently that the scientists involved have been mentioned publicly. This secrecy proved a key factor in Britain’s failure to develop computers commercially. Music, by Observer critic Fiona Maddocks Michael Tippett (UK), A Child of Our Time, 1939-41 Begun on 4 September 1939, the day after the declaration of war, Tippett wrote this grand choral work initially as a reaction to the violence of Kristallnacht in 1938, when German Nazis attacked Jewish people and their properties. It was premiered at the Adelphi Theatre, London on 19 March 1944. Olivier Messiaen (France), Quatuor pour la fin du temps, 1940 Messiaen wrote his Quartet for the End of Time while held prisoner in a German war camp, Stalag VIII-A. For piano, cello, clarinet and violin, it was first performed by the composer and fellow prisoners, outdoors in the cold to guards and inmates, on 15 January 1941. Dmitri Shostakovich (Russia), Leningrad Symphony, 1941 Shostakovich’s epic was officially written in response to Germany’s invasion of Russia but he said the symphony “is not about Leningrad under siege. It’s about the Leningrad that Stalin destroyed and that Hitler merely finished off.” Played by a depleted orchestra of sick and starving musicians, it was performed in Leningrad in August 1942 when the city was still under siege. Aaron Copland (USA), Fanfare for the Common Man, 1942 Inspired by President Henry A Wallace’s 1942 speech heralding the “century of the common man”, Copland composed the Fanfare as a response to American entering World War Two. He and other composers were commissioned to write stirring fanfares in honour of servicemen and women, as a contribution to the war effort. Richard Strauss (Germany), Metamorphosen, 1945 Composed in the final months of war, Richard Strauss’s elegy for 23 solo strings is thought - the composer did not specify - to commemorate the bombing of the three cities he most loved, Munich, Dresden and Berlin, and specifically the destruction of their opera houses, where so many of his own works had been premiered. Maurice Duruflé (France), Requiem, 1941-47 During the pro-Nazi Vichy government (1940-44), artists benefited from official commissions, part of a propaganda programme to highlight French culture. Durufle accepted one in 1941, eventually submitting the invoice in 1948. He was a slow worker, but may also have felt compromised by the political stigma of Vichy. The much-loved Requiem became a mainstay of Armistice Day services in France. Zoltan Kodaly (Hungary), Missa Brevis, 1945 Subtitled “tempore belli” (time of war), this work for organ and mixed choir was born of difficult times: in the siege of Budapest in the winter of 1944/45, Kodály had to take refuge in the cellars of the Budapest Opera House. The first performance, in February 1945 with gunfire in the street, was given in a cloakroom in the Opera House. It’s official premiere was at the Three Choirs Festival, Worcester, in 1948. Erich Korngold (Austria), Violin Concerto, 1945 The Viennese-born Korngold, a prominent composer in the golden age of Hollywood, left Europe in 1934 with the rise of the Nazi regime, abandoning concert work in favour of film scores. He maintained he would not return to writing concert music until Hitler was defeated. This lush, lyrical concerto in effect marked that event. Arnold Schoenberg (Austria-US), A Survivor from Warsaw, 1947 By now an emigre living in Los Angeles, and close to the end of his life, Schoenberg wrote A Survivor from Warsaw, for narrator, men’s chorus and orchestra, as a commemoration of Holocaust victims. It tells the story, faithful more in psychology and spirit than in factual accuracy, of a survivor from the Warsaw ghetto. Benjamin Britten (UK), War Requiem, 1962 Britten’s Requiem mass setting, interspersed with war poems by Wilfred Owen, was written for the opening of the new Coventry Cathedral, after bombing destroyed the original 14th-century structure. Britten intended the premiere to include a German and Russian soloist. The Soviets would not comply, but the War Requiem is valued worldwide as a work of European reconciliation. Chosen by Fiona Maddocks Dates are period of composition, not of premieres Film, by Observer critic Wendy Ide Army of Shadows, 1969 Jean-Pierre Melville, a former member of the French Resistance, brings his muscular approach to this superb portrait of the ordinary men and women who fought covertly against the Nazi occupation. No empty heroics here, just a bone deep melancholy and impossible choices. Saving Private Ryan, 1998 There is arguably no greater piece of combat cinema than the first 24 minutes of Steven Spielberg’s drama. The audience is plunged into the visceral terror Normandy landings through hand-held camera and immersive sound design. Come And See, 1985 Set in Belarus in 1943, this child’s eye view of the evils of the occupying Nazis is a portrait of innocence destroyed but spirit unbroken. A devastatingly powerful indictment of war. Son of Saul, 2015 The daring drama set in a concentration camp follows an inmate’s desperate quest to secure a Jewish burial for his dead child. The immersive approach is tough going, but breathlessly tense. Downfall, 2004 The film that spawned a thousand Hitler memes is an uncompromising, superbly acted account of the final days of the Third Reich. Claustrophobic and unflinching in its gaze, the film forces the acknowledgement that it was ordinary people rather than monsters who perpetrated Nazi war crimes. Bridge On the River Kwai, 1957 David Lean’s stirring drama, set in a Japanese internment camp, explores the complexities of war and of the characters of the men caught in the cross hairs. Alec Guinness plays the British colonel who turns forced labour into a morale building exercise for his men. Grave of the Fireflies, 1988 This achingly sad animation from Studio Ghibli follows two Japanese children struggling to survive at the tail end of the war. Strikingly beautiful and profoundly affecting, it’s a landmark both in animation and in war film. Schindler’s List, 1993 Liam Neeson plays the opportunistic industrialist who gradually awakens to the plight of his Jewish work force. Steven Spielberg’s humanist approach to the horror of the holocaust, and the themes of redemption and courage, make this one of the more accessible second world war movies. Casablanca, 1942 Romance set against the backdrop of war has rarely been as photogenic as it is in this classic picture which captures the restless tension of being displaced by war, the sense of normal life somehow suspended. Shoah, 1985 It’s more than nine hours in length, But there’s not a minute in Claude Lanzmann’s monumental documentary which isn’t essential. This haunting film is perhaps the most important account of the war ever made. Children’s books, by critic Fiona Noble Carrie’s War, Nina Bawden, 1973 The reality of war for many British children was life far from their families as evacuees, beautifully captured in this evocative but unsentimental adventure. Letters From the Lighthouse, Emma Carrol, 2017 A gripping mystery is combined with a well-observed tale of evacuee life. Themes of prejudice and refugees resonate strongly with current events. Once, Morris Gleitzman, 2005 The horror of the Holocaust unfolds through the eyes of child narrator Felix, in the first of a powerful sequence of novels which stretch from 1942 to the present day. The Lion and the Unicorn, Shirley Hughes, 1998 The emotional impact of a child’s wartime experiences, from fear and loneliness to bravery and courage, are explored in Hughes’s classic picture book. When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit, Judith Kerr, 1971 This semi-autobiographical novel is the first in a trilogy following Anna and her middle-class Jewish family as they flee Nazi Germany and become refugees.

In Sam Mills’s 2012 novel, The Quiddity of Will Self, a man is asked if he has read any of Self’s books. “No, I haven’t,” he replies, “I’ve just – well, read about him, seen him on telly … ” Unlike Amis, it sometimes appears that Self prefers being treated more as a phenomenon than as an author. Might he believe that the novel is dying (of which more later)? Or does he simply love the limelight, and think that if it isn’t a book putting him in it, then a Radio 4 broadcast or a TV appearance will have to do the job? Whatever the case, Will Self is indisputably great at being Will Self. A year before Self interviewed Amis, the day before Tony Blair became Labour party leader, a creative writing graduate called Matthew Humphreys moved into the remote Suffolk cottage where Self, who had split up with his first wife and left his family, was living. Over the next six months Humphreys changed his name to De Abaitua, experienced some kind of breakdown, and received “courses of instruction” from Self on everything from writing to eating oysters to the consumption of drink and drugs. “Never try to keep up with me,” Self tells De Abaitua one night. “I’ve been doing this for a long time.” De Abaitua is a good storyteller, and his book gives us precisely the Self we might hope for: “Never underestimate the importance of a pickled egg,” he sternly informs a chip shop queue. He takes potshots with an air rifle, undertakes obsessive cross-country walks and mutilates himself. “I’ve been scratching at my face all night,” he says. “Opiates give me image horror. Now my face is infected.” He also takes “the Sizewell cure”, which involves swimming in the tropically warm waters surrounding the nuclear power station. These sections of the book are excellent, possessing a feverish hilarity that owes a debt, as De Abaitua acknowledges, to Withnail and I. Problems only emerge when Self isn’t around. At one point he disappears to Brazil for nearly 50 pages and is sorely missed. In his absence we get the De Abaitua family history, and it becomes apparent that Self &amp; I is actually a memoir about De Abaitua’s path to becoming a writer, his time with Self being merely the most noteworthy part of it. Given De Abaitua’s relative obscurity – he calls himself a “literary footnote” – it is understandable that this is not quite how the book is presented. Nevertheless he does have some interesting things to say about writing, both his own and Self’s, and his descriptions of what he gets up to in his boss’s absence are engaging (although certain episodes, such as his axe murder of a pheasant, feel invented). He is also good on 1990s literary London, but lengthy accounts of his early years drag, and give the book a lopsided quality. The Self that De Abaitua describes emerges as self-obsessed and sometimes prima donna-ish, but on this evidence others with far less fame have behaved far less well. In fact, for all his spikiness and withering put-downs, Self comes across as a fundamentally decent person. Which doesn’t mean he isn’t expert at angering others. As I was writing this review, an interview was published in which he described the novel as “absolutely doomed”. The social media backlash was immediate and fierce, although in fairness it wasn’t news: it’s a drum he’s been banging since at least 2014. Assuming Self is in earnest (“I’ve always enjoyed bullshitting people,” he told the Paris Review in 2012), perhaps the reason he believes the novel is dying is because his books, as De Abaitua discusses, are written in response to existing works. Great Apes is Planet of the Apes via Kafka’s “A Report to an Academy”. Dorian updates Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray; Walking to Hollywood is Selfian Sebald, right down to the grainy photos. In the trilogy that began in 2012 with Umbrella and ended last year with Phone, he has taken on Ulysses and high modernism. For a white male writer of a certain age, what further peaks remain? Looked at this way it is the Self novel that’s dead, not the novel in toto, and he is merely making the mistake of universalising his individual experience (which, of course, is something novelists do all the time). His next project isn’t fiction but a memoir about his formative years as a writer. Perhaps if there’s a sequel he will revisit the months spent in a Suffolk cottage in 1994. Or perhaps enough has been said about that already. Chris Power’s short story collection, Mothers, is published by Faber. Self &amp; I by Matthew De Abaitua (Eye Books, £14.99).

The government claims the new plant will be relied on to deliver 7% of the UK’s electricity while providing a low-cost, low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels. But not everyone agrees, with critics arguing that the plants will be expensive to build and questioning whether nuclear energy represents a safe, clean and cost-effective energy future. The Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester played host to a public debate as part of the Manchester Science Festival in which four expert panellists debated the motion: Nuclear power, yes please. These were some of their thoughts: Four reasons why nuclear is the answer: 1. Britain has led the way in developing nuclear technology Dr Fiona Rayment, director of Fuel Cycle Solutions, argued that Britain should be proud of its leading role in developing nuclear technology since the first generation of reactors were introduced in the 1950s and 60s. “We’re actually at a stage where six decades on we’re at the third generation of nuclear reactors across the world and the UK has led the way in a lot of that reactor technology,” she said. “I actually believe that nuclear power is a reliable, secure and clean technology for the current and the future.” 2. Energy demands are set to increase With the majority of the UK’s energy still produced with fossil fuels, the government faces big challenges if it is to cut carbon emissions while continuing to meet growing energy demands in the future. “When you think about the fact that energy includes electricity, heat and transport … some projections say that by 2050 that [demand] is going to increase by about three-fold,” said Rayment. Professor of radiochemistry Francis Livens, Dalton Nuclear Institute, University of Manchester, agreed: “You need vastly more energy than we have and you don’t have that many ways of getting large amounts of energy reliably, on tap, in quantity.” 3. More reliable and efficient than renewables Livens stressed that although he was not uncritical of nuclear technology, it was the “least worst option” under the circumstances. “There are renewables, certainly,” he said, “but you have big questions about their reliability and ability to deliver huge quantities of energy that would be implied by giving much more energy to the majority of the world.” Rayment agreed: “We have to put things in context. You have to have 1,000 windmills to actually be equivalent to one nuclear power plant,” she told the audience. 4. Britain’s nuclear regulation is second to none Although the nuclear industry has been blighted by a history of disasters, such as Chernobyl and Fukushima, the panellists in favour of the motion reassured the audience that Britain has a world-leading reputation when it comes to regulating the industry. “With any industry we need to have the right level of regulation and safety is of the upmost importance. Our regulatory body in the UK is highly regarded throughout the world,” said Rayment. And four reasons why it’s not … 1. Hinkley Point deal is prohibitively expensive Speaking against the motion, the Guardian’s environment editor John Vidal described the Chinese project at Hinkley Point a “rotten deal” pointing out that no completion date has yet been declared and that electricity produced by the plant is likely to be expensive. “This is the most expensive project [of its kind] that Britain has ever approached … The only people who can afford it are the Chinese government and the French government. We can’t afford it so we have to go elsewhere,” he said. 2. Nuclear waste In 1980 Manchester became the first city to become a ‘nuclear free zone’ following a resolution passed by the council that banned the storage of nuclear waste in the area. Local Labour councillor Grace Fletcher-Hackwood warned the audience that there is no adequate way of getting rid of nuclear waste once it’s been produced. Responding to whether nuclear should form part of Britain’s future energy mix she said: “When no policy currently exists for the waste that has been produced over the last 60 years you have to wonder whether we shouldn’t first sort out our nuclear past.” 3. Renewable technology has come on in leaps and bounds When it comes to renewables, the UK is lagging behind European competitors such as Germany which is phasing out its nuclear reactors and where renewables already produce nearly 30% of electricity supply. Vidal argued that while renewable energy may have been in its infancy 10 years ago, today the sector is witnessing a technological revolution: “Battery technologies are changing and may hold the future for storage, which is fantastically exciting. Wind energy is now cheaper than all other sources put together. If just one-tenth of the research money which is put into nuclear were put into renewable energy we know perfectly well we would have a different world.” 4. Chernobyl-style disasters a real danger Over several decades there have been dozens of serious accidents at nuclear power stations around the world. According to a recently published peer-reviewed statistical analysis of global nuclear accidents, there is a 50:50 chance we will see another Chernobyl incident within the next 50 years. “China is building 400 new nuclear reactors. More than 200 of these are in seismically dangerous areas. Most of these are facing the sea and with sea levels rising we know what’s going to happen,” warned Vidal.

The threat of blackouts has receded for this winter after scares earlier in the year, National Grid said on Friday, citing a reprieve for Yorkshire’s Eggborough coal-fired power station, as well as greater flexibility from companies with big energy requirements. But the respite will be brief unless further action is taken, warned parliament’s energy and climate change select committee. The MPs recommend investment in two major areas: on the supply side, energy storage; and on the demand side, efficiency technologies that smooth out peaks in usage, for instance by switching devices off and on and running them at lower power at times. Angus MacNeil, chair of the committee, said: “The government must get a move on and encourage the energy market to embrace smart technological solutions like energy storage and demand-side response. There is an incredible opportunity for the UK to become a world leader in these disruptive technologies, yet our current energy security subsidies favour dirty diesel generation over smart new clean tech solutions.” The committee also called for sweeping reforms to the government’s regulation of the energy market, which include a “capacity market” for ensuring there is sufficient electricity supply and contracts awarded to suppliers through an auction. While these systems were supposed to reward renewable energy companies and reduce the carbon emitted by electricity generation, in practice some of the main beneficiaries have been generators using diesel oil, which is one of the dirtiest forms of generation but very flexible. Redrawing these regulations could benefit cleaner generation such as wind farms and solar power, as well as newer technologies such as large-scale batteries and systems to manage energy, called demand-side response. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, backed the call for reform: “This report from a cross-party group of MPs is an urgent wake-up call for Theresa May’s government. It’s embarrassing that Britain, one of the world’s leading economies, has to hand out taxpayer-funded subsidies to clunking old coal plants and highly polluting diesel generators to keep the lights on. The right mix of renewable energy, battery storage and efficiency measures offers a much better alternative.” The technology available to manage demand and increase efficiency is growing fast, according to Friends of the Earth, and the cost of it is also falling. But government support – such as reforms of the current regulations – would increase its uptake, with beneficial effects. Simon Bullock, campaigner at the charity, said: “[These technologies] are a massive economic opportunity for the UK. They’re essential to build the smart, flexible, clean electricity grid we need in the 2020s, and they reduce our reliance on fossil fuel plants for backup power, and can help lower people’s bills.” Companies involved in demand-side response technology say that, after decades of development, it is now at a stage where it can play a big role in energy efficiency, which will help to reduce demands on electricity supply. Patrick Liddy, director of EnerNOC, one of the companies developing such tools, said: “Demand-side response technology is mature [and] provides many benefits for the UK, including engaging heavy energy users such as factories, commercial property and public sector estates in keeping the network balanced. Current UK energy policy was originally written with generation in mind, so it’s only right that now we have the demand-side technology available, [the UK should] evolve our approach.” The report, entitled The Energy Revolution and Future Challenges for UK Energy and Climate Policy, is the last from the energy and climate change committee. The latter will be dissolved and future reports on energy and climate change will come from the committee that reports on the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). That will mean far fewer parliamentary reports on the UK’s energy and climate change policies than in the past, as the new BEIS committee will have a far broader remit, covering all of the UK’s industry, business and commerce. Past reports, from a cross-party committee of MPs that was until last year chaired by a Conservative former minister, have often criticised government policy. In the report, the MPs also warn that the risks of Brexit to the UK’s energy supply must be taken into account as a high priority. They highlight, for instance, the risk that collective EU systems will be discarded - for instance, a collective agreement to help any nation at risk from a sudden shortage in gas supply, such as that which might be threatened from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. A spokesperson for BEIS, responding to the committee’s findings, said: “The capacity market ensures that our families have a secure energy supply at a fair price that they can rely on. “We are fully committed to a low carbon energy future and the potential benefits that new technologies such as storage could bring to this. However, for the capacity market to work effectively it relies on flexible technology that is ready to be deployed”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/23/sweden-summons-chinese-ambassador-over-kidnapping-of-gui-minhai","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T03:00:56Z","webTitle":"Bookseller kidnap: China hints Swedish diplomats broke laws","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/23/sweden-summons-chinese-ambassador-over-kidnapping-of-gui-minhai","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/23/sweden-summons-chinese-ambassador-over-kidnapping-of-gui-minhai","fields":{"headline":"Bookseller kidnap: China hints Swedish diplomats broke laws","bodyText":"China has attempted to deflect international criticism over its alleged abduction of the Swedish bookseller Gui Minhai by insinuating that two Swedish diplomats who were with him when he was taken had violated unspecified laws. Gui, a Hong Kong publisher who dealt in melodramatic tomes about China’s political elite, was taking a train to Beijing on Saturday morning, apparently to attend a medical examination at the Swedish embassy, when he was detained by about 10 plainclothes officers. It was the second time in just over two years that Gui, 53, had been seized by Chinese agents. In October 2015, he vanished from his Thai holiday home, later resurfacing in detention in China where he made what supporters denounced as a forced televised confession. Gui had seemed on the verge of release last autumn. Reports at the time had said he was “half-free” and living under surveillance, but this week’s development has shattered hopes that he would be properly freed. On Tuesday, China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, faced a barrage of questions over Gui at a press briefing in Beijing, held as Sweden’s foreign minister, Margot Wallström, summoned China’s ambassador over the incident. Hua said she had no information about the missing bookseller’s case, claiming it was outside of the foreign ministry’s remit. She urged reporters to contact “the competent authorities” but declined to say who they were. “I don’t see what the point of asking this question is,” she told journalists. Pressed on whether China’s public security ministry could shed light on Gui’s whereabouts, Hua asked a reporter from the New York Times: “What do you think? How long have you been in China?” She also hinted that the Swedish diplomats who were with Gui when he was taken had committed an unspecified offence. “We hope that any foreigners in China, including foreign diplomats, can observe international and Chinese laws.” Sweden’s foreign ministry offered no immediate response to that suggestion but confirmed Wallström had received China’s ambassador on Tuesday after telling reporters Sweden had detailed knowledge of Saturday’s events and was “working round the clock” on the issue. “The situation has now worsened since Saturday morning,” Wallström admitted. Criticism of China’s actions – and Stockholm’s so far timid public response to Gui’s ordeal - intensified after reports of his latest detention. “This was precisely what wasn’t supposed to happen,” the bookseller’s daughter, Angela Gui, told the Guardian. “I think it is quite clear that he has been abducted again and that he’s being held somewhere at a secret location,” she added in an interview with Radio Sweden. In an editorial entitled “Is there anything China won’t get away with?”, Sweden’s Borås Tidning newspaper said it was time to stand up to a bullying Beijing: “The scariest part of the news about the Swedish publisher isn’t so much that Chinese authorities have caught him again but the arrogance the manner of his arrest demonstrates to the rest of the world.” It said: “This is a new China that we see; a China which, with its ever-growing tentacles, wants to build a huge port in Lysekil [in Sweden] … which builds nuclear power plants in the UK, which wants to build an Arctic highway from Norway to Moscow … a China that is not afraid of the diplomatic repercussions that may arise from grabbing a Swedish book publisher in front of the employees of Margot Wallström.” Diplomats and observers say that under Xi Jinping Beijing has become increasingly deaf to foreign criticism, wagering cash-hungry governments will not challenge its actions. “There is really a new, harsher tone in their approach. It wasn’t like this a few years ago,” said one western diplomat who declined to be named. “I think they’ve become over-confident and are overplaying their hand,” the diplomat added. “And there is an increasing pushback from all over the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/14/my-partner-convinced-me-of-the-facts-readers-on-changing-their-opinion-on-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T11:43:49Z","webTitle":"'My partner convinced me of the facts': readers on changing their opinion on climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/14/my-partner-convinced-me-of-the-facts-readers-on-changing-their-opinion-on-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/14/my-partner-convinced-me-of-the-facts-readers-on-changing-their-opinion-on-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"'My partner convinced me of the facts': readers on changing their opinion on climate change","bodyText":"‘My partner convinced me of the facts of climate change’: Joshua, 28, Florida, US I first thought it was fake as I used to watch Fox News with my family. In 2015 I met my partner Stephen who knew that the facts of climate change couldn’t be ignored. He took it upon himself to try to convince me. We started watching documentaries on the subject on Netflix. The first documentary that caught my attention was Cowspiracy directed by Kip Andersen and Keegan Kuhn. This documentary really hit home and I even wrote an essay on it. Then came What the Health by the same directors. After we watched the movie Stephen and I turned to an all plant-based diet. We have our ups and downs on staying true to our new lifestyle change, but we always keep in mind that for every burger we don’t eat that is 660 gallons of water that we are saving for others in need. I was lucky enough that Stephen took the time and saw that if I could see the issues I would see that the facts are true. ‘I read scientific papers and it became obvious the sceptic claims made no sense’: Harri Haanpää, 45, Siuntio, Finland As a graduate student in the early 2000s, I did not really have an opinion on the matter but the debate raised my curiosity. So when some of the prominent sceptical websites made claims about some scientific papers, I searched for the papers online and checked for myself. It soon became quite obvious that the sceptic claims made no sense whatsoever. So I became politically active and I’ve now been active in the Finnish Green party for 10 years. ‘Visits to museums and exhibitions helped me learn about climate change’: Ray, Hong Kong Climate change seemed like a questionable thing to me at first and now it’s not. What made me change my mind is several news articles and blogs that I’ve read up on the internet as well as visits to museums and exhibitions. It was informative and introduced aspects such as rising temperatures, rising seas, extreme weather events and risks that we as a community face. I believe it will help people understand how serious the situation is and I would like to encourage the community to visit museums and learn about climate change. Given everything I have been told, my belief in climate change has gone from weak to very strong even if I still have many questions. After learning about how bad this can really get, it not only changed whether or not I believed in it, but also made me worry more and more. I now understand that I must try to do things that benefit the environment but at the same time I must also understand that I can’t save the world. ‘Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth was an eye-opener’: Annette Bejany, 51, Beirut, Lebanon I was a teenager when President Ronald Reagan reassured us that global warming was all part of a natural, cyclical process - not dangerous and not caused by humans. Being a young, naive Republican, I believed him. When Al Gore’s documentary An inconvenient Truth came out in theatres, I would never have considered going to see it if I hadn’t become angry about Bush’s decision to invade Iraq and cynical about the Republicans’ lip service to Christian values. The movie was an eye-opener to say the least. Now I am a Green Party member, try to live a zero waste life, I’m nearly vegan and read up on climate change issues in the news on a regular basis. I agree 100% with Pope Francis’ encyclical on the environment that fighting climate change is a moral imperative for social justice and that it is a grave sin to be tyrants rather than stewards of the earth. ‘Other factors are more important than the ones stated by the IPCC’: Guy, UK I believe that the climate is changing, but I now think that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s view on the importance of CO2 is significantly overstated. I assumed that mainstream science was right and agree that burning fossil fuels is generally harmful and should be reduced if possible. However, after researching more about the factors effecting our climate I am of the opinion that other factors are more important than the IPCC stated factors. The sun and solar magnetic flux, plus the ocean currents are much more significant than stated by some scientist and the press. I also see significant data manipulation and misinformation (from both sides) so finding good independent sources of information is hard. I check published ‘hard data’ against obvious proxy data to see if it agrees, and too often it doesn’t. I think climate science has become political (understandable given the consequences) which means normal scientific debate is not happening as it should. ‘There are far more urgent ecological or environmental concerns, such as land management, ocean management’: William Handler, 45, Ontario, Canada I used to think climate change was a serious problem but now I think it has been overblown. As a research physicist I looked at research first hand and came to the conclusion that the modelling of climate is not particularly good. Catastrophic predictions are silly. Global warming is real but not as serious as portrayed in the press. The probable total effect on the climate due to people is nothing to worry about compared to other, far more urgent ecological or environmental concerns, such as land management, ocean management, invasive species etc. Also, regardless of the actual reality of catastrophic global warming the actual actions taken have been ridiculous, futile, expensive and have had no impact on CO2 production in any meaningful way. If predictions made in the 90s had been true, the only solution was to use the already developed, reliable, cheap nuclear power and to get India, China and African countries using it. Instead people are burning fuel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/may/02/alarm-sounded-over-delays-to-develop-uk-mini-nuclear-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-02T10:58:50Z","webTitle":"Alarm sounded over delays to develop UK mini nuclear reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/02/alarm-sounded-over-delays-to-develop-uk-mini-nuclear-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/may/02/alarm-sounded-over-delays-to-develop-uk-mini-nuclear-reactors","fields":{"headline":"Alarm sounded over delays to develop UK mini nuclear reactors","bodyText":"The government’s failure to deliver on a multimillion-pound competition to develop mini atomic power stations has hurt the nuclear sector and risks international companies walking away from the UK, a Lords committee has warned. In 2015 the then chancellor George Osborne promised £250m over five years for a nuclear research and development programme, an undisclosed sum of which was for a competition to pave the way for small modular reactors. These reactors are much smaller than conventional nuclear plants with a capacity of less than 300MW – or a 10th of what Hinkley Point C should provide. But the government has failed to even publish results of the first phase of the competition, expected last autumn, which the Lords science and technology committee said was “particularly alarming”. “This has had a negative effect on the nuclear sector in the UK and if the government does not act soon the necessary high level of industrial interest will not be maintained,” they said in a report on Tuesday. The peers urged ministers to publish their plans for small modular reactors (SMRs) without delay, and scolded the government for not showing any urgency to make a decision. The UK and US are vying to attract the companies and supply chains to research, develop and build small modular reactors. The industry argues they could be quicker and cheaper to build than normal nuclear power stations, partly by being prefabricated in factories. Rolls-Royce, which is bidding for a slice of the competition funding, told the Lords it hoped to deploy a small modular reactor in the UK by 2028 if it had government backing. The company is competing with Chinese state firm CNNC, US firm NuScale and the US-Japanese partnership GE-Hitachi. Toshiba’s US nuclear arm Westinghouse was also among the bidders but is now unlikely to proceed after filing for bankruptcy in March. Newcastle-based Penultimate Power UK, which hopes to capitalise on the market, told the committee that a lack of clarity from government had paralysed development of nuclear power generation technology. “Without urgent action the window of opportunity for meaningful participation will soon close,” the company said. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), said he shared the committee’s frustration and the competition had been “left hanging in the air”, with the roadmap for the reactors “lost somewhere in Whitehall”. Trawsfynydd in Wales, the site of a former nuclear power station, has been pitched by the Welsh government as a potential site for the UK’s first SMR, because of its transport and power links, and skilled former nuclear workers. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “The government recognises the potential of small modular reactors to help meet our energy and climate change challenges at a lower cost.” Government officials said earlier this year that one of the attractions of mini nuclear power stations was they fitted with the industrial strategy launched by Theresa May. But Tom Wintle, deputy director at the business department, said they had to provide affordable power. “SMRs will need to deliver energy cost-competitively if they are to play a part in the UK’s future energy mix. As well as securing low-carbon energy, government is also committed to keeping down the cost of that energy for consumers, so there is a key challenge there for the nuclear industry as a whole and for SMRs,” he told an industry conference."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/sep/07/former-japan-pm-junichiro-koizumi-accuses-abe-lying-over-fukushima-pledge","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-07T11:15:16Z","webTitle":"Former Japan PM accuses Abe of lying over Fukushima pledge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/07/former-japan-pm-junichiro-koizumi-accuses-abe-lying-over-fukushima-pledge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/sep/07/former-japan-pm-junichiro-koizumi-accuses-abe-lying-over-fukushima-pledge","fields":{"headline":"Former Japan PM accuses Abe of lying over Fukushima pledge","bodyText":"Japan’s former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi has labelled the country’s current leader, Shinzo Abe, a “liar” for telling the international community that the situation at the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant is under control. Koizumi, who became one of Japan’s most popular postwar leaders during his 2001-06 premiership, has used his retirement from frontline politics to become a leading campaigner against nuclear restarts in Japan in defiance of Abe, a fellow conservative Liberal Democratic party (LDP) politician who was once regarded as his natural successor. Abe told members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in Buenos Aires in September 2013 that the situation at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was “under control”, shortly before Tokyo was awarded the 2020 Games. IOC officials were concerned by reports about the huge build-up of contaminated water at the Fukushima site, more than two years after the disaster forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents. “When [Abe] said the situation was under control, he was lying,” Koizumi told reporters in Tokyo. “It is not under control,” he added, noting the problems the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), has experienced with a costly subterranean ice wall that is supposed to prevent groundwater from flowing into the basements of the damaged reactors, where it becomes highly contaminated. “They keep saying they can do it, but they can’t,” Koizumi said. He went on to claim that Abe had been fooled by industry experts who claim that nuclear is the safest, cleanest and cheapest form of energy for resource-poor Japan. “He believes what he’s being told by nuclear experts,” Koizumi said. “I believed them, too, when I was prime minister. I think Abe understands the arguments on both sides of the debate, but he has chosen to believe the pro-nuclear lobby.” After the Fukushima crisis, Koizumi said he had “studied the process, reality and history of the introduction of nuclear power, and became ashamed of myself for believing such lies”. Abe has pushed for the restart of Japan’s nuclear reactors, while the government says it wants nuclear to account for a fifth of Japan’s total energy mix by 2030. Just three of the country’s dozens of nuclear reactors are in operation, and two will be taken offline later this year for maintenance. Koizumi, 74, has also thrown his support behind hundreds of US sailors and marines who claim they developed leukaemia and other serious health problems after being exposed to Fukushima radiation plumes while helping with relief operations – nicknamed Operation Tomodachi (friend) – following the 11 March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. In 2012 the service personnel launched a lawsuit accusing Tepco of failing to prevent the accident and of lying about the levels of radiation from the stricken reactors, putting US personnel at risk. Most of the 400 plaintiffs were aboard the USS Ronald Reagan, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier that was anchored off Japan’s north-east coast while helicopters flew emergency supplies to survivors of the tsunami, which killed almost 19,000 people. Medical experts, however, said the sailors would have received only small, non-harmful doses of radiation; a US defence department report published in 2014 said no link had been established between the sailors’ health problems and their exposure to low doses of Fukushima radiation. Koizumi, who met several of the sick servicemen in San Diego in May, plans to raise $1m by the end of next March to help cover the sailors’ medical expenses. “I felt I had to do something to help those who worked so hard for Japan,” he said. “That won’t be enough money, but at least it will show that Japan is grateful for what they did for us.” Despite his opposition to Abe’s pro-nuclear policies, Koizumi was complimentary about his performance as prime minister during his second time in office in the past decade. “As far as nuclear power is concerned, we are totally at odds,” Koizumi said. “But I think he’s reflected on the mistakes he made during his first time as leader and is doing a much better job second time around.” In political longevity terms, Abe’s performance could hardly be worse. He resigned in September 2007 after less than a year in office, following a series of ministerial scandals, a debilitating bowel condition and a disastrous performance by the LDP in upper house elections."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2018/mar/16/eon-rwe-asset-swap-shakeup-german-energy-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-17T07:51:35Z","webTitle":"Global energy giants forced to adapt to rise of renewables","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/mar/16/eon-rwe-asset-swap-shakeup-german-energy-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2018/mar/16/eon-rwe-asset-swap-shakeup-german-energy-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Global energy giants forced to adapt to rise of renewables","bodyText":"Seven years after an earthquake off Japan’s eastern coast led to three meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station, the aftershocks are still being felt across the world. The latest came last Saturday when E.ON and RWE announced a huge shakeup of the German energy industry, following meetings that ran into the early hours. Under a complex asset and shares swap, E.ON will be reshaped to focus on supplying energy to customers and managing energy grids. The company will leave renewables. RWE will focus on power generation and energy trading, complementing its existing coal and gas power stations with a new portfolio of windfarms that will make it Europe’s third-biggest renewable energy producer. The major change comes two years after both groups split their green and fossil-fuel energy businesses, a result of the plan by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to phase out nuclear by 2022, and also the Energiewende, Germany’s speeded-up transition to renewables after Fukushima. Coming so soon after 2016’s drastic overhaul, last week’s shakeup raises the question of what a successful energy utility looks like in Europe today. How do companies adapt to a world where the rapid growth of renewables pushes down wholesale prices, and the electrification of cars begins to be felt on power grids? Peter Atherton, an analyst at Cornwall Insight, said the deal showed that E.ON and RWE did not get their reorganisation right two years ago. It marks a decisive break with the old, traditional model of a vertically integrated energy company that generates energy, transports it and sells it. In the noughties, the conglomerate model was seen as a way for energy firms to succeed, leading to a wave of mergers. Some, such as Italy’s Enel and Spain’s Iberdrola (ScottishPower’s owner) are still pursuing this “do everything” model. But by and large, companies are being broken up and becoming more specialised. “What you’re certainly seeing is companies taking bets about where the value will be,” said Atherton. RWE argues that today the only way to compete in European government auctions for renewable energy subsidies is to go big. Rolf Martin Schmitz, the group’s chief executive, said: “Critical mass is the key in renewable energy. Before this transaction, neither RWE nor E.ON was in this position.” After the deal, RWE will have around 8GW of renewable capacity and another 5GW in the pipeline, which will together account for 60% of its earnings by 2020. Schmitz also said that a new type of company was needed to thrive in a world where windfarms and other green energy projects would soon have to succeed on market prices, not government subsidies. “Renewables will evolve from a regulated business to market competition,” he said. E.ON, meanwhile, is majoring on supplying people with energy and services, and will grow from 31 million customers to roughly 50 million after the deal. It will also have a much greater proportion of its earnings – 80%, up from 65% – coming from the regulated, lower-return but lower-risk business of energy networks. John Feddersen, chief executive of Aurora Energy Research, said the two firms were going in very different directions, but the path E.ON had taken was less well trodden. “This is to some extent a question of try it and see what works. [For E.ON], owning grids and lobbying government for good regulatory outcomes is a well-understood business. However, the [customer] services side is untried,” he said. The changing nature of power generation in Europe has been felt most keenly in Germany because of the Energiewende, but industry-watchers say the same pattern is driving companies to transform themselves across the continent. In the UK, British Gas owner Centrica is halfway through a sometimes painful reinvention of itself as a customer-centric energy company, divesting its old, large power stations to focus on selling services such as smart heating systems, as well as gas and electricity. The UK’s second-biggest energy firm, SSE, is moving in the opposite direction. It is getting out of domestic energy supply, banking instead on regulated networks and renewable power generation, where prices are guaranteed. The picture is further complicated by the entrance of big oil, which is taking serious steps to diversify out of oil and gas and into the world of energy utilities. Norway’s Statoil last week rebranded itself as Equinor to reflect its transformation into a “broad energy” company that deploys windfarms as well as oil rigs. Shell recently bought the UK’s biggest independent household energy supplier, First Utility, and has also acquired firms in electric car infrastructure. That puts it in direct competition with E.ON, which promised to roll out charging points faster as a result of the asset swap. Investors seem to like the paths E.ON and RWE have taken, with big bumps in the share prices of both after the deal. But no one knows if we will be back here in two years’ time. “I would view this very much as a test of the right structure for an energy company,” said Feddersen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/sep/10/uk-windfarms-become-cheaper-than-hinkley-point-c","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-10T11:16:29Z","webTitle":"UK windfarms cheaper than Hinkley Point, experts claim","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/10/uk-windfarms-become-cheaper-than-hinkley-point-c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/sep/10/uk-windfarms-become-cheaper-than-hinkley-point-c","fields":{"headline":"New windfarms to become far cheaper than Hinkley Point, experts claim","bodyText":"Windfarms around Britain’s coast will beat the planned nuclear power station Hinkley Point on price when the winning bidders for a £290m-a-year pot of government subsidies are announced on Monday, experts predict. Such a milestone would mark a dramatic cost reduction for a technology that was once far more expensive than atomic power, and could fuel calls for a rethink over the UK’s future energy mix. Industry watchers said successful offshore windfarm developers may secure guaranteed payments for power as low as £70-80 per megawatt hour in the government’s auction, known as the second Contracts for Difference Allocation Round. In comparison, France’s EDF has been promised £92.50 per MW hour for power from the two reactors it is building in Somerset, around twice the wholesale price. The subsidies are paid by consumers via levies on energy bills. “I think [windfarm developers] will bid very aggressively and below the headline strike price of Hinkley Point,” said Richard Howard, head of research at the energy analysts Aurora Research, adding that the anticipated lower price was a result of dramatic cost reductions by the industry, brought about by the technology maturing. For example, developers are using much bigger turbines than half a decade ago, and less steel in the foundations that attach them to the seabed. The sector is also now perceived to be a much lower risk, bringing down the cost of capital. If the guaranteed price of power is as low as £70 per MW hour – a level at the extreme end of what industry figures think is credible – that would mark a 42% reduction on the £119.89 price awarded for offshore windfarms in the last auction, held two years ago. Contracts awarded in 2014 were £155. Emma Pinchbeck, executive director at the industry group RenewableUK, said: “I think it’s a watershed moment for renewables. If the price comes in as low as people are suggesting, it means large-scale renewable generation will be cheaper than incumbent technologies. The idea that renewables are expensive is going to be undermined.” Howard said one reason developers might bid very low was because there was uncertainty over when or whether future auctions would be held for offshore windfarms in the UK. Pinchbeck urged ministers to commit to a timetable for further auctions. “The idea that there will be more auctions, that’s really important, for developing and keeping a supply chain in the UK,” she said. The government has allocated another £440m a year for further auctions held before 2020, but since the general election it has not made clear whether they will still go ahead. The developers expected to share in this week’s £290m pot are Germany’s Innogy, Spain’s EDP and Denmark’s Dong Energy. The lower the companies bid in the competition, the more generating capacity will be built. Together, the successful windfarms are expected to supply around 2.5-3.5% of the UK’s electricity demand when operational in the early 2020s. The results of Monday’s auction could ignite a debate over UK energy policy, and whether the Conservatives should rethink their long-standing plan for a new fleet of nuclear power stations to replace ageing reactors and coal plants, which are being phased out. Greenpeace said the low prices would mark “a huge moment for the UK energy sector”. Keith Anderson, chief corporate officer at one of the UK’s biggest energy companies, ScottishPower, said: “My challenge to the nuclear sector would be: look, here’s the cost reduction offshore wind has demonstrated. “The challenge to nuclear industry is if you don’t want people to criticise the £92.50 per MW hour [subsidy that nuclear is receiving], show us how you are bringing the cost down. That is a colossal challenge.” He said that with the UK committed to a low carbon economy regardless of Brexit, and with gas replacing coal on the power system, now would be a good time to ask where the country would go next on energy. The nuclear industry argues that no single low carbon source could meet the UK’s power needs alone. “With two-thirds of the UK’s currently dispatchable generation capacity due to retire by 2030, including all but one of the current nuclear fleet, the UK will need the full range of low carbon technologies to provide the reliable, secure and readily available power for homes, businesses and public services,” said Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association. EDF said future new nuclear projects such as Sizewell C in Suffolk would be at a lower cost than Hinkley. The auction results, due at 7am on Monday, are also likely to inform a major government review of the costs of energy set to be published in October."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/jul/29/facebook-results-running-out-new-users-goodwill","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-29T06:00:50Z","webTitle":"Facebook’s results suggest it is short of new users and goodwill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/29/facebook-results-running-out-new-users-goodwill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jul/29/facebook-results-running-out-new-users-goodwill","fields":{"headline":"Facebook’s results suggest it is short of new users and goodwill","bodyText":"What’s bad for Facebook’s market cap might be good for society. That, at least, is what the company would like investors to take away from its disastrous second-quarter results, which triggered a fall in its stock-market valuation of almost $120bn (£92bn), the largest single loss of value in Wall Street history. At its core, the collapse is due to three negative trends: a stagnant user base, shrinking revenues and growing costs. The first, Facebook argues, has been visible for years; the second is a blip as advertisers get used to new formats; and the third is a reflection of the significant sums the company is spending to fix the problems that have plagued it in the press over the past year. It is the last of these that, from Facebook’s point of view, represents a social good. But for investors, doing the right thing carries a heavy cost. Facebook has experienced a difficult year against the backdrop of a lack of user growth. In the US, its daily user base is stagnant; in the EU, it has shrunk by three million. Even worldwide, Facebook put on just 22 million users, driven largely by growth in India, Indonesia and the Philippines – less than half the growth seen in the previous quarter. But that should not come as a surprise. In its most-developed markets, Facebook is simply running out of people: there are not enough Americans or Europeans alive for the company to double in size again. And on a global scale, Facebook is just as limited by access to the net itself: Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s founder and chief executive, noted for the first time that 2.5 billion people use at least one of Facebook’s apps – an impressive figure made more so by the fact that there are only around 3.5 billion people in the world with access to the internet at all. The reduction in European users – a first – does offer pause. GDPR, the EU data regulation, has skimmed a million off the site’s daily reach, according to Zuckerberg, as users either bounce off the onerous request for new rights or delete their accounts outright in response. The Cambridge Analytica scandal too is likely to have played a part, with the site’s increasing toxic reputation prompting some to stay away. But for smart investors, the user figures were visible in advance. The nastier shock was that Facebook’s ability to make money from those users has also taken a hit. Stories, a format ruthlessly cloned from Snapchat two years ago, is popular, fun, temporary and solves a problem the social network had suffered – that people are increasingly wary of posting content that will stick around forever. But Stories also simply isn’t as good at making money as the old Facebook feed, according to chief financial officer David Wehner. If the user base is as big as it’s going to get, the growth needs to come from how much money Facebook gets per user. And if the future of the site is struggling to encourage advertisers to buy in, that’s an uncomfortable realisation. And then there’s the positive side of the report – unless, that is, you own Facebook stock. Wehner told investors that the company is “making significant long-term investments” in safety and security: “Those investments are in the billions of dollars per year; those will have a negative impact on margins.” All told, the company’s costs are expected to grow by 50%-60%, and continue growing into 2019 faster than revenue. Almost two years after the alarm started to be raised about Facebook’s influence on politics and society, the firm is starting to plough money into a solution. Wehner says: “We think that’s the right thing to do for the business in terms of ensuring the community’s safety and security ... but [the investments] don’t have obviously immediate translation into revenue dollars.” It may not be the answer you want to hear if you have billions invested in Facebook, but it should be welcome to anyone who cares about the social network warping society. Ministers and EDF should be feeling the heat over Hinkley Point If the French nuclear industry can’t deliver on time on home turf, why should it perform any better on this side of the channel? That is the question many will be asking this week after EDF Energy announced further delays to its Flamanville 3 nuclear power station on the Normandy coast. Inspections found that 33 of 148 welds were deficient, and will need repairs lasting into next summer. The result is an extra €400m of cost, taking the total to €10.9bn, and a new plan to start commercial electricity generation being further delayed until 2020, rather than next year. The original date was 2012. None of this bodes well for Hinkley Point C, the plant EDF is building in Somerset using the same technology, the European Pressurised Reactor (EPR). So far the only EPR in the world to have been switched on is in Taishan, China. Another in Olkiluoto, Finland, is more than a decade late, and last year was delayed another five months, to May 2019. EDF has already warned that the cost of Hinkley could climb from £18.1bn to £20.3bn, and that it may not start generating power until 2027, rather than 2025 as planned. The company says it has learned lessons from the issues at Flamanville, but it has already had problems with concrete at Hinkley, and that’s before starting on the trickier nuclear parts of the plant. Given that Hinkley is due to provide 7% of the UK’s electricity, any delays mean big headaches for the country. Energy security is unlikely to be at risk, because any gap would probably be filled by gas-fired power stations. But an increase in gas burning would make it even tougher for ministers to hit legally binding carbon budgets, which the UK is already set to overshoot. As the climate-change-boosted heatwaves currently sweeping four continents remind us, that’s a target the world can’t afford to miss. TV is now about going with the streamers Virgin Media’s 4 million TV customers have started their second week with a blackout of channels owned by UKTV, which range from Dave to Drama, with no end to the dispute in sight. At the same time, Disney has just been given the green light by shareholders for its $71bn takeover of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox. These seemingly disparate issues are in fact connected, as the TV landscape goes through a tumultuous shift in the Netflix era. At the heart of Virgin Media’s quarrel with UKTV (and part of its protracted negotiations with ITV) is on-demand TV rights. The BBC, co-owner of UKTV, holds back rights to its shows on UKTV, selling them instead to Netflix and Amazon and, potentially in the future, pooling them in a British rival to Netflix with ITV and Channel 4. Virgin Media says TV shows have to come with digital rights, as that is what viewers want: this makes streaming and on-demand viewing increasingly important to broadcasters. So to the Disney deal, which was prompted by fear of Netflix and others in the streaming world, including Amazon, Apple and Google. Rupert Murdoch decided to sell, offloading assets including the studio behind Deadpool, Avatar and the X-Men films, because he felt too small to compete with said digital rivals. His decision was prompted by the failure of his $80bn bid for Time Warner in 2014: get big or get out. Disney – owner of a vast content library from the Marvel superhero films to the Star Wars franchise, Pixar kids films such as Toy Story as well as family films like Frozen – has pulled its content from Netflix in the US as it prepares its own streaming service. Just like Virgin, Disney knows content is king, and buying Fox gives it crucial extra scale to take on the might of Netflix, with its $8bn annual content budget. The battle for the future of TV is focused on streamers who want to watch what they want, when they want."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2019/feb/03/huawei-friend-or-foe-global-5g-dominance","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2019-02-03T08:00:06Z","webTitle":"Is Huawei a friend or foe in the battle for 5G dominance?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/03/huawei-friend-or-foe-global-5g-dominance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2019/feb/03/huawei-friend-or-foe-global-5g-dominance","fields":{"headline":"Is Huawei a friend or foe in the battle for 5G dominance?","bodyText":"If, according to an ancient Chinese proverb, “a crisis is an opportunity riding the dangerous wind”, then Huawei is barrelling in on a storm force 12. Where the hurricane takes it, though, may be out of the telecoms giant’s control. A slew of bombshell allegations have raised troubling questions about the telecoms company’s probity and revived long-held concerns about its relationship with China’s intelligence services. The UK, in need of friends as Brexit looms, is struggling to negotiate the fallout. To ignore the mounting brouhaha risks alienating its closest ally, the United States, currently locked in a bitter trade war with China which has become synonymous with Huawei. But the UK needs Chinese technology to keep pace with the 21st century. “The UK, like much of the west, struggles to know whether to see China as threat or opportunity,” said Robert Hannigan, former director of the British intelligence centre’s GCHQ and now European chairman of the cybersecurity company BlueVoyant. “It’s a difficult balance. My view is that we want the benefits of Chinese technology and inward investment and we should find ways of managing the risks, pushing back where necessary.” Last Monday a 13-count indictment unsealed in a New York court, charging Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, with Iranian sanctions-busting – charges rejected by the company – made the balancing act that bit more difficult. A second indictment, unveiled the same day, alleged that the firm tried to steal technology from mobile operator T-Mobile US. Huawei insists the matter has been settled. It was just another bad week for a company that is making a habit of garnering negative headlines. Not a week goes by without a UK politician taking aim. Defence secretary Gavin Williamson expressed “grave concerns” about Huawei in December. Last week Chris Bryant, the Labour MP and member of the foreign affairs select committee, claimed: “Day by day we see more evidence that Chinese companies like Huawei are breaking all the rules and undermining British security.” In December a Huawei executive was arrested in Poland on charges of spying for China, a dramatic development that the company insisted had nothing to do with its operations, a rebuttal that did little to convince sceptics who view it as an appendage of China’s Communist party (CCP). While Huawei likes to portray itself as an independent enterprise wholly owned by its employees (“we’re the John Lewis of China,” one claimed), no Chinese company could succeed abroad so spectacularly without the party’s patronage, said Martin Thorley, an expert on international engagement with China at the University of Nottingham. “There are a growing number of exciting Chinese companies that could compete abroad in a range of sectors, but the CCP has made it’s choice, and it has chosen to retain power in all spheres to the detriment of these companies’ international aspirations.” For westerners who struggle to understand the power of CCP patronage, Thorley offers an analogy. “Imagine if the Conservative party in the UK controlled the army, the judiciary, all newspapers, the police force, major companies, all universities. It would be a very different country indeed. “Huawei is a part of this network and subject to these forces, so the question is whether a company ultimately subject to the whim of the CCP should be involved in sensitive security projects abroad. Some may argue that it should but they need to understand that when called upon Huawei must do as the party says.” In the UK, however, Huawei has gone to great lengths to present itself as a paragon of corporate accountability. It hired the government’s chief information officer, John Suffolk, as head of cybersecurity and its UK board is the envy of many FTSE 100 firms. Notable appointments include ex-BP boss Lord Browne of Madingley, Sir Andrew Cahn, the government’s former chief trade ambassador, and, until her death in 2017, Dame Helen Alexander, a former CBI president. In addition to the links it has forged with academia, the company is a donor to the Chatham House thinktank and has funded two influential parliamentary technology committees. A former global sponsor of Arsenal football club, Huawei will achieve a rare PR coup on Monday when an unfinished symphony by Schubert, completed using the company’s smartphone technology, will be performed for the first time at London’s Cadogan Hall. But its expert deployment of soft power cannot stanch the flow of bad publicity. Amid growing disquiet about Huawei’s activities, UK operator BT has announced that it will remove Huawei’s technology from parts of a network it acquired from a rival, a move that some suggested was down to security concerns. Last week Vodafone confirmed that it was restricting its involvement with Huawei in the UK. Huawei is already barred from supplying next-generation 5G equipment – the technology that will connect “the internet of things” – to Australia and New Zealand. Company insiders insist these developments have nothing to do with security issues, but the optics don’t look good and several UK institutions have taken fright as the charges have piled up. Oxford University and the Prince’s Trust, two venerable organisations that have received Huawei funding, have broken links with the company in the last few days. Some 19 UK universities still enjoy Huawei sponsorship, but, given events, they may now be reconsidering their positions. More bad news is to come, on both sides of the Atlantic. The Observer understands a report to be presented to parliament’s intelligence and security committee in the coming months will flag further concerns about the use of Huawei’s software in the UK telecoms networks, something that will be seized upon by the company’s critics, who warn that sensitive data generated in the UK is at risk of being re-routed to China. In the US, alongside its broader attack on Chinese imports, the Trump administration wants to ban US companies from using Chinese equipment in their critical telecoms networks. Some believe the administration’s ultimate goal is to push Huawei out of Europe and the US, leaving America to frame the global standards for 5G. Behind the scenes, some see a level of coordination in the way the US and its allies have been gunning for Huawei. “Each week there’s a new hit,” one seasoned Huawei watcher observed. “It’s really quite impressive, from a PR perspective.” As China has pushed back, for one person at least the geopolitical row has become a matter of life and death. Following Meng’s arrest in Canada at the request of the US, the Chinese authorities seized two Canadians and sentenced to death a third man, Robert Schellenberg, who had initially been sentenced to 15 years in prison. The decision prompted the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to accuse China of “arbitrarily” applying the death sentence. In a rare meeting with journalists last month, a sign the company knows it needs to halt the flow of negative headlines, Meng’s father, the company’s founder, Ren Zhengfei, insisted the decision was “not related to Huawei in any way”. “We are like a small sesame seed, stuck in the middle of conflict between two great powers,” said Ren during the round-table discussion, a transcript of which has been shared with the Observer. Not that small a seed. With 180,000 staff around the world (1,500 in the UK), Huawei produced revenues last year of more than $100bn. In 2017 it invested $13bn (£10bn) in research and development, half what the UK spent. Not bad for a company founded in a small flat with a $2,500 loan barely more than 20 years ago. Curiously, as the row over Huawei’s activities has sucked in each of the UK’s intelligence-sharing partners in the so-called “Five Eyes” spying alliance – the US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada – Theresa May’s government has been strangely quiet about its position. But then, to be seen taking up the cudgels against Huawei would be to risk unpicking the years of work that the UK has spent assiduously wooing China. The dividends of this courtship are manifold. Between 2016 and 2017, Chinese investment in the UK doubled to $20.8bn, according to a report produced by the TMF Group, a consultancy, on behalf of the China-Britain Business Council. This was all the more astonishing given that, in the same year, overall Chinese outbound investment declined for the first time since records began in 2003. More is to come. Between 2018 and 2022, Huawei alone has pledged to spend some £3bn in the UK. It is perhaps no coincidence that, as Chinese money has poured into the UK, hundreds of Chinese investors have received golden visas granting them residency. And nowhere is the burgeoning Anglo-Chinese relationship more tangible than London. Two of the City’s most recognisable buildings, the 224m “Cheesegrater” and the 38-storey Walkie Talkie, are now owned by Hong Kong companies, while the multibillion-pound redevelopment of the Royal Albert Dock in east London is being spearheaded by the Chinese developer ABP. These projects pale into insignificance compared with the £20bn development of Hinkley Point C. The new nuclear station in Somerset that will generate low-carbon electricity for about 6 million homes is a third-owned by China’s General Nuclear Power Group. But some experts question where this relationship will end. “My fear is that, just as financial elite influence over government ensured light-touch regulation that led to financial disaster in 2008, so similar interests have steered the UK government towards the ‘golden era’ policy with China,” Thorley said. “This policy has stalled somewhat since David Cameron and George Osborne left Downing Street, but we still may feel its consequences in the UK’s energy strategy and beyond.” The UK’s assiduous courtship of China was evident in 2010 when Cameron set up his National Security Council, comprising eight committees, six of which he headed. Significantly, though, of the other two, the one relating to cybersecurity was to be overseen not by the prime minister but by the chancellor. At the time intelligence experts were quick to interpret this shift. One told the Observer that they believed the Treasury wanted to “own” cyber because it believed the opportunities afforded by the development of the technology should not be subsumed beneath national security concerns, a view that at the time alarmed some in the intelligence community. And for good reason. Under article 7 of China’s 2017 National Intelligence law, companies like Huawei are legally obliged to help the Chinese intelligence agencies upon request. This fact alone might convince many that Huawei should be nowhere near the UK’s critical infrastructure. But Huawei is subject to unique supervision by the UK’s intelligence services. In 2010 the UK government established the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation centre, overseen by GCHQ’s national cybersecurity centre, to monitor the company’s operations in the UK. Staffed by 35 heavily vetted analysts, the centre flags security issues arising from Huawei’s activities to government. A report issued by the centre’s oversight board last July raised serious concerns about the poor quality of Huawei’s security engineering. As a result, the board conceded that it could provide only “limited assurance” that any risks to UK national security from Huawei’s involvement in the UK’s critical networks had been sufficiently mitigated. Another report from the board, to be published this spring, is expected to raise similar concerns, giving more ammunition to Huawei’s critics, the Observer understands. However, while the intelligence agencies may harbour concerns about the robustness of Huawei’s software, the centre has never found evidence of the fabled “backdoors” that would allow China to penetrate the UK’s telecoms networks. “Critically, it has concluded that Huawei falls short in its approach to cybersecurity, but it has never uncovered hostile state activity by Chinese government agencies,” Hannigan said. Ren, a former officer in the People’s Liberation Army, insists Huawei would never betray its customers. “When it comes to cybersecurity and privacy protection, we are committed to siding with our customers. We will never harm any nation or any individual.” The extraordinary level to which the UK has gone to accommodate a company regularly accused of spying for a foreign state says much about where the shifting balance of power now lies in the world. In the era of “techno-nationalism”, countries that innovate dominate. Last year the broadband comparison website, Cable, published an annual league table revealing that the UK had the 35th fastest broadband in the world, a slip of four places since 2017, one that put it behind almost all other EU member states and Madagascar, one of the least developed nations in the world, according to the UN. Huawei knows it is one of the very few companies that can drag the UK up the table. “Huawei is the only company in the world that can integrate 5G base stations with the most advanced microwave technology,” Ren said. “With that capability, our 5G base stations don’t even need fibre connections. Instead, they can use superfast microwave to support ultra-wide bandwidth backhauls. This is a compelling solution that makes a lot of economic sense.” For economic, read cheap. To switch to an alternative supplier, such as Sweden’s Ericsson, would be hugely costly, Whitehall mandarins concede. Inevitably, the significantly higher prices would be passed on to consumers. Jo Platt, shadow minister for cyber, said UK reliance on a few key tech firms was a concern. “Why are we spending huge amounts of public money on mega-companies like Amazon Digital Services and Huawei; how do we redress that?” Perhaps Huawei itself will provide the answer. Amid reports that Poland is pushing fellow Nato members to adopt a “unified position” on Huawei, something that could make life difficult for the UK as it scrambles to keep Huawei onside, Ren promised the company would scale back if it was not allowed to sell its products in certain markets. Such a pledge would never be made by a western company beholden to shareholders. But, as Ren acknowledged, Huawei is different. “We are not a public company – we aren’t overly concerned about beautiful numbers.” He was talking about Huawei. But he may as well have been talking about China. 22 August 2018 The US issues a warrant for Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei and daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei 1 December Meng Wanzhou is arrested at Vancouver airport after US says Huawei was involved in breaking Iran sanctions 10 December Two Canadians are detained in China, four days after Justin Trudeau refuses to intervene in Meng’s case 14 January 2019 Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg is sentenced to death by a Chinese court for drug smuggling 24 January Huawei says it will not use US-made components for its next generation of smartphones 28 January Meng is charged with misleading US banks about Iran dealings.

Fears that Russia will target Britain’s critical national infrastructure have prompted round-the-clock threat assessments by the UK’s financial sector, energy firms and GCHQ, the UK’s largest intelligence agency, along with the security services MI5 and MI6. The Bank of England, major financiers, including Lloyds, and organisations such as Water UK are working with the government’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to assess the next move from Moscow following the murder of Nikolai Glushkov, 68, and the Salisbury chemical attack. Scotland Yard on Saturday issued a renewed appeal for information for anyone who may have seen a burgundy red BMW owned by Sergei Skripal, 66, the former Russian spy who was found unconscious on 4 March in Salisbury along with his daughter, Yulia. The pair were poisoned with a nerve agent and remain critical but stable in hospital. Glushkov, a businessman and a known critic of President Vladimir Putin, was found strangled at his home in London last week. Police across Britain have begun contacting Russian exiles to discuss their safety as they investigate the murder of Glushkov, understood to have been on a list of 22 “fugitives” published by the Russian embassy in London last year. Officers have yet to establish if there is a link between the attacks. Intelligence officials, however, fear that Moscow may strike next using very different methods, referring to Russia’s involvement in the crippling NotPetya ransomware cyber-attack last year that targeted Ukraine’s financial, energy and government sectors before it spread across the world. On Thursday the Trump administration accused Russia of engineering a series of cyber-attacks that targeted American and European nuclear power plants and water and electricity systems, the first time the United States has publicly accused Moscow of hacking into America’s energy infrastructure. The UK’s NCSC is based inside GCHQ and notifies UK firms considered to be “critical national infrastructure” and the government of the latest threat level. It is monitoring significant Russian activity in the UK, though it is understood that no specific threat from Russia has emerged since the attempted murder of Skripal and his 33-year-old daughter and the murder of Glushkov. Robert Hannigan, a former director of GCHQ and the National Security Council, told the Observer that the NCSC was monitoring “very large volumes” of attacks every day on the UK, including its globally important financial services. Hannigan, who was responsible for the UK’s first cyber strategy in 2009 and is now a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said that from his experience, which also includes three years as prime minister Tony Blair’s security adviser, he had never seen Russia so unpredictable and hostile. “In their [the Russians] current mood it’s hard to know what they will do. What’s different now is the willingness to be reckless, not to play by the rules that most civilised countries play by and not to worry about being found out. They no longer seem to care.” Hannigan said they were continually detecting Russians on UK cyber networks. “They’re constantly being found on networks but it’s their intent that matters more than the fact they are there. The difficulty with cyber is that you can be on a network to gather intelligence or you can be on a network to do something destructive and the two look pretty much the same.” A senior banking source, confirming that the sector was working closely with GCHQ and the security services to evaluate any threat from Russia, said they were also concerned about the risk of attack, not just from the Kremlin but from rogue elements caught up in the febrile climate that has prevailed since the Salisbury chemical attack. “It is possible that Russian patriots may take it upon themselves to make a point at a time like this,” said the source. A Lloyds spokesman said: “We update and test our defences regularly and work closely with both industry bodies and law enforcement agencies to help us protect our customers.” A Water UK spokesperson, which represents the major water companies, said it was in regular contact with government officials to ensure its cyber defences were sufficiently robust. The UK government has floated the idea of fining organisations which fail to implement effective cyber security measures as part of plans to make Britain’s essential infrastructure resilient against future cyber-attacks. Beyza Unal, a research fellow at Chatham House’s international security department, said that the UK had been shoring up its defences in the face of the evolving cyber threat. “The UK has a really good cyber defence strategy planning as well as organisation, each sector talks to the government organisations,” she said. Latest figures from the NCSC reveal more than 1,100 attacks over the past year, 590 significant. Thirty required action by government bodies, a number of which targeted the UK’s internationally important financial sector."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/23/macron-trump-whisperer-state-visit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T06:00:03Z","webTitle":"Macron to put 'Trump whisperer' skills to test on state visit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/23/macron-trump-whisperer-state-visit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/23/macron-trump-whisperer-state-visit","fields":{"headline":"Macron to put 'Trump whisperer' skills to test on state visit","bodyText":"They call him the Trump whisperer. France’s President Emmanuel Macron – who believes his diplomacy, persuasion and personal charm can sway the thinking of his US counterpart, Donald Trump – arrives in Washington on Monday for the deeply symbolic first state visit by a foreign leader since Trump came to power. The stakes are high, with Macron expected to raise future plans on Syria after the recent joint missile strikes, as well as France’s determination to preserve the Iran nuclear deal which Trump wants to quit. Macron said last week that he had convinced Trump to keep troops in Syria for the long term but was quickly rebuffed by the White House. But Elysée officials said the highly choreographed visit, including an intimate dinner with the Trumps at Mount Vernon, was aimed foremost at cementing what they called an “intense, close relationship built on trust”, underlined by Macron and Trump’s daily phone conversations over Syria strikes. Macron’s drive for influence in Washington is built on a surprisingly close relationship forged between two men who would appear polar opposites. Trump, 71, is an anti-globalist and a protectionist elected on a pledge to put America First, who had once appeared to favour Macron’s opponent, the far-right Marine Le Pen. Macron, 40, believes in a kind of cosmopolitan globalism and is an ardent pro-European. The intellectual French president is the same age as Trump’s eldest son, Donald Jr, and believes a head of state should read literature or philosophy every night lest they lose touch with reality. US observers wonder if Trump can finish a book. And yet Macron, driven by a keen sense of pragmatism, has built up perhaps the closest personal relationship to Trump of any world leader. “What’s the secret of Trump whispering in 2018?” asked Gérard Araud, the French ambassador to Washington, as he attempted to sum up the Macron-Trump relationship at an Atlantic Council event in Washington this month. He acknowledged that although the presidents had different personalities, they were both “disruptors” whose elections had surprised and challenged the old political order in their countries. And both men can be brutally frank. “Donald Trump has never hidden what he thinks, and Emmanuel Macron is the same – so they have built a dialogue,” he said. But the American media talk of “bromance” irks French diplomats who view the smiling and backslapping on display when Macron grandly invited Trump to Paris’s Bastille Day military parade last summer as just clever, logical diplomacy. “No it’s not ‘bromance’,” Araud said. “It’s simply that there is a common interest on both sides to reach an understanding. Any French president wants to have a good relationship with the president of the US. It’s nothing new.” Macron’s notorious white-knuckled handshake of Trump at their first meeting has given way to honouring and flattering the US president, namely with the summer visit to Paris and dinner at the Eiffel Tower. The two men talk in English, without intermediaries, a nod to Macron’s belief that Trump is “not a classical politician”. Although they agree on some key topics – such as counter-terrorism and Syria – they maintain what diplomats call “gentlemen’s disagreements” on others, including Trump’s resolve to leave the Paris climate accord, the Iran nuclear accord and economic protectionism. Crucially, the Macron-Trump relationship has flourished while other traditional US allies appeared weakened: Germany during its long wait to form a government and the UK where Theresa May has not capitalised on the traditional London-Washington “special relationship”. Macron believes that the rules-based, western-dominated world order is being challenged, and France – a nuclear power and permanent member of the UN security council – has to be well-placed to respond. “The word I use about Macron is neorealist,” said François Heisbourg, the chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “Macron understands that we live in a Trumpian world – because it’s not only Trump, it’s Russia’s Putin, Turkey’s Erdoğan, Egypt’s Sisi, China’s Xi Jinping. And Macron is rather good at playing the horse whisperer’s role with these kind of individuals. He is the only European political executive leader who is on speaking terms with all those people.” But the question remains as to how much Macron has actually achieved in swaying Trump’s thinking. “Sometimes I manage to convince him, sometimes I fail,” Macron said earlier this year. Laurence Nardon, head of the US programme at the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI), said: “Macron has said several times that he wanted to change Trump’s mind, for example on climate issues, trade barriers, the Iran nuclear accord. But so far in terms of concrete results, the results are limited, except on trade barriers, where negotiations are progressing. “France hasn’t had an impact on changing American positions on climate change or the Iran deal for the moment. So the strategy hasn’t worked. But that is to be expected, because the reality is that Trump makes his decisions on issues such as protectionism, anti-environmentalism and Iran for reasons of internal politics, to please his own electorate. He is unlikely to change his views before the November midterms.” She added: “And yet on the French side, it seemed a sound policy to try to influence America’s view. It was a chance that France had to take.” Macron’s state visit is also about styling himself as a bridge to Europe for Trump. Germany’s Angela Merkel will visit Washington shortly after, reflecting European concerns on steel tariffs and the Iran deal. “The Macron-Trump relationship translates as the French desire to be at the centre of the game,” said Thomas Snégaroff, a historian at Paris’s Sciences Po university. “Paris can’t envisage the progress of multilateralism at a world level without the US, the biggest power in the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/dec/03/nuclear-power-paves-the-only-viable-path-forward-on-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-03T13:00:12Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power paves the only viable path forward on climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/03/nuclear-power-paves-the-only-viable-path-forward-on-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/dec/03/nuclear-power-paves-the-only-viable-path-forward-on-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power paves the only viable path forward on climate change","bodyText":"All four of us have dedicated our scientific careers to understand the processes and impacts of climate change, variously studying ocean systems, tropical cyclones, ice sheets and ecosystems as well as impacts on human societies. We have used both climate models and geological records of past climates to better understand lessons from warmer periods in the Earth’s history and investigate future scenarios. We have become so concerned about humanity’s slow response to this challenge that we have decided we must clearly set out what we see as the only viable path forward. As scientists we do not take advocacy positions lightly, but we believe the magnitude of climate change now presents an unprecedented moral challenge that compels us to speak out. To avoid the worst effects of climate change, including continued sea level rise, the total loss of Arctic sea ice and devastating effects on human societies and natural ecosystems alike, rapid global decarbonisation is needed. The voluntary measures put on the table at Paris by over 100 nations are a welcome step, but unless there are strong measures to reduce emissions beyond 2030, global emissions would remain at a high level, practically guaranteeing that young people inherit a climate running out of their control. A new and intensified approach is clearly needed. Everyone agrees that the most urgent component of decarbonisation is a move towards clean energy, and clean electricity in particular. We need affordable, abundant clean energy, but there is no particular reason why we should favour renewable energy over other forms of abundant energy. Indeed, cutting down forests for bioenergy and damming rivers for hydropower – both commonly counted as renewable energy sources – can have terrible environmental consequences. Nuclear power, particularly next-generation nuclear power with a closed fuel cycle (where spent fuel is reprocessed), is uniquely scalable, and environmentally advantageous. Over the past 50 years, nuclear power stations – by offsetting fossil fuel combustion – have avoided the emission of an estimated 60bn tonnes of carbon dioxide. Nuclear energy can power whole civilisations, and produce waste streams that are trivial compared to the waste produced by fossil fuel combustion. There are technical means to dispose of this small amount of waste safely. However, nuclear does pose unique safety and proliferation concerns that must be addressed with strong and binding international standards and safeguards. Most importantly for climate, nuclear produces no CO2 during power generation. To solve the climate problem, policy must be based on facts and not on prejudice. The climate system cares about greenhouse gas emissions – not about whether energy comes from renewable power or abundant nuclear power. Some have argued that it is feasible to meet all of our energy needs with renewables. The 100% renewable scenarios downplay or ignore the intermittency issue by making unrealistic technical assumptions, and can contain high levels of biomass and hydroelectric power at the expense of true sustainability. Large amounts of nuclear power would make it much easier for solar and wind to close the energy gap. The climate issue is too important for us to delude ourselves with wishful thinking. Throwing tools such as nuclear out of the box constrains humanity’s options and makes climate mitigation more likely to fail. We urge an all-of-the-above approach that includes increased investment in renewables combined with an accelerated deployment of new nuclear reactors. For example, a build rate of 61 new reactors per year could entirely replace current fossil fuel electricity generation by 2050. Accounting for increased global electricity demand driven by population growth and development in poorer countries, which would add another 54 reactors per year, this makes a total requirement of 115 reactors per year to 2050 to entirely decarbonise the global electricity system in this illustrative scenario. We know that this is technically achievable because France and Sweden were able to ramp up nuclear power to high levels in just 15-20 years. Nuclear will make the difference between the world missing crucial climate targets or achieving them. We are hopeful in the knowledge that, together with renewables, nuclear can help bridge the ‘emissions gap’ that bedevils the Paris climate negotiations. The future of our planet and our descendants depends on basing decisions on facts, and letting go of long-held biases when it comes to nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/sep/16/china-must-wait-four-years-for-decision-on-bradwell-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-16T18:26:26Z","webTitle":"China must wait four years for decision on Bradwell nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/16/china-must-wait-four-years-for-decision-on-bradwell-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/sep/16/china-must-wait-four-years-for-decision-on-bradwell-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"China must wait four years for decision on Bradwell nuclear plant","bodyText":"China faces at least a four-year wait to find out whether its plans to build a nuclear power station in Essex will be approved. If it got the go-ahead, Britain would be relying heavily on Chinese investment for its future energy supply after the government approved the construction of an £18bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, which will be 33% owned by China General Nuclear (CGN). Theresa May pushed through the Hinkley Point C project despite opposition from MPs and the public over its cost and the involvement of China. However, the project in Bradwell, Essex, is even more controversial because it would be majority owned and designed by China. The prime minister’s approval for Hinkley Point was backed by George Osborne, the former chancellor who championed the project. However, Osborne said the agreement with France and China approved by May looked “pretty much like the same deal” agreed last year by David Cameron’s government. This is despite May’s government claiming it had inserted a “special share” in the agreement to help protect national security and ensure the ownership of the nuclear plant did not change without state approval. “I’m very pleased that we are going ahead with the Hinkley power plant,” Osborne told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I don’t think anything has fundamentally changed from the deal that we put together in government just a few months ago. It looks to me pretty much like the same deal. “The advice we got from civil servants in the energy ministry and from the security establishment was that the special share would not add any additional protection beyond what the very tough and tight regulatory regime already provided us. It didn’t seem to me necessary to have some additional special share. Maybe the advice has changed over the last few months. I don’t know, obviously I’m not in the government any more.” Under the deal, CGN agreed to invest £6bn in Hinkley Point C in return for leading its own power plant project at Bradwell. The Bradwell plant is considered vital by the state-owned company because it would be the first Chinese nuclear reactor to be built in a developed country and an opportunity to promote China’s technological expertise. CGN plans formally to submit its plan for a nuclear reactor at Bradwell within weeks. However, it would take at least four years for the Office of Nuclear Regulation (ONR) to assess the proposals and possibly approve them. This means that despite the government having approved Hinkley Point C, the shape of Britain’s future energy supply will remain unresolved for some time. Sources close to CGN said they were “confident” about winning approval but prepared for a “lengthy and meticulous process”. The company has held preliminary discussions with the ONR about Bradwell, its technology and its governance structure. The regulator said in an official document earlier this year that CGN was in a “good position” to begin a generic design assessment, the formal process to approve a new nuclear reactor. The GDA for Bradwell would begin when the Chinese company submitted its proposals and the government gave the ONR a green light. The process for the Chinese company would be the same as for other new reactors and would take around four years, as long as the group met the timetable for submissions and provided sufficient detail. The ONR said: “As the independent regulator for all [UK] nuclear sites we have strong powers to ensure the safe and secure delivery of any new nuclear project.” CGN would own two-thirds of the Bradwell B project, with the French energy company EDF owning the rest. This is the reverse of Hinkley Point C, which is two-thirds owned by EDF and of a French design. The government’s approval of Hinkley Point C has been welcomed in China. Johnny Hon, a Sino-British entrepreneur and vice-president of the 48 Group Club, which promotes trade links between the countries, said: “Although the news is most welcome from China’s perspective, their most anticipated deal is the third potential reactor in Bradwell in Essex – whose details are yet to be confirmed. “This reactor would be the first in a developed country to use Chinese technology and [would] be a breakthrough in establishing China as a global leader in nuclear power.” Beijing’s official news agency, Xinhua, said May’s backing of Hinkley Point C had saved UK-China relations from being “tossed into uncertainty”. In an opinion piece on Friday, Xinhua said the project had been put at risk by “some fictitious ‘national security’ concerns about Chinese investment … Had the programme gone under, all sides were to lose dearly, while China-Britain relations could have been tossed into uncertainty.” Contracts relating to the construction of Hinkley Point C are already being awarded. First Bus and Crosville Motor Services have won a 10-year contract to provide bus services for workers involved in building the power plant in Somerset. Around 300 jobs will be created for the service, which will use 160 environmentally friendly buses. Meanwhile General Electric, the US industrial giant, has confirmed it is in line to receive $1.9bn (£1.5bn) by building steam turbines and generators for the power plant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jul/28/resignation-edf-director-hinkley-point-gerard-magnin","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-28T13:41:14Z","webTitle":"Resignation of EDF director paves way for Hinkley Point go-ahead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/resignation-edf-director-hinkley-point-gerard-magnin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/resignation-edf-director-hinkley-point-gerard-magnin","fields":{"headline":"Resignation of EDF director paves way for Hinkley Point go-ahead","bodyText":"An EDF director opposed to the construction of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant has resigned before a crucial board vote on the project, paving the way for the French company to approve it. Gérard Magnin said Hinkley Point was “very risky” in his resignation letter to EDF’s chief executive. Magnin did not attend the board meeting in Paris on Thursday where EDF’s remaining 17 directors will vote on the project. His resignation follows that of EDF’s chief financial official, Thomas Piquemal, earlier this year, which was linked to concerns about the cost of Hinkley Point. Magnin has a background in alternative energies and is the founder of Energy Cities, an association designed to help local authorities move to newer forms of energy. The French government, which owns 85% of EDF, proposed him as a board member in 2014. His appointment was seen as an attempt to encourage the company to invest more in renewable energy. Magnin, however, said Hinkley Point and a proposal to buy Areva’s reactor building unit showed EDF was actually moving further towards nuclear power. “As a board member proposed by the government shareholder, I no longer want to support a strategy that I do not agree with,” Magnin wrote in his letter to Jean-Bernard Lévy, which has been seen by Reuters. “Let’s hope that Hinkley Point will not drag EDF into the same abyss as Areva.” The French government had to rescue the nuclear group from bankruptcy earlier this year. The £18bn project is controversial in the UK and France. EDF has net debt of more than €37bn (£31bn) and unions representing the company’s workers in France are concerned that Hinkley Point could jeopardise its survival. Critics in the UK are concerned that consumers will ultimately have to pick up the bill for the project. The National Audit Office (NAO) has said taxpayers could end up paying more than £30bn through a range of subsidies designed to support the project. The government has agreed a strike price, a guaranteed price for the electricity generated by Hinkley Point, of £92.50 per megawatt hour. This is more than twice the cost of existing wholesale electricity prices."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jan/10/china-on-track-to-lead-in-renewables-as-us-retreats-report-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-10T03:08:49Z","webTitle":"China on track to lead in renewables as US retreats, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/10/china-on-track-to-lead-in-renewables-as-us-retreats-report-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jan/10/china-on-track-to-lead-in-renewables-as-us-retreats-report-says","fields":{"headline":"China on track to lead in renewables as US retreats, report says","bodyText":"China is moving towards becoming a global leader in renewable technology as the US pulls away, a new report has said. China is the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and still invests in coal but in recent years it has become the largest investor in domestic renewable energy. The country is now on track to lead international investment in the sector, according to the report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). “As the global transition toward renewables gains pace and as battery storage and electric vehicles technologies pick up momentum, China is setting itself up to dominate these sectors globally over the next several decades of this century,” said IEEFA. IEEFA identified a record high spend of more than US$44bn by China on international takeovers and projects worth more than $1bn – a 38% year-on-year growth. China’s One Belt One Road agenda, which drives infrastructure investment along ancient trade routes, is leading the country’s growth. $8bn of solar equipment has been exported from China since it began, and the country has overtaken the US and Germany to become the number one exporter of environmental goods and services. “China’s presence in wind power globally is also on the rise, led by international activities of companies such as Goldwind and by China Three Gorges’ diversification away from hydroelectricity,” the report said. The trajectory is in stark contrast to that of the US, which last year pulled out of the Paris climate accord and has renewed its support for the coal industry. The decision to abandon the Paris agreement “led to China’s quick reaffirmation of its emissions-reduction pledge”, the report said. “That allows it to further project itself globally as a responsible major power while addressing its domestic air pollution concerns and building world-leading capacity in new energy markets.” As part of its Paris commitments, China pledged to peak its emissions by 2030 while making best efforts to peak earlier. It would also increase the share of renewable or nuclear energy sources to 20%. Co-author of the report and director of IEEFA, Tim Buckley, said China was setting itself up as a global technology leader “whilst the US government looks the other way”. “Although China isn’t necessarily intending to fill the climate leadership void left by the US withdrawal from Paris, it will certainly be very comfortable providing technology leadership and financial capacity so as to dominate fast-growing sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles and batteries.” The report noted the August 2017 merger of China’s top coal mining company, Shenhua Group Corp, with one of the “big five” power utilities, China Guodian Corp. The newly named China Energy Investment Corp created the world’s largest power generator, and with the clean-energy assets of Guodian, Shenhua’s growth was no longer dependent on the pursuit of coal. “[This] strategic posture [of pursuing coal] has burdened China’s power companies and limited their appetite for innovative new clean energy technologies,” the IEEFA said. The report also found China was “outmanoeuvring other economies” in securing energy commodity supplies such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, allowing them to dominate manufacturing of batteries and electric vehicles. On Monday, the US federal energy regulatory commission rejected a plan by the Donald Trump-led US administration to provide subsidies for coal-fired and nuclear power plants. Last year the energy secretary, Rick Perry, proposed moves to slow the phasing out of the ageing plants and Trump vowed to repeal Obama-era environmental regulations in a bid to end a so-called “war on coal”. However, independent analysis found the subsidies plan would cost taxpayers $10.6bn a year, and the commission on Monday said there was no evidence that retiring coal-fired power plants threatened the reliability of the nation’s electricity grid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/jul/09/gig-economy-now-time-ease-burden-labouring-taylor-report","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-09T07:51:43Z","webTitle":"Gig economy: now is the time to ease the burden for workers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/09/gig-economy-now-time-ease-burden-labouring-taylor-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/jul/09/gig-economy-now-time-ease-burden-labouring-taylor-report","fields":{"headline":"Gig economy: now is the time to ease the burden for workers","bodyText":"When Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts, was appointed last year by Theresa May to lead a review of modern employment practices, he said it would be “really important to get out and listen to people”, as opposed to merely crunching data and numbers. Let us hope he has listened to some of the same people as Frank Field, the former chair of the work and pensions committee. Field’s latest report from the frontline of the gig economy told some depressing, if by now familiar, stories. Workers can be forced into forms of self-employment against their will. Contracts can offer effective wages of less than £2.50 an hour and be enforced with threats of fines or loss of work. Field’s latest report drew on accounts from workers at Parcelforce, DPD and British Car Auctions but it echoed the findings of his earlier work, including the original review that prompted May to appoint Taylor. In the coming days the Taylor report will be published and it will present the first test of the Conservatives’ manifesto promise to “make sure that people working in the ‘gig’ economy are properly protected”. What should it say? The first task is to end the absurdity of bogus self-employment. This employment category is plainly being abused by some companies whose workers continue to be told how to behave like regular employees for all practical purposes – their work can be directed down to exact details, including time, hours, place and uniform. The only real difference is that the employer is able to avoid paying employers’ national insurance and pension contributions, and offering protections such as maternity and sick pay. It’s a scam. Massive benefits accrue to the employers and very few to the workers. The best solution is backed by the TUC and Field: reverse the burden of legal proof so that companies must demonstrate that someone is not an employee. To expect workers to go to an employment tribunal, or even a court, to establish normal employment rights is unfair and impractical. Taylor could propose a fast, simple and transparent system for assessing self-employed status. The current system is either a muddle, or an invitation to unscrupulous companies to see what they can get away with. A second area is more contentious. It seems unlikely that Taylor will propose abolishing zero-hour contracts because, in some cases, their flexibility benefits both sides. That will not be universally popular, but it would be a realistic position. But Taylor could – and should – establish the principle that companies should pay a premium for flexibility. In regular work that is paid by the hour, companies expect to pay overtime. The same approach would also operate with zero-hour and short-hours contracts: contracted hours would be paid at a standard rate and anything on top would attract a higher hourly rate. As the TUC has argued, such a system would also “create a financial incentive for employers to reduce their reliance on insecure forms of work”. Third, Taylor must ensure that proposals to promote the “workers’ voice” within companies mean something substantial. The prime minister has an appalling record of obfuscation in this area. She promised to put workers in boardrooms but then watered down the idea to say an existing non-executive director could represent them. If Taylor wants to establish German-style “workplace citizenship” in the UK, he must set out the practical steps. In the gig economy, a blast of old-fashioned collective bargaining could do more to improve the lot of workers than technical tweaks to current employment laws. Andrew Haldane, chief economist at the Bank or England, was right when he argued last month that a period of “divide and conquer” has left workers in the UK less able to bargain for higher wages. Taylor must avoid May’s wishy-washy approach and acknowledge that the best people to represent workers’ interests are workers themselves. Power on with Hinkley: but then it’s time to rethink energy strategy It was always a case of when, not if, Hinkley Point C went over budget and over schedule. But EDF’s admission last week that its new nuclear power station in Somerset risks costing as much as £2.2bn more than its original £18bn price tag, and coming online 15 months late, is still staggering. The French state-owned firm has been planning the project for years, so such a significant hike at such an early stage does not bode well for future delays and cost increases. Nonetheless, Hinkley Point C should go ahead. A huge amount of work has already been done, and the project brings billions in investment and thousands of jobs to a corner of the country that needs it. It will also provide 7% of the UK’s electricity and help Britain hit otherwise impossible carbon targets. But the case for a new fleet of nuclear power stations beyond Hinkley – already highly debatable before this week – looks increasingly weak. None looks able to tackle with sufficient urgency the UK’s challenges of energy security and cutting emissions in the 2020s. The project that seemed closest after Hinkley, Moorside in Cumbria, is now among the walking dead after its reactor vendor went bust and one of two key investors sold its stake. Plans for new reactors at Wylfa in Wales, backed by Japan’s Hitachi, are the next closest along the road, but the Horizon project still needs to raise huge sums of capital. The Japanese and UK government are considering taking a public stake, although the move would put taxpayers on the hook if it suffers budget overruns, like Hinkley. China wants to build a new nuclear power station at Essex but would face at least four years of clearing regulatory hurdles before it could even begin. Less than a fortnight into his new job, energy minister Richard Harrington said the UK still needed new nuclear. But it’s not too late for officials to say no, minister. The future of British power is in wind, solar and gas, energy efficiency, smart grids and the sort of enormous battery plant Elon Musk has revealed Tesla will construct in Australia. Hinkley should be the last nuclear power station the UK ever builds. Ashley’s booze claims fail to dilute Sports Direct’s value Is this the sort of boast you want to hear from your chief executive? “I like to get drunk, I’m a power drinker. My thing is not to drink regularly, it’s to binge drink.” The speaker, of course, was Sports Direct’s Mike Ashley, in the high court last week where he was defending claims that he agreed to pay a banker £15m during a drinking session in a London pub. The case continues, but here’s the remarkable fact: while Ashley was describing his boozing habits, Sports Direct’s share price barely moved. There was no loss of confidence in the company – or, at least, no fresh slump after last year’s revelations about working practices at its Shirebrook warehouse. Actually, it’s not so remarkable. Share prices move when facts emerge that differ from expectations. Ashley’s boozing is no secret. Investors know what they’re getting: a boss who owns more than half the shares and doesn’t care what they think."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/nov/01/hinkley-point-c-will-not-cost-taxpayers-extra-says-edf-energy-boss","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-01T18:22:54Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C will not cost taxpayers extra, says EDF Energy boss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/01/hinkley-point-c-will-not-cost-taxpayers-extra-says-edf-energy-boss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/nov/01/hinkley-point-c-will-not-cost-taxpayers-extra-says-edf-energy-boss","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C will not cost taxpayers extra, says EDF Energy boss","bodyText":"The chief executive of EDF Energy has vowed that the £24bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant will be built by 2025 and will not result in extra costs to UK taxpayers. In evidence before the House of Lords economic affairs select committee, Vincent de Rivaz dismissed parallels with two nuclear plants EDF is building in France and Finland, which have suffered delays and cost overruns. He said planning of the two projects had been “flawed” and there had been “underestimation” of their costs but insisted EDF had learned lessons from these setbacks. “The assumptions made on cost and schedule were wrong, dead wrong. We have dramatically changed the approach by which we prepared this project,” he said. Asked if taxpayers would have to pay for any unforeseen cost increases, or a decision to abandon the 3.2-gigawatt plant altogether, De Rivaz said: “Categorically not”. The promises come just days after secret government papers revealed that taxpayers would foot the bill if the cost of storing nuclear waste from the plant, which EDF is building in partnership with China General Nuclear, spiralled out of control. Hinkley Point C, which won final approval in September after Theresa May ordered a last-minute review, has also faced criticism over the £92.50 per megawatt hour (MW/h) “strike price” that the government guaranteed to pay EDF for electricity. Members of the committee pointed to a presentation by EDF in 2008 that predicted Hinkley could deliver power at just £45/MWh, citing the forecast as evidence that costs could increase further. De Rivaz said the figure had never been submitted to government but admitted it had been a mistake. “At that time there were flawed assumptions based on the cost of [the French reactor at] Flamanville,” he said. “What interests us today is the cost of Hinkley Point C. It’s a battle of the past.” He said the eventual agreement was a “fair, fair deal” for UK consumers. While Hinkley Point C has proved controversial in the UK, it has also led to deep divisions in EDF Energy’s parent company, EDF, majority owned by the French state. French trade unions have opposed the firm’s role in the plant, while the former finance chief Thomas Piquemal was among executives who quit EDF over concerns about the risks to the company’s finances. “It is his choice to talk down about the company he has just left,” said De Rivaz, adding that Piquemal’s replacement, Xavier Girre, had “no reservations at all”. He added that the project, due to provide 7% of the UK’s power needs, would be ready on time. “In 2025, when the country needs it, it will be up and running.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/sep/03/hinkley-point-c-theresa-may-china-g20-summit","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-03T11:39:40Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C: no easy solution to Theresa May's Chinese puzzle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/03/hinkley-point-c-theresa-may-china-g20-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/sep/03/hinkley-point-c-theresa-may-china-g20-summit","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C: no easy solution to Theresa May's Chinese puzzle","bodyText":"Theresa May will be dodging questions from the Chinese and French premiers at the G20 summit in Huangzhou about whether she will or will not be giving the go-ahead to the controversial Hinkley Point C nuclear project. One of the first decisions made by May’s new government was to review the £18.5bn flagship energy project that foreign companies – EDF of France and CGN of China – expected to build. Beijing is particularly incensed by suggestions that British ministers are questioning the national security implications of allowing a Chinese business access to the UK national energy infrastructure. In a prominent opinion piece published in the state-run China Daily newspaper on Thursday, ahead of her arrival, China’s ambassador to London urged May to make “wise strategic choices” over Britain’s future relationship with China. Liu Xiaoming made no direct reference to Hinkley but said “a number of steps need to be taken in order to maintain the momentum in the relationship” between London and Beijing. The newly formed Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has also confirmed the secretary of state, Greg Clark, met a delegation from EDF in London who were seeking reassurances that the Somerset scheme would proceed. But Hinkley remains under review with May only promising that a final decision for or against the new reactor scheme, which was championed by George Osborne, would be made in October. So why is a scheme that has been so long in the making still being reconsidered at this time, when EDF and CGN have promised to stump up the building costs and Britain is in dire need of new generating capacity? The case against Security Defence of the realm is indeed an issue. Senior military and intelligence figures have warned ministers that plans to give China a big stake in Britain’s nuclear power industry poses a threat to national security. May’s chief of staff, Nick Timothy, wrote a piece saying MI5 believed that the intelligence services of China continued to work against UK interests at home and abroad. Critics say countries such as the US would never allow the Chinese to work inside its national infrastructure where it could insert computer glitches that could turn the lights off. America scuppered a Chinese company from buying one of its oil companies, Unocal, on strategic grounds in 2005. The Hinkley deal is not self-standing, either. Beijing has only agreed to provide 30% funding on condition that it will be able to build its own Chinese-designed reactor at Bradwell in Essex. Cost While spy stories may be headline grabbing, there are other more mundane reasons why Hinkley may never go ahead: cost – and most notably the fact that UK energy consumers would ultimately pay the eye-watering bill. Osborne offered EDF and CGN a guaranteed price for its electricity of £92.50 per megawatt hour – more than twice the current cost of wholesale power – for a period of 35 years. Critics point out that EDF’s track record of delays and cost overruns at building a new reactor at Flamanville in Normandy is dismal, as is the experience of its reactor designer, Areva, with a new construction at Olkiluoto in Finland. Unnecessary power The biggest cloud over Hinkley, which has grown and grown over the years since the Somerset project was first muted, surrounds whether this kind of inflexible, on-all-the-time nuclear power is really needed now. The rise of renewables such as wind and solar are threatening the whole argument for nuclear, which also has ongoing issues such as how to dispose of radioactive waste and whether they are a vulnerable terrorist target to contend with. Wind farms and solar arrays are fast coming down in price and while they may produce intermittent power, they are relatively quick and easy to construct. The idea that Britain could rely on these new low-carbon technologies was considered ridiculous even three years ago but less so now. They can be relatively easily backed up by gas-fired power stations while a research race for large scale and efficient batteries could eventually allow green power to run 24 hours a day in areas where renewables were located. A new realisation that Britain could reduce demand for power by a variety of energy saving measures has also raised questions about the need for a new generation of massive plants such as Hinkley. The case in favour Credibility Against all this is the sheer credibility of the UK as a home for foreign investment, especially post-Brexit. Telling the French and Chinese to keep their money could have serious consequences, as Beijing is clearly indicating. Alternatives difficult While many Conservative MPs have reservations about Hinkley there is little enthusiasm for a massive drive on wind and solar, whose subsidy levels have been hugely cut back since Ed Davey ran the show for the coalition government. Britain has carbon emission targets to meet and so any alternative strategy for keeping the lights on such as allowing coal-fired power stations to keep on polluting would mean a U-turn on climate change. The stakes are high whichever route is taken. May will be trying to dodge these thorny questions over the next couple of days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2017/sep/16/foxhounds-will-always-kill-foxes-when-hunts-allow-them","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-16T23:05:25Z","webTitle":"Foxhounds will always kill foxes when hunts allow them | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2017/sep/16/foxhounds-will-always-kill-foxes-when-hunts-allow-them","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2017/sep/16/foxhounds-will-always-kill-foxes-when-hunts-allow-them","fields":{"headline":"Letters: foxhounds will always kill foxes when hunts allow them","bodyText":"Joss Hanbury, master of the Quorn hunt, says foxhounds have “been bred for generations to hunt live prey”, giving this as a reason why hunts keep killing foxes, implying that it’s just one of those unfortunate things that can’t be helped (News). If someone’s bull terriers savaged a bull, it would be no good the owner pleading that the breed had been bred for bull-baiting and therefore there wasn’t much he could do to stop them. He would be prosecuted and the dogs might well be destroyed. But hunts take out packs of 30-plus dogs that they state are uncontrollable and take them to coverts almost certain to contain foxes. So foxes get chased and killed and the hunts pretend they thought the hounds were on a non-existent “trail”. I have been a hunt monitor for 23 years and have watched hundreds of hunts. I am convinced that trail hunting does not exist, but is a front for every hunt to continue hunting live quarry, a “cynical subterfuge” in the words of one unusually percipient judge. However, considering its fatuousness, this excuse is remarkably successful at repeatedly getting hunts out of trouble. The National Trust should bear in mind that a landowner allowing illegal hunting to take place can be prosecuted. If it succeeds in crushing the motion to ban all trail hunting on NT land, it will have placed itself in an invidious position. Penny Little Great Haseley Oxfordshire Last chance on climate change The extreme weather that has caused devastation in Florida, Houston, the Caribbean and south-east Asia is symptomatic of climate breakdown, which is happening as a result of global warming caused mainly by the burning of fossil fuels (“Survivors of Irma beg for aid”, News). We have about 15 years to stabilise the atmosphere before climate breakdown becomes unstoppable. It will result in the failure of staple crops in tropical zones, floods, droughts, wars over land and resources such as clean water and chaotic, forced mass migration to temperate parts of the world. The maturing of the renewable energy industry and developments in smart grids and battery storage mean we have a chance to avert climate breakdown. The most effective action we can take is to switch to a 100% renewable energy supplier. Nuclear power is too expensive, too slow to build and too dangerous. Cumbria’s police and crime commissioner recently described Sellafield as a big strategic target for terrorists. This applies to all nuclear power plants. The only sensible future is based on clean, safe, affordable and abundant renewable energy. Anne Dismorr Norwich Pay cap must be lifted for all I read with interest of the looming “winter of discontent” (News). Living in a seaside resort with problems of deprivation, it beggared belief that universal credit was trialled here. I think the disingenuous premise was that if it could work here, it would work anywhere. But this led to severe problems for many. The chancellor cannot rule and divide between public sector workers. The removal of this unfair pay cap needs to apply to all. If this is achieved, we may begin to believe in the government’s tarnished mantra of wanting a society that works for all. Judith A Daniels Great Yarmouth Bell Pottinger reined in too late As an addendum to Catherine Bennett’s article (“PR execs behaving badly…, Comment), it is worth noting that during the Bell Pottinger scandal, the Public Relations and Communications Association did little or nothing to rein in the agency’s shocking activities in South Africa, until its shamefully silent hand was forced. It is legitimate to ask who else within the PRCA membership is enjoying the comfort of a blind eye while they pursue similar immoral activities.

Four years ago, a fire started in the neighbouring Cuming Museum and it and the library have been closed since. Southwark council said it would cost £40m to make safe and yet a private art academy did so for £30,000. In consultation, residents asked for a library – instead, they got this. Admirable as I’m sure the exhibition is, it is under the shadow of the wider gentrification of the Elephant. Did the council deliberately come up with an unworkable figure?

Dieter Helm, an economist at the University of Oxford, has been chosen by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to carry out the review, the Guardian has learned. The Conservative manifesto promised that the resulting report would be the first step towards “competitive and affordable energy costs”. Theresa May is among those in the government taking an interest in the cost-of-energy review, which will examine how power prices can be kept down while meeting the UK’s carbon targets and keeping the lights on. But the choice of Helm, author of a new book on the slow demise of oil companies in the face of energy trends, will be controversial in some quarters because of his criticism of wind and solar power. While acknowledging that renewables are remaking the energy landscape, the professor of energy has criticised the cost of today’s windfarms and solar technology, calling them “expensive” and highlighting the “sheer cost” of electricity generated from renewable sources. Helm has also suggested the existing generation of green energy is not enough to significantly cut emissions. “Current renewables like wind turbines, rooftop solar and biomass stand no serious chance of making much difference to decarbonisation. It’s simply a matter of scale,” he wrote in the Spectator magazine. Instead, Helm believes funding should be directed at next generation renewable technologies, such as more efficient solar panels. He also backs emerging technologies such as smart grids and battery storage. Hannah Martin, head of energy at Greenpeace UK, said: “Dieter has a well-known preference for gas and has historically failed to grasp the full potential of renewables. “At a time when the costs of offshore wind and solar are plummeting this review needs somebody with the vision to grasp the opportunities offered by clean energy to provide jobs, lower bills and slash carbon pollution.” Other figures believed to have been in the frame for the job included Lord Turner, the former chair of a government advisory body, the Committee on Climate Change, who recently told the Guardian that Tory policy on onshore wind power was endangering cheap energy in the UK. However, concerns that the review might be tilted against renewables could be allayed by Helm’s choice of colleagues to work on the report. The Guardian understands that he will be aided by a former boss of the National Grid, Steve Holliday, who is a proponent of decentralised energy including batteries, and Richard Nourse of Greencoat Capital, an investment fund supporting clean energy. Rounding out the proposed team would be Jim Gao, an engineer at an artificial intelligence company, Deepmind, owned by Google, which has been an enthusiastic supporter of renewables. The review will look at all aspects of the energy industry and how they contribute to the cost of electricity, such as new technologies including the rollout of smart meters in millions of homes and the increasing number of electric cars drawing power from the grid. At the heart of the review will be the challenge of addressing the energy trilemma: balancing the UK’s binding carbon targets with affordability and security of supply. The Conservative manifesto said the review would “be asked to make recommendations as to how we can ensure UK energy costs are as low as possible, while ensuring a reliable supply and allowing us to meet our 2050 carbon reduction objective. Our ambition is that the UK should have the lowest energy costs in Europe, both for households and businesses.” The review is due to report its findings to the business secretary, Greg Clark, in the autumn, and is expected to inform the government’s long-term approach to power generation. Helm is also a strong critic of the cost of nuclear power, saying that just to get to the “starting line” of building a new atomic power station in the UK involves a “lengthy, complex and expensive process”. He has also questioned whether any more new nuclear power plants will be built in the UK after Hinkley Point C in Somerset, which the public spending watchdog recently described as a “risky and expensive project”. The new energy minister, Richard Harrington, has said the government is still committed to a new generation of nuclear power stations but Helm’s review could provide a justification for abandoning that ambition on cost grounds. If nuclear and renewables fell out of favour in future government policy, that would leave gas as the only large-scale option for new power, given ministers are committed to phasing out coal. Although Helm told the Guardian he had not been appointed to the role, it is understood he is the government’s preferred choice. While a round of price hikes by energy suppliers last winter led to calls for a cap on prices, the average household bill of £1,160 in 2016 was below 2008 levels because of energy efficiency measures and falling energy demand. The Committee on Climate Change also concluded this year that British households’ energy costs were not high compared with the rest of Europe. A BEIS spokesman said: “As committed to in the industrial strategy green paper, we will commission a review to ensure energy costs are as low as possible while meeting our climate change targets. No decision has been taken on who will undertake this review.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/19/james-hansen-nasa-scientist-climate-change-warning","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-19T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"Ex-Nasa scientist: 30 years on, world is failing 'miserably’ to address climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/19/james-hansen-nasa-scientist-climate-change-warning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/19/james-hansen-nasa-scientist-climate-change-warning","fields":{"headline":"Ex-Nasa scientist: 30 years on, world is failing 'miserably’ to address climate change","bodyText":"Thirty years after a former Nasa scientist sounded the alarm for the general public about climate change and human activity, the expert issued a fresh warning that the world is failing “miserably” to deal with the worsening dangers. While Donald Trump and many conservatives like to argue that climate change is a hoax, James Hansen, the 77-year-old former Nasa climate scientist, said in an interview at his home in New York that the relevant hoax today is perpetrated by those leaders claiming to be addressing the problem. Hansen provided what’s considered the first warning to a mass audience about global warming when, in 1988, he told a US congressional hearing he could declare “with 99% confidence” that a recent sharp rise in temperatures was a result of human activity. Since this time, the world’s greenhouse gas emissions have mushroomed despite repeated, increasingly frantic warnings about civilization-shaking catastrophe, from scientists amassing reams of evidence in Hansen’s wake. “All we’ve done is agree there’s a problem,” Hansen told the Guardian. “We agreed that in 1992 [at the Earth summit in Rio] and re-agreed it again in Paris [at the 2015 climate accord]. We haven’t acknowledged what is required to solve it. Promises like Paris don’t mean much, it’s wishful thinking. It’s a hoax that governments have played on us since the 1990s.” Hansen’s long list of culprits for this inertia are both familiar – the nefarious lobbying of the fossil fuel industry – and surprising. Jerry Brown, the progressive governor of California, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, are “both pretending to be solving the problem” while being unambitious and shunning low-carbon nuclear power, Hansen argues. There is particular scorn for Barack Obama. Hansen says in a scathing upcoming book that the former president “failed miserably” on climate change and oversaw policies that were “late, ineffectual and partisan”. Hansen even accuses Obama of passing up the opportunity to thwart Donald Trump’s destruction of US climate action, by declining to settle a lawsuit the scientist, his granddaughter and 20 other young people are waging against the government, accusing it of unconstitutionally causing peril to their living environment. “Near the end of his administration the US said it would reduce emissions 80% by 2050,” Hansen said. “Our lawsuit demands a reduction of 6% a year so I thought, ‘That’s close enough, let’s settle the lawsuit.’ We got through to Obama’s office but he decided against it. It was a tremendous opportunity. This was after Trump’s election, so if we’d settled it quickly the US legally wouldn’t be able to do the absurd things Trump is doing now by opening up all sorts of fossil fuel sources.” Hansen’s frustrations temper any satisfaction at largely being vindicated for his testimony, delivered to lawmakers on 23 June 1988. Wearing a cream-coloured suit, the soft-spoken son of Iowan tenant farmers hunched over the microphone in Washington to explain that humans had entered a confronting new era. “The greenhouse effect has been detected and it is changing our climate now,” he said. Afterwards, Hansen told reporters: “It is time to stop waffling so much and say that the evidence is pretty strong that the greenhouse effect is here.” He brandished new research that forecast that 1988 was set to be the warmest year on record, as well as projections for future heat under three different emissions scenarios. The world has dutifully followed Hansen’s “scenario B” – we are “smack on it” it, Hansen said last week – with global temperatures jumping by around 1C (1.8F) over the past century. These findings hadn’t occurred in a vacuum, of course – the Irish physicist John Tyndall confirmed that carbon dioxide is a heat-trapping gas in the 1850s. A 1985 scientific conference in Villach, Austria, concluded the temperature rise in the 21st century would be “greater than in any man’s history”. The changes in motion would “affect life on Earth for centuries to come”, the New York Times warned the morning after Hansen’s testimony. Three decades of diplomacy has blossomed into an international consensus, albeit rattled by Trump, that the temperature rise must be curbed to “well below” 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times. But in this time emissions have soared (in 1988, 20bn tons of carbon dioxide was emitted – by 2017 it was 32bn tons) with promised cuts insufficient for the 2C goal. Despite the notable growth of renewable energy such as solar and wind, Hansen believes there is no pathway to salvation without a tax on carbon-producing fuels. “The solution isn’t complicated, it’s not rocket science,” Hansen said. “Emissions aren’t going to go down if the cost of fossil fuels isn’t honest. Economists are very clear on this. We need a steadily increasing fee that is then distributed to the public.” Hansen faced opposition even before his testimony – he recalls a Nasa colleague telling him on the morning of his presentation “no respectable scientist” would claim the world is warming – and faced subsequent meddling and censorship from George HW Bush’s administration. He eventually retired from Nasa in 2013 and promptly reinvented himself as an activist who was arrested, wearing his trademark hat, outside the White House while protesting against the Keystone oil pipeline. The dawdling global response to warming temperatures means runaway climate change now looms. The aspirational 1.5C (2.7F) warming target set in Paris could be surpassed by 2040. Huge amounts of ice from western Antarctica are crashing into the ocean, redrawing forecasts for sea level rise. Some low-lying islands fear extinction. “It’s not too late,” Hansen stressed. “There is a rate of reduction that’s feasible to stay well below 2C. But you just need that price on carbon.” John Holdren, who was Obama’s chief science adviser, told the Guardian that the Paris agreement achieved what was possible without support from Congress and that legally binding lawsuits would be “problematic”. However, he added that while he had reservations about Hansen’s policy ideas he was one of the “true giants” of climate science. “Poor Jim Hansen. He’s a tragic hero,” said Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard academic who studies the history of science. “The Cassandra aspect of his life is that he’s cursed to understand and diagnose what’s going on but unable to persuade people to do something about it. We are all raised to believe knowledge is power but Hansen proves the untruth of that slogan. Power is power.” That power has been most aggressively wielded by fossil fuel companies such as Exxon and Shell which, despite being well aware of the dangers of climate change decades before Hansen’s touchstone moment in 1988, funded a network of groups that ridiculed the science and funded sympathetic politicians. Later, they were to be joined by the bulk of the US Republican party, which now recoils from any action on climate change as heresy. “Obama was committed to action but couldn’t do much with the Congress he had,” Oreskes said. “To blame the Democrats and Obama is to misunderstand the political context. There was a huge, organized network that put forward a message of confusion and doubt.” Climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer, who testified at the same 1988 hearing about sea level rise, said the struggle to confront climate change has been “discouraging”. “The nasty anti-science movement ramped up and now we are way behind.” “I’m convinced we will deal with the problem,” he said. “[But] not before there is an amount of suffering that is unconscionable and should’ve been avoided.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2019/apr/08/oil-prices-high-libya-civil-war-brexit-sterling-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-04-08T14:07:49Z","webTitle":"Oil prices rise to 2019 high as Libya civil war threatens supply – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/apr/08/oil-prices-high-libya-civil-war-brexit-sterling-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2019/apr/08/oil-prices-high-libya-civil-war-brexit-sterling-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Oil prices rise to 2019 high as Libya civil war threatens supply – as it happened","bodyText":"There are four days until the UK leaves the EU, unless something else comes up. Of course, we’ve been here before – as evidenced by Jaguar Land Rover’s factory shutdown, planned when 29 March was still the date of Brexit. Behind the scenes, Labour and the Conservatives have been in contact about a possible Brexit compromise, while Prime Minister Theresa May is preparing for meetings with European leaders about gaining a short extension to the Article 50 negotiation period. In the City, all eyes are on Debenhams and Mike Ashley, ahead of a deadline of 5pm for his attempt to agree a £150m rescue deal in exchange for the role of chief executive of the department store chain. Oil prices remain near the five-month highs hit earlier in the day. Brent crude futures hit a high of $70.86 per barrel, with instability in Libya raising the prospect of further supply constraints at the same time that Opec, the cartel of oil-producing nations, has made cuts to production. The fighting in Libya is nearing the capital of the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli. Khalifa Haftar, a 75-year-old warlord, has seized control of oilfields. You can read here for an explainer of the situation in Libya. Thank you for reading today, and please do come back tomorrow for more coverage of business, economics and the markets. JJ The deadline is getting closer for Debenhams, and a nervous wait for any investors holding out hope that their shares are still worth something. The department store chain has until 5pm to decide if it will accept a £150m rescue deal offered by the Sports Direct boss or give control of the company to its lenders. US stock markets fall at the Wall Street opening bell, with Boeing’s travails weighing particularly on the Dow Jones industrial average. The Dow lost 0.48% at the open, a 127-point fall. The Nasdaq fell by 0.17%, or 14 points; the S&amp;P 500 fell by 0.16%, ending a seven-day winning streak. Sterling has lost a bit more ground against the euro in afternoon trading. The pound fell below €1.1580, representing a 0.3% fall, as Prime Minister Theresa May prepared to meet France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Angela Merkel to argue for a short extension of the Brexit deadline. Against the US dollar the poount was down by 0.1%, at $1.3054. A judge has discharged a jury in a trial against four ex-Barclays executives. You can read some more detail on the trial (10:39am) here: Shares in Boeing are suffering ahead of the opening bell on Wall Street, after the US aircraft manufacturer said it will cut production of its 737 plane. Boeing said on Friday that it would make 20% fewer 737s following two deadly crashes in which malfunctioning safety features may have played a part, according to investigators. Premarket trading on Monday indicated that the company’s share price has fallen by about 4.8%. Boeing’s 737 Max jets have been grounded around the world following the crash of jets owned by Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air. In both crashes the pilots are thought to have attempted unsuccessfully to override safety features. Labour is hinting that there could be movement on Brexit talks today. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the “ball is in the government’s court” on a possible compromise. That comes after Conservative party hardliners Mark Francois and Andrew Bridgen, among the most strident voices in favour of leaving the EU without a deal, wrote letters to the chair of the party’s backbench committee calling for a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Theresa May. Follow all of the latest political developments here: Futures are pointing to a lower open for the main US stock market indices, following the tepid start to the week from European shares. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 index futures point to a 0.1% fall at the Wall Street opening bell, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is set to fall by 0.2%. It’s mostly quiet on the markets front halfway through the trading day in London. Shares in housebuilder Redrow are the biggest riser on the FTSE 350, up by 7% after it confirmed the previously announced return of £111m to shareholders via a share issue and buyback. Pharma company Indivior rose by 5% after it announced new data on an opioid addiction treatment. On the FTSE 100 the biggest mover was hospital provider NMC Health, which fell by 3.8%, followed by takeaway ordering platform Just East, down by 2.5%. Gold miner Fresnillo and grocery logistics firm Ocado were the only FTSE 100 companies who had gained more than 1% at the time of writing. New laws proposed to tackle social media companies streaming child abuse, extremism, terrorist attacks and cyberbullying have been welcomed by senior police and children’s charities. Launched on Monday, the Online Harms white paper outlines what the government says are tough new laws for internet companies and the ability to enforce them, write Sandra Laville and Alex Hern. Social media companies will have a mandatory “duty of care”, requiring firms to “take reasonable steps to keep their users safe and tackle illegal and harmful activity on their services”, the government said. You can find more detail and reaction here: London’s ultra-low emission zone came into force when Big Ben tolled midnight last night, meaning that drivers of more polluting vehicles in the centre of the capital will have to pay £12.50 a day. The charge, brought in on top of the separate congestion charge by mayor Sadiq Khan to combat air pollution, rises to £100 for buses, coaches and lorries. It will apply to traffic within the red ring in the map below. However, more Britons outside the capital may have to get used to the limits. Areas inside the north and south circular are set to be covered from 2021, while Birmingham and Leeds have said they will introduce clean air zones in 2020, and Manchester plans to follow suit. Health campaigners have stepped up calls for other cities to introduce the plans, writes the Guardian’s Sarah Boseley. Lower sales and a premature Brexit shutdown at Jaguar Land Rover, the UK’s biggest carmaker (albeit one owned by India’s Tata Motors). JLR’s four main UK manufacturing sites – at Castle Bromwich, Solihull and Wolverhampton in the West Midlands, and Halewood in Merseyside – which employ 18,500 people, are closed from Monday until Friday. The production shutdown at Britain’s biggest carmaker is in addition to its usual Easter closure, which runs from next week until 23 April. The extension was agreed with staff in January to prepare for potential Brexit disruption, when the UK’s scheduled departure date from the EU was 29 March. There’s more detail from the Guardian’s Julia Kollewe here: Brexit-watchers are not the only people waiting for white smoke today: Debenhams shareholders will find out by 5pm whether retail impresario Mike Ashley has any hope of securing a takeover. If a deal with Ashley’s Sports Direct is not agreed it is likely that Debenhams’ creditors will tonight put the group into “pre-pack administration”, which would wipe out the value of Sports Direct’s stake of nearly 30% in the department store. Over the weekend Debenhams issued four conditions Ashley would have to agree to if he wanted to extend the deadline and give more time for a deal. Sports Direct agreed to underwrite a £150m rescue rights issue if Debenhams agreed to make him chief executive ahead of the 8 April. Sports Direct also said this morning that it wants Debenhams’ lenders to write off £148m in debts. Ashley, it is fair to say, did not take Debenhams’ conditions on the rescue deal well. “For the avoidance of doubt, it is Sports Direct’s contention that the board of Debenhams and its advisors have undertaken a sustained programme of falsehoods and denials. The fact that they can so openly lie in their recollection of joint meetings with Sports Direct is beyond the pale,” the company said. Will we get some movement on Brexit today? Possibly, as talks between Labour and the Conservatives continue. Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt this morning hinted that the government would be open to a customs union compromsie, saying there would be no point having talks with Labour if the government was constrained by “big red lines”. Asked if accepting a customs union would be the price for a deal with Labour, he said: Well, we don’t have a majority in parliament, and so we have to look to other parties to seek agreement that will allow us to get Brexit over the line in parliament as the law requires. You can’t go into any of those discussions with big red lines because otherwise there’s no point in having them, but we are very clear about the type of Brexit that we want. That’s in our manifesto, and we’ve made that clear. Prime Minister Theresa May is “leaving no stone unturned to try and resolve Brexit”, he added. You can follow all of the day’s political twists and turns with the Guardian’s Andrew Sparrow here: May is currently enjoying/enduring her 1,000th day as prime minister, although given her vow to resign soon she may quite not be popping the champagne corks. A London jury has been dismissed in a landmark fraud trial of four former Barclays executives accused of paying Qatar undisclosed fees to help rescue the bank at the height of the credit crisis in 2008. Judge Robert Jay told the jury at Southwark Crown Court on Monday he was required to discharge them. Halfway through the trading morning in London in a truly momentous week for the future of the British economy, and currency markets... ... are barely moving. Sterling is down by 0.05% against the euro at €1.1612. Against the US dollar it is much the same story: a pound will buy you $1.3048. The FTSE 100 is down by 0.2%, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 is faring slightly less, down by 0.27%. Oil prices are still holding up, however. Futures for West Texas Intermediate crude, the North American benchmark, are up by 0.5% today at $63.38 per barrel. The North Sea benchmark, Brent crude, is also up by 0.5%, at $70.69 per barrel. The activist investor targeting a board seat at Barclays has written another letter to shareholders in an attempt to gain support. Edward Bramson, the founder of Sherborne Investors, is trying to force Barclays to move capital away from its underperforming investment banking division to more profitable activities. The bank has so far stood firm behind its investment bank, which services large corporations and investors, but last month Barclays chief executive Jes Staley took personal control of the division, forcing out previous boss Tim Throsby. “In view of Barclays’ most recent announcements of sudden management realignments and departures, we believe that Mr. Bramson’s experience and temperament would be a strongly stabilising influence on the board,” the letter from Sherborne to Barclays shareholders said. Bramson is not the only investor questioning the outlook for Barclays: the investor played by Steve Carell in The Big Short has bet that shares in the bank will fall. Eurozone investor confidence has improved thanks to positive signs from China, according to the widely followed survey by Sentix. The headline Sentix measure rose to -0.3 points for April, the highest since November, after a reading of -2.2 points in the previous month. Manfred Hübner, managing director at Sentix, said: Economic observers are currently focusing their attention strongly on China. The signs in China are increasingly pointing to an upswing. Should there be an additional settlement in the trade dispute with the USA, the second economically robust region of the world economy, the European economy could also see a turnaround. However, the European economy remains “fragile”, he added. The Eurozone economy is losing momentum, but the rate of the decline is slowing. And he gave Britons a welcome reminder that not everything revolves around Brexit, with the trade dispute between China and Donald Trump’s White House the major driver for investors in the next few months. Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, Khalid al-Falih, this morning suggested that further production cuts may not be necessary, given the increase in prices. At a conference on Monday Al-Falih said the oil market was “moving towards balance”. Falih said he did not “think we need to” when asked if the kingdom was prepared to make additional cuts to support the oil market. Al-Falih also said that demand for the first international bond from Saudi’s state-owned oil company, Aramco, had hit $30bn. Aramco, which is thought by many to be the world’s largest company, is raising cash ahead of a delayed initial public offering. Let’s take another look at the oil market, with Brent crude prices at their highest point of the year so far. Futures prices have risen from just over $50 per barrel before Christmas to almost $71 on Monday. The higher prices have come thanks to multiple factors weighing on supply, including cuts in production from Opec (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and stronger US jobs data than had been expected. On top of that, the deteriorating Libyan situation has added more impetus for higher prices. While not quite at the top table of the world’s oil producers, Libya is still a large supplier, meaning that its civil war is closely watched in oil markets. Libya was the 20th largest petroleum producer in 2018, at more than a million barrels per day, according to the US Energy Information Adminstration. Over the weekend eastern Libyan military commander Khalifa Haftar mounted an assault on Tripoli, the capital, and the United Nations-backed government there. You can read more detail on the battle here: Centrica is leading the FTSE 100 after reports of a potential buyer for its UK nuclear power reactors. Shares rose by 0.6% after the Telegraph reported that Greencoat Capital is in talks to launch a fund to target a £4bn sell-off of a minority stake in seven reactors from EDF Energy and Centrica. Other risers include miners Antofagasta and Fresnillo, but shares overall have fallen by 0.3% on London’s main index. Private hospitals firm NMC Health is the biggest faller, down by 3.5%. Carlos Ghosn’s final exit from Nissan, the Japanese carmaker which he was widely credited with reviving, has been completed, with his removal from the board. Nissan shareholders voted to remove Ghosn at an extraordinary general meeting at a Tokyo hotel, the latest development in a scandal which began with his arrest in November on charges of underreporting his income to regulators. Ghosn’s troubles have broadened in recent weeks. Renault, the French carmaker whose alliance with Nissan Ghosn led, reported him to French authorities and Japanese prosecutors then rearrested him. He remains in detention in Tokyo. Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa opened the meeting with a speech outlining the allegations against his former mentor, accusing him of misusing funds and seeking to conceal his compensation. He and other executives bowed deeply before the thousands of shareholders at the meeting as it opened.

Exports decreased by 1.3% in February, Germany’s Federal Statistical Office reported, lower than the 0.5% fall predicted by economists. Imports fell by 1.6%, after rising by 1.4% the month before. Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany, said it is clear that the German economy is “still struggling”. The export sector had been on a rollercoaster ride through all of 2018, with problems in emerging markets, trade tensions between the US and China, US protectionism, a possible cooling of the Chinese economy and increasing fears of a hard Brexit. There simply seem to be too many crises in global trade for the German export sector to defy all of them at the same time. However, he added that the outlook may be more positive if geopolitics take a turn for the better. Recent real-time indicators suggest a rebound in global trade since the start of the year and relief in the trade tensions between the US and China should also benefit German exports. The FTSE 100 has started the day with barely a murmur. London’s blue-chip index is down by 0.05%. Europe’s other main stock markets have fallen. Germany’s Dax fell by 0.25% after relatively weak trade data. Spain’s Ibex fell by 0.2%, but France’s Cac 40 was flat at the open. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The start of 2019 was marked by fears that a long-expected slowdown in the global economy would finally come around, weighing on oil demand. However, supply constraints have sustained prices, with futures for the Brent crude benchmark back above $70 per barrel at the start of the week. Futures prices rose by 0.5% to a high of $70.78 early on Monday as traders priced in lower output from Libya, where fighting in the long-running civil war has escalated, threatening the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli. The Libyan instability coincided with relatively strong US jobs data on Friday, supply cuts from Opec, the oil-producing nations’ cartel, and sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. James McCormick, global head of desk strategy at Natwest Markets, pointed out that Brent crude futures moved above the 200-day moving average at the end of last week, a signal of bullish sentiment. He said: The upside risks in crude oil prices [...] are being realised. Sterling markets were fairly stable in early trading, but don’t count on it remaining that way. The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 11pm on Friday unless something else comes up – a fact that will undoubtedly drive the news week. Take a look at this shaky-cam video from the prime minister for a sign of just how strange the current political situation is. With just a hint of understatement, Guy Stear and Klaus Baader, analysts at Société Générale, said: This week is likely to be overshadowed by events relating to Brexit. Another short extension has been requested by the UK, but the EU may prefer a longer delay while setting strict conditions and requiring participation in the EU parliament elections.

The two nations technically remain in a state of war, since a peace treaty was never signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, and this meeting could touch on a formal truce. It will also be focused on preparing the ground for US president Donald Trump to meet Kim in May or June. Here is everything you need to know about the historic meeting. What is happening? Kim and Moon will meet in Panmunjom, a village in the joint security areas on the heavily militarised border between the two neighbours. The eyes of the world will be on the summit and its tone will have a major impact on any meeting between Kim and Trump. Why is it important? This is only the second time Kim will meet another head of state, after a brief trip to China last month. This is also the first time in a decade that South Korea is led by a liberal government that wants to actively engage with the North. In many ways, Moon has been preparing for engagement with North Korea for most of his career. “The Inter-Korean summit is like the opening move in chess. How you play it sets up the other possible moves that come after it,” said Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who worked on North Korea policy. “So the Inter-Korean summit’s significance lies primarily in what atmosphere it creates and what expectations it reinforces heading into the next move, which is the Trump-Kim summit.” What’s the history? North and South Korea have been divided since the end of the Korean War, and except for about a decade ending in 2008, relations between the two have remained frosty. There have been occasional outbreaks of violence, most recently in 2010 when 50 people were killed when a South Korean navy corvette was sunk and several islands close to the border were attacked. This is also not the first time North Korea has expressed a willingness to abandon its nuclear ambitions. A deal with the US, Japan and South Korea in the 1990s was meant to give the North civilian nuclear power without the ability to build a weapon, but the reactor was never finished. North Korea pledged to relinquish its nuclear programme in 2007 in exchange for sanctions relief and fuel, but later pulled out of that agreement and expelled inspectors in 2009. Why now? Kim feels he has developed his nuclear and missile programmes to sufficient degree that they act as a deterrent against any attack and give North Korea significant negotiating power. “Kim Jong-un is trying to repair the relations that have really deteriorated over the last few years while they developed nuclear weapons,” said Jenny Town, the assistant director of the US-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. In his new year’s address, Kim extended an olive branch and offered to participate the Winter Olympics, which was held in South Korea in February. That participation led to a series of meetings culminating in this months summit and a planned meeting between Kim and Trump. What do both sides want? Both leader’s interests are broadly aligned. They want to claim the summit as a success and both sides know the real goal is an agreement between the US and the North. Seoul has also suggested it could try to replace the current armistice agreement with a formal peace treaty, but it wants the North to agree to denuclearise. “For Moon, the summit is valuable because it makes it harder for the United States or North Korea to escalate tensions and gives him a lever to push both countries toward Moon’s ultimate goal: a comprehensive US-North Korea deal,” Oba said. “For Kim, it’s a way of increasing his options, putting pressure on the United States to deal with him on his terms, and convincing the world he is acting in good faith so that the blame for any future setbacks will be on the United States and not North Korea.” Kim will also likely be looking for relief from the sanctions currently imposed on his country. “North Korea will be focusing on repairing diplomatic ties and figuring out how they can repair their economy,” Town said. “Moon also wants to look at restarting Inter-Korea economic cooperation.” What are the possible outcomes? While North Korea has repeatedly signalled it is willing to give up its nuclear weapons, the conditions for that to happen may be too high a price to pay for the US and its allies. “The worst case scenario is learning the North Korean definition of denuclearization is untenable with international community’s expectations,” Town said. “When they think of denuclearization, they think it will come about over decades.” “It’s also dependent on having good relations with the US, and North Korea has seen the US pull out of many international agreements, so they won’t trust a simple promise, they want to build trust over time.” Kim is acutely aware of the fate of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, who gave up his weapons programmes only to have European and US forces bomb the country during an uprising against him. Other possibilities include a meeting relatively light on substance, focused on building goodwill between both sides and positive photo opportunities instead of touching on issues that could cause conflict. What comes next? There is little chance of a concrete agreement of any kind resulting from the summit. Beginning negotiations with a meeting between the two leaders, before any details have been hammered out, is always risky. The meeting will likely be followed by months, if not years, of negotiations at the lower levels before anything is signed. “They’ll likely come away with good intentions but not necessarily sustainable policies,” said Town."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/mar/21/boris-johnson-compares-russian-world-cup-to-hitlers-1936-olympics","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-21T16:40:48Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson compares Russian World Cup to Hitler's 1936 Olympics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/21/boris-johnson-compares-russian-world-cup-to-hitlers-1936-olympics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/mar/21/boris-johnson-compares-russian-world-cup-to-hitlers-1936-olympics","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson compares Russian World Cup to Hitler's 1936 Olympics","bodyText":"Boris Johnson has predicted Vladimir Putin will revel in the World Cup in Russia this summer in the same way that Adolf Hitler did in the Olympic Games in Berlin in 1936, and suggested the UK may advise English football fans to avoid travelling to the tournament for their own safety. The foreign secretary said about a quarter of the number of fans who travelled to watch England in Brazil in 2014 were currently expected to go to Russia. He said 24,000 people had purchased tickets, as opposed to 94,000 at the same point in the run-up to the tournament in Brazil. Johnson revealed that the British diplomat responsible for liaising with UK fans had been thrown out as part of the diplomatic expulsions in the wake of the poisoning of a Russian former spy, Sergei Skripal. Russia has also said it is closing the British consulate in St Petersburg, restricting the ability of the UK embassy to help visitors in the event of violence. Johnson said he would be seeking urgent assurances from Russia that it would fulfil its obligations under the World Cup contract to ensure the safety of fans. “I think it is up to the Russians to give us an undertaking that they will be safe,” he said. Both Russia and England have a history of violent football fans, and the risk of fierce fighting between the two sets of fans appears to be higher given the political tensions. The Russian foreign ministry responded to Johnson’s remarks by saying he was “poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness”. It said: “It’s scary to remember that this person represents the political leadership of a nuclear power.” Johnson was speaking to the all-party foreign affairs select committee and responding to remarks from the Labour MP Ian Austin, who called for England to pull out of the World Cup altogether. “Putin is going to use it in the way Hitler used the 1936 Olympics,” Austin said. Johnson replied: “I think that your characterisation of what is going to happen in Moscow, the World Cup, in all the venues – yes, I think the comparison with 1936 is certainly right. It is an emetic prospect of Putin glorying in this sporting event”. However, he said he did not think it would be fair to ban the England team from competing. Austin described Putin as a KGB “thug” who had enriched himself. Johnson said he did not believe Putin had been re-elected in a free and fair election, saying there had been no true competitive choice. Johnson again rejected Moscow’s assertion that it had nothing to do with the attack on Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, on 4 March. He said: “No matter how exactly it came to be done, the pathway, the chain of responsibility seems to me to go back to the Russian state and those at the top.” A Russian official said on Wednesday that Moscow would not accept the results of an inquiry into the source of the poison being undertaken by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. At a televised briefing to Moscow-based diplomats, Vladimir Yermakov, a deputy head of the foreign affairs ministry’s department for non-proliferation, said: “It is not possible to evaluate what happened in Salisbury within the framework of the [chemical weapons] convention and within the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Deeper expert evaluations will be needed, and in any case we need to conduct our own investigations for Russia to be able to draw any conclusions.” He suggested the UK was “hiding facts” about the case that may later “disappear”. A sometimes flustered Yermakov was confronted at the briefing by diplomats from the UK, France, the US, Slovakia and Sweden all separately challenging the Russian handling of the case. The British diplomat, Emma Nottingham, accused the Russians of having “a record of state-sponsored assassinations”. Yermakov responded: “Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? Pull yourselves away a little bit from your Russophobia and your island mentality.” EU heads of state will meet on Thursday and express solidarity with the UK over the Skripal attack but will not directly ascribe responsibility to Russia. The EU council president, Donald Tusk, said the EU would agree “to increase our resilience to hybrid threats such as undermining trust in our democracies through fake news or election meddling”. He said he was in “no mood to celebrate Putin’s election” – remarks designed to contrast strongly with a gushing letter of praise to the Russian leader from the EU commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. Differences across the EU mean no new Russian sanctions will be proposed at least until clearer liability emerges from either the British police or OPCW investigations. Johnson said he had been struck by “the mountain of disgust globally” directed at Russia and claimed the UK had been picked on for standing up to Russia on human rights, Syria and Ukraine. Russia for its part suffered “a revanchiste bitter feeling about the way the cold war ended”, leading Putin “to want to cause trouble wherever he can”, he said. He said the UK would crack down on Russian oligarchs living in “big schlosses in fashionable districts of London”, so long as there was evidence that their funds had been gained illicitly or corruptly. Johnson said he was prepared to investigate whether wealthy Russians were sending money back to Moscow through Russian debt bond auctions.

Jean-Bernard Levy, the chief executive of EDF, said on Friday he had no doubt about the government’s support for the £18bn project. The board of EDF approved Hinkley Point C by 10 votes to seven at a meeting on Thursday, but the UK government then announced it would conduct another review of the controversial project and announce its decision in the early autumn. Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, said the government would “now consider carefully all the component parts of this project”. However, Levy played down the delay. “There is no comment to make. The statement made by Mr Clark is perfectly clear,” he said. “I have no doubt about the support of the British government led by Mrs May.” Nonetheless, Levy confirmed he had not been warned about the government’s review and only found out when he saw the announcement on the internet. EDF’s UK chief executive, Vincent De Rivaz, was expected in Somerset on Friday morning alongside senior company officials to give interviews about the project. The event was cancelled after the government’s unexpected intervention. The Guardian understands that there would have been no review under the former government, led by David Cameron and with Amber Rudd as energy secretary, as a decision had already been made to sign off the project. Sources stressed that this response had come from the new prime minister, Theresa May, and her new ministerial team. May’s joint chief of staff, Nick Timothy, criticised the project last year because of the funding it was receiving from China. China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) has taken a 33% stake in the project alongside EDF. Timothy wrote on the ConservativeHome website in October 2015, that it was “baffling” that the government was allowing Chinese state firms to invest in sensitive infrastructure and that “rational concerns about national security are being swept to one side because of the desperate desire for Chinese trade and investment”. He claimed security experts were worried the Chinese could build weaknesses into computer systems that would allow them to “shut down Britain’s energy production at will” and argued against giving a “hostile state” access to the UK’s critical infrastructure. China has reiterated its commitment to Hinkley Point C despite the review and the fact a delegation had flown to the UK this week to sign contracts. A CGN spokesman said: “We respect the new government’s need to familiarise itself with a project as important to the UK’s future energy security as Hinkley Point C and we stand ready to help the government in this respect. CGN remains committed to delivering this much-needed nuclear capacity with our strategic partners, EDF, and providing the UK with safe, reliable and sustainable energy.” Ian Liddell-Grainger, the local Conservative MP for whose constituency includes the Hinkley Point nuclear power stations, added: “I am 100% sure this is going to happen, I am 100% sure it is going to be signed, and 100% sure that we will build it on time on budget.” He argued that Rudd as energy secretary, as well as Andrea Leadsom, who was a minister of state in the department, had time to understand the project and be positive about it. Clark, he added, was only two weeks into his job, and the prime minister was considered in her manner. “Knowing Theresa May, she is a formidably lady who makes up her own mind,” he added. “When you send her things she questions it, and it is always her who responds. That is how she ticks.” But a Conservative pressure group on the left of the party said ministers should use this opportunity to back out. Ben Caldecott, associate fellow at Bright Blue, said: “The government should abandon Hinkley C – pursuing it in light of all the evidence of cost reductions in other technologies would be deeply irresponsible. We need a new Plan A. “This must be focused on bringing forward sufficient renewables, electricity storage, and energy efficiency to more than close any gap left in the late 2020s by Hinkley not proceeding. This would be sensible, achievable and cheap.” Shares in EDF rose more than 10% in France on Friday on the back of the delay and better-than-expected financial results. Trade union leaders in France have said Hinkley Point could financially ruin the company, which has net debts of more than €37bn (£31bn). The government’s new review was met with fierce criticism from trade unions in the UK. The construction of Hinkley Point C is expected to create 25,000 jobs. The GMB called the decision “bewildering and bonkers”. Justin Bowden, GMB national secretary for energy, said: “After years of procrastination, what is required is decisive action not dithering and more delay. This unnecessary hesitation is putting finance for the project in doubt and 25,000 new jobs at risk immediately after Brexit. It is a gross error of judgment and must be reversed.” Barry Gardiner, the shadow energy secretary, said the decision for a review at the 11th hour “sends the most appalling message out to investors”. He told the Guardian: “The government says we are open for business but it says to investors we will dally with you for 10 years, we will give an indicative contract and then after a final decision, when the chairman has been authorised to come and sign, you pull the plug and say we will take another three months.” Gardiner pointed out that both May and Clarke had been in the cabinet that agreed to push ahead with the plans. He said that Labour had warned about the contract for years, but argued that the way it had been handled showed either that ministers had been incompetent or that it was a deliberate decision. And if it was deliberate, then that is staggering, an incredibly aggressive act,” he added. He said Britain needed to retain relationships with European partners in a bid to retain single market access. “This is not a time to be making enemies, and particularly not of the French.” The CBI said the government needed to show that Britain was open for business. Josh Hardie, the CBI deputy director-general, said: “While it is understandable the government wants to get to grips with the details of the Hinkley contract, it must press ahead to finalise the deal as soon as possible. “The UK is facing a major investment challenge to ensure a secure, low-carbon and affordable energy supply. It’s crucial that we see clear and timely decisions, and send a definite message that the UK is well and truly open for business.” However, Simon Walker, the director-general of the Institute of Directors, said the delay by the new government was sensible. “Considering the vast scale of this project, and the high price asked for the power generated, it is only sensible for Greg Clark to pause before making his decision,” he said. “The IoD is a firm supporter of building new nuclear plants to generate reliable, low-carbon energy, but the government is right to scrutinise the value of such long-term investments carefully.” French energy unions reacted angrily to EDF giving the go-ahead for Hickley Point C, saying it was a political decision. A joint union statement said the decision had been made “against the unanimous opinion of the staff representative and passed using force, an unusual step in the history of the company”. EDF’s central committee is taking legal action in an attempt to suspend the company’s decision. A hearing is expected on 2 August. A second legal attempt will be considered by judges on 22 September. “Such a project cannot be carried out or succeed against the will of the unions and staff,” said the union statement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/sep/12/carbon-free-plants-nuclear-energy-future-power-state-sources","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-12T21:00:36Z","webTitle":"Can our need for a carbon-free future override our fears of nuclear energy?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/12/carbon-free-plants-nuclear-energy-future-power-state-sources","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/12/carbon-free-plants-nuclear-energy-future-power-state-sources","fields":{"headline":"Can our need for a carbon-free future override our fears of nuclear energy?","bodyText":"Nestled between Chattanooga and Knoxville, Tennessee, the Watts Bar 2 nuclear power plant sits on 1,700 acres in an area friendly to nuclear power. It’s near Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which might be best remembered for its work on the Manhattan Project. The 1,150-megawatt plant is undergoing testing to go fully online this month, and will join the existing 1,100-megawatt Watts Bar plant, which already provides 650,000 area homes with electricity that emits zero carbon emissions. When Watts Bar 2 is fully operational, it will be the 100th operating nuclear power plant in the US, the country with the most nuclear power stations in the world. Watts Bar 2 is making history for being the first nuclear power plant to be built in the US in two decades. Its existence also happens at a time when the role of nuclear power in the country’s energy future is uncertain. While states such as California are shutting down nuclear power plants over safety concerns, other states see nuclear power playing an important role in their march to replace fossil fuels with energy sources that emit little or no emissions. Georgia and South Carolina, for example, are currently building plants. The number of states that support nuclear is by no means high. Although 29 states have renewable energy goals, until recently, only Indiana and Ohio expressly included nuclear energy in those strategies. But other states are starting to craft plans to subsidize nuclear power generation, which accounts for 20% of the nation’s total electricity production. Unlike coal and natural gas plants that emit carbon emissions while producing electricity, nuclear generates none and accounts for 63% of the country’s zero-emission electricity, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), a nuclear power advocacy group. New York recently joined the two other states by including nuclear as part of its clean energy plan, which calls for 50% of its electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030. The move illustrates the difficulties of reaching the goal with renewables such as solar and wind alone. “If you think of the time it will take to make those renewable additions, we are digging the hole too deep on carbon emissions and losing time. New York did the right thing,” said Paul Meier, an environmental engineer at Blumont Engineering Solutions, specializing in modeling energy and emissions scenarios. The new plan also includes an unusual subsidy program to pay struggling nuclear plant owners more for the power. The subsidy program reflects a major shift in energy planning in an era of historically low natural gas prices, increased availability of renewable energy and new technology development to generate and deliver electricity more efficiently. New York experiment What makes New York’s subsidy program unique is it’s the first time that nuclear power will receive the same environmental and social benefits ascribed to wind and solar, said Gene Grecheck, former president of the American Nuclear Society, a professional organization of engineers and scientists and a current co-chair of a committee at the society that advises state policy makers. Unlike wind and solar energy which receive hefty federal and state subsidies, nuclear providers have not seen the same support despite providing a consistent, large scale and reliable carbon-free energy. The enormous cost of developing a nuclear power plant and safety concerns that grew out of the three melting Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactors in Japan in 2011 have made nuclear seem a risky option for addressing climate change. Each nuclear power plant could take around $10bn and 10 years to develop and build, said Matt Crozat, NEI’s senior director of business policy. Justifying that cost is tough at a time when natural gas doesn’t have the same risk profile, and its price is low. The US Energy Information Administration estimates the cost for producing electricity averages $56.40 per megawatt hour at new, basic natural gas plants and $99.70 per megawatt hour at nuclear plants. The production costs, which take into account tax credits, average $50.90 per megawatt hour for wind power and $58.2 per megawatt hour for energy from solar panels. As a result, nuclear is a particularly expensive energy in states that allow multiple electricity retailers to do business in the same region. A utility that buys nuclear power will likely have to raise the price it charges and become a less desirable option. In states that allow utilities monopolies, such as California, the utilities need to justify the higher rates when they seek state approval to charge customers more, but they don’t have to worry about competition. Since 2013, about 13 nuclear plants around the country have been or are slated for shutdown, largely because of low natural gas prices and the rise of renewable energy, NEI said. California plans to close its last nuclear power plant in about nine years. Illinois has not come up a plan to avoid early retirement for two plants. Nebraska’s nuclear plant will close, said Edward Kee, chief executive officer of the Nuclear Economics Consulting Group. Ohio is trying to come up with a plan to keep its Davis-Besse nuclear plant going. Under the new program, New York is requiring its energy suppliers to start, in April 2017, to pay to pay a premium for nuclear energy because of its environmental benefit. The higher revenues will make two of New York’s plants profitable and help the third at least break even, said Lela Jgerenaia, US power market analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. In 2015, the average wholesale electricity prices for the two plants ranged from $22.49 per megawatt hour to $39.36 per megawatt hour. The average cost of running nuclear power plants nationwide is about $35 per megawatt hour to run, Kee said. If the three struggling plants in New York closed today, the state’s carbon emissions would increase by more than 31m metric tons during the next two years, resulting in public health and other societal costs of at least $1.4bn, the governor’s office said. In the first two years of the 12-year program, the credits are forecast to cost about $1bn and raise residential power bills by less than $2 a month, the office added. Geoffrey Heal, professor at Columbia Business School with a focus on environmental economics, applauds New York’s decision to create the zero-carbon emission credits, rather than seek to close and replace them with natural gas plants. “If you really want to reduce carbon substantially – and the US stated in its Paris (climate agreement) submission that it would like for these carbon emissions to be down 80% by 2050 – that would mean basically taking all fossil fuels out of electricity production. If you’re going to go carbon free in power generation, you have to have wind, solar and nuclear,” Heal said. Nuclear is tough to love Whether New York will lead other states to use emissions credits to support nuclear power is too early to tell, Grecheck said. Public opposition to nuclear has historically played a role in prolonging the time and cost of developing a power plant. But lately, some environmentalists believe climate change is so far gone they’re willing to overlook the pitfalls of nuclear, including the headache with disposing of toxic nuclear waste. For Bob Brecha, professor and research director for the Hanley Sustainability Institute at University of Dayton in Ohio, the best role currently for nuclear is to be a substitute for fossil fuels until wind and solar, along with technology to store these intermittent energy sources, can meet 100% of the power needs. Environmental objection remains strong for groups such as the Sierra Club, which opposes to the nuclear provision in New York’s clean energy plan. “It does not make sense to force New York’s consumers to buy expensive, dangerous nuclear power when real clean energy options are available for less, and with costs continuing to fall,” said John Coequyt, global climate policy director, for Sierra Club. Unless natural gas prices go up, the future of new nuclear production may only occur in states, such as Georgia and North Carolina, that allow electric monopolies, said Christopher Muir, utilities analyst at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Georgia and South Carolina are two states currently building plants. Southern Company’s $8bn Vogtle plant in Georgia will be the largest US nuclear plant when it’s scheduled to open by 2020. The Vogtle Power Plant in Georgia, majority owned by Southern Company, will be the largest US nuclear plant when it’s scheduled to open by 2020. Southern Company’s share of the project is estimated at $8bn, and some estimates place the entire price tag at $21bn. “Completing the new units at Plant Vogtle remains the best cost option for meeting Georgia’s future energy needs – once the new units come online they will put downward pressure on customer rates and provide reliable, carbon-free energy for 60 to 80 years,” said Craig Bell, spokesman for Georgia Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"science/blog/2017/jun/28/climate-change-energy-problem-lets-talk-honestly-about-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-28T15:02:50Z","webTitle":"Climate change is an energy problem, so let's talk honestly about nuclear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/jun/28/climate-change-energy-problem-lets-talk-honestly-about-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/blog/2017/jun/28/climate-change-energy-problem-lets-talk-honestly-about-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Climate change is an energy problem, so let's talk honestly about nuclear","bodyText":"Of all the hazards facing humankind, climate change is the single greatest threat we have ever faced. In a few short decades, we have altered the climate more than we ever thought possible and now, in the midst of the greatest heatwave recorded in decades in the hottest year on record, we are finally beginning to countenance the scale of problem before us. The poorest of the poor have been the first to suffer – droughts and food shortages are already imperilling the lives of countless millions, with ensuing conflicts threatening even more. We have rendered some areas uninhabitable, and the number of climate refugees will only increase. Even we privileged folk in the western world are no longer immune, with the dangers steadily encroaching. The vast majority of the carbon and greenhouse gases we spew into the atmosphere are generated by our need for energy, prompting the late Prof Sir David MacKay to observe that “the climate problem is mostly an energy problem”. Clearly then, we must reduce our carbon emissions drastically, and it is likely that nuclear power will play a substantial role in this endeavour. Yet despite the pressing nature of the problem, there are few topics as consistently contentious as the one of nuclear power, and the long history of opposition to it cannot be ignored. Fears about nuclear energy run deep: the 1986 Chernobyl disaster remains a towering linchpin in anti-nuclear narratives, presented as an irrefutable case that nuclear energy is inherently unsafe. These claims are so profoundly entrenched that it is almost accepted as common knowledge that the Chernobyl disaster killed thousands. Yet, as I’ve written here before, these claims do not stand up to scrutiny and persist in the face of report after report to the contrary. Years of subsequent investigation place the death toll of the disaster at approximately 43 people, with deleterious health effects failing to materialise at any appreciable rate. That this information is surprising to many is indicative of quite how polarised the discussion on such a vital topic has been. Much of the reason for this is ideological – Greenpeace is but one organisation that has been criticised for releasing misleading anti-nuclear information, claiming that up to 200,000 deaths are attributable to Chernobyl. This figure has been roundly debunked, but predictably strikes fear into the public conscience, encouraging panic in place of reason. The more recent 2011 Fukushima disaster has been become a similar focus for nuclear panic, despite the fact that no one has died nor is ever likely to from this event. The spectre of the plant looms so large in the public consciousness that we have seemingly forgotten that the cause of the meltdown was a massive tsunami that claimed about 16,000 lives, itself potentially exacerbated by climate change. There is a dark irony then in the fact that the ensuing kneejerk reaction led to the closure of Germany’s nuclear plants and their replacement with heavily polluting coal plants. Some of this is undoubtedly due to the legacy of the cold war, where the US and the USSR built nuclear weapons of unimaginable destruction, aiming them at one another and edging the entire world to the brink of nuclear Armageddon. Indeed, the list of close calls shows just how close we came to mass destruction, and makes for terrifying reading. That the spectre of the cold war still haunts our discussions on the topic is completely understandable, even though nuclear energy and nuclear weapons operate on entirely different principles. Yet simply dismissing concerns about nuclear energy as unfounded is not productive, nor is it honest. Nuclear energy may be the most efficient and clean source we have, but it is complicated and like any energy source, it is not devoid of complications. Nuclear waste is one aspect of this – nuclear byproducts and legacy waste can remain radioactive for centuries, and have to be carefully stored and managed to avoid any potential contamination. And while the risk to human health is generally low to nonexistent, safely storing such materials is a challenging engineering problem and legitimate concern. These challenges are not insurmountable, but nor should they be glossed over. Nor should we ignore that due to the complexities of nuclear power, precautions must be taken to avoid detrimental impacts in the event of an accident or issue. As a precaution after the Chernobyl disaster, 115,000 people were evacuated from their homes. Quite aside from the psychological trauma of such an exodus, their continued use as pawns in emotive narratives continues to do damage – the WHO in 2005 noted that “designation of the affected population as ‘victims’ rather than ‘survivors’ has led them to perceive themselves as helpless, weak and lacking control over their future. This ... has led either to overcautious behaviour and exaggerated health concerns, or to reckless conduct.” Cost is another factor that must be considered, and while supremely efficient and clean, building nuclear plants is an expensive and difficult undertaking, and a variety of different technologies exist with different advantages and disadvantages. Clearly then, we urgently need a nuanced discussion on our energy future to stave off the worst ravages of climate change. Yet too often this falls at the first hurdle; with old battle-lines long drawn, nuclear advocates and opponents hold their own courts, talking only to their own side and dismissing the criticism and concerns of the other. These echo chambers may be comforting, but they are ultimately detrimental to our collective wellbeing. With the chaos of climate change on our doorstep, it has never been more imperative that we make informed decisions about how best to power our world. For progress to occur, both sides need to heed each other and have an honest conversation about the advantages and risks of all forms of energy production. More than this, access to impartial information is vital. Misunderstandings are frequent, and confound discussion. It is a sad reality that hyper-partisan sources have come to dominate our social media spheres. As flattering as these might be to our ideological preconceptions, the reality is that they are damaging to our understanding and poison productive discussion. Unbiased information is of paramount importance – this is why the newest guide by Sense About Science, Making Sense of Nuclear (full disclaimer: I contributed feedback to the guide in question) is an extremely useful addition to navigating the controversy and confusion surrounding the issue. In the words of Sense About Science: “This guide is not about promoting nuclear as the route to a low-carbon energy system. It isn’t the broad look at energy generation that would help you decide if nuclear power is suitable in any given situation. But none of us wants to make decisions based on outdated information. So it is an exploration of what seems to have changed and to have changed minds.” This is a laudable goal, and this conversation has never been more important. Whatever options we choose must be rooted in best evidence, and appropriate for our needs, whether they be renewables, nuclear energy or a combination of both. Despite the critical threat posed by climate change, it is still under-discussed but ignored at our peril. If we are to avert disaster, we need to have an honest and informed discussion about how to power our world and save our environment – before it’s too late."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/oct/22/what-is-the-internet-13-key-questions-answered","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-10-22T05:00:22Z","webTitle":"What is the internet? 13 key questions answered","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/22/what-is-the-internet-13-key-questions-answered","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/oct/22/what-is-the-internet-13-key-questions-answered","fields":{"headline":"What is the internet? 13 key questions answered","bodyText":"What is the internet? The internet is the wider network that allows computer networks around the world run by companies, governments, universities and other organisations to talk to one another. The result is a mass of cables, computers, data centres, routers, servers, repeaters, satellites and wifi towers that allows digital information to travel around the world. It is that infrastructure that lets you order the weekly shop, share your life on Facebook, stream Outcast on Netflix, email your aunt in Wollongong and search the web for the world’s tiniest cat. How big is the internet? One measure is the amount of information that courses through it: about five exabytes a day. That’s equivalent to 40,000 two-hour standard definition movies per second. It takes some wiring up. Hundreds of thousands of miles of cables criss-cross countries, and more are laid along sea floors to connect islands and continents. About 300 submarine cables, the deep-sea variant only as thick as a garden hose, underpin the modern internet. Most are bundles of hair-thin fibre optics that carry data at the speed of light. The cables range from the 80-mile Dublin to Anglesey connection to the 12,000-mile Asia-America Gateway, which links California to Singapore, Hong Kong and other places in Asia. Major cables serve a staggering number of people. In 2008, damage to two marine cables near the Egyptian port of Alexandria affected tens of millions of internet users in Africa, India, Pakistan and the Middle East. Last year, the chief of the British defence staff, Sir Stuart Peach, warned that Russia could pose a threat to international commerce and the internet if it chose to destroy marine cables. How much energy does the internet use? The Chinese telecoms firm Huawei estimates that the information and communications technology (ICT) industry could use 20% of the world’s electricity and release more than 5% of the world’s carbon emissions by 2025. The study’s author, Anders Andrae, said the coming “tsunami of data” was to blame. In 2016, the US government’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimated that American data centres – facilities where computers store, process and share information – might need 73bn kWh of energy in 2020. That’s the output of 10 Hinkley Point B nuclear power stations. What is the world wide web? The web is a way to view and share information over the internet. That information, be it text, music, photos or videos or whatever, is written on web pages served up by a web browser. Google handles more than 40,000 searches per second, and has 60% of the global browser market through Chrome. There are nearly 2bn websites in existence but most are hardly visited. The top 0.1% of websites (roughly 5m) attract more than half of the world’s web traffic. Among them are Google, YouTube, Facebook, the Chinese site Baidu, Instagram, Yahoo, Twitter, the Russian social network VK.com, Wikipedia, Amazon and a smattering of porn sites. The rise of apps means that for many people, being on the internet today is less about browsing the open web than getting more focused information: news, messages, weather forecasts, videos and the like. What is the dark web? A search of the web does not search all of it. Google the word “puppies” and your browser will display web pages the search engine has found in the hundreds of billions that has logged in its search index. While the search index is massive, it contains only a fraction of what is on the web. Far more, perhaps 95%, is unindexed and so invisible to standard browsers. Think of the web as having three layers: surface, deep and dark. Standard web browsers trawl the surface web, the pages that are most visible. Under the surface is the deep web: a mass of pages that are not indexed. These include pages held behind passwords – the kind found on the office intranet, for example, and pages no one links to, since Google and others build their search indexes by following links from one web page to another. Buried in the deep web is the dark web, a bunch of sites with addresses that hide them from view. To access the dark web, you need special software such as Tor (The Onion Router), a tool originally created by the US navy for intelligence agents online. While the dark web has plenty of legitimate uses, not least to preserve the anonymity of journalists, activists and whistleblowers, a substantial portion is driven by criminal activity. Illicit marketplaces on the dark web trade everything from drugs, guns and counterfeit money to hackers, hitmen and child pornography. How many people are online? It depends how you measure it. One metric popular with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a UN body, counts being online as having used the internet in the past three months. It means people are not assumed to use the internet simply because they live in a town with an internet cable or near a wifi tower. By this yardstick, some 3.58 billion people, or 48% of the global population, were online by the end of 2017. The number should reach 3.8 billion, or 49.2%, by the end of 2018, with half of the world being online by May 2019. Fixed-line internet connections are expensive in developing countries, so most people connect through their mobile phones. The trend leads to a two-tier experience of the internet that is hidden by growth figures. What can be done on a mobile phone is a fraction of what can be achieved with a desktop, laptop or tablet, as anyone who has tried to file their tax return on their mobile will know. “The distinction often gets lost in the discussion around access and affordability,” says Dhanaraj Thakur, research director at the Web Foundation. “We can say that 50% of the world is using the internet, but the majority are using it on their phones. In terms of productivity, that is completely different to using a desktop or laptop.” The popularity of mobile internet leads to other issues too. In Africa, for example, the telcos incentivise people to buy 20MB to 1GB data bundles by offering access to key apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Gmail and Twitter, even when they run out of data. The upshot is that people associate the internet with those platforms rather than the open web. Some even fail to realise they are using the internet. The issue came to light when surveys and focus groups in Africa and southeast Asia found that more people said they used Facebook than went online. “For them Facebook is the internet. They are not exploring beyond it,” said Nanjira Sambuli, who leads the Web Foundation’s efforts to promote equality in access to the web. Who are they? In some countries nearly everyone is online. More than 98% of Icelanders are on the internet, with similar percentages in Denmark, Norway, Luxembourg and Bahrain, the ITU says. In Britain about 95% are online, compared with 85% in Spain, 84% in Germany, 80% in France and only 64% in Italy. Meanwhile, a 2018 report from the Pew Research Center found that 89% of Americans are online. The unconnected tend to be poorer, older, less educated and rural. The west does not dominate the online world, though. While the US has around 300 million internet users, China notched up more than 800 million in 2018, with 40% of its population still unconnected. India reached an estimated 500 million internet users this year, with 60% of the nation still offline. What are they doing? A minute on the internet looks like this: 156m emails, 29m messages, 1.5m Spotify songs, 4m Google searches, 2m minutes of Skype calls, 350,000 tweets, 243,000 photos posted on Facebook, 87,000 hours of Netflix, 65,000 pictures put on Instagram, 25,000 posts on Tumblr, 18,000 matches on Tinder, and 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube. Most consumer internet traffic is video: add up all the online video watched on websites, YouTube, Netflix and webcams and you have 77% of the world’s internet traffic, according to US tech firm Cisco. What places are offline? There is a stark divide between the haves and have-nots and poverty is an overwhelming factor. In the urban centres of some African nations, internet access is routine. More than half of South Africans and Moroccans are online, and parts of other countries, such as Botswana, Cameroon and Gabon, are connecting fast. Mobile phones are driving growth thanks to mobile broadband costs falling 50% in the past three years. But plenty of places are not keeping pace. In Tanzania, Uganda and Sudan, around 30 to 40% can get online. In Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone only 7 to 11% are online. In Eritrea and Somalia, less than 2% have access. To build a mobile hotspot in a remote, off-grid village can cost three times the urban equivalent, which reaches far more people and so brings a much greater return on investment. In rural communities, there is often little demand for the internet because people do not see the point: the web does not serve their interests. Are certain groups offline? There is a clear age divide: far fewer older people use the internet than younger people. In Britain, where 99% of 16- to 34-year-olds are online, the 75-and-overs make up more than half of the 4.5 million adults who have never used the internet, according to the Office of National Statistics. There is a serious gender gap too. In two-thirds of the world’s nations, men dominate internet usage. Globally, there are 12% fewer women online than men. While the digital gender gap has narrowed in most regions since 2013, it has widened in Africa. There, 25% fewer women than men use the internet, the ITU says. Meanwhile, in Pakistan, men outnumber women online by nearly two-to-one, while in India, 70% of internet users are men. The divide largely reflects patriarchal traditions and the inequalities they instil. Some countries buck the trend, notably Jamaica, where more women than men are online. This may be because more women than men enrol at the University of the West Indies in Kingston. The country has the highest proportion of female managers in the world. How will the whole world get online? A major challenge is to get affordable internet to poor, rural regions. With an eye on expanding markets, US tech firms hope to make inroads. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, scrapped plans for solar powered drones and is now focusing on high-altitude balloons to provide the internet from the edge of space. Elon Musk’s SpaceX and a company called OneWeb have their own plans to bring internet access to everyone in the world via constellations of microsatellites. Facebook, which saw its Free Basics service banned under India’s net neutrality laws, has also abandoned plans for internet-beaming drones and is now working with local companies to provide affordable mobile services. Microsoft, meanwhile, is using TV white spaces – the unused broadcast frequencies – for wireless broadband. Another approach, community networks, is also gaining ground. These mobile networks typically use solar-powered stations and are built by and for local communities. Run by cooperatives, they are cheaper than the alternatives and keep skills and profits in the area.

He was right. And it is a core duty of the British government to deal effectively with a nerve gas attack on our streets, which has seriously incapacitated three people and endangered many more. Theresa May has risen to the challenge. The authorities have swiftly identified the poison used in the attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal as Russian. We have demanded that Russia explain what has happened, or face consequences. It is already clear that we can expect obfuscation. We will then have to deliver the prime minister’s “vigorous” response. I was British ambassador in 2006 when Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned in Moscow. The similarities are striking: almost certain Russian guilt, a nasty poison deployed on British streets, Russian refusal to cooperate. We introduced sanctions – diplomatic expulsions and limits on links with the Russian intelligence agencies – intended to deter any recurrence. With hindsight, those sanctions were not enough. We should be tougher this time. Three baskets of measures are on the table. First, the “diplomatic”. The Russian security agencies almost certainly carried out the Salisbury attack. We should build on the Litvinenko measures to make life for them in the UK as difficult as possible. We should freeze our contacts with them and rigorously curtail their travel from Moscow. A significant proportion of those working in the Russian embassy should be expelled (with sad consequences for my innocent diplomatic colleagues and friends in the British embassy in Moscow who will inevitably bear the brunt of Russian retaliation). Second, economic measures. There is far too much crooked money floating around London. This is not only a Russian problem and we have tough new tools (such as “unexplained wealth orders”) to tackle it. These tools should now be energetically deployed. At the same time the government should accept the “Magnitsky clause”, which would impose sanctions on human rights violators. Third, general contacts. Top of the list is this year’s Russia World Cup. I doubt there is a widespread desire for the England football team to withdraw, and in any case the history of sports boycotts is unimpressive. But plainly we will not want to send senior-level UK representatives, and the same will apply to representation at other major events hosted by the Russians. The UK acting alone will not be enough, however. The apparent brazenness of the Skripal attack, using a poison Russia must have known would be linked to it, suggests it is almost deliberately courting UK hostility. We will need allied support to make an impact. Here the Litvinenko precedent is not encouraging. Our allies (particularly the Europeans) said the correct things but were unwilling to risk their links with Moscow in support of what they saw as a UK/Russia row. The politics this time are very different, of course. Russia could not be more mistrusted. And the fact that what happens in Salisbury today could happen in Avignon or Frankfurt tomorrow will have force. But it is still going to take a big effort to turn supportive words (which are coming in abundance) into real action. Meanwhile, the US, with its deep domestic divisions on Russia policy (as illustrated by Rex Tillerson’s departure as secretary of state today), is almost certainly out of the game. So there is much to be done to assemble measures to deter any future Skripal-type attack. All our energies for now need to go into that. But we must not forget the longer term. When the heat eventually dies down, Russia will still be a major nuclear power crucial to tackling the full spectrum of international problems such as Syria, Iran, arms control, Islamist terrorism and cybersecurity. A big blunder following Russia’s 2014 intervention in Ukraine was to try to isolate Russia. It didn’t work. Key countries (China, India) never participated, and those that did quickly found themselves eating their words as the costs and dangers of being out of touch with Russia became apparent. The UK has been slow to acknowledge this lesson, but it would be a mistake, for example, to withdraw our ambassador from Moscow and cut off other key official links, further narrowing what is already a perilously thin line of communication. More broadly, relations between Russia and the west are now at their most dangerous level for decades. Both Russia and the US are rebuilding their nuclear arsenals, and links between our militaries are almost non-existent even as our planes circle each other over Syria and Iraq. We owe it to the next generation to spare them the shadow of nuclear war that hung over us. As the vastly stronger side in the confrontation, the west must act first. We should be looking for potential areas of cooperation with Russia which could begin to rebuild the shattered relationship. Terrorism and perhaps the governing of cyberspace are good places to start. Who knows where attempts at a thaw may lead? A Russia with a set of fruitful and constructive links with the west is far less likely to be tempted into Litvinenko- or Skripal-type outrages that would inevitably damage those links. Finally, once we have responded forcefully and legitimately to the Salisbury provocation, “the safety of the people” would be better guaranteed through cooperation than confrontation. • Tony Brenton was British ambassador to Russia from 2004 to 2008"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/16/is-fukushima-doomed-to-become-a-dumping-ground-for-toxic-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-16T13:12:37Z","webTitle":"Is Fukushima doomed to become a dumping ground for toxic waste?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/16/is-fukushima-doomed-to-become-a-dumping-ground-for-toxic-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/16/is-fukushima-doomed-to-become-a-dumping-ground-for-toxic-waste","fields":{"headline":"Is Fukushima doomed to become a dumping ground for toxic waste?","bodyText":"This month, seven years after the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi reactor meltdowns and explosions that blanketed hundreds of square kilometres of northeastern Japan with radioactive debris, government officials and politicians spoke in hopeful terms about Fukushima’s prosperous future. Nevertheless, perhaps the single most important element of Fukushima’s future remains unspoken: the exclusion zone seems destined to host a repository for Japan’s most hazardous nuclear waste. No Japanese government official will admit this, at least not publicly. A secure repository for nuclear waste has remained a long-elusive goal on the archipelago. But, given that Japan possesses approximately 17,000 tonnes of spent fuel from nuclear power operations, such a development is vital. Most spent fuel rods are still stored precariously above ground, in pools, in a highly earthquake-prone nation. Japanese officialdom relentlessly emphasises positive messages regarding Fukushima’s short- and medium-term future, prioritising economic development and the gradual return of sceptical evacuees to their newly “remediated” communities. Yet the return rate for the least hard-hit communities is only about 15%. Government proclamations regarding revitalisation of the area in and around the exclusion zone intone about jobs but seem geared ominously toward a future with relatively few humans. The Fukushima prefecture government is currently promoting a plan, dubbed The Innovation Coast, that would transform the unwelcoming region into a thriving sweep of high-tech innovation. Much of the development would be directed towards a “robot-related industrial cluster” and experimental zones like a robot test field. The test field would develop robots tailored for disaster response and for other purposes on a course simulating a wide range of hurdles and challenges already well represented in Fukushima itself. Large water tanks would contain an array of underwater hazards to navigate, mirroring the wreckage-strewn waters beneath the Fukushima Daiichi plant, where a number of meltdown-remediating underwater robots have met a premature demise in recent years. Elsewhere on the robot test field, dilapidated buildings and other ruins would serve as a proving ground for land-based disaster-response robots, which must navigate twisted steel rods, broken concrete and other rubble. Engineered runways and surrounding radiation-hit areas would serve as prime territory for testing parlous aerial drones for a range of purposes in various weather conditions – which would be difficult or impossible to achieve elsewhere in relatively densely populated Japan. The planned site for the test field would link with a secluded test area about 13km south along the coast to coordinate test flights over the exclusion zone’s more or less posthuman terrain. Naturally, unlike Fukushima’s human residents, robots would be oblivious to the elevated radiation levels found outside the Fukushima Daiichi facility. In addition, prefectural officials have suggested that the exclusion zone environs could play host to a range of other services that don’t require much human intervention, such as long-term archive facilities. Proud long-time residents of Fukushima, for their part, see all this development as a continued “colonisation” of the home prefecture by Tokyo – a well-worn pattern of outsiders using the zone for their own purposes, as were the utility representatives and officials who built the ill-fated plant in the first place. Years of colossal decontamination measures have scraped irradiated material from seemingly every forest, park, farm, roadside, and school ground. This 16 million cubic metres of radioactive soil is now stored in provisional sites in and around the exclusion zone, waiting to be moved to an interim storage facility that has hardly been started and for which nearly half of the land has not yet even been leased. The state has promised to remove all the contaminated soil from Fukushima after 30 years, and government officials have been scrupulous in insisting that this will be the case – for soil. Yet in a nation with about 17,000 tonnes of highly radioactive spent fuel rods and no willing candidates for secure repositories, it is only a matter of time before it becomes possible for politicians to publicly back the idea of transforming the area around Fukushima Daiichi into a secure repository. Government officials, including those tasked with nuclear waste storage, describe the quintessentially Japanese strategy of saki-okuri, or calculated postponement, in the context of nuclear waste storage. Such perception management is a subtle business, but by quietly and unrelentingly pushing back the day of reckoning – slowly changing the terms of debate – the broadly distasteful prospect of storing Japan’s most dangerous material in its most tragically maltreated region would become gradually less intolerable to Japanese sensibilities. The expanse of Fukushima in and around the exclusion zone represents an already contaminated area with, since 2011, far fewer residents to protest against such plans. Such a rare opportunity for relatively unopposed intervention in a struggling area will surely prove irresistible to the nuclear lobby. Fukushima has been marginalised, disenfranchised, and outmanoeuvred for decades. After all, the electricity from Fukushima Daiichi went straight to the capital, not to Fukushima itself, which bore the risks. Since 2011, Fukushima has been saddled with the staggering burden of the meltdown’s aftermath that, despite government PR, will encumber and stigmatise its citizens for at least several decades. • Peter Wynn Kirby is a nuclear and environmental specialist at the University of Oxford"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/16/uk-green-energy-investment-plunges-after-policy-changes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-16T13:35:16Z","webTitle":"UK green energy investment halves after policy changes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/16/uk-green-energy-investment-plunges-after-policy-changes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/16/uk-green-energy-investment-plunges-after-policy-changes","fields":{"headline":"UK green energy investment halves after policy changes","bodyText":"Investment in clean energy plunged further in Britain than in any other country last year because of government policy changes, new figures show. The amount companies spent on green energy in the UK rose during the years of the coalition government (2010-2015) but has now fallen for two years in a row under the Conservatives, according to analysis by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF). While investment in wind, solar and other renewable sources slumped by 56% to $10.3bn (£7.5bn) in the UK, worldwide spending climbed 3% to $333.5bn (£242.4bn), the second-highest level on record. Alan Whitehead, shadow energy minister, said: “The government’s green rhetoric is nothing more than empty promises. Their ideologically-driven policy lurches away from clean solar power and onshore wind has spooked investors. “Whilst saying they have ambitions to be a green government their actions point in the opposite direction with renewables support slashed at the same time that fracking has been given the go ahead.” Caroline Lucas, Green party co-leader, said the UK figures were damning. China led the global charge, with investment jumping by nearly a quarter to $132.6bn, a new high. The amount of solar installed in China increased by more than three-quarters on the year before as costs fell. Worldwide, solar took the lion’s share of spending on renewables, at $160.8bn, followed by windfarms. Jon Moore, chief executive of BNEF, said: “The 2017 total is all the more remarkable when you consider that capital costs for the leading technology – solar – continue to fall sharply.” Investment increased by 1% to $56.9bn in the US, the second-biggest market for clean technologies, despite the Trump administration’s efforts to favour coal and nuclear power. However, spending also fell in Germany, Japan, India, Norway, Turkey and Taiwan. The fall of 56% in the UK was the steepest decline, far out-stripping the decrease of 26% for Europe as a whole. Around half of the UK spend, $4.8bn, was a final investment decision by Ørsted of Denmark on a single huge offshore windfarm, the Hornsea 2 project off the Yorkshire coast. Another big green energy firm, npower’s parent company, Innogy, said the UK was still an attractive place to invest, but there had been a stop-start approach to support from government. Paul Cowling, director of wind energy offshore at Innogy SE, said: “It’s just very lumpy. You have this very sort of cyclic type of approach that government have had in the past.” The German firm is planning to spend €3.5bn (£3.1bn) on renewables over the next three years, with the UK billed as the company’s second-biggest market. Cowling confirmed that the company would be competing for a slice of the £557m pot of government subsidies for offshore windfarms that will be auctioned next year. BNEF said that while the promise of future subsidies showed the government was behind the sector, it agreed with Innogy on the need for greater clarity on what ministers want over the next decade. “What’s needed when we hear from investors and developers is more transparency from the government. When you compare the Netherlands and Germany there’s more transparency up to 2030 on [wind power] capacity through competitive auctions,” said Keegan Kruger, wind analyst at BNEF. Kruger added that he expected the trend in UK investment to continue downwards until around 2020, when it would likely stabilise because of new investments in offshore windfarms. As well as solar parks and windfarms, the BNEF analysis counts clean technology investments as including smart grids, energy efficiency and battery storage projects. It also includes biomass, waste-to-energy schemes, marine energy and small hydro projects but excludes large dams. A government spokesperson said: “The UK has reduced emissions on a per person basis faster than any other G7 nation and the government is committed to a low carbon future for the UK with clean growth at the heart of our industrial strategy.” • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/aug/11/energy-specialists-raise-concerns-on-chinese-hinkley-involvement","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-11T19:19:51Z","webTitle":"Energy specialists raise concerns about Chinese Hinkley involvement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/energy-specialists-raise-concerns-on-chinese-hinkley-involvement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/energy-specialists-raise-concerns-on-chinese-hinkley-involvement","fields":{"headline":"Energy specialists raise concerns about Chinese Hinkley involvement","bodyText":"Further concerns have been raised over China’s involvement in the £18bn Hinkley Point nuclear power project after it emerged that the state-owned company backing the plant is facing espionage charges in the US. The chair of the parliamentary energy and climate change committee said the allegations raised serious questions about the corporate integrity of China General Nuclear Power (CGN) and must be part of the government’s current review of Hinkley. Warning that there are now “grave concerns” about CGN’s 33% stake in Hinkley, Angus MacNeil MP said: “It does raise questions about how honourable the company is and whether it could cut corners on construction methods and issues like that.” CGN has been named as a defendant in legal papers filed by the US authorities in a Tennessee district court, where the accused face charges of involvement in a conspiracy to steal nuclear secrets in order to help speed up China’s own nuclear power programme. Another defendant is a 66-year-old naturalised US citizen called Szuhsiung “Allen” Ho, also known as Allen Ho. A senior adviser to CGN, Ho is scheduled to appear next week accused of trying to recruit US atomic experts to gather nuclear technology secrets. Details of the charges emerged as Australia blocked the sale of a power grid company to a Chinese firm on security grounds. One energy expert urged Theresa May to immediately pull the plug on the Somerset power project, saying it was the final nail in a scheme already under threat after the prime minister ordered a review of the plant last month. Paul Dorfman, a senior research fellow at the energy institute at University College London and a former government adviser, said the decision to undertake a review, on the basis of security concerns about China’s involvement, had already upset Beijing. Referring to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, he said: “No other OECD country would let China into its critical nuclear infrastructure, given its history of nuclear weapon proliferation. May has already taken the diplomatic hit for this, so what’s she got to lose?” Dorfman said a convenient excuse for pulling out of Hinkley could be supplied by problems with the plant’s main backer, France’s EDF, which is committed to using European pressurised reactor (EPR) technology that is running over budget at sites in France and Finland. “If government wanted to, it could avoid taking China to task on this by reframing the problem in the context of the failed French EPR reactor, which is three times over-cost and over-time where it’s being built in Finland and France.” Energy industry sources also raised questions over how much the former prime minister and chancellor knew about the CGN case in the US. One source said the Tennessee case had been known about in security circles for nearly a year because elements of it had been in the public domain but not highlighted by media. “It is inconceivable that George Osborne and David Cameron had not been told about the case by the security forces. May – as former home secretary – was perhaps willing to listen more intently to what they (MI5) were telling her,” said one. CGN said it could not immediately comment on the scandal but promised it would provide a written statement. Ho’s attorney, Peter Zeidenberg, said his client had been openly engaged in commercial activity involving non-classified information. The UK’s prime minister’s office and the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) also declined to discuss the issue or its implications. “This is a matter for the American authorities. It would be inappropriate for us to comment on a live court case,” said a BEIS spokesperson. Hinkley was meant to be a central part of George Osborne’s bid to usher in a “golden decade” of closer trade relations with China. Final details of the deal were announced as the former chancellor toured the country last year. In addition to potential security concerns, some in Whitehall had always harboured doubts about whether the vast reactor project was worth the generous subsidies that the government had had to pledge to get an investment agreement. But Osborne was known to be so attached to the project that objections were pushed aside. The former chancellor, who was sacked by May last month in one of her first acts as prime minister, could not be reached for comment yesterday. Greg Clark, the new energy secretary, is known to be keen to scrutinise the financial details before formal approval is given. Downing Street has said a decision will be made next month while the Chinese have already made clear their irritation with the delay. Barry Gardiner, shadow energy secretary, expressed concern about the court case being used by ministers as an excuse for dumping Hinkley. “There are many reasons to criticise the Hinkley C deal: the vast cost; the long subsidy lock-in while other technologies fall in price and the technical feasibility of the project ever being built. These are genuine risks the government ought to have addressed two years ago. “The government says it wants to boost international trade. If the government held off the deal because of these allegations, they have jeopardised a relationship with a key future trade partner at a time when we need to be creating new friends and forging new trade alliances.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/aug/09/uk-will-want-business-with-china-regardless-of-hinkley-point","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T18:27:04Z","webTitle":"UK will want to do business with China, regardless of Hinkley Point | Tania Branigan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/uk-will-want-business-with-china-regardless-of-hinkley-point","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/09/uk-will-want-business-with-china-regardless-of-hinkley-point","fields":{"headline":"UK will want to do business with China, regardless of Hinkley Point outcome","bodyText":"Though the Chinese ambassador has called the UK’s decision on Hinkley Point C nuclear plant a “crucial historical juncture” for bilateral ties, it barely registers in the long sweep of the relationship. As any schoolchild in China could tell you – but probably rather fewer adults here – the nadir came a couple of centuries ago, when Britain sent in gunboats to protect its drug sales. Those events colour Chinese perceptions of the UK to this day. To the British, it was a necessary but not terribly grave imperial move, putting a decaying power in its place (“Albert is so amused at my having got the island of Hong Kong,” Queen Victoria blithely wrote). For the Chinese, it was a deep and abiding shame. The opium wars kicked off what Beijing terms, and promotes relentlessly, as the “century of humiliation” at the hands of foreign powers, ended only by the Communist party’s triumph. The Chinese authorities’ claim to legitimacy rests upon their ability to provide economic wellbeing, which is proving increasingly tough, and this idea of renewed national pride, seized and amplified by Xi Jinping since he took power. It is one reason he wanted his people to see his red carpet welcome in London last year: the former aggressor was now bowing its knee. It also increases Beijing’s sensitivity to the 11th-hour halt on Hinkley Point and the public airing of suspicions about China’s behaviour and intentions. The undiplomatic handling will be almost as unwelcome as the decision. But the Chinese are pragmatic and the real lesson from history is that remembering the days when Britannia ruled the waves accentuates its decline. The UK is a waning power, especially since voting for Brexit, which “show[ed] a losing mindset”, in the words of one populist state-run Chinese newspaper. Beijing might, in fact, describe the UK somewhat as Lord Macartney, the first British envoy to China, described China: “An old, crazy, first-rate man of war, which a fortunate succession of able and vigilant officers have contrived to keep afloat ...” China, of course, has no need to force open our economy, because we begged for its cooperation. Engagement and trade has never been the kind of political issue in the UK that it is in the US, where China-bashing is a regular feature of the electoral cycle. The Osborne Doctrine went much further. It looked like business at all costs. And as plenty of diplomats have observed, Beijing does not respect weakness. We are useful, rather than important, thanks to the hangover from our imperial heyday: that permanent seat on the UN security council, for example, and our ability to set an example to others. We are less valuable outside the European Union – no longer China’s gateway to the EU, or its voice in discussions there – but canny investors may relish the prospect of Brexit bargains. China envies our soft power, too, which they have sought without success to buy or manufacture. Yes, we may seem quaint or entertaining – the country of Harry Potter, Downton Abbey and David Beckham – but the Chinese know far more about us than vice versa, even if they don’t always understand us. Their leaders have read Shakespeare and Adam Smith; you’d struggle to find British politicians who could identify Du Fu or Liang Qichao. Meanwhile, under Xi’s leadership, the talk of international friendship has gone hand in hand with increasing domestic stress on the idea that “hostile foreign forces” from the west want to contain China and unleash its disintegration. Talk of human rights is just another way to undermine the country, they say. What the UK and other western countries want most, as the former chancellor George Osborne’s strategy highlighted, is a stable China with which they can do business. Whether or not Theresa May decides Hinkley Point should go ahead, that is unlikely to change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/aug/11/nuclear-espionage-charge-for-china-firm-with-one-third-stake-in-hinkley-point","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-11T00:11:46Z","webTitle":"Nuclear espionage charge for China firm with one-third stake in UK's Hinkley Point","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/nuclear-espionage-charge-for-china-firm-with-one-third-stake-in-hinkley-point","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/nuclear-espionage-charge-for-china-firm-with-one-third-stake-in-hinkley-point","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear espionage charge for China firm with one-third stake in UK's Hinkley Point","bodyText":"The Chinese company with a major stake in the proposed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station has been charged by the US government over nuclear espionage, according to the US justice department. In a 17-page indictment, the US government said nuclear engineer Allen Ho, employed by the China General Nuclear Power Company, and the company itself had unlawfully conspired to develop nuclear material in China without US approval and “with the intent to secure an advantage to the People’s Republic of China”. CGNPC has a 33% stake in the £18bn Hinkley Point project in Somerset, which Theresa May has delayed partly because of concerns over China’s involvement. The delay prompted a warning earlier this week from the Chinese ambassador to the UK, who said that relations between the two countries are at a “crucial historical juncture”. Assistant US attorney general John P Carlin said: “Allen Ho, at the direction of a Chinese state-owned nuclear power company allegedly approached and enlisted US-based nuclear experts to provide integral assistance in developing and producing special nuclear material in China. “Ho did so without registering with the Department of Justice as an agent of a foreign nation or authorisation from the US Department of Energy”, Carlin continued. “Prosecuting those who seek to evade US law by attaining sensitive nuclear technology for foreign nations is a top priority for the National Security Division.” Ho allegedly conspired with China from 1997 to April 2016, said the indictment that was unsealed in April. Conspiring to unlawfully engage and participate in the development of nuclear material outside of the US carries a maximum sentence of life in prison and a fine of $250,000 (£192,000). Conspiring to act as an agent of a foreign government in the US carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. “The federal government has regulations in place to oversee civil nuclear cooperation”, said Michael Steinbach, executive assistant director of the FBI’s national security branch. “If those authorities are circumvented, this can result in significant damage to our national security. “The US will use all of its law enforcement tools to stop those who try to steal US nuclear technology and expertise.” Ho was born in China and is a naturalised US citizen with dual residency.

Westinghouse’s plight stems from a $6.1bn (£4.9bn) writedown because costs have overrun on the two plants CB&amp;I is building in Georgia and South Carolina, the first new US nuclear power stations for decades. The unaudited results showed Toshiba’s total losses widened by 53bn yen to 532bn yen (£3.9bn) in the nine months ending December 2016, adding that losses for the full year ending March could amount to more than 1tn yen (£7.3bn). It would be one of the biggest losses in Japanese corporate history. “There are material events and conditions that raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern,” the company said in a statement. Failure to file audited results fuelled speculation that the company could be forced out of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Toshiba’s president, Satoshi Tsunakawa, called the auditor’s decision not to approve the figures “truly regrettable” and said he hoped the company would not be delisted. Toshiba is attempting to strengthen its balance sheet by selling other assets, including its memory chip business. The company’s escalating crisis also heightened fears about the future of Toshiba’s planned Moorside nuclear plant in Cumbria. Earlier this month it was forced to take full control of the venture behind the project, Nugen, after its previous partner, the French utility Engie, exercised the right to sell its 40% stake under an option triggered by Westinghouse’s bankruptcy filing. Unite, Britain’s largest trade union, said it was fearful about what the latest developments at Toshiba would mean for the Moorside plant, and repeated its call on Greg Clark, the business and energy secretary, to intervene to safeguard the future of the project. Kevin Coyne, Unite’s national officer for energy, said: “The latest news about the very poor financial health of Toshiba raises further concerns about its involvement in the construction of the Moorside nuclear power station in Cumbria. “Unite renews its call to the business secretary, Greg Clark, to step in and pledge public investment to ensure that the project goes ahead on schedule, as Toshiba is in deep financial trouble and has a big question mark over its future.” Coyne said the “lights could go out” in the future without a coherent, joined up energy policy, adding Moorside would be crucial. “The importance of Moorside can’t be underestimated as it is expected to generate 20,000 highly skilled jobs during its construction and when it is up and running – and also supply 7% of the UK’s electricity needs from 2025,” he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the government was talking to potential investors. “The UK government is committed to new nuclear as an important part of our energy mix, having commissioned the first new nuclear power plant in a generation at Hinkley Point C,” the spokesperson said. “The NuGen consortium has always planned to bring in other partners to deliver the project and we engage regularly with a range of developers and investors. The secretary of state visited South Korea last week for talks on future collaboration between our two countries, including on potential civil nuclear projects.” In February, Tobisha said its chairman, Shigenori Shiga, was resigning to take “management responsibility” for the writedowns related to Westinghouse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2017/oct/03/nuclear-disarmament-dirty-word-tories-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-03T09:11:38Z","webTitle":"When did nuclear disarmament become such a dirty word for the Tories? | Emily Thornberry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/03/nuclear-disarmament-dirty-word-tories-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/03/nuclear-disarmament-dirty-word-tories-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"When did nuclear disarmament become such a dirty word for the Tories?","bodyText":"On this day, 65 years ago, near a remote island off the Australian west coast, a bomb was exploded in the hull of the empty navy frigate HMS Plym, its blast two-thirds more powerful than the one that destroyed Hiroshima. At that moment, Britain officially became the world’s third nuclear power. Both Winston Churchill, who authorised the test, and Clement Attlee, who initiated it, believed its true significance lay not in increasing Britain’s military capabilities, but in further deterring the threat of nuclear war between Russia and the west, and ultimately in eradicating that threat. Since that day in October 1952, 17 general elections have been held in Britain, and – while debates have often raged about a unilateral versus multilateral approach – the principle that the British government should always be working towards global disarmament has never seemed in doubt. Until now, that is. Theresa May’s manifesto earlier this year was only the third by a sitting government since Britain got the bomb that made no mention at all of nuclear proliferation and the importance of arms control. And – unlike the two others – she had no excuse. The previous exceptions to the rule were in February 1974, when Ted Heath tried to reduce his snap election to the single question “Who governs Britain?”; and 1997, when a fag-end Tory administration was barely going through the motions against New Labour. But in every other case, the prime minister and government of the day treated it as almost a moral responsibility to make clear their long-term commitment to disarmament, often alongside a statement of their short-term plans to retain and renew Britain’s nuclear arsenal. Take Harold Macmillan in 1955, declaring: “In the face of [the bomb’s] destructive power, any group of men would have to be not only bad, but mad, to unleash a war. We must not only abolish nuclear weapons, but also reduce armies and armaments to a point where no one state can threaten the peace. I shall never despair of finding by agreement solutions which will rid the world of fear.” Take Margaret Thatcher in 1983, who lambasted Labour’s unilateralist nuclear policy, but at the same time insisted that “every thinking man and woman wants to get rid of nuclear weapons”; and then, in 1987, set out detailed policies for the elimination or reduction of nuclear missile capabilities throughout the world, and claimed that “Britain is at the forefront of arms control negotiations”. Take John Major in 1992 and David Cameron in 2015, both speaking out strongly in their manifestos against the dangers of nuclear proliferation, and insisting that they would work with international allies to prevent more countries obtaining the bomb. So the question for the prime minister and her party is: “When did disarmament become such a dirty word?” Why are Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party now derided for advocating policies that Tory governments once considered perfectly commonplace? Theresa May cannot claim the circumstances are different. After all, Macmillan and Thatcher led the country through the most dangerous periods of the cold war; Major had to deal with the break-up of the Soviet Union and the fears over what would happen to its nuclear weapons; and Cameron was involved in the high-stakes negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme. They all recognised – as did Labour prime ministers of different eras – that the greater the threat of nuclear warfare facing the world, the more urgent the need became for all countries to tackle proliferation and make real progress on disarmament. Look at the situation today, especially this summer’s volatile and unresolved standoff between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, and it is clear that the threat of nuclear conflict is definitely no less severe than in previous decades, and is arguably at its highest level since the early 1980s. For past governments of all parties in Britain, that was the cue to step up their efforts on nuclear diplomacy, and commit to progress on disarmament. But from May, Boris Johnson and Michael Fallon, we hear the opposite, and the explanation is as depressing as it is straightforward. They know that Corbyn – along with me and others – is a long-standing proponent of disarmament. They know that this issue has caused tension in the Labour party over the past two years. And they therefore regard any discussion of nuclear weapons simply as a chance to misrepresent Labour as soft and divided on defence. In that context, the silence of the last Tory manifesto makes total sense; any commitment to make progress on arms control would have made it impossible for May’s attack dogs to tear holes in Labour for saying the same. So this most unprincipled of prime ministers chooses to ignore the issue of disarmament simply for short-term political gain, something no sitting government has done since that massive blast 65 years ago on HMS Plym. Perhaps she needs to reflect on why that 1952 test was staged as it was. Churchill’s scientists and engineers could have set off the A-bomb in any number of different ways, but they deliberately chose to simulate the effects of a bomb exploding aboard a boat approaching land. They did so because that scenario was one of the government’s greatest fears for how an atomic bomb might be deployed against Britain. In other words, their test simultaneously proved that we were a nuclear power, but also demonstrated our huge vulnerability to attack. And that paradox is why, at least up until now, every government since Churchill’s has believed that – whatever the arguments that nuclear weapons are a necessary short-term deterrent – the only long-term and absolute guarantee of safety is to eliminate them entirely from the planet. It should hardly be a surprise therefore for Labour’s leader to state that as his ambition, just as it was for Churchill, Macmillan, Thatcher, Major and Cameron. Indeed, the fact that Theresa May continues to attack Jeremy Corbyn for holding that principle is not just a massive departure from the standards of her postwar predecessors, but one of the many reasons she is not fit to stand in their – or his – company. • Emily Thornberry is the shadow foreign secretary"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/sep/21/hinkley-point-c-fresh-strike-threat-over-pay-dispute-delays","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-21T18:26:08Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C: fresh strike threat over pay dispute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/21/hinkley-point-c-fresh-strike-threat-over-pay-dispute-delays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/sep/21/hinkley-point-c-fresh-strike-threat-over-pay-dispute-delays","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C: fresh strike threat over pay dispute","bodyText":"The UK’s first new nuclear power plant for 20 years could be delayed again, after trade unions for construction staff working on the £20bn Hinkley Point C project announced a ballot for strike action in a dispute over pay. More than 95% of members balloted by GMB and Unite rejected a pay increase offered by the French energy company EDF and its contractor Bylor after months of discussions. Any extension of the labour dispute risks further time and cost overruns for Europe’s largest construction project, which is already behind schedule and over budget. Separately, staff at outsourcing group Capita are to go on strike for six days from 5 October over changes to the company’s pension scheme that will result in a “massive cut” to their retirement income, according to Unite. This year, EDF revealed the cost of Hinkley had risen from £18bn to £20.3bn and that construction of the plant would also be delayed by 15 months, meaning it might not start producing electricity until 2027. Strike action was called off in June after an interim deal over bonus payments was reached in the hope a permanent agreement avoiding any further delays at the Somerset site could be reached. Talks have since broken down and GMB and Unite will ballot members over strike action concerning the employment terms of more than 1,000 civil engineers. The unions’ chief complaint is that the civil engineering contracts are “significantly below” the rates of workers on mechanical and engineering (M&amp;E) deals. “Members have made their views clear; the unions warned the amount of money being offered was not sufficient and this has proved to be the case,” Jerry Swain, Unite’s national officer for construction, said. “The unions are fully prepared to return to the negotiating table if an improved offer is put forward.” EDF Energy said it was “disappointed” and that it had offered increased pay, bonuses and benefits as part of a package that was “fair and reasonable”. “The terms and conditions of employment at Hinkley Point C are superior to anything you will find in the UK construction industry,” it added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/feb/21/my-best-photograph-mars-rover-curiosity","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-21T17:12:27Z","webTitle":"My best photograph: Mars rover Curiosity's shot of the hill she'll never climb","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/21/my-best-photograph-mars-rover-curiosity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/21/my-best-photograph-mars-rover-curiosity","fields":{"headline":"My best photograph: Mars rover Curiosity's shot of the hill she'll never climb","bodyText":"Ken Herkenhoff Planetary scientist, US Geological Survey Mount Sharp was the first thing Curiosity ever took a photo of. The biggest Mars rover ever, Curiosity landed on August 2012, having spent 253 days hurtling through space. This shot of Aeolis Mons, to give the peak its official name, was taken three years later and the image has been enhanced to bring out colour variations. That’s why the sky looks blue. It would be highly unusual to ever actually see anything blue on Mars – there’s so much iron oxide around, suspended in the atmosphere like dust, that it colours everything. People call Mars the red planet, but technically – when measured scientifically – it’s yellowish brown. Mount Sharp, located in the middle of Gale Crater, has been the object of the mission all along. Since it’s made of sedimentary rock, it should give us a record of the planet’s major climate changes. The goal is to decipher that record and learn more about Mars’s ancient past. Right now, Curiosity is heading up the mountainside, exploring Vera Rubin Ridge, which you can see stretching along the bottom of the image. The dark material above that is basaltic sand, a common volcanic substance on both Mars and Earth. Most of our ocean floors are covered in it. The good stuff is just a bit further up, in an area rich in clays and sulphates. Clays are formed in more neutral waters, which is to say in Earth-like conditions, and that’s why they’re of such great interest: they are perhaps conducive to original life. Martian rocks are between three to four billion years old, meaning they date back to when the solar system was young. We have ancient rocks on Earth but they’re much rarer, because plate tectonics have destroyed so many of them. That’s one advantage of exploring Mars – no plate tectonics. Curiosity is the size of a Mini Cooper, with a mast as big as a tall person and a 7-foot robotic arm. She’s pretty robust: she can navigate knee-high obstacles and, at her top speed, cover about 30 metres an hour, depending on the terrain. The craft has 17 cameras, able to take single and stereo images, which provide us with 3D information about the landscape. She shoots in colour for scientific purposes and in black-and-white for navigation. Nearly 100 people from all over the world are involved in operating Curiosity. Every day we decide on her next goal: it might be to drive to a rock we’ve seen in previous pictures, take some shots, then turn left and take some more. A typical drive is 50 metres, occasionally 100 if it’s very flat, but if the terrain is rocky, the daily journey might be as little as 10. Moving Curiosity and activating her robotic arm are complex operations requiring careful planning. Depending on where Mars is relative to Earth, our commands are sent out from either California, Madrid or Canberra. About 10 to 15 minutes later, Curiosity gets to work, then sends back all her data overnight while she sleeps. When something goes wrong, things can get emotional, because we can’t just go and fix her. One of her wheels is damaged, which means we don’t let Curiosity pick her own path any more. And she’s been carrying around the same sample of sand dune for months now, because the drill feed mechanism isn’t working. The engineers are hoping to find a fix soon. We can’t say for certain how long Curiosity will last. The first rovers on Mars, Spirit and Opportunity, were designed to last 90 days. Opportunity is still going 14 years on, though Spirit got stuck in some sand after six years. It was pretty sad, like losing a child. We knew she was unlikely to survive the winter. Unlike those rovers, Curiosity has a nuclear-power source – a radioisotope thermal electric generator. The temperature on Mars fluctuates enormously, from 15C on a warm day to -70C overnight, which means we need heaters just to get the motors and instruments to function. At some point, we know, the generator will peter out. There’s no expectation that Curiosity will get to the top of Mount Sharp. The brighter rock formations higher up are probably as far as she will go. Who knows what we will find there. Covering that distance will take years, though. It has taken over five just to drive 18km – it could easily take another five to get to those bright rocks. Things are slow, we’re taking our time. But, you know, we’re doing geology on Mars. It’s never going to be easy. Additional information by Justin Maki. See more of Curiosity’s pictures here. Curiosity CV Made in: Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California.

It had no friends after the cold war ended, and no cards to play. Yet its single-minded drive to build a nuclear deterrent has now succeeded in delivering a summit with an American president. The White House says Donald Trump is ready to meet the supreme leader, Kim Jong-un, “by May”, at a time and location yet to be determined. Whether or not a “deal” emerges within two months, the mere fact of a summit breaks all the rules of diplomacy. It delivers legitimacy – the “face” the North Koreans crave. Washington does not recognise the existence of the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea. There’s no peace treaty with the United States, just the 1953 armistice agreement that ended the Korean war. Plus, Pyongyang is accused of breaking numerous international treaties, conventions, agreements, contracts, promises and understandings. Calling it a “rogue regime” doesn’t begin to capture the essential delinquency of its methods. We know what it wants. That’s the easy part. It wants its enemies to guarantee its continued existence; and that is inseparable from the continued and absolute rule of the Kim dynasty. Yet this could very well mean writing it a blank cheque. It can’t survive without massive infusions of aid, because it won’t change its malfunctioning economic system or stop devoting enormous resources to its military. Each time the founder, Kim Il-sung, or his son Kim Jong-il reached a fork in the road, they balked at taking the path to reform. This was not because they were stupid. It was because they realised that if they did consider reform, they would have to confront the fundamental question: what is the point of North Korea? If it becomes a market economy, with Samsung and all the other South Korean conglomerates so dominant on the other side of the border, then it will inevitably become an appendage of the prosperous South. And if the North gives up its “military first” policy, then it effectively abandons its sacred mission of unifying the country as a socialist republic under the rule of the Kims (or “liberating the South”, as they would term it). Some diplomatic problems around the world are open to fudge and ambiguity, and sometimes protracted negotiations are useful in order to give people time to adjust to reality. But the experience of the past decades shows that the North Korean problem is not one of these. As every visitor testifies, its rulers live in an absurd dreamworld of their own making, but at the same time they behave with lethal cynicism in their dealings at home and abroad. Just like the Trump administration, you may say. They are bound to get along. Maybe. But I think it will be hard (actually nearly impossible) for President Trump to craft any “deal” because it must involve removing the North’s existing nuclear devices and stripping the state of the power to build new ones. Given how practised North Korea is at deceit, in this (and every other) regard, no one has fresh ideas about how such a dramatic move could ever be “verified”. In short, North Korea could quickly make a monkey out of Trump. It’s why Bill Clinton, in his last months in office, when given a choice between crafting a deal between Israel and Palestine or one with Kim Jong-il (capped by a summit in Washington), opted for the former. He thought it was a less of a gamble. The trouble is that any “deal” with North Korea quickly descends into a system of extortion. That was the fate of the Clinton-era “agreed framework”, whereby North Korea was given food and money. But Pyongyang cheated, by secretly setting up an alternative route towards becoming a nuclear power. Why would it want to do that? Well, it’s a simple calculation. Ultimately your own nuclear deterrent is by far the best, and possibly only, guarantee of your continued existence. Everything else is just a piece of paper. The North Koreans would rather “eat grass”, observed Vladimir Putin, than give up their nuclear weapons programme. So we could just be seeing a fresh round of the traditional North Korean dance of advancing, pausing to collect bribes, then going nuclear again. By now the Americans have tried every strategy in the book – bilateral talks, multilateral talks, stepping-stone deals, regime-change bluster, proxy talks via China, sanctions, more sanctions. So it is not surprising that Trump wants to do something more daring. But if the past is a guide, Trump will take credit for “coercive diplomacy”, only to find he comes up well short of the leverage to force change on North Korea. In doing so he also risks legitimising, and indeed subsidising, one of the most appalling regimes in the world. Ever. So far the Kim family, governing a country of some 20 million, is reportedly responsible for the deaths of 7 million people. A deal with the Kim family could mean ruling out support for any potential internal opposition or an alternative leadership. So would it be a good thing if Trump did succeed with a “deal”, and the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea survived? Surely not. We owe the North Korean people a way of escaping from this odious regime. • Jasper Becker is an author and former foreign correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/mar/09/trump-kim-jong-un-believe-winning-risks-epic-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T15:30:17Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un believe they are winning – and the risks of that are epic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/09/trump-kim-jong-un-believe-winning-risks-epic-analysis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/mar/09/trump-kim-jong-un-believe-winning-risks-epic-analysis","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un believe they are winning – and the risks of that are epic","bodyText":"If a summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un really takes place in May, it will count as one of the most remarkable and unexpected pieces of theatre in diplomatic history. If that drama leads to a substantive peace agreement it would represent an extraordinary achievement. The Korean war never formally ended and the threat of a new devastating conflict has hung over the peninsula for decades. It is a prize on an epic scale, but so are the risks. Both leaders view the provisional agreement to meet as a personal triumph born of resolve. If each reckons he has the other over a barrel, they will be little room for compromise if and when they meet. The South Korean messengers who conveyed Kim’s invitation took pains to lay credit at Trump’s feet. White House briefers on Thursday night also went out of their way to tie the surprise development tightly to the US president’s leadership qualities. Having invested so much personal capital in the meetings, there is a significant danger of a backlash from either or both men if they do not get their way under the glare of international attention. There is plenty of room for misunderstanding. Both leaders say they want the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, but historically their governments have interpreted that to mean quite different things. While Washington sees it in terms of North Korean unilateral disarmament, Pyongyang envisions an end to the “hostile policies” of the US and the formal removal of the nuclear deterrent umbrella that has sheltered South Korea from its northern neighbour. Mutual insults and rattled sabres There is no guarantee of the summit actually taking place. Kim did not put his invitation down on paper. It was relayed orally by the South Korean national security chief, Chung Eui-yong. Since Kim met Chung and his delegation on Monday in Pyongyang, the North has remained silent on the contents of the offer and could seek to move the goalposts in the run-up to the high-stakes meeting. Trump could not contain his excitement at Thursday’s developments. He appeared unannounced at the White House briefing room to tip off journalists about Chung’s planned press statement. He told one reporter he hoped to garner the credit for the breakthrough. He seemed unaware that Pyongyang had been seeking a one-on-one meeting with a US president since the 1990s at least. In securing agreement, Kim can claim an achievement that eluded his father and grandfather – being treated in the eyes of the world as an equal by the most powerful man on earth. “To be clear – we need to talk to North Korea,” argued Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury institute of international studies at Monterey. “But Kim is not inviting Trump so that he can surrender North Korea’s weapons. Kim is inviting Trump to demonstrate that his investment in nuclear and missile capabilities has forced the United States to treat him as an equal.” Arguably neither Kim nor Trump deserve the principal credit for the sharp turn they have taken from mutual insults and rattled nuclear sabres. That credit is more reasonably attributed to the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, who found himself in the crossfire since coming to office last year, but has managed to leverage that position, through the hosting of the Winter Olympics, into an opening for dialogue. The timing has also been benign. The election of a pro-engagement president in South Korea has been followed by Kim’s declaration at the start of this year that his regime had attained its goal of building an arsenal of nuclear missiles. The Pyongyang regime now sees itself entering negotiations from a position of strength as a nuclear power. The White House narrative is entirely different. It portrays North Korea as cowed into talks by Trump’s determination and the unprecedented international sanctions regime that has been imposed since last September. However, any expectation Trump might have that Kim will trade his nuclear weapons for sanctions relief may be ill-conceived. Few observers believe the North Korean leader will bargain away lightly what he sees as a guarantee of his dynastic regime’s survival. A grand bargain Historically, major summits have followed months or years of carefully orchestrated lower-level negotiations. For this new diplomatic opening to be successful, that order will have to be reversed. The question is whether Kim and Trump would settle for something less than a grand bargain. “If [the summit] helps to establish a process for serious, sustained negotiations, then it’s a positive move,” argued Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the New America thinktank who has been involved in informal contacts with North Koreans. “But it will have to be managed carefully and with a great deal of prep work.” There are serious questions over whether the Trump administration is equipped for complex talks. Its leading Korea experts have left and the state department has been excluded. Rex Tillerson, travelling in Africa this week, does not even seem to have been informed of the development. He was still telling journalists on Thursday that negotiations remained a distant prospect. Trump for now is flying solo, convinced of his expertise in the art of the deal. But his deal-making in the real estate business drove him to bankruptcy several times. The implications of an equivalent failure in nuclear summitry, and how he might react, are sobering."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/askjack/2018/may/31/how-can-i-get-faster-broadband-in-a-rural-area-bt","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T09:49:20Z","webTitle":"How can I get faster broadband in a rural area?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2018/may/31/how-can-i-get-faster-broadband-in-a-rural-area-bt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack/2018/may/31/how-can-i-get-faster-broadband-in-a-rural-area-bt","fields":{"headline":"How can I get faster broadband in a rural area?","bodyText":"We’re a rural family of six with three businesses on site and we have three landlines in order to be able to use broadband. It is a disaster – usually less than 1MB, peaks occasionally at 4MB – and sometimes the kids have to go to the village to do homework. Why isn’t BT forced to enable rural homes with the same deals that city people get? BT wanted to charge £16,000 to connect us! We have excellent 4G outside, but not inside, the house. June BT isn’t forced to offer rural homes the same deals as city people because – as your £16,000 quote illustrates – it would cost too much. BT is busy extending its high-speed network to rural areas but the British government, via the DCMS’s Broadband Delivery UK (BDUK) scheme, and local authorities are contributing to the cost. For example, in Northern Ireland, where you live, BDUK has contributed £11.5m and local authorities £22m. That’s £500 per household for the 66,912 people who have signed up for BT’s new 24Mbps+ “superfast broadband”. It’s expensive because, while people may complain about broadband speeds, most of them don’t subscribe. (BT returns some of the public funding when more than 20% of potential customers adopt a service.) Further, there is no universal service obligation (USO) because the government’s strategy makes it impossible. USO schemes can work when a monopoly can use profits from customers who are cheap to serve – those in large towns – to subsidise those who are expensive to serve, like you. But the government chose unregulated competition in urban areas, which leaves no surplus for the rural ones. Last year, BT’s CEO Gavin Patterson made a “voluntary USO” offer that, he said, “would have allowed the last 5% of the UK to have a broadband product of at least – and I mean at least – 10 megabits per second by 2020, and do so in a way that allowed us to make a fair, not an excessive, return.” The scheme capped the cost at £3,400 per home, but the property owner could pay any excess. The government declined. It will now come up with a “regulatory USO”, though there’s no indication how it plans to pay for it. (See UPD Gov Reject BT Voluntary 10Mbps UK Broadband USO and Goes Regulatory.) Of course, the British government could deliver high-speed fibre to almost every building in the UK for a relatively small sum – perhaps around £13bn – but has been unable to find the cash since the idea was proposed in the mid-1980s. It would rather spend hundreds of billions on nuclear submarines, nuclear power stations and high-speed trains. As a result, the superfast broadband roll-out will continue where subsidies make it financially viable, but it will never reach some remote users. Instead, they will have to use 4G mobile broadband, fixed wireless (if available) or a satellite dish. One or more of those may solve your problem. Test your lines? If a line can sometimes deliver 4Mbps, it should be able to sustain it. There could be a problem in your house, such as interference on internal cables, cable faults, or a faulty router. It might be worth having an expert check your installation. (BT will check some of it for £129.99.) There could also be faults in the BT cabling to your house, or the connections in the cabinet or the exchange. BT has an online troubleshooter that can help diagnose some faults, but Openreach – the division that maintains the network – should be able to find them. Your broadband speeds may also be affected by congestion at the exchange. Broadband – like water and electricity – is delivered on the basis that not everyone will want to use it at the same time. If they do, there isn’t enough to go around. Try logging your speed at different times of day, and in different types of weather, to see if there is a correlation. If there’s a techie in the house, the ping and traceroute utilities can help with trouble-shooting. I understand you already have both BT and Talk Talk broadband, but it’s worth keeping an eye on your local exchange to see if any other services become available. Just enter your village’s name, or your postcode, phone number or exchange code, at Sam Knows. Bonding and balancing Technically, it’s possible to combine two or more lines to create a single “bonded ADSL” broadband service, but hardly any ISPs support it. Another idea is to use a load-balancing or dual-WAN router. For example, a Draytek V2832N Vigor 2832n will convert two ADSL2 lines and a 3G/4G router into a single system. (And a Vigor 2860 would support two 3G/4G routers.) This should smooth out variable connection problems and avoid dropped connections, unless all the services go down at the same time. Wireless looks best If you can get 4G close to the house then you may be able to get up to 40Mbps inside, for a reasonable price. I covered this last year in Can I give up my landline and use 4G broadband? For example, Three’s HomeFi service offers 40GB for £24 per month, with a free router on a 12-month contract. If you run out, a 10GB top-up costs £20. EE, which is owned by BT, offers even better value for heavy users: 100GB of data for £45 per month, or 200GB for £60 per month. If you sign an 18-month contract, there are no up-front costs. With no contract, you pay £99.99 for the 4GEE home router. You could also buy your own router and just buy data sims when you need them. Aerials and repeaters You should get good 4G performance indoors if you install an external LTE aerial such as the Solwise 4G-XPOL, as long as there’s an aerial socket on your router. There are, of course, other ways to boost the signal. You have not been able to use them legally because Ofcom classed mobile repeaters as “radio apparatus” under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006. However, some became legal on 12 April under the Wireless Telegraphy (Mobile Repeater) Regulations 2018 exemption, with the proviso that transmitters can only be used indoors. Cel-Fi is already selling one. Fixed Wireless Access There are various fixed wireless access (FWA) services that could easily provide broadband to large areas of rural Britain, but they have been sadly neglected. Wimax is one example. Still, there are almost a hundred wireless ISPs listed at ISPreview, and many readers will be able to find a local one. Your best bet seems to be Beacon Broadband, which is based in Derry, and which is just rolling out services. It offers unlimited packages for £25 to £65 per month, and a £45 20Mbps business package would meet your needs, if Beacon can handle your location. The setup involves installing a dish, usually on the side of your house. Otherwise, two-way satellite services are the option of last resort, and they should be available everywhere. They have two major problems: latency and cost. The latency problem is that actions can be “laggy” because of the delay while a signal travels to the satellite and back. As for costs, check the options at a leading supplier such as Avonline. Prices range from £19.95 for 5GB per month to £149.95 for 150GB per month.

It’s here, though, that we’ll start, because it’s here that the Pee Dee river meets the Waccamaw and both flush into the Atlantic Ocean. Follow the Pee Dee north into central North Carolina, and it’s fed by the Rocky river, which is fed by Richardson creek, which on Sunday night was fed way too much rainwater. It’s near there, on a two-lane road that cuts through soybean fields, that a mother’s Hyundai Elantra was swept away by floodwaters from Hurricane Florence late on Sunday night. When the car settled against a tree, she reached over and unhooked her 14-month-old son and held him in her arms. But as she got out, she lost a grip on him, and Richardson creek, this small tributary hundreds of miles from the ocean, claimed one of Hurricane Florence’s youngest victims, a little boy named Kaiden Lee-Welch who, in a devastating photo later provided by the local sheriff’s office, wears a onesie that reads “Handsome Little Guy”. I’ve lived in North Carolina for half of my 38 years, and I can’t remember a heavier couple of weeks. Florence’s numbers alone are astounding: 37 people have died, more than 30in of rain fell, the Cape Fear river crested at more than 60ft, and 5,500 hogs and 3.4 million chickens drowned on farms, many of their limp bodies making their way downriver. I’ve driven all over the southern strip of the state in the past 10 days, back and forth between Charlotte and the coast for various reasons. On Monday, a three-and-a-half-hour drive to the coast took six hours. In rural, poor areas of Robeson county, people in towns like Fairmont burned debris as they waited for their turn on the river-cresting schedule, hoping it wouldn’t happen again. The way Florence hung out and spun over us for five days, snapping longleaf pine trees in half near the coast, sending the Pungo river into homes in Belhaven, causing people to post updates from Harkers Island begging for it to end, pouring half a year’s worth of rain over the course of a weekend – all just two years after Hurricane Matthew – it all makes me think we should stop naming hurricanes. We should stop giving them personalities, as if they’re just old college friends who haven’t grown up but still visit and act a fool, leaving you to say: “Oh, that’s just Flo being Flo. What can you do? I guess we’ll just clean up now.” Storms aren’t infrequent visitors any more. Their stays seem only to grow longer. I stopped at a high-water spot near Sunny Point, a vast military terminal south of Wilmington where the government transfers weapons and munitions between boats and trains and trucks. Sunny Point got 27.44in of rain in the storm, which would be a state record if other towns hadn’t received more. Two sheriff’s deputies were on one side of the water and two deputies were on the other, a few hundred yards away. They were here simply to advise people. Big trucks could make it, if they took the right line. But small cars would stall. A man in a car pulled up and waited, hoping the water would drop. He’d left work at the nearby nuclear power plant, where he’d been stranded for six days. Water lines to the plant were broken, and truckloads of potable water had been brought in to keep the place stable. Most workers slept in cots; this man slept in a chair, he says. Finally, on Tuesday, other employees arrived by ferry, and he was able to leave. He didn’t want to be named; he just wanted to get home. Deputies helped him map out a route around the water, a 15-minute drive now more than an hour. “Brunswick county is essentially three islands,” the county commissioner, Frank Williams, said from Leland, a town mostly under water not far from where we stood. That’s where I was trying to go. Instead I talked with the deputies for an hour, watching big trucks push water up to their grills, and decided that in my smaller truck, it wasn’t worth it. I turned around. Millions of years ago, the North Carolina shoreline was actually set against the Uwharrie Mountains, about 150 miles inland. But as the ocean receded, it left the Sandhills region and the coastal plain. You probably have favorite places, too. North Carolina’s coastal plain has been one of mine since I moved here nearly 20 years ago. The working waterfronts remind me of the towns back home in Maryland, where my father was a Chesapeake Bay fisherman. The people here cuss like he cussed, they shower at the end of the day because you just don’t go to bed smelling like fish, and for the most part nobody has a lot of money, so they all get along. A few years ago, I was out on a boat on Bogue Sound with a person who knows as much about the coast as anyone. Todd Miller is the founder and executive director of the North Carolina Coastal Federation, which works to maintain the health of the state’s 12,000 miles of estuarian shoreline. Miller’s team has restored oyster reefs and helped build “living shorelines”, with natural rocks and plants. Miller grew up on Bogue Sound and remembers wading out into it with a crab net as a kid. He lives on the sound today, in a town called Ocean. Miller saw the worst of Florence, but his home is about 25ft up on a hill, and the storm surge didn’t make it to him. He was cleaning up on Tuesday when we talked on the phone. He said the sound, which usually smells of saltwater, now was full of freshwater and runoff from upstream. Coming up with ways to maintain the integrity of that runoff is a big part of the Coastal Federation’s mission. Much is made of climate change in times of hurricanes, and rightfully so, Miller says, but the more immediate issue is a generation of developers who have clustered homes in vulnerable areas. “We tell people now that you can’t design and plan around normal climate events; you have to plan around extreme,” he said. “They’re happening. They’re not 500-year events any more.” “The hardship that folks are facing, it’s pretty awful,” Miller said. “And we have so much more population at risk, living in risky places. Our exposure is a lot higher than it’s ever been as the climate becomes more extreme. More people in harm’s way along with the unpredictable climate is a bad formula.” Late Tuesday afternoon, I wound up in a familiar place that had become unfamiliar. Boiling Spring Lakes is a small community built decades ago to house people who work at Sunny Point. Some of its homes are mobile; others are single-story places on fixed foundations, and others are larger and more idealized suburbia, with four or five bedrooms and a garage. The dam that built the lake that made the community broke on Saturday. The lake emptied into homes downstream. At the end of one street on Tuesday, one mobile home was its own island. One key road in the community traveled over the dam. I went to that spot, one of hundreds of places on the North Carolina department of transportation’s interactive map marked with a yellow exclamation point to signify it was out. This was a little different, though. When the dam broke, the pavement fell with it. Now there’s a gap, about 300ft wide and 30ft deep. Where the pavement ends, it’s jagged like a razor. I sat there awhile on Tuesday, watching people walk up to the edge, all saying their own versions of “holy shit”. To the south as far as we could see, what had been a lake was now a bed of mud. You could see what people had thrown in over the years, empty pipes and sawed-off stumps. There were people on the other side of the break in the road, still stranded and cut off. We couldn’t do anything for them but wave. We couldn’t even holler; they wouldn’t have heard us. The sky was blue all around, but down here people were just exhausted and sad and frustrated, folks from the same neighborhood now on different peninsulas. One person who walked up was Jimmy McKee. He’s the site manager at a nearby historic spot, Brunswick Town. Last week, McKee carried on a tradition that’s pretty important in these parts: he raised the hurricane flags in downtown Southport. From 1900 to 1962, a woman named Jessie Taylor had done it before every storm. Her official title was “voluntary weather observer”, which meant she took the calls from the National Weather Service when they needed to alert the town about a hurricane. Then she’d run out and raise two red and black hurricane flags on a pole. There’s a plaque in her honor in Southport. Others have carried on the tradition since then. Now it’s McKee. Standing there where the road was no more and the lake was no more and the trees were snapped in half, I asked McKee what he would tell people who aren’t from here and might believe that Florence wasn’t that bad. The latest voluntary weather observer for the region looked down and said: “I’d just shake my head and say look around. I can’t describe it.” He’s right. No one person’s perspective could sum up what Florence did. Those same floodwaters from Richardson Creek that drowned a little boy on Sunday night made their way through South Carolina on Wednesday, as the Pee Dee crested and shut down Interstate 95, perhaps the most important highway in the US. The same water that killed farm animals inland changed the complexion of Bogue Sound in front of Todd Miller’s house. The storm isolated us all and showed us how connected we are at same time. Another guy approached the break in the road and cussed. He told us he’d be on the crew in charge of fixing the pipes in the neighborhood. His bosses asked him to scout the area and see if any were showing around the dam. Sure enough, there were, down in the ravine. He’ll be out here later this week, boots in the mud, trying to make sure they’re all connected again. “This is gonna fucking suck,” he said. “We’ll do it, though. But you ain’t gonna stop Mama Nature. Hell no.” Michael Graff is a writer in Charlotte"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/aug/13/electric-cars-are-not-the-solution-pollutionwatch","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-13T20:30:23Z","webTitle":"Electric cars are not the solution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/13/electric-cars-are-not-the-solution-pollutionwatch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/aug/13/electric-cars-are-not-the-solution-pollutionwatch","fields":{"headline":"Electric cars are not the solution","bodyText":"Will our streets be pollution free when the last petrol and diesel cars are sold in the UK in just over two decades time? Sadly not. This is for two main reasons. First, we will still have diesel lorries and buses. Second, electric cars still release particle pollution into the air from wearing tyres, brakes and road surfaces. Already more particle pollution comes from wear than from the exhausts of modern vehicles. The trend towards open disc brakes rather than sealed drums looks to be making the situation worse and toxicologists say that these particles are not harmless. Despite regenerative braking, where electric motors are put into reverse to slow the car, one study found that the extra weight of the batteries means more particle pollution compared with the petrol or diesel vehicles that we buy today. Electric cars move pollution from our cities to distant power plants. For big benefits we need carbon-free electricity. Most studies focus on average driving and average electricity generation. Instead, if we consider real urban driving and off-peak charging, electric cars are already a low pollution option for Belgium, where over half of electricity comes from nuclear power, and for Beijing, where more efficient gas-fired power stations are rapidly replacing old coal ones. A quarter of England’s car trips are less than two miles. We can be more ambitious. Replacing petrol and diesel cars with electric would miss the opportunity to save the NHS around £17 billion over the next 20 years by swapping short car journeys for walking or cycling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/jan/09/indian-point-nuclear-plant-close-new-york","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-09T21:02:44Z","webTitle":"Indian Point nuclear plant in New York will close after dozens of 'safety events'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/09/indian-point-nuclear-plant-close-new-york","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/jan/09/indian-point-nuclear-plant-close-new-york","fields":{"headline":"Indian Point nuclear plant in New York will close after dozens of 'safety events'","bodyText":"The Indian Point nuclear power plant in New York, which last year leaked radioactive material into groundwater near New York City, will close by April 2021, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday. “For 15 years, I have been deeply concerned by the continuing safety violations at Indian Point, especially given its location in the largest and most densely populated metropolitan region in the country,” Cuomo said. “I am proud to have secured this agreement with Entergy [the plant’s operator] to responsibly close the facility 14 years ahead of schedule, to protect the safety of all New Yorkers.” The plant has had 40 “safety events”, “operational events”, and shutdowns since 2012. The shutdowns have exposed apparent fragility in the nuclear facility’s workings: in December 2015 the plant was shut down for three days after droppings from a “large bird” caused an arc between power lines and a transmission tower. In April 2016, Entergy admitted it had found that bolts holding together the interior of one of Indian Point’s reactors were damaged and, in some cases, missing. Entergy also came under fire in 2016 after the Guardian published a safety assessment of proposed natural gas pipelines to be built by energy pipeline company Spectra on Indian Point property. The assessment, provided to the Guardian by engineer Paul Blanch and obtained through a freedom of information act (Foia), was partly hand-drawn and did not adequately account for the damage to the plant that could result from a breach of the lines. Local environmental groups have made the plant a nemesis, though those who work at the facility in Buchanan, New York, want it to remain open. The plant employs just under 1,000 people; Entergy’s chairman and CEO, Leo Denault, thanked Indian Point’s employees in a statement on the coming closure and said the company was “committed to treating our employees fairly and will help those interested in other opportunities to relocate within the Entergy system”. Paul Gallay, of activist group Riverkeeper, has campaigned long and hard to have the plant closed. “Given the scope of the risk Indian Point poses, this is an essential step to a safer and more secure New York,” Gallay told the Guardian. Gallay said that although the announcement was encouraging, the project of detoxification was just beginning. “The very first priority is to get the spent fuel out of the overpacked storage pools where it’s resided for the whole 45-year length of the operation of the facility,” he said. “This agreement requires that and must be followed by prompt and full radiological decommissioning.” But he was pleased, he said. With Indian Point closed, “necessary cleanup work can begin in earnest”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/sep/01/hes-only-three-so-let-little-noah-just-be-himself","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-01T17:25:17Z","webTitle":"He’s only three so let little Noah just be himself | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/01/hes-only-three-so-let-little-noah-just-be-himself","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/sep/01/hes-only-three-so-let-little-noah-just-be-himself","fields":{"headline":"He’s only three so let little Noah just be himself","bodyText":"Your editorial (Killer robots can’t be confined to science fiction, 30 August) states “no nuclear power has ever given up their capacity to launch a nuclear attack”.

Drax Group’s Dorothy Thompson will be succeeded by Will Gardiner, currently the chief financial officer, who will take over in January at a time when the company is eyeing a mix of gas, biomass and battery power to replace coal. During her 12-year tenure, Thompson oversaw a period of major change, converting three of Drax’s huge coal-fired units to biomass and using acquisitions to expand into retail energy and gas power. “I retire knowing the group is in excellent shape: it has the right strategy, the right team and in Will, the right leader,” said Thompson. She said the company’s scale meant it was a strategic player in UK electricity generation. One of the few women at the top of one of the UK’s biggest energy generation companies, Thompson was not always comfortable in the glare of press scrutiny, but was a well-regarded leader who reinvented a major power firm. Along the way, she secured what will amount to billions of pounds in public subsidies for its wood-burning units. The company says the biomass units provide a reliable form of renewable electricity but critics have said their carbon dioxide savings do not stack up. With Theresa May reiterating this week that the UK will phase out coal power by 2025, the company knows its must continue to switch away from the fossil fuel. Last week Drax said it had informed planners it would consult on 3.6GW of new gas generation – slightly more than the capacity of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station – and 0.2GW of battery storage. Gardiner, who joined the company two years ago, said he would build on Thompson’s legacy. “The changes we are seeing in the UK energy sector are unprecedented and we have an opportunity to thrive while doing the right thing for the UK energy market,” he said. The company’s share price was down by 0.45% to 309p after the announcement, but analysts welcomed Gardiner’s appointment.

Nissan and one of the UK’s biggest challenger energy suppliers, Ovo, will offer the “vehicle-to-grid” service to buyers of the Japanese carmaker’s new Leaf from next year. After installing a special charger in a customer’s home, the supplier will take over the management of the car’s battery, with owners able to set a minimum amount of charge they want for driving the next day. Ovo will then automatically trade electricity from the battery, topping it up during off-peak periods when power costs about 4p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and selling it at peak times for about four times as much. The Ovo chief executive, Stephen Fitzpatrick, said the savings would cover the £350-£400 annual cost of charging an electric car. “Being able to feed back into the grid will mean that customers will be able to drive for free,” he said. There are about 100,000 plug-in cars in the UK, but National Grid has warned their rapid growth will require the equivalent of a few new nuclear power stations. However, the cars’ batteries could also help energy networks cope with the increasing but variable wind and solar power on the system, by returning power to the grid at times of peak demand and smoothing out inconsistencies in energy supply. The government recently launched a £20m fund for research into such vehicle-to-grid technology, which has previously been confined to private pilots, but will now be open to consumers. Fitzpatrick predicted that while the technology would initially have a “relatively modest” impact on the take-up of electric vehicles and easing pressure on the grid, it was “the thin end of a very important wedge”. In future, the flexibility provided by allowing power grid managers to draw on millions of electric cars would be “transformational”, he said. As well as avoiding the need for costly grid upgrades, paid for through energy bills, it could reduce the number of new power stations that need to be built, Fitzpatrick added. Nissan and Ovo have also collaborated to sell a £4,800 home battery system to households with solar power, similar to the Powerwall made by Elon Musk’s Tesla. The battery is pitched as a way for buyers to make more money from their solar panels, and Ovo will pay owners about £350 a year for allowing it to offer services to the power grid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/aug/09/china-uk-investment-key-questions-following-hinkley-point-c-delay","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T13:33:26Z","webTitle":"China-UK investment: key questions following Hinkley Point C delay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/09/china-uk-investment-key-questions-following-hinkley-point-c-delay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/aug/09/china-uk-investment-key-questions-following-hinkley-point-c-delay","fields":{"headline":"China-UK investment: key questions following Hinkley Point C delay","bodyText":"The relationship between the British and Chinese governments is under strain after the prime minister, Theresa May, decided to delay approval of the planned £18bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power station because of concerns over China’s 30% stake in the project. The move has prompted a warning from the Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, who said in a pointed Financial Times comment piece that relations with Britain were at a “crucial historical juncture”. Here are some of the key questions regarding the Sino-British relationship after the Hinkley Point delay. Why does Hinkley Point need Chinese investment? Building nuclear power stations is expensive, and prone to cost and time overruns. The Hinkley Point project is already heavily subsidised by UK taxpayers, while EDF, the French largely state owned company overseeing the project, is under significant financial stress. That is why EDF brought China General Nuclear Power Corporation on board to take a 33% stake in the project and help spread the financial load. China is also expected to have a significant role in future reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex, which is one of May’s biggest concerns. Why is the UK courting Chinese investment? Investment from abroad is particularly important when you have a large current account deficit, meaning more money flowing out of the country than coming in. The UK’s current account deficit was 6.9% of GDP in the first three months of the year, just shy of a record high of 7.2% in the fourth quarter of 2015. When an economy has a large current account deficit, it needs foreign money to help plug the gap in what is referred to as the balance of payments. One way to do so is to offset the current account deficit with a surplus in the capital account, which includes items such as investment from abroad. Thankfully, China has deep pockets, running a huge current account surplus. Last year, the then chancellor, George Osborne, said 265,000 British jobs owed their existence to China. What does China own in the UK? While the UK is not one of China’s top three investment destinations, Britain comes top in Europe, attracting more Chinese cash than Germany, France and Italy combined. Chinese investors have sunk about $38bn (£29bn) into everything from prime London real estate to banks and football clubs since 2005, according to figures from the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation. Three Chinese sovereign wealth funds are huge investors in the UK. Safe holds 1% of BP and China Investment Corporation has 9% of Thames Water and 1% of Diageo, the maker of Guinness and Johnnie Walker whisky. Shanghai-based Bright Foods owns 60% of Weetabix, while Pizza Express, Sunseeker yachts, House of Fraser and Wentworth golf club are all Chinese owned. Chinese investors are also keen on British football clubs, particularly in the Midlands. Aston Villa and Wolverhampton Wanderers were both bought by Chinese investors, while West Bromwich Albion is being sold to a Chinese investment group. Investors CMC own a 13% stake in Manchester City. What Sino-British deals have been signed recently? During the state visit of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, last October, the government announced £40bn of UK-Chinese partnerships, including Hinkley. BP agreed a £6.5bn contract to supply liquefied natural gas to China Huadian Corporation, while Rolls-Royce signed a £1.6bn deal to supply Trent 700 engines to aviation company HNA Group. China Construction Bank agreed to provide up to £6bn of funding to help regenerative medicine and tissue engineering research at Oxford University. Aston Martin sealed a £50m deal with China Equity to develop its zero-emissions RapidE sports car, while London Taxi Company owner Geely will invest £50m in research and a new fleet of black cabs capable of zero emissions. Chinese investment is also crucial for the Northern Powerhouse project, which was placed in doubt by the departure of Osborne, its architect. This has stoked fears that any cooling of relations with Beijing could damage efforts to narrow the economic gulf between the south-east and the north of England. What future infrastructure investment will need Chinese cash? Ambitious projects require billions of dollars of investment and Chinese infrastructure investors are among those with cash to spend. Last year, Osborne called on Chinese companies to bid for contracts worth nearly £12bn to build High Speed 2, the planned rail line between London and the Midlands. A third runway at Heathrow would also involve Chinese investment, because 10% of Heathrow Holdings is owned by CIC. Are there national security concerns about Chinese investment? Fears about allowing China such close involvement with highly sensitive nuclear projects are thought to be among the reasons for delaying final approval for Hinkley Point. The former shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy called on the government to reassure the public amid reports of concerns from members of the intelligence community. One such worry is thought to be the possibility that Chinese workers could install a backdoor system, giving Beijing the potential to shut down Britain’s nuclear power stations and use them as leverage in any future diplomatic row. It is not just nuclear technology that has set alarm bells ringing. Chinese telecoms company Huawei is keen to expand in the UK, but intelligence agencies are wary. By way of compromise, Huawei employs a team of independent cybersecurity experts, overseen by British intelligence, at a secretive Oxfordshire centre known as the Cell. Have other countries shied away from Chinese investment? Earlier this year, the Australian treasurer, Scott Morrison, blocked the sale of S Kidman &amp; Co to a Chinese consortium. The Australian company owned land equivalent to 1.3% of the country and the potential sale fuelled concerns about the scale of China’s investments in Australia. A previous bid was also blocked, in part due to national security concerns, because some of Kidman’s land is close to a nuclear testing site. Huawei was also barred from tendering to take part in Australia’s $38bn nationwide superfast broadband rollout. The US has been equally mistrustful of Chinese investment, largely due to fears of the potential for cyberespionage. Huawei and fellow telecoms company ZTE were deemed a threat to national security by a US congressional committee, and are blocked from winning contracts for the military and Pentagon. Why does China like the UK so much? Chinese investors do not spend their money out of affection for Britain; they do so largely because there is money to be made. But there are other factors that make the UK an attractive place to store cash, particularly for private investors. One of these is a stable regulatory and legal system. Business leaders sometimes fall foul of the regime in autocratic countries such as China, and when they do, they risk having their assets appropriated by the state. The same risk exists for investments in volatile economies around the world. That might explain why so much Chinese money has been poured into UK real estate, a solid investment governed by a predictable and fair legal system. Chinese investors have put more than $12bn into UK property, nearly a third of the country’s overall investment in Britain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/11/history-of-us-north-korea-deals-singapore-summit","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T09:45:27Z","webTitle":"History of US-North Korea deals shows hard part is making them stick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/11/history-of-us-north-korea-deals-singapore-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/11/history-of-us-north-korea-deals-singapore-summit","fields":{"headline":"History of US-North Korea deals shows hard part is making them stick","bodyText":"It is Donald Trump’s recurring boast that with the Singapore summit with Kim Jong-un, he has succeeded in negotiations with North Korea where his predecessors failed. But the claim obscures a long history of agreements made and broken by both countries. The lesson of two major deals, in 1994 and 2005, is that it is much easier to reach agreements than to implement them. In fact, the complex, fraught process of implementation has usually brought with it new flashpoints and new crises. Trump’s looming Singapore summit with Kim will be the first meeting between US and North Korean leaders, but that is largely because previous US presidents have balked at giving the Pyongyang regime such recognition and prestige without substantive progress towards disarmament. Each time a deal has been close, the same basic bargain has been on the table: that North Korea relinquish its nuclear arsenal in return for a mix of security and economic incentives. In 1992 – the first time the US and North Korea engaged diplomatically since the 1953 armistice – the Pyongyang regime faced similar isolation and intense economic pressure as it does today. The collapse of the Soviet Union robbed the regime of a steadfast ally and patron. Meanwhile, Beijing was telling North Korea to undergo the same transformative economic reforms as China. Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, was facing an existential threat. Then, like now, rapprochement between North and South Korea created a diplomatic opening for the US. In January 1992, the two Koreas signed an agreement on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. That led to meetings between American and North Korean diplomats at the US mission to the United Nations in New York, where the two delegations eyed each other warily after three decades of silence. The first thing that struck Robert Gallucci, who became chief US negotiator in 1993, was his counterparts’ identical lapel badges portraying the Great Leader. “I tried to imagine us sitting there with lapel pictures of Bill Clinton and I just couldn’t,” he recalled. The first two years of US engagement with North Korea were highly volatile, in which diplomatic breakthroughs were interspersed by dangerous crises. North Korea made an agreement in January 1992 with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to allow its nuclear complex at Yongbyon to be inspected, and at the same time the US called off its joint military exercises with South Korea. The consequent mood of optimism was short-lived. The arrival of the IAEA inspectors led rapidly to a conflict on how much of the Yongbyon nuclear plant they could see. The escalation culminated in the North Koreans unloading spent fuel roads from the Yongbyon reactor, a necessary precursor to extracting plutonium. The Clinton administration started reviewing plans for air strikes to stop them and the two sides came close to war. Just before Washington got to the point of ordering the evacuation of US nationals from the peninsula, the former president Jimmy Carter stepped in. He flew to Pyongyang for a personal meeting with Kim Il-sung, putting the diplomacy back on track and providing the impetus for the first major accord between the two countries, the 1994 Agreed Framework. According to the deal, North Korea would dismantle its reactor at Yongbyon, the source of its plutonium, in return for two civilian light water nuclear power stations, generally seen as less of a proliferation risk. Until those reactors were built, North Korea would receive shipments of US-financed fuel oil. The deal was sealed in Geneva and the North Koreans invited the US negotiators to their mission to toast its success. One of the US diplomats, Joel Wit, was on the point of downing his shot when he spotted snakes at the bottom of the bottle. It was snake liquor, popular across east Asia for special occasions. “Snake liquor really does smell like there has been a dead animal in the bottle, because there is,” Wit said. “I didn’t drink it, and as I turned around to put the glass down on the table I noticed that all the other Americans put theirs away. I’m not sure if the North Koreans noticed.” From such tentative beginnings, the Agreed Framework would last nearly nine years, but its implementation would be a constant struggle. A Republican-dominated Congress did its best to slow down fuel deliveries, and the construction timetable for the reactors was continually postponed. It later emerged that North Korea had been cheating by pursuing a secret uranium route to making a bomb. That was enough for the hawks in the Bush administration, John Bolton among them, to kill off the Agreed Framework. The accord’s defenders suggest that the uranium enrichment programme was the regime’s hedge against the US reneging on the deal, and it could have been closed down through negotiations. They also argue that the Agreed Framework held back the weapons programme for most of the 1990s. Christopher Hill, who became the Bush administration’s chief negotiator with North Korea, disagreed with the decision to end the Agreed Framework. “My own view is we lost control of the plutonium process, we lost inspectors on the ground. We lost the capacity to understand what was going on there,” Hill said. After a break in contact of more than two years, Hill was given the task of re-establishing contacts with the North Koreans under the format of multilateral, six-party talks. Those negotiations eventually led to a 2005 joint statement of principles to guide future negotiations, which included some of the elements of the Agreed Framework, such as the eventual provision of light water reactors, and a lot of language that will be on the table in Tuesday’s talks between Trump and Kim. The statement called for “the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula … in a phased manner in line with the principle of ‘commitment for commitment, action for action.’” The joint statement once more raised hopes that the US and North Korea had turned a corner in their relationship, but it began to fall apart almost immediately. Within weeks, the US Treasury imposed new sanctions, freezing $23m (£17m) in North Korean assets in a bank in the Chinese territory of Macau, using counter-terror legislation. It was a relatively small amount of money, but it infuriated the North Koreans and the Chinese, who saw it as a violation of the spirit of the joint statement. US diplomats who had negotiated the 2005 statement were also taken by surprise. “I think it’s fair to say that one part of the US government was not particularly in touch with another part of US government, not for the first or last time,” said Hill, who saw it as an act of sabotage by hawks such as Bolton in the Bush administration. “I think the real purpose of it was to screw up the negotiations.” As relations spiralled downwards, North Korea tested seven ballistic missiles in July 2006, and conducted its first nuclear test in October the same year. The US ended up refunding North Korea the money it had frozen in Macau, and provided shipments of fuel oil, and in return the regime closed down its Yongbyon reactor and provided a partial inventory of its nuclear programme. But the six-party talks became bogged down in the question of verification. As before, North Korea was prepared to allow inspectors in but sought to limit what they could see. Kim Jong-un has struck one deal with the US, in February 2012. Under the Leap Year agreement, the regime undertook once more to suspend enrichment in Yongbyon under IAEA verification and to suspend nuclear and missile testing, in exchange, the Obama administration pledged to send food aid. Once more, the deal fell apart within weeks when North Korea conducted missile launches, which it insisted were for satellite deployment. The US deemed them a breach of the Leap Year agreement and halted plans to send food aid. Through three generations of the Kim dynasty, and successive US administrations, the biggest obstacle has not been reaching an agreement but making it stick. This has not only been a result of North Korea seeking to circumvent deals it has made, but a recurrent problem of US administrations sending conflicting signals, as different factions vie for control of policymaking. Whatever form of words Trump and Kim Jong-un agree on Tuesday, the history of US negotiations with North Korea suggest an agreement on paper is just the start, not the end, of any effort to achieve a real compromise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/mar/09/fukushima-communities-struggling","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-09T03:36:44Z","webTitle":"Town where nobody's home: Fukushima communities struggling to survive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/09/fukushima-communities-struggling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/mar/09/fukushima-communities-struggling","fields":{"headline":"Town where nobody's home: Fukushima communities struggling to survive","bodyText":"Okuma, on Japan’s east coast, used to host a busy community of 10,500 people. But today the houses stand empty. The town is empty because it is one of the closest to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station and – seven years after the earthquake and tsunami that triggered a triple meltdown – it remains under evacuation orders with decontamination still not finished. However, Okuma is not totally deserted. It is patrolled by Jijii Butai, or The Old Man squad. A group of hardy retirees who keep watch over their beloved former home. Tsunemitsu Yokoyama, 65, stands a few metres from a pick-up truck and recalls how he and his friends responded when they spotted a strange person on their streets. “There was a suspicious person who was walking around the town one day and we noticed this suspicious person and we picked this person up and we put him on the truck,” says the mild-mannered former town hall worker. “If we notice any suspicious actions or people of course we alert [the authorities].” Yokoyama is one of six retirees who formed the squad five years ago, partly to allay the concerns of homeowners about potential break-ins and fires. He says the squad members are less worried about radiation exposure than the younger generation because “we don’t have many years ahead of us anyway”. Almost every day, they travel from their new homes one to two hours away and conduct volunteer patrols. Despite the early focus on suspicious activity, they are now more likely to be occupied by keeping the town clean and tidy, looking out for damage caused by wild boars, picking up any rubbish that may have accumulated in the waterways, and clearing away fallen trees. “We belong to the same generation, we are around the same age, so we can understand each other pretty well in terms of sharing the same goal and also the objective and hope for this town,” Yokoyama says of the bond they’ve formed. The long road home The streets are not as quiet as they used to be. In some parts of the town, residents are now allowed to enter to periodically check up on their homes – but they are not allowed to stay overnight. It’s clear, however, that it will be a long and difficult process to entice them back given they have set up new lives elsewhere. Even Shuyo Shiga, the leader of the Okuma town recovery project, expects that the rest of his family will stay away once the situation has been put back to relative normality. For starters, it won’t be a case of simply moving back into their old home: Shiga’s property is part of a parcel of land earmarked to become an interim storage facility for nuclear waste. In addition, he says one of his three children suffered great trauma from seeing their neighbours “swallowed up by the tsunami” as they tried to flee the powerful waters. They are now in their 20s. “I think a person that has that kind of difficult experience, it’s very hard for them to come back to Okuma,” Shiga says. “The children said they will not return … and my wife is talking about not returning, so I suppose it will be for me to return to Okuma as a single person – not with my family, not with my wife.” The town is starting its recovery with modest ambitions. Residential homes are being built for 50 households – the number that indicated on a questionnaire that they wanted to come back. Eventually, says Shiga, the town plans to build 100 detached houses. But this is just a fraction of the pre-disaster population. It tends to be older residents who wish to return, he adds. Elsewhere in Fukushima prefecture, the town of Namie is a stark example of the challenges of getting a former evacuation zone back on track. Authorities lifted the evacuation orders there on 31 March 2017, except for some districts. Compared with Namie’s previous population of 21,000, so far just 490 people have returned. Yohei Aota, an official with the Namie town government, reveals the figures as he looks out over the portside district of Ukedo – a low-lying area that was swamped by a 15.5-metre wave. His home was one of those destroyed. Painful reminders “Of course looking at the scenery reminds me of what happened,” he says from an elevated vantage point where the local elementary students successfully escaped the reach of the tsunami. Now the school building stands empty and most of the homes in the area have been demolished. “There used to about 1,900 people living here [in Namie’s Ukedo district] but 182 people died unfortunately from the tsunami,” Aota says. “And actually there are still 30 missing persons – no remains, no belongings have been found of these 30 missing persons.” Fukushima authorities area anxious to say that a lot of progress has been made since May 2012 when the number of evacuees from across the entire prefecture peaked at 164,865. That figure has fallen below 50,000. But people are not exactly rushing back. Rieko Watanabe, 65, who evacuated from Namie to Minamisoma, says everyone has their own reasons for why they have not returned. She commutes from Minamisoma to run her business called Grandma Kitchen which serves meals and bento boxes to residents and workers. Watanabe notes that the people in Namie are shy about their plans for the future. “But they often look around and if they notice a friend or an acquaintance or a neighbour returning they might say, ‘oh maybe it’s time for me to return as well and maybe I can do something’. We are praying every day and we are working hard every day so that this trend of people coming back to Namie would be strengthened and can be maintained.” She adds with a determined smile: “Never give up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2017/jul/12/donald-trump-news-russia-witch-hunt","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-12T21:54:10Z","webTitle":"Trump backs son and blasts Russia 'witch hunt' | The minute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/jul/12/donald-trump-news-russia-witch-hunt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2017/jul/12/donald-trump-news-russia-witch-hunt","fields":{"headline":"Trump backs son and blasts Russia 'witch hunt'","bodyText":"Donald Trump dismissed emails in which his son embraced an offer of Russian support for his presidential campaign, reverting to flat denials of any ties to Moscow and calling investigations of such ties a “witch hunt”. 20 denials of Russian ties The president tweeted a day after Donald Trump Jr appeared on Fox to explain having jumped at the chance to catch Russian dirt on Clinton.

It is all about timing. Japan wasn’t due to hold an election for the powerful lower house until the end of next year, but Abe spied an opportunity to take advantage of a weak and divided opposition. In addition, his approval ratings have recovered since the summer, when he was implicated in two education-related scandals. With echoes of his UK counterpart Theresa May, Abe has argued that Japan needs strong and stable government at a time of domestic and international uncertainty. Unlike May, however, his gamble is likely to pay off. He is expected to win approval for his hard line against North Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes, but he could struggle to convince voters of his plans to go through with a rise in the consumption (sales) tax in late 2019. The measure, which Abe says is needed to fund social security spending and later to pay down Japan’s debts, is unpopular with the public. He has tried to sweeten the move by promising a 2 trillion yen ($17.8bn) stimulus package to fund childcare, education and social care for the elderly. There is also an element of personal ambition: a comfortable win for Abe’s coalition would improve his chances of staying on as Liberal Democratic party (LDP) president next September, enabling him to become Japan’s longest-serving prime minister. Who is Yuriko Koike? Koike shook up Japanese politics in the summer of 2016 when she became the first female governor of Tokyo. Despite once serving as Abe’s defence minister during his first, short-lived, stint as prime minister a decade ago, Koike defied the LDP to run for the governorship and then formed a local party that routed her erstwhile colleagues in Tokyo metropolitan assembly elections in July. Her decision to return to national politics with the launch of Kibo no To (Party of Hope) on the day Abe dissolved parliament prompted speculation that she was about to transform the country’s political landscape. But just days into the campaign, there is markedly less talk of the Party of Hope as a credible alternative to Abe’s LDP after several disappointing poll results. Whatever happens, Koike – who decided not to run for the lower house herself in order to continue as Tokyo’s governor – will remain an influential figure. The former news anchor and Arabic speaker has described herself as a “conservative reformist” who wants to take on vested interests. A defence hawk who admires Margaret Thatcher, Koike also supports legislation to ban discrimination against Japan’s LGBT community and has described herself as a “compassionate conservative”. The election probably came too soon for the Party of Hope, but winning several dozen seats would lend credence to its claims to be a serious opposition party. What are the main issues? North Korea aside, the early phase of the election campaign focused on the proposed increase in the sales tax, from 8% to 10%, in two years’ time. While Abe insists the extra revenue is needed to fund social security spending, Koike has said she would freeze the hike and provide a basic income to poorer households. Her economic agenda – dubbed “Yurinomics” after her given name – is short on detail. She has spoken in general terms about promoting private sector investment though a combination of deregulation and taxing companies’ huge retained earnings, while ditching the aggressive public spending and monetary easing that have characterised Abe’s five years in office. Nuclear power is also on the agenda, almost seven years after the triple meltdown in Fukushima. Abe is pushing for nuclear reactor restarts that he says will lower Japan’s dependence on expensive fuel imports and help it meet its climate change commitments. Koike wants to phase out nuclear power by 2030 and increase renewables’ share of the energy mix to just under a third. Intriguingly, the Party of Hope’s platform vows to achieve “12 zeroes” – including “zero hay fever” and “zero abandoned pets”. How big a factor is the North Korean nuclear crisis? Abe has put the perceived threat from North Korean missiles at the heart of his campaign, not least because polls show most voters support his hard line against Pyongyang. Along with the low birthrate and large elderly population, North Korea’s missile programme represents a “national crisis” for Japan, Abe has said. The regime has sent two ballistic missiles over the northern island of Hokkaido in recent weeks, triggering alerts and calls for Japan to develop the ability to strike North Korean military site. Which party is expected to win? With less than a week to go, it is looking as if Koike will have to settle for a distant second. In contrast to the excitement that greeted her party’s sudden arrival on the political scene, Koike has been criticised for her high-handed approach towards liberal deserters from the Democratic party who had showed an interest in running as Party of Hope candidates. Some voters have questioned her decision to get involved in national politics while she is still in charge of a city of almost 14 million people. The absence of any real ideological differences between Koike and Abe, particularly on security, may tempt LDP voters to stick with the party they know, rather than the Tokyo governor’s newly formed band of “conservative reformers”. One poll this week even suggested that the LDP and its junior coalition partner, Komeito, could come close to retaining their two-thirds “supermajority” in the lower house. The Nikkei business paper put the coalition on course to win 290 seats in the 465-seat chamber. That was roughly in line with polls taken by other media organisations. The Nikkei survey projected Hope would win 69 seats, with the Constitutional Democratic party, a left-leaning group that wants to preserve the constitution, on just over 40 seats. Will it be business as usual if Abe’s party retains its majority? Abe has show little interest in altering his economic policy – a mixture of fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reform. The Tokyo stock exchange’s recent rise to levels not seen since the mid-1990s, plus encouraging growth and employment figures, will only reinforce his belief that so-called Abenomics represents Japan’s best chance of ending two decades of stagnation. The sales tax rise, though, could hit already weak consumer spending – a drawback Koike has pointed out in the run-up to polling day. On foreign policy, Abe will continue to take a tough stance on North Korea and cultivate his relatively good relationship with Donald Trump. Another five years in office will give Abe perhaps his last chance to pursue his long-held dream of revising Japan’s constitution. For postwar conservatives like Abe, the US-authored “pacifist” constitution places unfair constraints on the country’s self-defence forces and is rooted in irrational fears of a return to the disastrous militarism of the first half of the 20th century. At the very least, Abe wants the constitution to clarify the role of the country’s self-defence forces (SDF) to reflect new security challenges posed by a rising China, North Korea and international terrorism. Domination of the lower house by the LDP and the Party of Hope, which also supports constitutional reform, could give him the mandate he needs. Revision requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of the Japanese parliament and a simple majority in a national referendum. The strongest opposition could come from the public, 35% of whom support enshrining the SDF in the constitution, according to a recent poll, with 42% opposed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2015/oct/26/nuclear-power-advocate-alan-finkel-to-be-named-australias-chief-scientist","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-26T01:09:51Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power advocate Alan Finkel to be named Australia's chief scientist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/oct/26/nuclear-power-advocate-alan-finkel-to-be-named-australias-chief-scientist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2015/oct/26/nuclear-power-advocate-alan-finkel-to-be-named-australias-chief-scientist","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power advocate Alan Finkel to be named Australia's chief scientist","bodyText":"A vocal advocate of nuclear power in Australia, Dr Alan Finkel, is set to be named as the country’s next chief scientist. The appointment of Finkel, an engineer and former neuroscience research fellow who has served as the chancellor of Monash University since 2008, is due to be announced by Malcolm Turnbull this week. It is not yet clear whether the prime minister’s choice, first reported by the Herald Sun on Monday, signals a new openness by the government to consider nuclear power generation. Finkel has previously called for debate about nuclear electricity, saying Australia would be able to manage such a system “at very high safety levels”. He has couched his arguments in terms of the potential of nuclear power to curb global emissions of carbon dioxide. Guardian Australia has independently confirmed that Finkel’s appointment is set to be announced this week. He will replace Professor Ian Chubb, who was appointed as chief scientist by the Gillard government in 2011. The former prime minister Tony Abbott extended Chubb’s term to the end of 2015. Turnbull praised Chubb for a “distinguished term of leadership”, as the prime minister vowed to place science “right at the centre and the heart of our national agenda”. “Even when science has been under attack, you have never flinched and you have always stood up for science and its central importance in Australia, both today and in our future,” Turnbull told Chubb at the prizes for science dinner in Canberra last week. “Now, the best accolade I can give Ian Chubb is to assure him that we’re working to put into effect the very ambitious agenda he set us. We have to be – and we will be – a country that invests in science and puts it right at the centre of our national agenda.” Finkel is president of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering. He also heads the classroom resources company Stile Education and chairs the Australian Centre of Excellence for All-Sky Astrophysics. The energy white paper released by the Abbott government in April 2015 did not signal any shift from the legislated ban on nuclear energy plants in Australia. But it did suggest the Coalition would consider the findings of the yet-to-be completed nuclear royal commission launched by the South Australian Labor government. Asked on Saturday about the possibility of establishing a nuclear industry, the federal Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said he would “wait to see what the royal commission says” but had “always believed that the cost of nuclear energy outweighs the economic benefits, and that’s before we get to the environmental safeguards”. “Our priorities are on solar and wind power, renewable energy, [and] making sure that we’ve got fair dinkum targets for climate change,” Shorten said on the sidelines of the South Australian Labor party conference. The position of chief scientist provides high-level advice to the prime minister and other ministers on science, technology and innovation, while publicly championing research and evidence-based decision making."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/jul/31/hinkley-offers-useful-guide-to-mays-plans-cameron-legacy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-31T04:01:25Z","webTitle":"Hinkley offers a useful guide to May’s plans for Cameron’s legacy | Andrew Rawnsley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/31/hinkley-offers-useful-guide-to-mays-plans-cameron-legacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/31/hinkley-offers-useful-guide-to-mays-plans-cameron-legacy","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley offers a useful guide to May’s plans for Cameron’s legacy","bodyText":"It turns out that there is a nuclear button that Theresa May is reluctant to press. She has just made her first big policy decision by choosing to pause and review government support for the mammothly controversial Hinkley Point nuclear reactor. Be in no doubt that this was a call made in Downing Street. It may have been Greg Clark, the business and energy secretary, who released the surprise news in a terse, late-hour statement from his department, but the order to delay came from Number 10. Only days earlier, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, had told Kamal Ahmed, the BBC’s economics editor, that the plant was definitely going ahead. The pause has evidently come as a complete shock to EDF, which had already ordered in the champagne for the contract signing after the board of the French state-owned company signed off on the project on Thursday. Even if it ultimately gets the green light in the autumn, choosing to reappraise the Hinkley C project is a significant act in itself. The pause has cheered and emboldened enemies of the plant, both those who are against it on the grounds that it is a vanity project that will prove ruinously expensive to the taxpayer and those who are opposed to nuclear reactors because they involve splitting uranium atoms. The delay has frustrated and angered the project’s supporters who ask how this fits with the government’s attempt to convince the world that a Brexit Britain will still be open for foreign investment. It has added tension to relations with the French at a time when they are already strained by Britain’s vote to leave the EU. The Chinese, to whom face matters so very much, aren’t pleased that their heavy involvement was clearly one of Mrs May’s problems with the project. The GMB, the relevant trade union, has called the delay “bonkers”. Labour people have had an opportunity to describe something other than their own party as “chaotic”. This decision has also shed some revelatory light on how Mrs May intends to operate. She wants her Number 10 to call the big shots – and she wants people to know that it is calling those shots. Another thing it underlines – and this point is so obvious that it has been almost completely missed – is that Mrs May has not been prime minister for terribly long. She moved into Downing Street less than three weeks ago. She had less time to prepare for the transition than initially expected because it was accelerated when she received the unopposed coronation that she originally said she didn’t want. Since Mrs May acquired the keys to Number 10, she has not spent all that much time in her new home. Many of her early days as prime minister have been spent travelling around Europe – if it’s Thursday, it must be Warsaw – trying to get acquainted with leaders who will be crucial to the Brexit negotiations. She has also devoted time to visits to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for Brexit-related reasons. I’m told that Mrs May is already finding that Brexit discussions, both the talks with European leaders and those taking place within her cabinet as ministers try to thrash out an agreed negotiating strategy, are consuming much more of her diary than she hoped. That has left her with less time to address an in-tray groaning with a pile of other decisions waiting to be made. This bequest of unfinished business from her predecessor did not accumulate because David Cameron was a chronically indecisive leader. It was often a better critique of him that he made major calls without spending sufficient time thinking through all the consequences. The backlog of decisions has mounted up because the energies of government have been so consumed by Europe for the best part of the last year: first by the pre-referendum negotiations, then by the long referendum campaign, and in the past month by the political turbulence and economic uncertainty unleashed by the result. In those breathing spaces that have not been dominated by Brexit, Mrs May has been endeavouring to immerse herself in a wide array of subjects with which she had only a glancing engagement during her six years as home secretary. She was party to earlier cabinet discussions about Hinkley Point, but these were largely superficial. Cabinet long since ceased to be a forum for meaty policy debate and crunchy decision-making, not least because prime ministers have become so fearful of discussions being leaked. Were Mrs May of a different temperament, I suppose she might have been content to devolve the decision about Hinkley. But the other important players are also new to their jobs and, anyway, we know that Mrs May is not an instinctive delegator. She is also usually at the careful rather than the rapid end of the spectrum when it comes to decision-making. Impetuosity is not her hallmark. She doesn’t like to be rushed or bounced. Her preference is to work through problem issues by reading all the relevant papers and keeping discussion tight with the small group of people whom she really trusts. Colleagues report that she hates having to commit to a course before she has examined all the angles and the Hinkley project is freighted with a lot of risks. The near-horizon cost is £18bn and rising. The potential future charge on taxpayers and electricity bill payers is higher still. Britain has had a disillusioning history when it comes to nuclear power, a technology this country largely invented but has been very poor at using successfully. If Mrs May wants to do further reading on the subject, I recommend Professor Simon Taylor’s excellent recent book, The Fall and Rise of Nuclear Power in Britain. When so much money is involved, and so many people think there is such potential for this project to go very badly wrong, it is not really so astonishing that Mrs May wanted a pause. As a new prime minister with a lot on her plate, there is some willingness to forgive the chaotic manner in which the review was announced, but she won’t always enjoy the benefit of the doubt. A previous occupant of her job once told me that Number 10 has to make about a hundred decisions a day of one sort or another. Many of those decisions are big. A lot of them are urgent. It remains to be seen whether Mrs May’s cautious method will be entirely compatible with the sheer velocity of decision-making that is required of a modern prime minister operating in a 24/7 media world. One thing she does know a lot about from her previous role is security. “There will always be a little bit of the Home Office inside me,” she told her civil servants when she made her farewell speech at Marsham Street before moving to Number 10. The Hinkley deal binds Britain into a high level of Chinese involvement in other nuclear reactors and that has always troubled her on security grounds. One of the fiercest critics of making China so central to critical infrastructure and energy supply has been Nick Timothy, a long-standing aide of the prime minister who is now a figure of considerable influence as her joint chief of staff. He usefully put a lot of his thoughts about big issues into the public domain during a period out of government when he shared his views with the ConservativeHome website. In one post, Mrs May’s right-hand man accused David Cameron’s government of “selling our national security to China” on the grounds that “the Chinese could use their role to build weaknesses into computer systems, which will allow them to shut down Britain’s energy production at will”. It is a big black mark for Hinkley in the mind of Mrs May that the project is an inheritance from her predecessor. Since she arrived at Downing Street, she has made a conscious effort to project herself not as a continuity with Mr Cameron, but a break from him. Her early statements as prime minister have contained a lot of implicit disparaging – and some explicit criticism – of his record. His allies were ruthlessly culled in her sweeping reshuffle. Her working majority in the Commons is 17. That is smaller than the number of ministers she sacked, which is likely to become a problem when her honeymoon fades and festering grievances surface. It wasn’t enough for her to dispatch George Osborne. Her people let the world know that he had been fired as chancellor rather than allow him to preserve some dignity by dressing it up as a resignation. The new regime at Number 10 instinctively treats any legacy from the Cameron-Osborne government as a dodgy bequest of the most suspect provenance. It was the reverse of helpful for the Hinkley deal that its most eager sponsor in the previous cabinet was Mr Osborne. That in itself made it suspect in the eyes of Mrs May. The former chancellor was also the keenest champion of a third runway at Heathrow so I would not be betting on that happening. She has already junked his deficit reduction plan and downgraded his focus on the Northern Powerhouse. It will take a while before we get the full measure of how Mrs May will perform as prime minister. But we now have a useful, early rule of thumb for predicting how she will act. Imagine what George Osborne would do in any given situation and assume that Theresa May will do the opposite."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jan/05/donald-trump-mental-health-fitness-for-office","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-05T19:06:27Z","webTitle":"Book revelations put new focus on Donald Trump's mental health","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/05/donald-trump-mental-health-fitness-for-office","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jan/05/donald-trump-mental-health-fitness-for-office","fields":{"headline":"Book revelations put new focus on Donald Trump's mental health","bodyText":"The revelations in Michael Wolff’s explosive book about Donald Trump’s first year in office have renewed scrutiny of the president’s mental health. Although the White House has denounced Wolff’s Fire and Fury as “complete fantasy”, the book sheds light on concerns among top White House aides over Trump’s psychological fitness for America’s highest office. “Everybody was painfully aware of the increasing pace of his [Trump’s] repetitions,” Wolff wrote. “It used to be inside of 30 minutes he’d repeat, word-for-word and expression-for-expression, the same three stories – now it was within 10 minutes. Indeed, many of his tweets were the product of his repetitions – he just couldn’t stop saying something.” The claims in Wolff’s book have been rejected by the White House and Trump allies, but they do not exist in isolation. Trump’s highly provocative behavior has routinely been the subject of public alarm, prompting private discussions in Washington over the potential of invoking the 25th amendment, which enables the president to be removed from office if the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet deem him physically or mentally “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office”. Trump’s recent tweet taunting the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un – boasting about his own “much bigger &amp; more powerful” nuclear button – amplified concerns over the most extreme possible consequences of the president’s unfiltered and largely unchecked behavior. The sense of urgency surrounding Trump’s mental state even led Bandy Lee, an assistant clinical professor at the Yale School of Medicine, to brief a dozen members of Congress last month on the potential risks associated with the president’s behavior. Lee, whose career has centered on studying, predicting and preventing violence, told the Guardian she and other psychiatrists were speaking out because they feel “the danger has become imminent”. Trump, she said, has already shown verbal aggressiveness, bragged about sexual assault, and incited violence at his rallies. “He’s shown an attraction to powerful weapons and war and provoked a hostile nation that already has an unstable leader and nuclear power,” Lee said. “All these signs are not just signs of dangerousness, but of the most cataclysmic kind of violence that could put an end to human life as we know it.” In October, Lee edited The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, a book consisting of essays from 27 mental health professionals assessing the president. Two months later, she earned an audience on Capitol Hill with a group of lawmakers. The meetings, first revealed by Politico, included more than a dozen Democrats from the House of Representatives and one Republican senator. Lee, who declined to identify any of the lawmakers by name, is also poised to meet with a Republican representative this month. Lee stressed she and others are not diagnosing the president, but rather seeking to send a message to take seriously his fitness for the Oval Office. “We’re concerned about the public health risk posed by him, by his mental instability,” she said. “We’re not concerned about him as a person. We are concerned about his being in the office of the presidency.” Lee’s public warnings have also prompted some to revisit a code of ethics instituted by the American Psychiatric Association, known as the Goldwater Rule, that prevents psychiatrists from commenting on the mental health of public figures without having examined them in person. A recent analysis, using concerns over the psychiatric status of Trump as its premise, deemed the rule to be outdated and undermining what some psychological scientists see as a “duty to inform”. Trump’s supporters have rejected suggestions that the president is mentally unstable. Chris Ruddy, a longtime friend of Trump’s and the chief executive of the conservative Newsmax Media, said: “He is not psychologically unfit, he has not lost it.” Ruddy told CNN on Friday about time they spent together in December: “He was not repeating things. Present was a medical doctor who’s a mutual friend of ours: he had no belief and view that the president was mentally incompetent and unfit. This is just an absurdity and it’s really trash, actually.” The secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who has never denied privately calling Trump a “moron”, has given an interview, telling CNN: “I have never questioned his mental fitness. I have no reason to question his mental fitness.” The question was nonetheless posed to the White House podium, drawing a sharp rebuke from the press secretary, Sarah Sanders. “It’s disgraceful and laughable,” Sanders said. To professionals like Lee, it is the refusal of those in Trump’s orbit to acknowledge the issue that will ultimately cause the public to underestimate his fitness for the presidency. “People will minimize the signs and also won’t recognize it,” she said, “but he will grow worse.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/sep/21/george-osborne-chinese-nuclear-power-station-bradwell-essex","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-21T20:34:09Z","webTitle":"Osborne expected to back Chinese nuclear power station in Essex","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/21/george-osborne-chinese-nuclear-power-station-bradwell-essex","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/sep/21/george-osborne-chinese-nuclear-power-station-bradwell-essex","fields":{"headline":"Osborne expected to back Chinese nuclear power station in Essex","bodyText":"China is expected to be allowed to build a nuclear power station in Essex as George Osborne embraced the world’s most populous country as an ideal partner for British business. The chancellor, on a trade mission to the country, argued that Britain should “run towards China” to help boost the UK economy and signalled that China could build a nuclear site in Bradwell, Essex, as part of a wider nuclear co-operation worth tens of billions of pounds. Speaking at a press conference, Osborne sidestepped concerns over Downing Street’s growing proximity to Beijing. When asked about what US officials have called Britain’s “constant accommodation” of Beijing, Osborne added: “I think it is important that, as China grows, it rightly takes its place at the top table.” The chancellor also used his visit to announce £6m for cultural exchanges to boost tourism, including sending the British Museum’s blockbuster exhibition A History of the World in 100 Objects to China, plus tours of Mandarin versions of Shakespeare and the first world war drama War Horse. Osborne is due to visit the Shanghai stock exchange on Tuesday to pledge that Britain will “stick together” with the east Asian power, after a period when the Chinese stock market has been hit by sharp falls. Aiming to establish the City of London as China’s “bridge” to western financial markets, Osborne is expected to say: “Whatever the headlines, regardless of the challenges, we shouldn’t be running away from China. Through the ups and downs, let’s stick together ... to grow our economies.” However, despite Osborne’s optimism, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said on Monday that China could be heading for a rough economic patch. In a speech in London, Carney described China’s economic “miracle” in the last three decades as extraordinary, but noted that performance since the recession of 2008-09 had “been bolstered by a large build-up of debt, which has more than doubled to reach almost 200% of GDP”. Some were now questioning China’s “glide path to global economic hegemony”, the governor said. The Bradwell site is owned by EDF, the French energy company. EDF is also the lead partner with two Chinese companies in the building of Hinkley Point C in Somerset, the first nuclear power station to be built in Britain for a generation – and on Monday Osborne unveiled a £2bn loan guarantee for the plant. The £24.5bn Hinkley project has been much delayed and EDF has struggled to finance it. Industry observers believe that the Chinese agreement to help finance Hinkley is conditional on the UK allowing Chinese companies to construct their own nuclear plant at Bradwell. “This civil nuclear cooperation … opens the door to majority Chinese ownership of a subsequent nuclear project in Bradwell,” said Osborne, according to Reuters. The energy minister, Amber Rudd, accompanying Osborne, said the UK would benefit from low-carbon energy, while China wanted a first showcase in the west for its newly developed nuclear technology. “They very much want to have their design up and running in the UK,” she told the Financial Times. “That’s because we have such tough standards of regulation everyone can have confidence they are safe and show that they have a great operation to take elsewhere.” However, while welcoming the £2bn support for Hinkley, the GMB union, which represents nuclear workers, said linking that deal to a reactor at Bradwell would be a “betrayal” of British workers. Brian Strutton, GMB national secretary for energy, said: “Chinese nuclear technology is unproven and no UK government should even consider allowing it to be used in a new nuclear power station 60 miles from London.” In May, a leading Chinese nuclear physicist, He Zuoxiu, told the Guardian that China’s “insane” rapid nuclear expansion was compromising safety. He said: “Nuclear energy costs are cheap [in China] because we lower our standards.” The £2bn support for Hinkley was welcomed by Jenifer Baxter, head of energy and environment at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers: “This development is welcome news and long overdue. Nuclear is set to play a central and vital role in the UK’s energy future. “Although the financial costs of nuclear power seem high, this power station will provide and modernise the diversification we so badly need in ensuring the UK’s lights stay on. The government now needs to push forward with the development of other nuclear power sites.” However, experts including analysts and HSBC bank, have been lining up in recent months to condemn the deal. Lord Turnbull, former head of the civil service, told Osborne that the Hinkley deal was a “bottomless pit and a big white elephant”, while the former energy minister Lord Howell, Osborne’s father-in-law, said it was “one of the worst deals ever” for British consumers and industry. In his press conference on Monday, Osborne made no mention of an intensifying human rights crackdown in China, which has seen more than 200 lawyers and activists “disappeared”, detained or interrogated since July. But in an emailed statement to the Guardian, he said the issues remained important: “We don’t see a choice between securing growth and investment and raising human rights issues. We do both consistently, and indeed I have done so in meetings here in China.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/aug/11/may-urged-to-pull-plug-immediately-on-hinkley-c-over-spying-allegations","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-11T12:05:00Z","webTitle":"May urged to pull plug immediately on Hinkley C over spying allegations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/may-urged-to-pull-plug-immediately-on-hinkley-c-over-spying-allegations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/11/may-urged-to-pull-plug-immediately-on-hinkley-c-over-spying-allegations","fields":{"headline":"May urged to pull plug immediately on Hinkley C over spying allegations","bodyText":"Theresa May is being urged to pull the plug on the controversial Hinkley Point C project immediately, after new allegations of spying in the US by a consultant working for the Chinese co-investor in the planned nuclear plant. The new government is currently in the middle of a review of the £18.5bn Hinkley scheme following a final investment decision by the developers, EDF of France and its Beijing-based partner China General Nuclear Power (CGN). Paul Dorfman, a senior research fellow at University College London, said the British prime minister could legitimately blame poor French reactor technology if she wanted to save face with the Chinese. “No other OECD country would let China into its critical nuclear infrastructure, given its history of nuclear weapon proliferation. May has already taken the diplomatic ‘hit’ for this, so what’s she got to lose?” “If government wanted to, it could avoid taking China to task on this by reframing the problem in the context of the failed French EPR reactor, which is three times over-cost and over-time where it’s being built in Finland and France.” Angus MacNeil MP, the chair of the energy and climate change select committee, said the spying allegations raised grave concerns about corporate integrity and must form a key part of the government’s current review of Hinkley. “I am not sure the Chinese have anything to steal from Britain in the way of nuclear secrets. That is after all why they are being brought in, but it does raise questions about how honourable the company is and whether it could cut corners on construction methods and issues like that.” The name of China General Nuclear Power (CGN) has appeared as a defendant in US legal papers filed by the US authorities in a Tennessee district court. Szuhsiung Ho, a senior adviser to CGN, is scheduled to appear in from of the court next week accused of trying to recruit US atomic experts to steal technology secrets to help speed up China’s own nuclear power programme. CGN said it could not immediately comment on the scandal, but promised it would put out a written statement. Brunswick, the high-profile City PR firm that has been working with CGN on Hinkley, said it was not “acting on behalf of CGN in respect of this matter”. The department of business, energy and industrial strategy also declined to comment on the implications of the court case. Dorfman said there had already been endless concern and discussion between strategic defence experts in London about the wisdom of allowing China to invest in UK nuclear projects, and not just Hinkley. “China has and always will play economic hardball. For China, Hinkley was always a loss-leader for Bradwell. The deal was, if China invested in Hinkley, then it could build and run its own reactor at Bradwell, the nearest nuclear site to London. “Now the idea of China investing in Hinkley, then constructing and operating a reactor on British soil is really beginning to look like a Anglo-Sino bridge too far.” Greenpeace’s executive director, John Sauven, said there were very real concerns about handing over the keys to our future energy security to companies run by foreign governments. “There are a vast array of alternative power sources for the UK that Theresa May can choose from to keep the lights on, from solar, tidal and wind power through to interconnectors and storage. These are cutting edge technologies that will also attract investment into the UK, create jobs and don’t come with a huge health warning.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/mar/02/clean-coal-kemper-plant-mississippi-problems","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-02T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Bosses at world's most ambitious clean coal plant kept problems secret for years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/02/clean-coal-kemper-plant-mississippi-problems","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/mar/02/clean-coal-kemper-plant-mississippi-problems","fields":{"headline":"Bosses at world's most ambitious clean coal plant kept problems secret for years","bodyText":"Executives at the world’s most ambitious “clean coal” plant knew for years about serious design flaws and budget problems but sought to withhold key information from regulators before their plans collapsed, according to documents obtained by the Guardian. The Kemper plant in Mississippi – held up as the global model for a new generation of “clean coal” power plants – was the most expensive fossil fuel power plant in US history, with a $7.5bn price tag. Its owners, Southern Company, boasted it was “going to be the cleanest coal plant in the world”, in the words of the CEO, Tom Fanning. But thousands of internal documents reviewed by the Guardian and a series of interviews with Kemper staff uncovered evidence that the company had information showing that the project would blow through state-imposed budget limits five years before the company decided to reverse course and become an exclusively gas-fired energy plant. Kemper’s failure could be a serious setback for global climate policy and plans to reach the Paris climate targets. International climate agreements rely heavily on developing practical carbon capture technologies that have so far largely proved elusive. Kemper was slated to be the largest coal carbon capture plant ever built, touted as potentially the first of many similar projects worldwide. The documents show that Kemper’s design faced what proved to be an insurmountable issue: it required vastly more maintenance downtime than originally predicted, and according to one 2014 report would be offline 45% of its first five years rather than the 25% the company had publicly projected. Those figures doomed Kemper’s “clean coal” plans by raising its lifetime costs dramatically. The company had this information three years before it told regulators it was reversing course and planned to run the plant on natural gas. Southern nonetheless pushed forward, sinking nearly $3bn more into construction. Experts have long warned that the biggest challenge for clean coal power is affordability – adding so-called carbon capture technology, which captures carbon dioxide emissions produced from the use of fossil fuels, requires expensive equipment and saps energy that could otherwise be sold to power customers. For years, Kemper, built in America’s lowest-income state, was marketed as proof that American innovation could show the world that clean coal technology made economic sense. Inside Southern, however, Kemper’s prospects looked very different. Documents obtained by the Guardian show: In 2010, before a shovel was turned, a top executive expressed doubts to his inner circle that Kemper could be built within limits demanded by Mississippi regulators. The company knew in early 2012 that Kemper was headed far over budget limits. A top Kemper official sought to hide damaging projections from independent monitors, around the time that state officials had the opportunity to cancel the project. Fanning, Southern’s CEO, reassured investors that he could come in under budget despite overwhelming evidence that the company would never make it. In a 2013 earnings call, Fanning touted a huge coal storage dome as “in place” and a sign of “tremendous” construction progress. Company files show the dome had in fact started crumbling inside months earlier, ultimately opening up a hole in the ceiling the size of a small house – a problem so bad the dome had to be razed and rebuilt later that year. Multiple forecasts showed that Kemper’s clean coal equipment could only be up and running a fraction of the time the company initially predicted. Repairs listed as taking four hours would actually shut coal power generation down for four weeks, a 2016 report warned. Kemper, which received roughly $400m from taxpayers, managed to produce electricity from some of its clean coal equipment for “over 100 hours”, or roughly five days last June, before construction was shuttered for good amid further budget blowouts. Before it ran aground, Kemper drew support from Obama and Trump administration figures alike. Trump has been particularly outspoken about his support of “clean coal”, which he praised as “beautiful” in this year’s State of the Union address. Last August, the Department of Energy announced $50m in possible funding for projects to develop “transformational coal technologies”. Southern, the country’s second-largest electrical utility, received over $380m from the Department of Energy on the condition that the project could generate affordable electricity, on schedule. But it does not appear to be under any immediate pressure to repay the money. It maintains close ties to top Trump administration officials. Rick Perry, described by Bloomberg as an “old friend” of Fanning, now helms the energy department as it navigates calls to “claw back” federal funds spent on Kemper. The US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, counts Southern and its law firm Balch and Bingham as his top two career donors, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Sessions, the country’s top law enforcement officer, has previously rebuffed calls to recuse himself from other matters involving that law firm. Southern’s other mega-project, the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia, was offered $3.7bn in federal loan guarantees in September, despite being five years behind schedule and $10bn over budget, according to watchdog groups. Late last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mothballed an investigation into allegations the company concealed schedule delays, uncovered by a New York Times investigation in 2016, without sanctioning the company or clearing it of wrongdoing, leaving the door open to further investigation. The new materials offer evidence of a much broader range of potential misconduct than previously revealed. The SEC declined to comment. Southern faces a continuing class action alleging the company failed to disclose “adverse information” in 2012 and 2013 and other lawsuits brought by shareholders and power customers over Kemper. A Southern spokesman declined to comment on specific questions about Kemper, instead pointing to a settlement last month with state regulators and tax legislation, which he said would lower customers’ power bills. He also cited the “continued operation of Kemper’s efficient natural gas facility”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/jul/29/friends-may-hinkley-point-delays","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-29T18:45:12Z","webTitle":"Just as we need friends, May is busy ruffling feathers over Hinkley Point | Deborah Orr","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/friends-may-hinkley-point-delays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/friends-may-hinkley-point-delays","fields":{"headline":"Just as we need friends, May is busy ruffling feathers over Hinkley Point","bodyText":"There are a number of things that I really don’t want to hear discussed on the news, especially in a manner that resembles the couple of expository lines frantically shouted at the start of a disaster movie. Nuclear power is very much one of those things. Nevertheless, here we all are, speculating as to whether the Chinese might build weaknesses into the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant’s computer systems, just in case they might at some point decide to snatch control of the facility. Which hardly suggests an open, collaborative relationship of trust. If I were Chinese, I’d be quite upset, hopefully because I’d been disrespected and traduced – but possibly, I suppose, because I’d been rumbled. It all seems quite distant from the Brexiteers’ dreams of arms held out in fond embrace as Britain opens for business to a grateful globe. Still, China is one thing. France is quite another. Under the current circumstances it’s sensible to stay on the right side of countries that seem, broadly, to be trustworthy allies who share our democratic values. Therefore it seems particularly rude of our government to have announced that they were going to have another think about Hinkley Point just as the French energy company EDF voted to go ahead and build the thing, along with its Chinese partner. The champagne, we are told, was on ice. The party marquee, we are told, was being erected. The media interviews, we are told, were lined up. It’s as if the announcement was timed for maximum public humiliation. Quel dommage. It’s perfectly reasonable for Theresa May to take some time. After all, it is pretty weird that a couple of state-owned companies, EDF and China’s CGN, are being contracted to do work that successive UK governments have believed should be done “privately”. Indeed there have been various legal challenges to the whole setup. It is also pretty weird that it’s so expensive, when the whole idea of putting this sort of work out to independent contractors is supposedly so that the competitive strength of market forces can do its work. Even within EDF, people think the project is too expensive, so it’s not like anyone’s rubbing their hands with quick-profit glee – except the money lenders. The easiest way to make the project cheaper would be direct government investment, so at least there’s some hope for that. But what’s definitely unreasonable is to decline to offer a quiet heads-up to putative business partners in a highly sensitive venture and warn EDF that the new government want some further time to consider. Good manners cost nothing. Bad manners can cost a great deal. Just as the UK needs to look like a country that is straightforward and businesslike, it’s starting to look like a country that is petulant and unpredictable. France, and all of Europe, is already upset about Brexit, and with good reason. It’s all very well to fetishise the will of the people. But when a country has a two-party democratic system, and the will of the people defied both of those parties, that country’s ability to deliver stable representative democracy is called into question. The UK is eight years and three prime ministers on from the announcement that a new generation of nuclear power stations would be created here. Thus far, all that has been created is endless controversy. Even if their necessity was settled in principle – which unfortunately it isn’t – Britain’s ability to turn its nuclear ambitions into reality grows more etiolated by the day. Britain doesn’t have the skills to manage such a project itself, having been out of the nuclear power station game for such a long time. Now, having declared ourselves fairly hostile to immigration, we’re beginning to look like a country that doesn’t even have the skills to manage not having the skills to manage things. EDF’s shares shot up in value when it was announced that the deal was in jeopardy again. No wonder. As for the prime minister, she’s starting to look like someone who just doesn’t care what feathers she ruffles or which enemies she makes. She has already banished major figures in the last government to the back benches. George Osborne, an enthusiast for Hinkley Point, has even more May-delivered egg all over his face now. Obviously, I’ve enjoyed that spectacle as much as the next man. But May’s majority is just 12. If Labour wasn’t looking so fantastically unlike an opposition, let alone a government in waiting, she’d have to be more careful. The checks and balances of the system, which foster a degree of diplomacy and fastidiousness, are not working. And that’s on view for all the world to see. Since Thursday night, May has alienated the French, the Chinese, some of her own backbenchers and some of her own cabinet. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, was saying just two weeks ago that Hinkley must go ahead. He is not looking like a man who has the ear of his boss. Other countries must now be wondering if Britain would treat them like this too. And we’re also just that bit further away from solving the problem of our future energy needs. The Hinkley Point deal has always been controversial within EDF. Two directors have recently resigned, one of them in part because of Hinkley, the other entirely because of it . Of the 17 remaining directors, only 10 voted in favour – only to be greeted with fresh prevarication. If May does decide she wants the plant, she might yet have to find someone else to deliver it. It really is an extraordinary episode, even in a climate where extraordinary episodes have become the norm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"teacher-network/2018/jan/23/assessment-too-often-fails-to-prioritise-learning-lets-change-that","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-23T09:48:35Z","webTitle":"Assessment too often fails to prioritise learning – let's change that","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2018/jan/23/assessment-too-often-fails-to-prioritise-learning-lets-change-that","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/teacher-network/2018/jan/23/assessment-too-often-fails-to-prioritise-learning-lets-change-that","fields":{"headline":"Assessment too often fails to prioritise learning – let's change that","bodyText":"We urgently need to rethink how we assess students’ work. Based on my experience as a headteacher and now as a consultant visiting different schools, I believe there’s far too much emphasis on accountability at the expense of learning. Many of the approaches commonly used also do nothing to cut workload for teachers. Often the focus is on what tracked data tells us about student progress, but I know of no large-scale study that demonstrates the positive impact of data-tracking systems on learning. My hunch is that you could delete all this data and the students would never notice the difference in terms of the education they receive. The majority of teachers have excellent knowledge of their students, with or without the data. By putting so much emphasis on this data, we risk losing sight of where it came from in the first place – that is, what it actually tells us about how much students understand and where they’re struggling. But by changing certain elements of the assessment process, we can make it more meaningful, as well as taking some of the workload burden off teachers. Marking students’ work The first thing to look at is marking. As I and many others have documented – see, for example, Embedded Formative Assessment by Dylan Wiliam – too much marking is wasted. Throughout the country there are books with beautiful, extensive marking comments that students don’t have time to read, may not fully understand and never respond to. A lot of marking is retrospective, never acted on and merely serves to satisfy external demands – parental pressure, scrutiny from leadership teams and so on – without doing much for learning. Thankfully, some schools are creating solutions: ensuring all marking happens in dedicated improvement time in lessons; allowing teachers to give verbal feedback to the whole class and individuals as appropriate in the place of written feedback; and recognising that marking specific sections of work is more productive than putting a red pen over everything. More powerful still, to my mind, is to focus more on developing teachers’ skills in questioning and giving responsive feedback during lessons. This is far more important than most marking but isn’t given the same priority. Tracking progress Increasingly, massive digital statement banks are used to track progress through content-heavy GCSE courses, and often introduced as part of “life after levels” development at key stage 3. In some systems, teachers are meant to continually assess each of the 30 students in a class against 50 statements about what they can or can’t do. That’s 1,500 data points per class. But as Daisy Christodoulou demonstrates in her book Making Good Progress, generic “can do” statements are problematic. It’s hard to know what’s meant by statements such as “I can evaluate the environmental impact of a nuclear power station” because, in reality, two different students may have two very different levels of understanding of this concept. If this data was deleted, teachers would still have all the information they need from their in-class assessments, tests and marking to plan for their students’ learning needs. Making teachers turn this information into statements adds to workload without enhancing student learning. We need to keep data tracking in perspective, giving weight to teachers’ judgments, quizzes, tests and assessments at classroom level without asking them to log them centrally. We want assessment to provide enough detail to inform teaching and learning directly – this is what drives student outcomes. So let’s not fall for the illusion that accuracy is created simply because statements are logged and tracked on a flash new database that spits out colourful graphs. ‘What went well’ Finally, let’s look at reflection sheets and checklists – the “what went well” and “even better if” sheets that are attached to students’ books. These sheets don’t reflect students’ learning needs in any meaningful way. “I must stop making silly mistakes”; “I must do more revision”; “I need to learn my quotations more accurately”; “I need to write a better conclusion”. I’ve seen all of these statements, invariably written on coloured sheets stuck into books. All of this feels like it serves the needs of the scrutineers, not those being scrutinised. I can’t believe any student improves their learning by writing these things. Teachers should ditch reflection sheets and give instructions for actions that more directly reflect a specific situation – whether that’s to practise equations, attempt a deeper explanation or redraft work with better punctuation. Assessment needs to work for students and teachers. Let’s choose methods that make a real difference to learning – and cut teachers’ workload in the process.

Against this backdrop, Euratom and the UK’s future nuclear safeguarding regime risk being forgotten. As the nuclear safeguards bill - one of the “Brexit bills” announced in the Queen’s speech – makes its way through the parliamentary process, nuclear experts were called to present evidence to MPs. The message from experts is unequivocal – there is no upside to the UK leaving the Euratom treaty. Be it Prospect, the trade union representing civil nuclear experts, EDF Energy, or the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), the sector is united in its message to the government: leaving Euratom is complicated, and the potential consequences could be disastrous for our country. Rupert Cowen, a nuclear expert at Prospect Law, claims the UK is “sleepwalking” to disaster: “If we do not get this right, business stops ... no nuclear trade will be able to continue.” This is not scaremongering. Analysis of the facts shows just how much is at risk by leaving Euratom, and how complex this process is, given the government’s unnecessary, self-imposed deadline. This government must start listening. Euratom, among other things, provides safeguarding inspections for all civil nuclear sites in the UK. Inspectors are employed by Euratom and many are EU nationals. It takes five years to train a nuclear inspector and there is currently a limited pool of qualified inspectors from which to recruit. As Sue Ferns, deputy general secretary of Prospect, said in her evidence to the nuclear safeguards bill committee, “this is a highly skilled, very specialist area, which is why there is such a premium on this source of labour” and this is why we must question the wisdom of the government’s actions so far. The government plans for the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) to take over the role that Euratom currently carries out, but the ONR and the NIA have made clear that new arrangements will not be in place by the time we are due to leave Euratom in March 2019. Asked by MPs whether new arrangements could be put in place within the timeframe, Dame Sue Ion, chair of the Nuclear Innovation and Research Advisory Board, said: “I do not think it is possible.” Should the UK fail to have its safeguarding regime in place by March 2019, nuclear trade would halt, as well as cross-nation technology sharing that some of our nuclear power stations rely on to function. Again, this is not an exaggeration of the problem, or political point-scoring. Put simply, if we don’t have our safeguarding regime in place, our nuclear industry will face major, potentially dangerous, disruptions. Despite protests from government ministers, leaving Euratom at the same time as leaving the European Union is not necessary. Euratom is a separate treaty to our EU membership and it is time the government treated it as such, rather than claiming the two are inextricably intertwined. Our civil nuclear industry and Euratom, like so much of the Brexit negotiations, is incredibly complex and it is absolutely vital that we get these negotiations right. Remaining part of Euratom for a transition period may act as a safety net, giving the industry the time it needs to prepare to leave Euratom, but the EU will demand that European courts oversee the arrangements, which of course crosses one of Theresa May’s negotiating red lines. Releasing the impact assessment that the government has carried out on our nuclear industry would be a step in the right direction, rather than rushing through policy with little scrutiny and condemning Brexit opponents as unpatriotic mutineers. It is time for this government to release itself from unnecessary self-imposed straightjackets, stop focussing on narrow party disputes and start listening and put the interests and the safety of the nation first."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2018/jan/18/carillion-taskforce-to-discuss-how-to-prevent-domino-effect-on-uk-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-18T16:09:46Z","webTitle":"Banks extend £225m lifeline to Carillion subcontractors as firms offer jobs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/18/carillion-taskforce-to-discuss-how-to-prevent-domino-effect-on-uk-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jan/18/carillion-taskforce-to-discuss-how-to-prevent-domino-effect-on-uk-economy","fields":{"headline":"Banks extend £225m lifeline to Carillion subcontractors as firms offer jobs","bodyText":"High street banks have made more than £225m available to help businesses put at risk by the failure of Carillion, while companies have offered to take on staff who were working for the firm when it collapsed into receivership. A taskforce of banks, businesses and construction industry trade bodies met with the business secretary on Thursday to discuss ways to contain the impact of Carillion’s collapse on jobs and the wider economy. Greg Clark convened the meeting amid pressure from trade unions to ensure that the business world helps limit job losses among former Carillion staff and employees in its supply chain. As the meeting broke up, banks announced more than £225m worth of emergency support to help small business customers ride out the crisis, including waivers on overdraft fees and loan repayment holidays. Clark, who urged banks to provide support at a separate meeting held on Wednesday, said: “I welcome this quick and positive move by banks including Lloyds, HSBC and RBS. This follows my meeting with the banks yesterday where I challenged them to see what further support they could provide for SMEs affected by Carillion’s insolvency. “It is essential that small businesses exposed are given the support they need by their lenders, and I look forward to other banks following suit.” The lifeline comes after several of Carillion’s subcontractors began laying off staff, sparking fears for the survival of some of its estimated 30,000 suppliers, owed hundreds of millions of pounds between them. Lloyds Banking Group, which was bailed out with £20bn of taxpayers’ money during the financial crisis, moved first to set up a £50m emergency fund to help affected businesses. Royal Bank of Scotland, which required a £45.5bn bailout during the crash, offered £75m, while HSBC outgunned both with a £100m fund. Santander UK also offered support but did not place a value on it, while a Barclays spokesperson said the bank would “look at” increasing overdrafts, reducing loan repayments and helping firms with cashflow problems. Former clients of Carillion have also moved to take on some of its staff who were employed on contracts to provide services such as cleaning, catering and maintenance. British Gas owner Centrica, and Nationwide building society vowed to ensure former Carillion employees would continue to be paid or in some cases employed directly. Meanwhile, banks and businesses took part in a meeting at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to discuss ways to contain the fallout from Carillion. A BEIS spokesperson said: “We have created a taskforce to continue to support and monitor the impact on small businesses and employees who have been affected by Carillion’s insolvency. “The taskforce will comprise representatives from business, construction trade associations, the trade unions, lenders and government.” The Trades Union Congress, which has pushed for a crisis coalition of businesses and trade unions to deal with the Carillion fallout, said its general secretary, Frances O’Grady, would present demands designed to protect workers. These will include: measures to transfer Carillion staff to new employers and protect their pay; bringing public sector contracts back under government control; a risk assessment of other large outsourcing firms and a moratorium on awarding further public service contracts to rival companies. O’Grady said: “We are pleased the government has agreed to union calls for a national taskforce to deal with the collapse of Carillion. “Time is of the essence in dealing with this crisis. We need urgent action to protect jobs, pay and pensions. This cannot be a talking shop.” As the government stepped up efforts to limit the impact of Carillion’s collapse, several of the firm’s former clients said they would ensure staff continue to be paid. Nationwide said it would directly employ 250 people who had been working for the company on a contract held by Carillion. A further 1,500 staff who were working for third-party subcontractors will now be contracted to Nationwide. “Our contractors perform a vital and valued role for the society. During an unsettling time for Carillion employees we felt it was important to provide them with some reassurances,” said a spokesperson. Centrica said it would make funds available to the government’s Insolvency Service to ensure that 480 staff who helped manage facilities at its buildings would continue to be paid. National Grid, which used Carillion staff on its infrastructure programme, said work would continue on an overhead line between Richborough and Canterbury, which is designed to connect a Belgium-UK power cable to the grid, and a power cable at Wylfa in Wales for the planned new nuclear power station there. A spokesperson said: “National Grid has contingency plans in place for all its projects with Carillion, using alternative suppliers if necessary. We believe that these plans mean we will be able to keep any disruption to a minimum.” The company did not say whether it would take on any Carillion staff or whether it had provided funding to ensure they continue to be paid. • Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/nov/22/no-subsidies-for-green-power-projects-before-2025-says-uk-treasury","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-23T14:08:40Z","webTitle":"No subsidies for green power projects before 2025, says UK Treasury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/22/no-subsidies-for-green-power-projects-before-2025-says-uk-treasury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/nov/22/no-subsidies-for-green-power-projects-before-2025-says-uk-treasury","fields":{"headline":"No subsidies for green power projects before 2025, says UK Treasury","bodyText":"Companies hoping to build new windfarms, solar plants and tidal lagoons, have been dealt a blow after the government said there would be no new subsidies for clean power projects until 2025 at the earliest. The Treasury said it had taken the decision to “protect” consumers, because households and businesses were facing an annual cost of about £9bn on their energy bills to pay for wind, solar and nuclear subsidies to which it had already committed. The revelation that there will be no more money for projects before 2025 could dash hopes for pioneering projects such as the proposed £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea, which has a mooted launch date of 2022. In a Treasury document on carbon levies published on Wednesday, officials said: “On the basis of the current forecast, there will be no new low-carbon electricity levies until 2025.” Environmental groups criticised the Treasury move. The WWF said it was a huge disappointment, while Greenpeace claimed Wednesday’s budget was one of the least green ever. Business groups also reacted with dismay. The pro-environment Aldersgate Group, whose members include BT, Ikea and Marks &amp; Spencer, said the lack of clarity on low-carbon power investments was disappointing. James Court, head of policy at the Renewable Energy Association, said: “The UK government seem to be turning their back on renewables by announcing no new support for projects post-2020 and a freeze on carbon taxes.” It is understood the policy will only affect projects generating electricity before 2025, so would not stop firms signing contracts for power stations coming online after 2025. That means the backers of new nuclear power stations are unlikely to be affected by the decision, because none was expected to be built by then. But it could be a blow for the companies wanting to build solar farms, onshore windfarms and other clean power plants at an earlier date. Some industry figures took comfort from Treasury language suggesting that some contracts might be allowed for renewables if the price were so low as to be effectively subsidy-free. The government confirmed that it would honour an existing pledge to auction £557m of renewable energy subsidies, beginning next year. But most of that pot is expected to be taken by giant offshore windfarms, likely crowding out other technologies such as tidal. John Sauven, chief executive of Greenpeace, said: “Despite the chancellor’s pride in the UK’s climate leadership, hidden away in the unannounced text of the budget, he quietly revealed this was one of the least green budgets ever because there will be no new money for renewables until at least 2025.” Gareth Redmond-King, head of energy and climate at WWF, said: “It is a huge disappointment that there will be no new investment in UK renewables.” The government also announced that until 2025 it was freezing a carbon tax on dirty energy generators. Big energy firms, including SSE, have been calling for the tax, the carbon price floor, to be strengthened to encourage new investment in greener energy. Recent research by energy analysts suggested that without an increase in the tax, coal power plant owners would enjoy a last hurrah in the early 2020s before they hit a government deadline for the closure of all coal-fired stations by 2025. One expert said the decision to freeze rather than increase the tax meant the UK’s climate change target for 2030 was being put at risk. “It is disappointing that the Treasury is continuing its indefinite freeze of the carbon price support rate, a move that could endanger the achievement of the UK’s emissions target for 2030,” said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. He added that the current price of around £24.50 a tonne of CO2 was likely to be too weak to drive the energy market to shift from gas power stations to renewables and nuclear."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2017/dec/31/lack-of-charging-bays-is-the-main-obstacle-to-self-driving-car-rise-says-axa","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-12-31T15:16:19Z","webTitle":"UK lacks infrastructure for self-driving electric cars, says Axa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/31/lack-of-charging-bays-is-the-main-obstacle-to-self-driving-car-rise-says-axa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/dec/31/lack-of-charging-bays-is-the-main-obstacle-to-self-driving-car-rise-says-axa","fields":{"headline":"UK lacks infrastructure for self-driving electric cars, says Axa","bodyText":"A shortage of charging points and strain on energy supplies are now the main stumbling blocks to the rise of driverless electric cars, according to the UK boss of insurer Axa. Amanda Blanc said a lack of rapid charging bays and pressure on the National Grid have overtaken questions about accident liability as the biggest barriers to autonomous vehicles entering the transport mainstream. Blanc, a Tesla driver, said personal experience pointed to problems lying ahead for driverless electric vehicles. There are about 125,000 plug-in electric cars in the UK and 14,000 chargers – 2,620 of them being rapid chargers that can give a car an 80% charge in 30 minutes. Shell has recently opened its first charging points for electric vehicles at 10 filling stations, mostly in London and the south-east. Blanc said a recent long-distance family trip showed the potential limitations of a future dominated by autonomous transport. When Blanc recently drove to Edinburgh in the Tesla with her family, they stopped twice to use a supercharger but went for coffee while the car charged. “In three to four years’ time when more people are buying electric, you do not want to have to queue for your supercharger,” she said. “The infrastructure has to be fixed.” The other issue for Blanc is the strain on Britain’s electricity supply. According to the National Grid, growth in electric vehicles on Britain’s roads could see peak electricity demand jump by more than the capacity of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station by 2030. She explained: “If suddenly everyone’s got one [an electric car] I’m not sure how the National Grid is going to cope with that. If in the Coronation Street break everyone goes to put the kettle on and that causes problems, just imagine what will happen if everybody comes home from work at 6 o’clock and switches their cars on to charge – we have to be smarter about renewables and regenerating electricity. That’s a real challenge.” Blanc, whose Axa unit has 10 million customers, is one of the strongest backers of self-driving and electric cars in the insurance industry. She believes that children born today will not need to learn to drive and as grown-ups will be cruising around Britain’s cities in electric “robo-cars”. Advocates say they will reduce pollution, be cheaper to run and provide mobility to those unable to drive, including the elderly. Until recently, the question of who is liable in an accident involving a self-driving car was seen as a major hurdle in the development of autonomous vehicles – but Blanc said a government draft bill had brought clarity. If it becomes law, insurers will automatically pay out if motorists crash a car in self-driving mode. The question of whether man or machine are to blame will then be debated by the insurance company and the carmaker. If the motorist is found to have been negligent by failing to download safety-critical software updates, for instance, the insurance payout can be reduced. With 85-90% of road accidents caused by human error, the adoption of self-driving cars is expected to slash the number of small claims made by motorists – and insurance premiums will come down as a result. The industry would be left with more severe claims: when an accident does happen, the cost is likely to be higher because car parts are now bristling with technology and are more expensive to replace. Some of the world’s biggest carmakers and technology companies including Volvo, Ford, Nissan and Google are vying to develop the first fully automated vehicles. Tesla Autopilot software already allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel in certain circumstances. Blanc said about her Tesla: “Two weekends ago we were driving too close to the kerb and it corrected on my husband’s behalf. It’s starting to think for you.” The chancellor recently reaffirmed a budget pledge to ensure “genuine driverless vehicles” on Britain’s roads by 2021. Phillip Hammond admitted that it would be a “very challenging” achievement: a million drivers of commercial vehicles would have to retrain. But others point to progress being made. Waymo, a company that started as part of Google, launched tests of fully driverless taxis on the streets of Phoenix, Arizona, last month. Jaguar Land Rover is testing self-driving vehicles on public roads in Coventry, albeit with a driver in the front seat. Axa is involved in several self-driving car trials funded by the government, including Venturer in Bristol and UK Autodrive in Milton Keynes.

One question went as follows: “Some people say that the 1975 Public Affairs Act should be repealed. Do you agree or disagree with this idea?” It turned out that 16% did agree, and 18% didn’t. This was surprising. There should have been no controversy about the 1975 Public Affairs Act because it did not exist. The study, Pseudo-Opinions on Public Affairs, became a classic of political science. It has been rerun in different versions several times: in 1983, 1984, 1995 and 2013, always with similar results. Around a third of people will pretend to have an opinion, unless you make it easy to say “don’t know”. If you say that “President Obama” or “the Republicans” want to repeal the Public Affairs Act, even more opinions appear, along partisan lines. The study tells us something that no politician will ever say within earshot of the people who elect them: we often don’t know what we’re talking about, but we don’t like to admit it. This doesn’t mean people are stupid. Quite the reverse. Stupid would be spending your time studying the minutiae of government legislation rather than working, caring for others, or enjoying life. After all, your opinion is just one of 47 million in the UK electorate, no matter how well informed you are. James Fishkin, a professor of political science at Stanford University and a leading advocate of “citizens’ assemblies”, a way of finding out what “the people” really want, when they take some time to think it over, calls this “rational ignorance”. Most of us simply don’t need to know how to run the country. In November last year, Gordon Brown suggested that an assembly might resolve the Brexit crisis. Last month, Damon Albarn, Rowan Williams and a number of other public figures wrote an open letter to the Guardian in support, and the idea now has this newspaper’s backing. Fishkin calls it “embarrassingly simple”. You just put the country in a room and let them talk. In 2016, for instance, when Ireland decided to reconsider its abortion laws, everyone braced for a fight. A bitter referendum 33 years earlier had given mothers and their unborn children equal rights to life under the eighth amendment of the constitution. It made legal abortions almost impossible in Ireland and created a national controversy that would not go away. To tackle the question, and four others, parliament established a citizens’ assembly of 99 randomly selected Irish citizens, who would reflect the national balance of age, gender, class and region. They would be chaired by a supreme court judge (now retired), Mary Laffoy. No politicians would be involved. The first thing Neasa Keogh heard about it was a knock at the door of her house in Limerick. She had opinions on abortion, but had never been involved in politics in any way, besides voting. “I was politically motivated when politicians came to my door,” she says. “I had often thought: ‘We ought to do this, and we ought to do that.’ But I never did anything about it.” Now 58, Keogh had just retired from her job as a primary school teacher and could spare the time, and her travel to Dublin would be paid. Citizens’ assemblies have to be transparent, however, and this would broadcast live online, which meant Keogh’s name would be made public. She remembered “the hatred and the viciousness” surrounding the eighth amendment in 1983. “I was a little bit nervous about being targeted by rightwing elements,” she says. But it was a chance to help her country, so she accepted. The assembly would meet at the Grand hotel, Malahide, north-east of Dublin, for a weekend every month, and it would be 18 months before all five topics were completed. In addition to the 99 citizens, there would be 100 substitutes in case some dropped out, which several did. Essentially, Keogh was to be one member of a gigantic jury, weighing a country’s values rather than a person’s innocence or guilt. On the morning of the launch event at Dublin Castle, another assembly member, Oisín Herraghty, set off early on the drive from County Mayo. Now 47, Herraghty is a technical manager at an arts centre. Like Keogh, he had been approached on his doorstep. He agreed to take part right away, then more or less forgot about it. “I had the radio on in the car,” he recalls, “and the first item on the 8am news was the inaugural meeting of the citizens’ assembly. I thought: ‘Oh. That’s me. The first item on the news, this must be bigger than I thought.’” At this point, he hadn’t even told his family. The scale of the responsibility, and the honour, hit Keogh at the event itself. After short speeches from Laffoy and Enda Kenny, who was then the Taoiseach, they heard from three lawyers and academics about the history of social change in Ireland. “Sometimes you go to things and you think it’s all a bit of a show, but it was all so genuine and heartfelt,” says Keogh. Sessions began in earnest the following month. Although 199 people may be a microcosm of Ireland’s 4.8 million citizens, it is still far too many for a productive conversation, so they were split into groups. Keogh found herself part of a table of six, with a balance of men and women and one person from each age band. Each table also had a facilitator and a note-taker. The facilitator policed the conversation, according to a page of guidelines. During expert presentations, if a citizen felt nervous about asking a question, the facilitator would ask it on their behalf. They heard from medical experts, priests and advocates from both sides. More than 13,000 submissions were received from members of the public, and the assembly members themselves requested to hear some other points of view. At the end of each meeting, they had to write a short report, to satisfy the chair that they had understood what they had heard. Before each session, they were given background information to read. They were not shown abortion images, but were otherwise spared no details. It was hard work. It was hard in many ways. Keogh had voted against the ban on abortion in 1983, and considers herself fairly liberal, but she remembers being asked: Do you think the unborn does not have an equal right to life? “That was like a belt to the solar plexus,” she says. “I’m a mother of three children … I found that very, very difficult.” The final meeting to consider abortion began on Saturday 22 April 2017. Most of the weekend was spent voting in private booths, and the results astonished Ireland. The assembly decided overwhelmingly to change the eighth amendment, and 64% recommended that parliament allow abortion without any restriction, up to either 12 or 22 weeks. Although it had been written off by some as a way to smother the controversy, the assembly ended up being far more radical than anyone expected, and more than many thought Ireland was ready for. A referendum was duly held to find out. Herraghty followed the campaign. “I heard people on both sides pushing their views,” he says, “and I’d find myself going: ‘Hang on a second. That’s not true. Check your facts. That’s not actually true.’” On 25 May 2018, the country approved the changes by 66% to 34%, just a touch above the margin at the Grand hotel. This might confirm some people’s suspicions about citizens’ assemblies. Isn’t it just what you would expect to happen when you lock people in a hotel with a bunch of, no-doubt, liberal experts? Well, it might be, but experts aren’t the only people an assembly has to hear from. In Ireland, the citizens themselves demanded more firsthand experience from those affected by the abortion ban. Accordingly, they heard a selection of audio recordings from six women, some of whom had travelled for abortions, some of whom had decided against it. In Limerick, some people told Keogh about their abortions, which they had kept secret for years. Assemblies can take the voice of ordinary people into the heart of politics. At the same time, they can solve the “echo chamber” problem by making people talk to others who don’t share their opinions. “That was drilled into us,” Keogh says. “That people had their views. Everyone had to be listened to. I found myself at tables where I had nothing in common with people, but we were still able to come to some consensus, or decide: ‘We can’t agree on that.’ I met wonderful people. I met people like I’d never met in my life.” Citizens’ assemblies are not unusual worldwide, nor new. An early televised experiment took place in Manchester in 1994, discussing crime. In 1996, under governor George W Bush, the state of Texas organised what it called a “deliberative poll”, which actively chose to pay a premium to generate power by wind instead of fossil fuels. (Texas still leads the US in wind power.) In 2006, a citizens’ assembly recommended electoral reform in the Netherlands. In 2011, the Japanese government commissioned a deliberative poll on nuclear power and the future of the pension system. In Gdansk, Poland, a citizens’ assembly met in 2016 to consider flood prevention, and they have tackled other subjects, such as migration, since. (Sadly, the pioneering mayor behind it, Pawel Adamowicz, was murdered at the weekend.) Nonetheless, the process remains obscure, even in Canada, where local and national assemblies are common, and where they are sometimes called “reference panels”. “One day a letter showed up at my house,” says Syd Burdett, 27, from British Columbia, “and it was like: ‘Hey, we want people for this reference panel about pharmacare. We’ll pay for you to come out to Ottawa for a week.’” The national government wanted a sample of 35 people from across Canada to tell it how to pay for medicines. Burdett had been about to quit his job in a convenience store anyway. On a whim, he accepted. As things stand, people have free medical care for everything except prescriptions outside hospitals. As a result, some do without the medicines they need. A pharmacare system would fix that, and save lives, but at a cost. Burdett says he had a vague idea of what a reference panel was, but had heard nothing about this one. When he arrived at the hotel in Ottawa, after a five-hour flight, he enjoyed it very much. “It reminded me a lot of being at university,” he says. “It was an academic experience, in a way.” Over the week, Burdett’s group heard from academic, medical and commercial experts. One woman brought her new baby, who behaved very well. Discussions were quite technical at times, but nothing was impenetrable. “I think by the end of the week people had a pretty good understanding,” Burdett says. At last, they did recommend pharmacare, paid for by higher taxes. You can see why assemblies are winning the love of politicians. When something necessary but unpopular must be done, such as raising taxes, they move the responsibility on to the people who stand to suffer, who have no reason to lie, no votes to win, no need to pretend that they hold all the answers. At the same time, assemblies bring more authority than some decorative consultation, and more clarity than a referendum. Indeed, in England, they are already on the way. Rebecca Weight is 31 and works at a museum in London. She subscribes to online surveys so she wasn’t surprised when an email arrived last year, asking if she would be willing to spend two weekends in a hotel in Birmingham, discussing the future of adult social care. She would be paid £300, plus expenses. “I’ve done focus group-type things,” she says. “It seemed it might be similar to that, but maybe something with a little bit more meaning.” It turned out to be the country’s first true citizens’ assembly, commissioned by the House of Commons. On 27 April 2018, Weight set off to join the other 46 citizens. “It was a real cross-section of people,” she says. “I was quite surprised by how diverse the group was.” They had dinner, got to know each other, and the next day the problem of adult social care in England was set out before them. It turned out to be quite simple. “There wasn’t enough money to pay for it,” says Weight. Like every participant I spoke to, Weight found it challenging and enjoyable. She would have liked to hear more firsthand experience of the care system, but, overall, she felt they got enough from the many experts to form a reliable opinion, if not to become expert themselves. In the end, the assembly recommended paying for universal adult social care with higher taxes. It remains to be seen what the authorities will do with the wisdom of Burdett and Weigh, and their fellow citizens. In Canada, the federal government responded with the Hoskins Commission, which will report this summer with a pharmacare plan. In England, the Commons committees behind the assembly have adopted most of its suggestions. A government green paper will follow this year. Would an assembly help to resolve Brexit? A trial run took place in October 2017, at a hotel in Manchester. Organised by the charity Involve, the assembly brought together 25 leave voters, 22 remain voters and three people who did not vote. After two weekends, they chose to leave with a trade deal and preferential access for EU citizens, but not free movement. If they couldn’t get such a deal, they wanted to remain in the single market, with free movement under tight controls. Recommending what he called “a new kind of royal commission”, Gordon Brown spoke in November of “a dialogue about the difficult issues from migration to sovereignty and our long-term economic future, empowering all voices to be heard”. This sounds marvellous, but if an assembly is to work, particularly on something as divisive as Brexit, we must foresee and understand the scepticism that will greet it. Matthew Taylor is the chief executive of the RSA, and has promoted deliberation in politics since the 90s. He often meets doubts about whether citizens’ assemblies are fair, which is reasonable, given how little known they are. In particular, people doubt whether they are really representative, whether ordinary voters can grasp complex issues, and whether the process can be run impartially. “That’s why you have to take the plunge and do it,” Taylor says. “It’s only when you’ve done it and people see, that they go: ‘Oh, right. I can see that these people genuinely do represent the country.’” This is why Taylor believes it would be so important for a Brexit assembly to be open and televised. It would look like a stitch-up at first, in some eyes, but experience elsewhere shows it would earn its own legitimacy over time. The outcome need not be binding, but if a government chose to act against it, it would have to explain why. This way, politics could at last move forwards. Herraghty still doesn’t talk much about his time at the assembly, but it came up by chance at work the other day. For the first time, he told his colleagues: “I was a member of that.” They looked at him, amazed. “It was fantastic,” he said. “One of the best experiences in my life.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/news-blog/live/2017/sep/13/trump-hides-gift-for-rich-in-tax-pitch","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-13T21:45:18Z","webTitle":"Trump hides gift for rich in tax pitch | The minute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/news-blog/live/2017/sep/13/trump-hides-gift-for-rich-in-tax-pitch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/news-blog/live/2017/sep/13/trump-hides-gift-for-rich-in-tax-pitch","fields":{"headline":"Trump hides gift for rich in tax pitch","bodyText":"Pitching a tax reform proposal, Donald Trump promised, “The rich will not be gaining at all from this plan.

Now’s the time to shout about it","bodyText":"Ever been on a protest march for the environment? If you’re young and you care about things – if you’re old, for that matter – you may well have been, and I bet I can guess the theme of the demo. It was probably about climate change, and quite right too, global warming being an unparalleled threat to our very existence. It might have been about nuclear power and its expansion; it might perhaps have been aimed at major pollution, or the loss of some local well-loved amenity. But I’ll bet you a pound to a pinch of snuff that it wasn’t about farmland birds, or the disappearance of insects. No one, young or old, marches in the street to protest about the impoverishment of our countryside; no one hoists banners crying out against the turning of our green fields into sterile wildlife wastelands. Yet in the past 50 years in Britain, through the intensification of agriculture, we have destroyed well over half of our biodiversity, and the populations of birds, butterflies and wild flowers that once gave the landscape such animation and thrilling life have been utterly devastated – the figures are there. Most notable is the case of farmland birds, which by the government’s own admission declined by 56% between 1970 and 2015; it is estimated this represents a loss of at least 44 million individuals. Over huge swaths of the land, once beloved species such as the lapwing, the spotted flycatcher, the cuckoo and the turtle dove, as well as many once common butterflies such as the pearl-bordered fritillary and once familiar blooms such as cornflowers, have simply vanished. The fields may still look green in spring, but it is mostly lifeless scenery, apart from the pesticide-saturated crops: it is green concrete. This is a quite remarkable historical event; it has altered the character of Britain just as profoundly as the other changes of the past half-century, such as the end of social deference, the rise of multiculturalism and the coming of sexual equality. Yet its most remarkable aspect is this: people still do not perceive it. In the past decade, specialists in conservation have come to understand the magnitude of the loss, but for the public at large, and indeed for most politicians, it is simply not on the radar; we are faced with a sort of mass cognitive dissonance, a nationwide unawareness of what is obvious. Most Britons remain blithely unaware that since the Beatles broke up, we have wiped out half our wildlife. Yet we are not alone. Last week, the French woke up in a dramatic way to the fact that their own farmland birds, their skylarks and partridges and meadow pipits, were rapidly disappearing: Le Monde, the most sober of national journals, splashed the fact across the top of its front page. French bird populations in general, two reports indicated, had fallen by a third just in the past 15 years, and the next day scientists said that this was symptomatic of a future facing Europe as a whole, of “biodiversity oblivion”. Intensive farming is the problem. Three generations of making agriculture more industrial have given Europe cheap food on a mammoth scale, but a terrible environmental price has eventually been paid, which we are only now understanding. The heart of the matter is universal pesticide use: we benefit from farming wholly based on poison, which has exterminated more and more of the insects at the base of myriad food chains in the natural world. In the recent past, few have cared about insect decline, because people in general don’t care about insects, but the numbers are becoming too big to ignore. The startling disclosure last October that since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the number of flying insects on nature reserves in Germany had dropped by at least 76% – more than three-quarters – went round the world. Can anything be done to get us off the road to biodiversity oblivion? The perhaps surprising answer is that yes, it can. We can reorder the basis of our farming, and here we stand at a major crossroads, because that is what the present Conservative government has just promised to do. On 11 January it launched a 25-year environment plan, and followed it up on 27 February with a consultation on the future for food, farming and the environment. Both these documents offer to put British agriculture on a wholly new basis (partly made possible by the anticipation of Brexit): the state will continue to pay farmers, but not according to the amount of food they produce, as the EU’s common agricultural policy first ordained, or according to the amount of land they own – the situation at the moment. They will be paid according to the amount of environmentally friendly measures they can put in place on their land. The new philosophy is “public money for public goods”, and the environment is explicitly recognised as the principal public good. Senior conservationists I have spoken to are enthusiastic about these proposals. If you’re on the left, you might allege that this is mere greenwashing, a renewed attempt to detoxify the Tory brand, and of course, there will be votes in this – those vital young votes especially. But you only have to read the documents to see that this is in no way a political stunt, a crude photo-op like David Cameron with his huskies in the Arctic. These are proposals that have been deeply thought through. As they stand, they’re great. The principal problem will be holding the government to them. For instance, the £3.1bn in EU subsidies that British farmers currently receive, if converted into payments for agri-environment measures, would go a very long way to reversing the destruction of our wildlife; but that sum is only guaranteed until 2022. What happens after that? What’s to stop the Treasury clawing a huge chunk of it back? What is needed is political pressure on the government to stand by these promises. It has to come ultimately from the base, since ordinary people’s feelings are the beginnings of political will. So what must happen first is that long overdue recognition, by the public as a whole, of just how terribly our countryside has been devastated. We all know and love William Blake’s reference to the green and pleasant land; the time has come to acknowledge that it may still be green, but much of it, alas, is now a lifeless landscape, pleasant no longer. • Michael McCarthy is a journalist and naturalist, and author of The Moth Snowstorm: Nature and Joy"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jan/29/may-to-take-business-leaders-on-china-visit-in-search-of-deals","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-30T08:06:20Z","webTitle":"May hoping to kickstart faltering China relations with trade visit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/29/may-to-take-business-leaders-on-china-visit-in-search-of-deals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jan/29/may-to-take-business-leaders-on-china-visit-in-search-of-deals","fields":{"headline":"May hoping to kickstart faltering China relations with trade visit","bodyText":"Theresa May will attempt to reset her relationship with China in a vital three-day trip this week, leading the largest-ever UK trade delegation, comprising 50 business leaders. Beijing’s ambassador to London has claimed Brexit is a “strategic opportunity” to boost ties, saying “golden fruits” will be up for grabs when May touches down in China on Wednesday. Downing Street said the visit will “intensify the ‘golden era’ in UK-China relations”, a phrase often used by David Cameron and George Osborne dating from President Xi’s state visit to the UK in 2015. However, while Chinese officials talk up the visit as a chance to write a new chapter of “win-win” relations, most observers agree Britain’s decision to leave the European Union has severely eroded both its negotiating position and its value to Beijing, which once considered London a key EU ally. “Clearly they did lose interest in the UK,” said one well-placed monitor of Chinese politics who, like many, believes China’s focus has now shifted to France. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, beat May to Beijing when he passed through earlier this month, bestowing a horse on Chinese leader Xi Jinping as a symbol of their warming friendship. Beijing is likely to be keenly aware of its sway over the weak leader of a feuding party governing a divided nation – and will therefore seek the maximum number of concessions in exchange for its support. It is also pushing for a resounding endorsement of the Belt and Road initiative, a $900bn global infrastructure spree that is Xi’s pet foreign policy programme. May’s reluctance to offer her formal blessing to a project some suspect is a ploy to extend Beijing’s global political and economic reach has complicated pre-visit talks. Chinese officials have reportedly even refused to answer calls from their British counterparts. No. 10 sounded a cautious note on the scheme. “This is one of the things the prime minister will be talking about when we are in China, I wouldn’t want to pre-empt those discussions,” the spokesman said. Experts said the prime minister’s efforts will be complicated further by her personal standing in Beijing. While Xi was recently confirmed as China’s most dominant ruler in decades, May is seen as a hamstrung leader whose days in office may be numbered and who is less pro-Beijing than her predecessor, David Cameron. May riled China’s leaders by delaying approval for the Beijing-backed Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant and then baffled them with last year’s botched election. Steve Tsang, the head of the School of Oriental and African Studies’ China Institute, said: “This is a prime minister who will be seen in Beijing as a paper tiger who pretends to take tough positions but, in fact, is as weak as it gets.” Tsang said China’s ambassador was right to describe Brexit as an opportunity – “a huge opportunity for Beijing”. Kerry Brown, the director of the Lau China Institute at King’s College London, said: “I think they will see her as a biddable leader who is quite weak and who will need something – and they will be very aware of their power over such a visitor. She has got to obviously avoid this idea that she is going there with a begging bowl, even though, in fact, that is kind of what she is doing.” British officials pointed to figures showing trade between the UK and China is at record levels and UK exports to China have grown by over 60% since 2010, underscoring the mutual benefits of a liberal future trade partnership. In talks with Xi, May is expected to raise North Korea’s belligerence, stressing the need for co-operation in support of the rules-based international system. More difficult for the prime minister will be the growing concern over the political situation in Hong Kong. On Monday, Hong Kong’s last governor, Lord Patten, called on May to challenge Beijing over its erosion of the former British colony’s rights and freedoms, highlighted this week when Agnes Chow, one of the most recognisable faces of its moderate “umbrella” protest movement was barred from running for political office as a result of her political views. Downing Street would not confirm whether the topic was on May’s official agenda. “The UK has always been clear and continues to be clear that it’s vital Hong Kong’s rights and freedoms are respected and we are firm believers in one country, two systems – we welcome the Chinese commitment to it,” the prime minister’s spokesman said. May said the delegation of British businesses represented all corners of the UK economy. “There are huge trade opportunities in China that we want to help British businesses take advantage of,” she said. The business delegation includes financial services, technology, automotive, food and drink, energy and infrastructure developers, including BP, Jaguar Land Rover and Whittards, the tea manufacturer. May and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, will land in Wuhan on Wednesday, a historical city, which has the most students of any city in the world. In Beijing later on Wednesday, she will meet Chinese premier Li Keqiang and then Xi on Thursday, before travelling to Shanghai to meet British and Chinese business leaders on Friday. For the first time on a solo trip, May will be accompanied by her husband, Philip, a supportive presence for the prime minister while the debate rages over her future at home on her backbenches.

The meeting is still a state secret, unmentioned in official media, unknown to the majority of Kim’s citizens – and far too dangerous for those who have heard whispers to discuss them in public. Days after the CIA chief, Mike Pompeo, met Kim in Pyongyang, official minders shepherding foreign journalists on a highly choreographed trip around the city refused several times to translate questions about Trump’s visit, saying only that “political questions” were not allowed or “not proper”. North Koreans are inundated with propaganda about American aggression from childhood. At one model kindergarten on the outskirts of Pyongyang, visited by journalists last week, a poster warning against imperialists sat alongside murals of birds and butterflies. Plastic guns and tanks sat in classrooms beside model teapots and cooking sets. The people are also surrounded by murals and statues sanctifying the ruling dynasty: Kim, his father Kim Jong-il, and his grandfather and “eternal president” Kim Il-sung. Kim Il-sung’s birthday, 15 April, is a national holiday known as the Day of the Sun, when thousands of Koreans in formal dress flock to murals, statues and his official birthplace to leave flowers and bow in carefully choreographed tribute. Apartments the three leaders have visited, trains they have travelled on – even a coffee shop chair once sat on by the youngest Kim – are marked with plaques or other signs. Formal portraits of the two elder Kims’ photos have a place of honour in every home. Their quotes adorn government buildings, workplaces, schools and universities. This system of indoctrination and propaganda complicates any official announcement of the Trump meeting. An ideological framework must be devised to explain the talks with the enemy; and regardless of how they are presented, there is an uncomfortable margin for the “infallible” leader to be seen to fail in his aims. Trump is a volatile opponent who telegraphed his impatience even before the two men fixed a place to talk, warning he would walk away if he thought the preparations weren’t going anywhere. But this unpredictability is the reason there are talks at all. Trump’s barrage of verbal and Twitter attacks on North Koreans – which have been reported there – led Pyongyang to question if it was, for the first time in a generation, facing a US president willing to attack them, experts say. The bluster of decades of North Korean threats against America was based in no small part on the very real threat the regime poses to the people of Seoul. Millions live in the South Korean capital, which is barely 50km from the de facto border with the north. That it is well within range of artillery and other weapons means the city effectively serves as a human shield for Pyongyang’s nuclear programme. Officials there have long calculated that no US president would risk lives in Seoul with an attack on the North. But under Trump that is no longer a safe assumption, says Andrei Lankov, professor of Korean Studies at Kookmin University. “[North Korea] is facing a pretty unprecedented situation,” said Lankov, the author of Real North Korea. “A US president who appears willing to initiate a strike against them no matter what damage it will do to Seoul, and sanctions seriously affecting their economy.” In Pyongyang, the minders who barred questions from western journalists about the summit were frank about Trump himself. “He is crazy,” said one, referring to Trump’s belligerent speech to the United Nations. “[North Koreans] could not believe it when he actually threatened the annihilation of an entire nation of 25 million people.” Adding to pressure on Kim, international trade vital to the economy has been stifled after China’s unexpected decision to implement harsh sanctions approved by the United Nations. For years the Chinese government paid little more than lip service to various tranches of sanctions aimed at reining in the nuclear programme. North Koreans sent seafood, coal and the country’s esoteric range of other legal exports across the border and brought oil, consumer goods and desperately needed hard currency home. But last autumn that changed. Not all trade has been cut off. China was still buying at least one type of sanctioned iron this spring, the website NK News reported. But from factories forced to ration power, to the silent testimony of idle construction sites, a sudden flood of seafood into the domestic market, and countless other small signs, there is widespread consensus that Beijing has decided to crack down in an unprecedented way. China’s motives are opaque; they too may be worried about the prospect of a war on their doorstep given Trump’s belligerence, or share worries about nuclear weapons spreading in a region where they have until now been the only nuclear power. But their impact is unquestionable. North Korea is officially committed to self-reliance, and says it can survive controls on trade. In a place where ideology often trumps reality, it is hard to have a frank discussion about the effect of China closing the border. At one shoe factory in Pyongyang, the manager strenuously insisted all their raw materials were produced inside North Korea, as workers standing just metres away opened sacks of plastic pellets stamped “made in China” to feed the production line. But the effects have been severe and widespread enough to merit some official reference. “Its true that these sanctions are giving some obstacles to the development of the economy,” said Ri Gi-song, a professor at the Academy of Social Sciences in Pyongyang in a rare interview. That was a week after the prime minister, Pak Pong-ju, attacked “vicious sanctions and pressure manoeuvres”, and warned of “unprecedented massive challenges” in an April report to North Korea’s rubber-stamp parliament, the website 38 Degrees reported. The squeeze from China is likely affecting government coffers, which are bolstered by funds from private enterprise even though there is officially no tax in North Korea. And Kim may be worried that as the economy suffers, austerity may erode support from the small elite who have grown accustomed to the modest luxuries that constitute a high-end lifestyle in North Korea: eating out and drinking in pubs, Karaoke nights, and occasional trip to funfairs and water parks. Kim, like his predecessors, has proved adept at manipulating regional and world powers into providing aid and political support while offering little in return. Now Kim may at last be forced into making real changes to stave off looming political and economic crises. “They are going to make concessions in order not to be shot at, and have parts of the sanctions lifted,” Lankov said, suggesting they could include a moratorium on missile and nuclear tests. But he believes neither domestic nor international pressure will persuade the government to fully give up its nuclear programme. “They are not suicidal and if they lose the nuclear weapons, they become extremely vulnerable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/aug/04/with-political-will-we-could-easily-solve-our-transport-problems","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-04T17:22:46Z","webTitle":"With political will, we could easily solve our transport problems | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/04/with-political-will-we-could-easily-solve-our-transport-problems","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/aug/04/with-political-will-we-could-easily-solve-our-transport-problems","fields":{"headline":"With political will, we could easily solve our transport problems","bodyText":"George Monbiot makes some useful points in his article bemoaning the influence of the lobbying power of the motor industry (We must break the car’s chokehold on Britain, 2 August). He proposes a modal transport shift to more coach travel and investment in nuclear power plants to power our electric cars. He ignores completely, as usual, the solar option with smaller electric cars and electric bikes and charged by photovoltaics on homes, at work and in public places. In 1993, I bought Hannibal, the 750kg fibreglass Kewet El Jet electric car that we used for a decade to take the children to school, go shopping and to train and bus stations. This first British solar car was largely powered by the 4kWp PV roof on my Oxford ecohouse. Monbiot also ignores the huge trend towards using electric bikes that can be easily solar charged at home or work. We love our cars and bikes, but the trick is to make them much smaller, lighter and solar powered, used locally and to connect with public transport systems for longer distances, so decrying any need for building inevitably toxic new nuclear power stations at all. Car size does matter now if we, as a society, are serious about surviving safely into the 22nd century, so let’s have less of Jeremy Clarkson on TV and more solar-powered Good Lives. It’s the mindset that has to change first, then the hardware. Emeritus Professor Sue Roaf Oxford • George Monbiot and several of your readers (Letters, 28 July and 31 July) have drawn attention to the folly of the government’s 2040 initiative. It does not need 2020 hindsight to see that the demands on electricity generation will rocket in order to support a nation using only electric cars. Where will this electricity come from and at whose expense? What is still perplexing is Mr Monbiot’s continued support for nuclear power. Has he overlooked the massive clean-up and decommissioning bills which are accumulating? Is he dismissing nuclear accidents as inconvenient truths? And relying on the “burial” method for centuries to come? Nuclear (at least the fission sort) is still only an interim solution at best. There is only one way that an energy budget can be balanced in the long term without polluting: through renewables. Rather than consider whether to support electric cars or nuclear, we should install as much renewable generation as possible and perhaps, for once, live within its limits. A real joined-up policy would invest in expanding a nationalised rail network and encourage more people to travel by train than car. Two-way rail lines take up far less countryside than six-lane highways. Transporting goods too can be streamlined, with local depots handling the shorter distribution distances required while reducing the number of lorries on our roads – which might be better served by a nationalised postal service than fragmented companies competing unnecessarily: prices never seem to fall as a result of so-called competition. But on one point I can agree with Mr Monbiot: we are unlikely to see an ambitious plan for national infrastructure planning from governments focussing only on five-year election cycles. Dr John Ellis Tavistock, Devon • I read with interest a recent letter from Colin Read (31 July), who insisted that electric cars were shifting pollution from the car tailpipe to power stations. First, as an investor in energy, I would kindly point out that the efficiency of converting energy from one big engine, versus 1,000,000 small engines, is significantly different due to economies of scale. Second, the shift assumes that electric grids will continue to cater to peak demand. Currently, we are unable to store energy once it is generated from power stations – fossil fuel or renewable alike. But electric grids will in the next three to five years start to cater towards average demand, because of the innovation in energy storage. The exciting prospect is a 24/7 renewable electric grid, which energy storage makes possible. You get the efficiency of a grid system and the cleanness of renewables in one, and cheaply. A specific type of storage – liquid metal batteries – offers the greatest chance of commercial success, not least due to the short lifespan and dangers of lithium batteries. The greatest impediments to this are no longer scientific or commercial but political. UK government employees, not your typical risk takers by virtue of their employer, risk credibility when presenting innovation – concerning, when 42% of UK GDP is decided by government spending. Given the choice between making a comparatively risk-free decision over Hinkley Point C, and the decision to deploy new technology, which would you choose? Of course, the answer is to build both and then gradually shift to renewable energy, but the speed of this graduation, decided by how much risk the mandarins are willing to take, is what will determine whether we shift pollution from tailpipes to power stations. Josh Burge London • With almost 30% of lorries on our roads totally empty and average HGV loading only around 50%, sorting out freight transport can be part of the road transport solution. In order to get better efficiency from HGVs, instead of the current old-fashioned time-based system which neither measures the actual miles driven nor the full economic, safety and environmental impact of the HGV traffic, the government should introduce a distance-based lorry charging system. This measure could incentivise better utilisation of lorries, thus reducing lorry miles, crashes and pollution. Furthermore, it would also make it easier for rail freight, the safer, sustainable alternative, which reduces road congestion, to compete; one large freight train can remove up to 136 HGVs. Philippa Edmunds Freight on rail manager, Campaign for Better Transport • During weekdays unused cars line suburban streets. At weekends they choke town centres. Cars have become a status symbol rather than a sometime convenience. Many citizens are duped into undertaking the huge often unnecessary expense involved in car ownership even when adequate public transport is readily available. Often car ownership with the concomitant abuse of energy and resources would properly be a cause of shame rather than pride. As George Monbiot says, it is time to put the focus on cycling. This means designing our town centres to discourage cars and support bikes. It means park-and-ride schemes, frequent and flexible bus services, bike design for the elderly as well as the young, and pedestrianisation of town centres. Cars are expensive, polluting and dangerous, and dictate the design of towns to accommodate machines instead of people. Time to start designing our town centres for the benefit of citizens, not machines. Jim McCluskey Twickenham, Middlesex • The government is pressing ahead with its HS2 project at a cost of £60bn to be completed in the early 2030s. At the same time it has just announced a policy of phasing out diesel and petrol vehicles by 2040. Are there any projections available of the impact of this ban on traffic volumes? It seems likely that we will end up with a reduction in the number of vehicles on our roads, particularly motorways. As there are currently two motorways from London to Birmingham, why isn’t one of these converted into the HS2 route? This would slash the project’s costs and avoid some of the major environmental impacts of the current plan. Phil Gilbert Hallaton, Leicestershire • While overhead electrification is expensive in both cost and time, why is consideration not given to the “third rail” electrification which powers most of the railways in the south-east plus the very reliable Mersey Rail trains around Liverpool. Installing a third rail can’t be as expensive as building gantries and pylons. The rail industry needs to look at other alternatives, including having trains with the ability to obtain power from more than one source. Michael Nicolson Southport, Merseyside • “Garden cities encouraged long journeys to work” declares Simon Jenkins (We’re addicted to travel. And we need to be cured, 3 August). That is the direct opposite of the truth. The central principle of the garden cities, and of their successors, the postwar new towns, was that there would be sufficient suitable employment for residents locally, so that they would not need to take long journeys to work. This was seen as an essential factor in allowing communal life to develop healthily. That eminently sensible principle has been largely eroded over the years by the dysfunctional way our national economy has proceeded, with the result that a far higher proportion of the people of such towns have been forced to spend much of their lives travelling long distances to work. But that should never be blamed on those who envisaged and developed these towns.

The news came as the French energy group said a more advanced sister project at Flamanville in Normandy would now not start operating until 2018, at a cost of €10bn (£7.3bn). It was originally slated to open in 2005 and cost €3bn. No definite schedule has been given for power to be switched on at Hinkley, but it means the £24.5bn facility, which still awaits EDF’s formal go-ahead, may not be ready by 2023, a date that has already been put back several times. A decision had been widely expected to come in October. “Even though the final investment decision [FID] has been pushed back from the initial forecasts, the construction time will stay the same, which means that the commissioning date will be updated at the point when FID is made,” EDF’s chief executive, Jean-Bernard Lévy, said. “We are in final discussions with the British government and our Chinese partners. We hope to make this final investment decision as soon as possible.” he said. The latest problem follows continued speculation that China General Nuclear Power Corp and China National Nuclear Corp were pushing the UK government for concessions before committing to a cash investment at Hinkley. Critics have repeatedly told the government that it was foolish to rely on a new generation of nuclear power stations to meet Britain’s energy crunch, because such huge projects have a record of coming in late and over budget."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/feb/28/momentum-bid-for-key-labour-post-exposes-tension-with-unite","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"Momentum bid for key Labour post exposes tension with Unite","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/28/momentum-bid-for-key-labour-post-exposes-tension-with-unite","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/feb/28/momentum-bid-for-key-labour-post-exposes-tension-with-unite","fields":{"headline":"Momentum bid for key Labour post exposes tension with Unite","bodyText":"Len McCluskey once joked that Labour MPs were so paranoid about the closeness of Unite and Momentum, they were worried about “a secret tunnel linking Unite HQ to Jon Lansman’s home”. However, a battle to be Labour’s new general secretary is set to expose a faultline which has been quietly widening on the left of the party – between Momentum’s desire to see Labour transformed into a member-led movement and trade union interests in keeping tight control on its key offices. The departure of Labour’s general secretary, Iain McNicol, lit the touchpaper this week. Lansman, the founder of Momentum, is taking advice about the possibility of challenging Unite’s chosen candidate, Jennie Formby, who has the support of the leaders’ office. Historically, Momentum has been close to Unite and leftwing trade unions, setting up its first offices in the headquarters of the TSSA union. However, senior figures in Momentum now believe the group has a big enough support base to begin challenging party orthodoxy on its own terms, even if it means going head to head with trade unions. One described it as a “healthy tension” which was necessary to balance the powers within the party. Since its creation, Momentum has acted as both the muscle and the mouth of Corbyn’s vision to transform the party into a member-led social movement, but it now has sufficient power of its own to begin influencing the direction of the party beyond unquestioning support. Momentum has its own offices in east London, more than 30,000 members, and is financially independent, with 90% of its donations coming from membership fees and individual donations, not unions. Senior Momentum figures have wondered for a while whether the group needed to show its independence, and when would be the right time. “Our agenda is transforming the party. There are going to be places where Momentum and the unions disagree,” one source said. “What we want to make sure, first and foremost, is that the party is run collectively.” Momentum has never before felt the need to show its strength to the leaders’ office before, but Lansman was reportedly infuriated by the decision to appoint McNicol’s successor in a fast-track timetable of just three weeks and on the assumption that Formby would be the left’s candidate. Lansman’s decision to run would put him firmly at odds not just with Unite, but with the leaders’ office. Close allies of Corbyn are known to back Formby; these include one of his closest aides, Karie Murphy, and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. The Corbynite blog Skwawkbox and the MP Chris Williamson publicly backed Formby, the union’s former political director and a seven-year NEC member, shortly after she announced her decision, on Tuesday lunchtime, to run. A raft of other MPs followed shortly after. Many in the party believe McNicol’s replacement should be a woman, given that men hold most key positions – that of leader, deputy leader, shadow chancellor, heads of the Welsh and Scottish parties, and all of its metropolitan mayors. Others in the running for the position of general secretary are the GMB political officer Lisa Johnson and Unite’s political director, Anneliese Midgley, who has tweeted her support for Formby. The position is decided by a vote of the party’s full national executive committee. Key to the decision will be Corbyn-sceptic members of the committee, as well as the other larger unions Unison and GMB, which have not backed Formby so far. Union officers on the party’s ruling NEC do not speak as one voice, with Unison and Unite regularly at odds, but none wants to see their bloc’s influence diminished. One source on the NEC’s moderate wing said they had observed the tension between Momentum and trade unions for a while. “This could well be the moment the whole thing blows,” the source said. “The unions really should have seen this coming – everyone can see it apart from them. The reality is, there is not just one ‘project’ for the future of the Labour party, there are many projects, and sometimes they coalesce around mutual interests. And sometimes they don’t align at all.” Corbyn recently drafted in McCluskey’s chief of staff, Andrew Murray, a former communist party member, as a part-time consultant to his office, and Murphy is also closely associated with Unite. The union gave Labour £4.4m at the last general election. “Lots of people are worried about Unite influence in the leaders’ office and controlling the general secretary,” another Momentum source said. Should Lansman stand, it would likely be a personal wrench for Corbyn, who has been a longtime close friend of the Momentum founder since he worked on the 1981 deputy leadership campaign of Tony Benn, Corbyn’s political idol. Tensions have simmered since the compromise reached at last year’s conference to give new seats on the NEC to members, after hard lobbying by Momentum. However, unions also secured an extra seat on the ruling body as a compromise to ensure that their influence was not diminished. “It was very clear then that the union-controlled NEC wants democratisation of the party as long as it suits them,” a source said. “It was democratisation from the top down – it should come from the bottom up.” So far, key figures in Momentum have shown no desire to flex their muscles on policy, especially not on Brexit, despite large numbers of their members being firmly pro-EU. There are other issues, though, that could throw open future divisions with the unions. Momentum’s members are far more likely to back nuclear disarmament, oppose the expansion of Heathrow or be sceptical about nuclear power, all areas where Corbyn is sympathetic. Unions, however, especially Unite, cautiously back those policies, for the most part because their members are employed at airports and on nuclear submarines. But Lansman made it clear, in a previous interview, that he believes in the wisdom of the membership on key policy issues too. Members, he has argued, opposed the Iraq war, opposed PFI and opposed austerity, even when those were all part of Labour policy – and had been proved right."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/apr/21/the-pressing-need-for-nuclear-disarmament","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-21T16:12:24Z","webTitle":"The pressing need for nuclear disarmament | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/21/the-pressing-need-for-nuclear-disarmament","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/apr/21/the-pressing-need-for-nuclear-disarmament","fields":{"headline":"The pressing need for nuclear disarmament","bodyText":"Paul Mason writes (G2, 17 April) that the generation waking up to recent headlines “may need reminding what a nuclear weapon does”. Given the dramatic escalation of nuclear rhetoric in recent months, we could all use a reminder of the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of such weapons. Mr Mason correctly notes that in the UK – as elsewhere – the numbers of people in need of emergency medical help after an attack would outstrip hospital beds. But it is worth remembering that in many nuclear scenarios, these hospital beds and other essential health infrastructure would no longer exist. Neither would the doctors and nurses who operate them. Nuclear weapons are unique in their destructive power, in the unspeakable human suffering they cause, and in the impossibility of controlling their effects in space and time. They threaten irreversible harm to the environment and to future generations. Prohibiting and eliminating them is a humanitarian imperative. Mr Mason writes about what a responsible nuclear power “would do”. We would suggest that a responsible nuclear power should participate in the ongoing UN negotiations for a new treaty banning nuclear weapons. This would reinforce the stigma against their use and be a concrete step towards fulfilling existing commitments for nuclear disarmament, notably those of article VI of the non-proliferation treaty. All nuclear states can show leadership by taking their place at the negotiating table. Kathleen Lawand Head, Arms Unit , International Committee of the Red Cross • Paul Mason writes very good sense in relation to the present risk of war as a result of emotion-driven leadership, and the urgent need to “use our diplomatic clout to strengthen disarmament”. The UK should go further and support the nuclear ban treaty negotiations backed by over 130 nations at the UN, which met for a week in March and will reconvene from 15 June to 7 July. These remarkably positive talks have hugely advanced the steps towards nuclear disarmament, but are being boycotted by the US, the UK and other nuclear weapons states on the grounds that we should stick with the ineffective non-proliferation treaty, and because “nuclear weapons are needed for security”. Mason is right that we should speak out; we should also ask our government to back the ban treaty, and attend the June talks in New York. Otherwise our claim to support nuclear disarmament is an empty one.

Unable to say what Brexit is, a strategically and heroically vague David Davis last week chose instead to tell Brussels what Brexit isn’t, promising, definitively, that Brexit will not be “a Mad Max-style world”, despite evidence to the contrary commissioned by his own department. Andrea Leadsom, meanwhile, has clarified that Brexit will also not be “some ham”, Jacob Rees-Mogg has stated categorically that Brexit will not be “a drawing of Alain Delon”, while Dan Hananananan has further elucidated that Brexit will also not be “a kind of thing with all stuff on it, and brown stripes, going up and down, like humbug mints on an escalator or some hot bees”. In the light of Davis’s assurances that we will not be “plunged into a Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction”, I wonder how much worse the post-Brexit dystopia could be anyway? Would the air of the capital remain technically toxic? Would there be nuclear power stations abandoned in dangerous disrepair? Would the oceans choke on plastic? Would secure housing be a pipe dream for millions? Would Boris Johnson still be free to scatter his lies at midnight into sleeping children’s eyes? For many of the disenfranchised and disenchanted Britons who voted for Brexit, being plunged into a Mad Max-style dystopia would represent an improvement in their living conditions! Perhaps being plunged into a Mad Max-style dystopia is one of the few tangible benefits of Brexit!! Especially if it was sunny and featured Tina Turner as an Amazon cyberpunk!!! And anyway, better to live one day free in a Mad Max-style dystopia than a thousand years as a slave in the world’s largest single market area. I worry that the idea that we will be “plunged” into a Mad Max-style dystopia is a little optimistic. The word “plunged” suggests events would unfold with a speed and decisiveness so far absent from the Brexit process. After a few years of sliding slowly and painfully into a Mad Max-style dystopia, with no clear end to the plunging in sight, Leave voters will look back at the suggestion that we were to be plunged into anything at all as just another example of the lying betrayals of their feckless and apparently unaccountable Brexit cheerleaders. Where was the plunge into a Mad Max-style dystopia we were promised? But what do I know? I have not even seen any of the Mad Max movies, though last year Brendan McCarthy, co-writer of the recent reboot Mad Max: Fury Road, described me as “an archaic leftwing relic”, adding: “Milo Yiannopoulos is more on the zeitgeist.” But where is the discredited alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos now? Nowhere. And where am I? I am in a three-star hotel room in Stratford-upon-Avon, eating a bag of humbug mints, which are what gave me the idea for the closing sentence of the third paragraph. I win. And anyway, the best dystopian sci-fi film is not Mad Max, but the straight-to-video Mad Max rip-off World Gone Wild (Lee H Katzin, 1987), which I bought on VHS from a shop called Rimpy’s Fags, Foods and Non-Foods on Horn Lane in Acton for 50p in 1989. (World Gone Wild was, of course, filed in the non-foods section of the store, along with the wood, a fossilised coelacanth and Terence Trent D’Arby.) The reason World Gone Wild is a better dystopian sci-fi movie than Brendan McCarthy’s stupid Mad Max: Fury Road, for example, is because it doesn’t have a colon in the middle of its title like what a idiot would do; and because it stars Adam Ant as a man called Derek Abernathy who, in a plot copied off Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai, harries a plucky village of survivors in a Mad Max-style dystopia; and because it co-stars the bewildering actor Alan Autry, who played a gay footballer in the controversial gay Cheers episode The Boys in the Bar, but went on to become the anti-gay mayor of Fresno California; and because I’ve seen it and you never will. I win. Again. David Davis rightly became the immediate target of the high-speed satire sausage machines of social media’s infinite monkey treadmill for his foolish Mad Max metaphor, but imagine if he had been just a little more pop-culturally literate in the way that Tories just never are. Imagine if, instead of saying Britain would not be “plunged into a Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction”, David Davis had said Britain would not be “plunged into a Derek Abernathy-style world. You know? Derek Abernathy? The Adam Ant character in World Gone Wild? Haven’t you seen it? Steve Jones from the Sex Pistol’s forgotten 80s hair metal band Chequered Past do the theme tune.” The confused corrupt Eurocrat fat-cats of Brussels would immediately have sent their researchers off to score copies of World Gone Wild to decode Davis’s latest opaque clue as to what Britain imagined Brexit was, thus buying Davis more time to invoke ever more obscure dystopian sci-fi movies in his quest to hide the dispiriting truth. “I tell you what Brexit won’t be. It won’t be like that one set two years from now where Christian Bale and a group of bedraggled survivors hide in a desolate English wasteland attacked by giant dragons. Rain of Fire, wasn’t it?

More than 200 crofters have objected to proposals to build on communal land close to Stornoway, the biggest town in the Outer Hebrides. The crofters want to build their own development, with the profits going to the local community. The row started because under Scottish law crofters have rights over the land even though the multinationals have bought a lease through a joint venture called Lewis Wind Power. Crofting is bound by complex rules that give both landowners and smallholders rights. EDF and Wood have now applied to the Scottish land court to force through the development of 36 turbines on the “common grazings”, triggering the objections to the plans. Wind is increasingly seen as a key natural resource in the Western Isles, with the potential to boost the economic future of the islands. The contested area is moorland called the Stornoway General, a few miles from the main town. Stornoway General is divided into areas for different villages and owned by the Stornoway Trust. One township, Point and Sandwick, has built three turbines on its section, borrowing £14m from Santander bank to finance the development, and the turbines now support a drug and alcohol programme, a hospice and a local arts centre. Calum MacDonald, a former Labour MP for the area who was involved in developing the first three turbines, said the earlier development proved that the crofters’ plans were viable. “We absolutely believe we can make it work and that we would be able to borrow the money for the development,” he said. “EDF would not be doing it unless they believed it would make money.” MacDonald said crofting rights were particularly important to locals. “After the Highland Clearances, the crofts were protected by statute. Like so much land in Scotland, two different interests have rights over the land – the landowner and the crofter. It’s because of the history that people get so upset, the idea that their rights to the land would just be handed over to a multinational, just like that.” Angus McCormack, a local councillor and chair of the Point and Sandwick Trust, said a larger community-owned project could finance more local causes, as well as create jobs on an island with a high poverty rate. “We have to do it for the young people. There is nothing else to stay for,” said McCormack. “Building our own windfarms would be transformational to the islands. One of the key things is trying to keep hold of the young people. They go away for their education, and they never come back.” Rhoda MacKenzie from the Sandwick and North Street township said the 70-year lease was too long. “In a few months’ time, it could be gone for two or three generations,” she said. “If this were oil, they would be treating it differently, but wind has always been here. It’s just we’ve proved that we know how to harness it now.” The rules governing crofting evolved because, traditionally, crofters had small pieces of land next to their houses, where they raised livestock during the winter. During the summer, they would travel to the moor. Crofters’ rights include grazing sheep and cattle and cutting peat, and they have extended to planting trees and building windfarms. In their 2017 general election manifesto, the Conservatives announced that, although onshore wind power would no longer be subsidised, an exemption would be made to support the development of wind projects in the remote islands of Scotland provided they “directly benefit the local communities”. This means that Lewis Wind Power could bid for subsidies under the “contract for difference” (CfD) scheme, which guarantees a minimum price for electricity. EDF recently agreed a CfD deal for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset, which has been criticised for the vast projected cost to electricity consumers. Supporters of Lewis Wind Power said that multinationals’ involvement is critical to support the construction of an interconnector, carrying electricity to the mainland grid. Although EDF and Wood Group would not invest directly in the interconnector, it will not be built unless there is a guarantee of largescale electricity generation. Kerry MacPhee, from Lewis Wind Power, said: “Without the interconnector, there won’t be any more community windfarms or any project on the island. We need this interconnector. Lewis Wind Power have been working on this project for years. It’s not as simple as just bidding into a contract for difference. You’ve got to have the critical mass.” Iain Maciver, the factor (agent) of the Stornoway Trust, said the interconnector was vital. “If they do their maths, they will realise that 100% of nothing will always be nothing. If we don’t get this project through, the island economy is on its knees.” Patrick Krause, the chief executive of the Scottish Crofting Federation, said the crofters’ objections were important. “This is something that the government should be looking at as part of their infrastructure development anyway,” said Krause. “The Scottish government’s plans are to increase our dependency on renewable energy, and if the best places for turbines are on the islands, or offshore completely, then we need interconnectors. I don’t like the fact that the Scottish government are maybe getting out of their duty on this and leaving a community to fight with a big transnational syndicate.” Donald John MacSween, the general manager of the Point and Sandwick Trust, said that the crofters’ plans justified the interconnector. “For generations, we’ve been living in a gale, and now that we’ve finally found a way to make money out of it, I don’t see why EDF should take it,” said MacSween. “Mind you, if we can find a way of making money out of rain and dark nights, then we’ll really be in business.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/20/china-to-take-one-third-stake-in-24bn-hinkley-nuclear-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-20T09:57:15Z","webTitle":"China to take one-third stake in £24bn Hinkley nuclear power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/20/china-to-take-one-third-stake-in-24bn-hinkley-nuclear-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/20/china-to-take-one-third-stake-in-24bn-hinkley-nuclear-power-station","fields":{"headline":"China to take one-third stake in £24bn Hinkley nuclear power station","bodyText":"China will take a one-third stake in a French-led project to build a new £24bn nuclear power station in the UK at Hinkley Point in Somerset, expected to be the most expensive ever built. The deal was signed between state-owned companies from China and France just hours before the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, arrived in London for a state visit, and is due to be announced on Wednesday. It will lead to a final investment decision - the point of no return - by the end of 2015, according to the Financial Times. The companies - France’s EDF and China General Nuclear Power Corporation - will be the only investors, having failed to attract others. The new completion date for the two reactors at Hinkley Point is 2025, eight years later than first suggested. The deal is strongly backed by the chancellor, George Osborne. The government believes the new plant, which would deliver 7% of the UK’s electricity, represents good value for low-carbon electricity which, barring problems, is always on. The plant has been promised £92 per megawatt hour (MWh) for 35 years, double today’s average wholesale electricity price, with any shortfall being paid by consumers via household energy bills. Hinkley Point will also be backed by up to £17bn of UK government loan guarantees. The deal signed this week is also expected to mention Chinese involvement on additional nuclear plants at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex. China hopes to build 110 nuclear power plants at home and wants to use its own designs at Bradwell as a showcase to help it sell its technology further afield. But the nuclear push has many critics over its cost, the time it takes to build and the possible threats to the UK’s national security of having China in control of a plant on UK soil. Osborne’s father-in-law, former energy minister Lord Howell, said the project was “one of the worst deals ever” for British consumers and industry. Howell, and others, have warned the reactor design planned for Hinkley C has never been completed successfully, pointing to huge cost and time overruns at EDF’s projects at Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland. EDF needs the Chinese investment as it is burdened with high levels of debt and is expected to sell €10bn of assets in the next five years, according to the Financial Times. Earlier in October, two of the world’s biggest ratings agencies warned the company it faced credit-rating downgrades if Hinkley Point goes ahead. A Greenpeace poll this week showed 29% of the UK public supports the Hinkley project, with 34% against it. A protest camp was set up outside the site this week and Alan Jeffery, a spokesman for the Stop Hinkley campaign said: “We remain mystified about why Osborne wants to throw good money after bad on this project. In the process, he has devastated the UK’s burgeoning renewable energy industry, threatening up to 20,000 jobs in the process. He is doing his best to kill off an innovative industry of the future in order to keep alive a technology of the past.” However, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers have welcomed the Hinkley plan. “Nuclear is set to play a central and vital role in the UK’s energy future,” said the IME’s Jenifer Baxter. “Although the financial costs of nuclear power seem high, this power station will provide and modernise the diversification we so badly need in ensuring the UK’s lights stay on.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jul/01/hinkley-point-c-critics-try-to-derail-it-amid-brexit-vote-turmoil","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-01T15:59:29Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C critics try to derail it amid Brexit vote turmoil","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/01/hinkley-point-c-critics-try-to-derail-it-amid-brexit-vote-turmoil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jul/01/hinkley-point-c-critics-try-to-derail-it-amid-brexit-vote-turmoil","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C critics try to derail it amid Brexit vote turmoil","bodyText":"Britain’s flagship energy project, Hinkley Point C, is hanging by a thread as critics inside key backer EDF use the political turmoil from the Brexit vote to try to derail the already delayed £18bn scheme. Jean Bernard Levy, the EDF group chief executive, and the French and British governments, have in recent days insisted they are as committed as ever to a positive final investment decision being taken as soon as possible. But well-placed sources in Paris have told the Guardian that the already divided EDF board, which must make that decision, is in danger of fracturing further as former supporters of the project worry about Brexit. “The situation for Levy was already very delicate,” said one source. “But it has become a lot more difficult because there is so little certainty around the British government,” they added. “No one could know today which way a vote [of the board on Hinkley] would go.” Those arguing against the project say it is impossible to make any decisions when it is unclear who will be the future prime minister, chancellor of the exchequer and energy and climate change secretary. Highly critical EDF unions in France, which have six representatives on the main board, are pressing waiverers among the five independent board members who have previously supported Levy to change their minds. Growing concern has led to four British trade unions urging EDF to press ahead with Hinkley. It was a first “litmus test” that major infrastructure projects will proceed as normal following the Brexit vote, they argued. The message was delivered by four British trade unions in a letter to Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF’s UK arm, ahead of a previous commitment to make the “final investment decision” by September. “The UK trade unions are 100% in support of Hinkley Point C and believe that it is vital to make a final investment decision in a timely fashion soon after the consultation process (between EDF and the French unions) is completed on 4 July,” says the letter signed by the four general secretaries: Len McCluskey (Unite); Brian Rye (Ucatt); Mike Clancy (Prospect) and Tim Roache (GMB). “Nuclear new build is already behind the curve; we cannot afford further delay and it is vital for EDF to make a final investment decision now,” it adds. The unions say the project, which is meant to generate 7% of UK’s electricity, is vital for keeping the lights on and to create thousands of jobs in the years ahead. The reactor scheme is the first of its kind in more than 20 years but has already been beset by delays. EDF has put back the final investment decision due to its own internal problems mainly centering round mounting financial problems and dissent among its own unions and staff. The letter adds: “It would be a tragedy, in both France and the UK, if all this work and the extraordinary opportunities it provides were to be lost. “The moment to make the decision is upon us and we have a genuine fear that any further delay will lead to the unravelling of all that we have fought so hard to achieve.” Unite national officer for energy, Kevin Coyne, said: “The final investment decision by EDF Energy in Hinkley Point will be the first litmus test, following the Brexit vote, that much-needed investment in large infrastructure projects is still coming on stream.” Brian Rye, acting general secretary of Ucatt, said: “This is a vitally needed and ground-breaking project. The decision on the final go-ahead on Hinkley will demonstrate whether foreign-owned companies are still prepared to invest in the UK. The government needs to ensure that they get this deal over the line.” Justin Bowden, GMB national secretary, said: “The decision to get on and build Hinkley Point C must be made now, without further delay. The UK is already at growing risk of power shortages from our over-reliance on unpredictable renewables and our energy needs have not changed since last week.” The prime minister’s office said David Cameron and his French counterpart Francois Hollande reconfirmed their commitment to Hinkley when they met at first world war commemorations in Normandy. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) said keeping the lights on was “non-negotiable” and the government would ensure consumers had secure, affordable and clean energy now and in the future. A spokesperson added: “UK Government remains committed to Hinkley Point C. It’s good for British people and will power around 6 million homes with reliable electricity for 60 years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/feb/02/china-perceive-auntie-theresa-may-visit","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-02T14:17:34Z","webTitle":"How China really perceives ‘Auntie May’ | Yuan Ren","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/02/china-perceive-auntie-theresa-may-visit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/02/china-perceive-auntie-theresa-may-visit","fields":{"headline":"How China really perceives ‘Auntie May’","bodyText":"On the same day that the BBC underlined China’s apparent excitement over Theresa May’s visit, with a video featuring Chinese students praising the UK, Chinese social media was arguably more enthusiastic about the “super blue blood moon” . On Wednesday night China’s popular social media platform WeChat was awash with user postings of moon pictures. Most Chinese people are unlikely to know that the British prime minister is in their country. “I don’t think anyone is paying attention to that,” a Chinese news assistant for a European news agency replied, laughing, when I asked her about May’s visit. As much as the visit has made headlines in the Chinese media, which is mostly state-sponsored, it was her visit to Wuhan that created more buzz, and for a much less well-known female figure. Jiang Shuying, or Maggie Jiang, a Chinese TV actress who holds a masters from the University of East Anglia, was propelled to social media stardom as she showed the prime minister around Wuhan University. Both news and social media posts about the visit were quick to note the actress’s polished beauty and how good her English was. There is some media intrigue with May herself, in particular her family life – as you would expect from a deeply patriarchal society where only one woman sits in the 25-strong top-level politburo. Media noted that May’s visit was the first time she had been accompanied by her husband on an official visit abroad, the narrative being “the quiet man behind a strong woman”. The fact that they have no children was mentioned – the expected explanation for many Chinese people as to how a woman could arrive at such professional distinction. Foreign female political figures are often portrayed as hard bitten – and like Angela Merkel, May has been referred to as an “iron lady”. But this image was tweaked in a state media interview, who suggested the title of “Auntie May” in an interview with her before her visit. As with “Uncle Xi” (President Xi Jinping) and “Mama Peng” (the first lady, Peng Liyuan), the term politely labels May as an amenable and reliable member of the leader’s extended, international family. It’s a clever tactic, but politeness and even flattery is the Chinese way, rooted in its three classical Confucian texts that set out how to behave in public and private. There is no reason China shouldn’t view the UK positively, given that British backing into critical government-led projects such as the new Xiong’an economic zone to the south-west of Beijing. David Cameron first talked of a “golden era” in Sino-UK relations two years ago, evoking China’s own “golden age”: a reference to the prosperous Tang dynasty and thriving trade along the Silk Road. The term has been rejigged: it is now the harvesting of “golden fruits” under May. But the enthusiasm may be less glowing than the British side wants to believe. It’s telling perhaps that Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador to the UK, wrote in an article in the Telegraph this week that: “Both China and the UK now stand at the entrance to a new era.” Surely this unique relationship is not still hovering at the doorway? China has more in common culturally with the UK than any other European country, and far more than with the US. Ancient history is an important rhetorical device in contemporary China and Xi’s overall political narrative, and the UK’s “stable history” gives it symbolic credibility as a global ally that is experienced in “investment, security, green finance”, as China News wrote. However, the way China sees Britain is not quite the same as at the end of 2013, when George Osborne and Boris Johnson first touted a “special relationship”, going to Beijing to discuss trade. Back then, China also saw the UK as a powerful extension of Europe. With Brexit, it realises the need to court the rest of the continent, for which read France and Germany, more directly. For the time being, the importance of Britain must be weighed against the bigger investment China is trying to make in the EU, which it views as a single entity. May’s visit comes hot on the heels of Emmanual Macron’s a few weeks ago. On the positive side, you could argue that Brexit may grant China more flexibility in trading with the UK, and the depreciation of the pound attracts more investment. For China’s booming middle class, in particular, the devaluing of the pound has been delightful, allowing more families to consider sending their children to study in the UK, not to mention the shopping on Oxford Street, and at Bicester village. But given that Europe is particularly important in the Belt and Road initiative, Xi’s flagship project, China’s focus will increasingly be there. There are also niggling reservations over May after delays in the approval of the controversial Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, in which China has a one-third stake. Overall, the UK remains an ally that provides valuable investment opportunities, as well as a country admired by China for its strong political institutions, and centuries-long record of global influence. While there’s no sign of the lavish state reception that greeted Donald Trump in the Forbidden City, the UK can continue to curry favour by supporting the Belt and Road project, and may eventually taste the nectar of those “golden fruits”. If nothing else, loyal family member “Auntie May” – unlike the “stealthy” Trump who flips on China all the time – is unlikely to end up doing anything unexpected. • Yuan Ren is a bilingual writer and broadcaster on China"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jul/14/hinkley-point-c-new-uk-chancellor-determined-start-building-philip-hammond","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-14T08:50:30Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point: new UK chancellor determined to start building","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/14/hinkley-point-c-new-uk-chancellor-determined-start-building-philip-hammond","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jul/14/hinkley-point-c-new-uk-chancellor-determined-start-building-philip-hammond","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point: new UK chancellor determined to start building","bodyText":"The new chancellor of the exchequer has expressed his determination to see construction begin on the controversial Hinkley Point C nuclear plant, amid mounting concerns over the cost of the project. “We have to make sure the project goes ahead,” Philip Hammond told BBC’s Today programme. However, he admitted there was “obviously an atmosphere of uncertainty” around the £18bn scheme due to the change of ministers following the referendum. Talks with France and China – the two countries offering to build the Somerset reactors – were already underway to reassure them that the UK government continued to fully back Britain’s first new nuclear power plant in a generation, said Hammond. A modern economy needed a fully modern and functioning power and supply system, said the chancellor who said he believed Hinkley was a “prerequisite” for this to happen. Hammond admitted he was not aware of the latest findings from the financial watchdog, the National Audit Office, that consumers may have to pay out nearly £30bn over the 35-year life of the plant – through higher energy bills – if the cost of wholesale energy remained low. He said he would look at this immediately. A subsidy deal signed between the French energy company EDF and the administration of David Cameron, meant that EDF could receive compensation – effectively paid by consumers’ higher bills – in the event of a fall in wholesale electricity prices. Hammond said Hinkley would make a huge contribution providing over 6% of the UK’s power. Hammond’s intervention is a significant move amid speculation that the project could be abandoned. The future of the facility is in the hands of EDF and the French government. Both parties have repeatedly delayed taking a financial decision on the scheme amid mounting debt problems at the partly state-owned energy group. EDF and the Elysée have promised that a final investment decision will be taken in September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-delay-points-to-renegotiation-rather-than-rethink","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-29T16:46:56Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C delay points to renegotiation rather than rethink","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-delay-points-to-renegotiation-rather-than-rethink","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-c-delay-points-to-renegotiation-rather-than-rethink","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C delay points to renegotiation rather than rethink","bodyText":"Theresa May’s government has read the small print of the Hinkley deal and maybe it’s become spooked. But whether ministers are specifically anxious by the phenomenal long-term cost of the project, the Chinese state’s involvement, or the design and near-impossible construction of what would be the most ambitious and expensive power station in the world is not yet clear. Possibly, the new prime minister has been led to understand that the whole darn thing must be rethought. Or it could just be a momentary delay. What is not in doubt is that government is still firmly committed to nuclear power as part of the UK energy mix. So it seems unlikely that No 10 is planning a radical rethink of energy policy and a return to the pre-Blair, renewable-only days. Far more likely, the plan being hurriedly hatched is to renegotiate the deal with EDF and the Chinese, in the expectation that the French company’s tricky finances will force it to abandon the Hinkley ship. Then if the EDF deal unravels it will clear the way for government to swiftly adopt Plan B. This could involve the business and energy secretary, Greg Clark, inviting the Japanese giant Hitachi to expand its existing programme of two new reactors in Britain. The company, which owns the Horizon nuclear consortium, is well down the road of planning and building a new 2,700MW power station at Wylfa on Anglesey, and is already negotiating price guarantees with government. The energy secretary Greg Clark has just returned from Tokyo after talks with the company that also builds small modular reactors, which are touted by many as simple to build, safe, secure and cheap. It is possible Clark has been speaking to Hitachi to step this up. But a Hinkley exit, if it happened, would give the energy secretary several new nuclear options. If the government is fixated on big, centralised power stations, Clark could also take a trip to Seoul, South Korea, where the national nuclear company, Kepco, has an envious record of building a range of large nuclear reactors more or less on time and on budget. If China is still considered acceptable, he could ask Beijing to step in. Either way, if EDF did step out of the way, he would be free to strike a better, cheaper, quicker nuclear deal as well as offering loans and sweeteners. But the business and energy department also knows it is a fact of modern energy life that nuclear costs are inexorably rising at the same time that renewable energy is becoming cheaper and more reliable. Not only is is becoming feasible to store the intermittent electricity generated by wind and sun, it is possible to tap into many other sources and distribute power very differently. The beauty of this week’s unexpected pause on the EDF deal is that it allows May to make a clean break with the Cameron government’s apparent ideological opposition to renewables and decentralised power. In the eight years since Hinkley negotiations started, renewables have been transformed. Offshore wind, once ruinously expensive, is now around 20% cheaper than nuclear power in Denmark; solar is so cheap it can be sold in supermarkets; tidal power is limitless and emerging; and energy saving, the Cinderella of the energy world, has proved itself the cheapest way to cut energy costs. All could flourish once the yoke of the giant Hinkley project is lifted. Because Hinkley stands to cost the taxpayer more than the Channel Tunnel, the Olympic games, Heathrow expansion and Crossrail combined, it would inevitably stifle all these emerging technologies for the whole of its heavily subsidised 60-year life. Maybe, the government has unexpectedly stepped back and opened the way for exciting options that it can now grasp."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/oct/21/nuclear-power-deal-china-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-21T11:44:19Z","webTitle":"This nuclear power deal with China is one of the maddest ever struck | Polly Toynbee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/21/nuclear-power-deal-china-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/21/nuclear-power-deal-china-uk","fields":{"headline":"This nuclear power deal with China is one of the maddest ever struck","bodyText":"The grand kowtow continues its humiliating progress today, but beggars can’t be choosers. The Queen and all her family – good grief, even the Duke of York – are rolled out as the golden words flow. Britain always risks being a figure of fun as it grasps at the coat-tails of the great powers: enough leaks from our American cousins have revealed how often our “special relationship” dream has been mocked in Washington. What snickers echo in Beijing’s labyrinths of power? Red carpets for tyrants, dictators, feudal sheikhs and torturers of every hue – the Queen has been obliged to smile upon them all. Remember, she had Romania’s Nicolae Ceausescu to stay in 1978 at Jim Callaghan’s behest: after parading with her in her open-topped carriage, he returned home with two labradors, later seen riding round Bucharest in their own limousine as his people starved. Ethical diplomacy? An oxymoron dispelled so often by “needs must”. Today is the big sign-up, as Mont Blanc pens are put to one of the maddest deals ever struck by any government, let alone by David Cameron, who has the word “security” on a repeat key for every speech. A Chinese state-controlled company, with a minority French state partner, will build (and control) massive nuclear power plants at Hinkley Point, Bradwell in Essex and Sizewell. British intelligence agency sources are said to be so concerned that they have let it be known in public that they can never know what hidden capabilities are built into the plants’ software. On the one hand, the government needs four new Trident subs to protect us from unknown – Chinese? – future nuclear foes in a dangerous world. But on the other hand Cameron and Osborne are nonchalant about the blatant risk of the Chinese planting undetectable devices that could, say, blow up the plants, with which to blackmail us if they chose. Peter Mandelson blithely says that if ever the Chinese used that leverage they would forfeit their world investments – but we are talking about a hypothetical war footing. If that’s too outlandish to worry about, what’s the point of Trident? Cameron can do one or other of these nuclear programmes, but logically not both. These nuclear power plans are bizarre in every way. Hinkley Point will be the most expensive plant in the world, at £24bn. To pay for it, monumental subsidies lasting until 2060 will dwarf any PFI ever devised. Osborne begs the Chinese to pay for this and for HS2 as well on a never–never bill for our grandchildren, when we could borrow the money at negligible interest and be in hock to no one. But his damaging fiscal charter allows no such investment. The Chinese get a guaranteed price of £92.50 per megawatt hour – double the usual price. But even with this walloping sweetener of a profit stream, no other company would touch it. So why, exactly, do the Chinese want it? This huge subsidy will be added to our energy bills. Yet the government has just slashed a far lower £9-a-year subsidy for wind and solar power, saying they want to relieve householders of that burden. Nuclear may be a desirable small part of the energy mix as we get closer to black- and brownouts, but only if the price matches other technologies. How perverse to axe support for wind and solar just as it nears viability. As Patrick Barkham explains, solar subsidies could be gradually withdrawn but are needed now. As it is, the sudden 87% slash in subsidy is sending solar and wind companies crashing. Onshore wind is destroyed by the government’s refusal to grant planning permission. Even offshore wind companies are being frozen out. Ecotricity, a green provider, says almost all UK electricity could be supplied by renewables by 2030. With a little gas backup, UK electricity could be virtually emissions-free. If the gigantic, risky investment in these nuclear plants were diverted to a green energy industry rush, the rewards would be immense and Britain’s reputation as a vanguard not a laggard on climate change would be invaluable. Soft power is better than kowtowing to hard power. The UN’s chief scientist, Professor Jacquie McGlade, warned this week that Britain’s cuts to renewable subsidies put us at odds with the unprecedented pledges made by 150 other countries for the Paris climate change summit in December: she calls it “a very perverse signal”. Visit Black Ditch, the site just near Hinkley Point where the government turned down an application for wind turbines, as they do all wind applications. It’s a scrappy bit of ex-industrial land beside a motorway, under Hinkley Point’s pylons. Let that stand as a symbol for the folly of the vast and risky nuclear plan, displacing wiser green investments. What people still don’t get about the Cameron/Osborne regime is how virtually every decision springs from a random set of extreme ideologies. Instinctive loathing of “green crap”, including wind and solar power, is one. Embracing some monster building projects, especially nuclear, regardless of cost or worth, is another. But their vaulting ambition for grand projects can only come with soaring off-the-books debt, despite all the lectures on austerity and balanced budgets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/live/2020/jun/17/black-lives-matter-protests-republicans-police-bill-chokehold-donald-trump-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2020-06-18T00:16:32Z","webTitle":"Atlanta officer charged with felony murder for Rayshard Brooks killing – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/17/black-lives-matter-protests-republicans-police-bill-chokehold-donald-trump-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/17/black-lives-matter-protests-republicans-police-bill-chokehold-donald-trump-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Atlanta officer charged with felony murder for Rayshard Brooks killing – as it happened","bodyText":"The white Atlanta police officer who fatally shot Rayshard Brooks was charged with murder.

Democrats have sized the revelations as more evidence to support Trump’s impeachment but have also criticized Bolton for declining to testify during the impeachment inquiry. Joe Biden accused Donald Trump of surrendering the fight against coronavirus said that the president “sold out” the US in allegedly asking China for re-election help. Biden said Trump had violated a “sacred duty” to the American people. Officials in Tulsa, Oklahoma, worried that the president’s plan to hold a huge political indoor rally in the city on Saturday will inflame racial tensions and put people at risk of catching coronavirus. Some have urged Trump to postpone the event. The city’s Republican mayor said that it was an “honor” to host the president, but said he would not be attending the rally. A CDC report found that nearly 70% of 220 patients hospitalized in Atlanta were Black. With cases rising in some parts of the nation as cities reopen bars, restaurants, and other public venues, the pandemic continues to expose deeply entrenched inequalities. Joe Biden, in response to the allegation that Trump asked China for help getting re-elected, said that the president “sold out the American people to protect his political future”. Here’s more from Biden: Today, we learned from John Bolton, the President’s former national security advisor, that President Trump sold out the American people to protect his political future. He reportedly directly asked Xi Jinping, China’s leader, to help him get re-elected. He was willing to trade away our most cherished democratic values for the empty promise of a flimsy trade deal that bailed him out of his disastrous tariff war that did so much damage to our farmers, manufacturers, and consumers. If these accounts are true, it’s not only morally repugnant, it’s a violation of Donald Trump’s sacred duty to the American people to protect America’s interests and defend our values. Democrats have seized on allegations that Trump requested political help from China, emphasizing evidence to support having impeached Trump. Here’s Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer: But as Elizabeth Warren pointed out, any revelations in Bolton’s book have come too late. Bolton declined to testify during the impeachment inquiry last year. In Boston, demonstrators organized a law enforcement “appreciation rally” and faced off against Black Lives Matter protesters. Here’s a view of the scene, from WGBH reporter Tori Bedford. The pro-police protesters were carrying “Thin Blue Line” American flags, which defenders have said represent a solemn tribute to fallen officers. But the flag has also been criticized as a symbol of white supremacy, appearing next to the confederate flag at the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. Per witnesses at the rally in Boston today, someone carrying the Thin Blue Line flag spat at a passing car with a Black driver, and police escorted the driver away. Officers were instructed not to use body cameras during the raid of journalist Bryan Carmody’s home, in a San Francisco police department memo obtained by the nonprofit Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. In the memo, lieutenant Pilar Torres said officers conducting the raid should “lieutenant Pilar Torres states that he told law enforcement officers conducting the raid “not to utilize our department issued BWC’s [body worn cameras] for this operation” to avoid compromising the “confidential investigation”. San Francisco has reached a $369,000 settlement with Carmody. Officers raided the freelance journalist’s home in 2019 and seized notebooks and other materials after he refused to disclose the source who shared a confidential police report on the death of a San Francisco public defender. The case is receiving renewed interest amid the new revelations and amid increased scrutiny over the police’s treatment of journalists covering the recent protests against police brutality. In March and April, out of 220 coronavirus patients who were hospitalized, 79% were Black. Older Black men made up 52% of those hospitalized. By comparison, 13% of hospitalized patients were white, per the report published Wednesday. The unequal toll of the coronavirus pandemic on Black and minority communities has now been well documented throughout the country. A previous CDC report found that more than 80% of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 in Georgia were Black. As the state has loosened restrictions and increased testing, the number of cases reported has increased in four of the past five weeks. The Republican mayor of Tulsa has said he won’t be attending Trump’s rally on Saturday. At a press conference, mayor GT Bynum said it will be a “tremendous honor” to host Trump in Tulsa, but that he won’t attend the event. “I’m not positive that everything is safe,” he said, and encouraged attendees to wear masks. Officials, residents and civil rights activists have called on Nynum to cancel the rally at the BOK Center in Tulsa, which as a 19,000-seat capacity — warning the event could not only cause the coronavirus to spread, but also inflame racial tensions. Bynum said that the company managing the venue has “sole discretion” over hosting the event. “The president chose this city, and so it falls on us,” Bynum said. “And it is an honor.” Several nooses were found hanging on trees in Oakland, California, the latest in a spate of racist, anti-black related crimes under investigation across the state. Police are investigating the nooses as a hate crime. They were found in the Lake Merritt area, a popular outdoor space and neighborhood. “Symbols of racial violence have no place in Oakland and will not be tolerated,” Oakland’s mayor, Libby Schaaf, said in a statement. “We are all responsible for knowing the history and present day reality of lynchings, hate crimes and racial violence. Objects that invoke such terror will not be tolerated in Oakland’s public spaces.” Schaaf noted that there were some reports that the nooses might have been hung as part of exercise equipment, but that does not “remove nor excuse their torturous and terrorizing effects”. The discovery of the nooses comes on the heels of investigations into the hanging deaths of two black men in southern California. Robert Fuller, 24, was found dead hanging from a tree near Palmdale city hall in the early hours of 10 June. The county medical examiner initially labeled the preliminary cause of death as suicide pending a full autopsy, noting the lack of evidence of foul play. But following widespread outcry, the coroner deferred the decision and the Los Angeles county sheriff announced that the FBI and the state attorney general’s office will be monitoring the investigation. Ten days earlier, 38-year-old Malcolm Harsch was found dead hanging from a tree in front of the Victorville public library in San Bernardino county, about 50 miles away from where Fuller was found dead. Today is the fifth anniversary of the Charleston massacre when white supremacist Dylann Roof murdered nine people at Emanuel AME church. Despite a South Carolina law protecting monuments, officials in Charleston announced that they will remove a statute of John C Calhoun, a former vice-president and advocate for slavery. Mayor John Tecklenburg announced that he will send a resolution to the city council to have the statue taken down. To do so is “not to erase our long and often tragic history but to begin to write a new and more equitable future”, he said. Reverend Nelson Rivers said Calhoun “represents Dylann Roof to us”. “The time has come to not just acknowledge your racist evil wicked past. The time has come to take down the monuments that honor the evil that was done in the name of Charleston, in the name of South Carolina,” Rivers said on Tuesday. Hi there, this is Maanvi Singh on the west coast. Keisha Lance Bottoms, the Atlanta mayor, told The View that though she’s “encouraged” by Donald Trump’s executive order on police reform, “it’s hard to take him seriously in this moment.” Bottoms, who has found herself on a shortlist of contenders to be Joe Biden’s running mate, said he was disappointed that the president’s executive order didn’t address racial bias in policing. “We don’t have another minute to spare. We convened an advisory task force in Atlanta to look at our use of force policies, and not three days later, then Rayshard Brooks was killed in Atlanta,” she said. “We don’t have time for the theatrics. We’ve gotta have action right now and we needed it yesterday.” It’s been a very busy afternoon in US politics and there will be more to come when Maanvi Singh takes over from the west coast for the next few hours. Here’s what happened this afternoon: Joe Biden accused Donald Trump of surrendering the fight against coronavirus in the US, with the nation rushing to reopen as the president encourages it, despite cases rising in news hotspots across several states. The white Atlanta police officer who shot Rayshard Brooks, who is black, was charged with murder this afternoon in the man’s killing. In his upcoming book, former national security adviser John Bolton reportedly argues Trump should have been impeached for more than just the Ukraine controversy, claiming the president tried to halt criminal investigations as “personal favors” to dictators. Officials in Tulsa, Oklahoma, worry that the president’s plan to hold a huge political indoor rally in the city on Saturday will inflame racial tensions and put people at risk of catching coronavirus. Some have urged Trump to postpone the event. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, on Wednesday laced into Donald Trump over his handling of the coronavirus, accusing him of “surrendering the fight” against the Covid-19 outbreak as more than a dozen US states experience sharp rises in reported cases. “He’s waived a white flag, and has retreated,” Biden said. He accused the administration of “engaging in self-congratulations” when the number of deaths each month still exceeds the number of war dead in World War II. “Just like he couldn’t wish Covid-19 away in March, just like he couldn’t tweet it away in April, he can’t ignore it away in June,” Biden said. “Mr President, wake up. Get to work,” he said in closing. “There’s so much more to be done.” Biden began his remarks by marking the fifth anniversary of the Charleston massacre, when a white supremecist murdered nine black parishioners as they prayed. Biden, who was vice president at the time, said he continues to marvel at their “amazing grace” and capacity to forgive the perpetrator of what he called a “poisonous expression of white supremacy that still infects our nation and many of our institutions.” But, acknowledging the ongoing protests against racism and police brutality, he said “grace alone is not enough.” The New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, announced that the city is launching an online database that will let New Yorkers track disciplinary cases against police officers accused of excessive force and other violations and view their administrative records. The New York police department will also adopt tighter deadlines to speed up the disciplinary process, the mayor said, according to the latest from the Associated Press. The reforms are meant to bring more transparency to a system long criticized for being too secretive and plagued by lengthy delays in holding police officers accountable for misconduct. “We have to know that if something’s done right, it will be recognized and when something’s done wrong, it will be acted on,” De Blasio said. “When people know that, that’s what helps them have greater faith.” He added: “I want everything we have to be put on online.” The move drew a swift rebuke from the head of the Police Benevolent Association, the city’s largest police union, who said it undermines privacy protections. Lynch also labeled the measures to expedite cases “arbitrary” and vulnerable to predetermined outcomes driven by politics. The announcement from De Blasio, who ran for the Democratic nomination for president in the 2020 election, but did not prevail, follows decisions in recent days to make officers’ body-camera footage more widely available and to disband a plainclothes anti-crime unit that critics said was too aggressive. Last week, state governor Andrew Cuomo also signed legislation barring the NYPD and other police departments in the state from keeping the public in the dark about disciplinary records. Donald Trump set out a plan on Wednesday aimed at helping to prevent suicides by US military veterans, which he described as a “tremendous problem”. “Ending the tragedy of veteran suicide demands bold action at every level of society,” the president said in the east room of the White House. “Twenty veterans and service members take their own lives every single day. The loss of our heroes breaks our hearts and pains our souls.” Trump announced 10 recommendations, including providing suicide prevention training and enhancing research, and a public health awareness campaign led by Second Lady Karen Pence, who said: “We’re all dealing with anxiety. We’re all dealing with stress right now so, if I can do anything as lead ambassador, it’s my goal to help take away the stigma of mental health.” The initiative is called The President’s Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide, or PREVENTS, and had been delayed for three months by the coronavirus pandemic. Although Trump stayed mostly on-script, he could not resist a swipe at his predecessor, Barack Obama, and his 2020 election rival, Joe Biden. “After years of shameful scandal and neglect under the Obama-Biden administration, and scandal and neglect it was, we have fundamentally reorganised the VA [Department of Veterans Affairs] from top to bottom,” he said. The remarks occurred at the same time as a speech by Biden in Pennsylvania. All three major cable news networks – CNN, Fox News and MSNBC – gave live coverage to the former vice president instead of Trump. The president’s relationship with the military has been strained by his aggressive reaction to the protests against racial injustice in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Fulton county district attorney Paul Howard revealed that Atlanta police officer Garrett Rolfe knew the taser Rayshard Brooks took from him was not functional. The taser had already been fired twice and thus was of no use when Rolfe shot Brooks twice in the back as he was running away. The detail underscores that Rolfe was aware he was in no physical danger when he fatally shot Brooks. Cameras also captured Rolfe kicking Brooks as he was on the ground struggling for his life. Devin Brosnan, the other Atlanta police officer involved in the killing of Rayshard Brooks, is facing three charges, including aggravated assault and violation of oath. The aggravated assault charge is in connection to Brosnan standing on Brooks’ shoulders after he was shot twice in the back by officer Garrett Rolfe. Fulton county district attorney Paul Howard said Brosnan is cooperating with his office and is willing to testify against Rolfe. Howard has asked the two officers to surrender themselves by 6 pm tomorrow. He said he would recommend no bond for Rolfe. Fulton county district attorney Paul Howard said Atlanta police officer Garrett Rolfe is facing 11 charges in connection to the death of Rayshard Brooks, including felony murder. Some of the other charges against Rolfe include three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, criminal damage to property, violation of oath and aggravated assault for kicking Brooks’ body after he was shot. Fulton county district attorney Paul Howard has announced an Atlanta police officer has been charged with felony murder in connection to the death of Rayshard Brooks. Howard previously said his office was today issuing arrest warrants for the two officers involved in the killing of Brooks. Fulton county district attorney Paul Howard said his office has concluded Rayshard Brooks was running away when a police officer shot him twice in the back. “We have concluded at the time Mr Brooks was shot that he did not pose an immediate threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or officers,” Howard said. Fulton county district attorney Paul Howard said the two officers involved in the killing of Rayshard Brooks continued to injure him after he was shot. Howard said one officer kicked Brooks and the other stood on his shoulders as he lay on the ground struggling for his life. Fulton county district attorney Paul Howard said Rayshard Brooks cooperated with officers’ instructions for more than 40 minutes before he was fatally shot. Howard also noted Brooks was not told he was being arrested for driving under the influence, as police officers are required to do. “Mr Brooks never presented himself as a threat,” Howard said, adding that Brooks did not display “any aggressive behavior.” Fulton county district attorney Paul Howard has announced he will be issuing arrest warrants in connection to the police killing of Rayshard Brooks. “We have decided to issue warrants in this case today,” Howard said at a press conference in Atlanta. Brooks was shot in the back while running away from police officers on Friday night, prompting outcry in the city and across the country. John Bolton’s allegation that Donald Trump asked Xi Jinping to help him win his re-election campaign, reported by the Washington Post, flies in the face of Trump’s anti-China campaign rhetoric. Trump’s reelection campaign is currently running hundreds of ads attacking his Democratic rival Joe Biden as being too soft on China. The ads variously portray Biden as a puppet of Xi, hugging China, and wearing a red hat with the slogan “Make China Great Again”. Video spots reference the Chinese origins of the coronavirus pandemic and appear designed to invoke xenophobia, fear, and anger at Chinese trade policies. During a meeting with Xi in June 2019, Trump “turned the conversation to the coming US presidential election, alluding to China’s economic capability to affect the ongoing campaigns, pleading with Xi to ensure he’d win”, Bolton writes in his book, according to the Washington Post. “He stressed the importance of farmers, and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome. I would print Trump’s exact words but the government’s prepublication review process has decided otherwise.” In a book excerpt provided to the Wall Street Journal, John Bolton claims Trump “nodded apporvingly” when Chinese President Xi Jinping suggested the US held “too many elections.” Bolton writes: In Buenos Aires on Dec. 1, at dinner, Xi began by telling Trump how wonderful he was, laying it on thick. Xi read steadily through note cards, doubtless all of it hashed out arduously in advance. Trump ad-libbed, with no one on the U.S. side knowing what he would say from one minute to the next. One highlight came when Xi said he wanted to work with Trump for six more years, and Trump replied that people were saying that the two-term constitutional limit on presidents should be repealed for him. Xi said the U.S. had too many elections, because he didn’t want to switch away from Trump, who nodded approvingly. The Wall Street Journal has published an excerpt from John Bolton’s upcoming book, which includes a claim that Trump encouraged the Chinese president to continue building concentration camps for the country’s Uighur citizens. Bolton writes in the excerpt for the Journal: At the opening dinner of the Osaka G-20 meeting in June 2019, with only interpreters present, Xi [Jinping] had explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do. The National Security Council’s top Asia staffer, Matthew Pottinger, told me that Trump said something very similar during his November 2017 trip to China. Up to 1 million Uighur citizens have disappeared into Chinese re-education camps, prompting outcry from human rights groups. Beijing has claimed the camps are meant to stamp out extremism. The Washington Post has also obtained a copy of John Bolton’s book, in which the former national security adviser reportedly claims Trump asked Chinese President Xi Jinping for help in winning reelection. The Post reports: During a one-on-one meeting at the June 2019 Group of 20 summit in Japan, Xi complained to Trump about China critics in the United States. But Bolton writes in a book scheduled to be released next week that ‘Trump immediately assumed Xi meant the Democrats. Trump said approvingly that there was great hostility among the Democrats. ‘He then, stunningly, turned the conversation to the coming U.S. presidential election, alluding to China’s economic capability to affect the ongoing campaigns, pleading with Xi to ensure he’d win,’ Bolton writes. ‘He stressed the importance of farmers, and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome. I would print Trump’s exact words but the government’s prepublication review process has decided otherwise.’ That last sentence is particularly noteworthy, considering the Trump administration is claiming Bolton’s book cannot be released because it contains classified information. The administration also alleged Bolton backed out of a review process for the book, but Bolton’s lawyer has accused the White House of exploiting the standard review process in an effort to prevent the publication of unflattering anecdotes about the president. John Bolton reportedly accuses House Democrats of committing “impeachment malpractice” by focusing solely on the Ukraine controversy in their inquiry against Trump in his upcoming book. The New York Times reports: The book confirms House testimony that Mr. Bolton was wary all along of the president’s actions with regard to Ukraine and that Mr. Trump explicitly linked the security aid to investigations involving [Joe] Biden and Hillary Clinton. ... Mr. Bolton, however, had nothing for scorn for the House Democrats who impeached Mr. Trump, saying they committed ‘impeachment malpractice’ by limiting their inquiry to the Ukraine matter and moving too quickly for their own political reasons. Instead, he said they should have also looked at how Mr. Trump was willing to intervene in investigations into companies like Turkey’s Halkbank to curry favor with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey or China’s ZTE to favor President Xi Jinping. Mr. Bolton also recounts a discussion at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Osaka, Japan, last summer at which the president overtly linked policy to his own political fortunes as he asked Mr. Xi to buy a lot of American agricultural products to help him win farm states in this year’s election. Mr. Trump, he writes, was ‘pleading with Xi to ensure he’d win. He stressed the importance of farmers, and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome.’ According to the New York Times, John Bolton’s book includes numerous unflattering anecdotes about Trump and recounts episodes of senior aides mocking the president. The Times reports: It is a withering portrait of a president ignorant of even basic facts about the world, susceptible to transparent flattery by authoritarian leaders manipulating him and prone to false statements, foul-mouthed eruptions and snap decisions that aides try to manage or reverse. Mr. Trump did not seem to know, for example, that Britain is a nuclear power and asked if Finland is part of Russia, Mr. Bolton writes. He came closer to withdrawing the United States from NATO than previously known. Even top advisers who position themselves as unswervingly loyal mock him behind his back. During Mr. Trump’s 2018 meeting with North Korea’s leader, according to the book, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo slipped Mr. Bolton a note disparaging the president, saying, ‘He is so full of shit.’ That closing anecdote could cause trouble for Pompeo, considering the president is notoriously sensitive to any indication that his advisers are criticizing or mocking him. In his upcoming book, former national security adviser John Bolton reportedly argues Trump should have been impeached for more than just the Ukraine controversy, claiming the president tried to halt criminal investigations as “personal favors” to dictators. The New York Times reports: Mr. Bolton describes several episodes where the president expressed willingness to halt criminal investigations ‘to, in effect, give personal favors to dictators he liked,’ citing cases involving major firms in China and Turkey. ‘The pattern looked like obstruction of justice as a way of life, which we couldn’t accept,’ Mr. Bolton writes, adding that he reported his concerns to Attorney General William P. Barr. The book is set to be published next week, but the administration has filed a civil lawsuit against Bolton in an effort to block the book’s release. In addition to the health concerns, Tulsa rallies have expressed fear that Trump’s Saturday campaign rally will worsen racial unrest in the city. Reuters reports: In Tulsa, officials said they were worried the rally would set the stage for potential clashes between Trump supporters and protesters who may try to crash the event to argue the Republican president has failed to address racial injustice or police brutality against African Americans. The president has repeatedly criticized those protesting the police killing of George Floyd, calling the demonstrators “thugs” and suggesting some of them were just “following the crowd.” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has just concluded her briefing, during which she was pressed on the Trump campaign’s decision to move ahead with its Tulsa rally this weekend. As McEnany was speaking, Tulsa’s mayor held a press conference about the upcoming rally, and a senior city health official said he believed the event should be postponed out of concern about the spread of coronavirus. “I recommended it be postponed until it’s safer,” said Dr Bruce Dart, the executive director of the Tulsa health department. “We’re concerned.” But McEnany dismissed reporters’ questions about the safety of the rally, accusing the press of a double standard when it comes to covering large events. She said news reports have not highlighted health concerns about the recent protests against police brutality, although such events are outdoors and thus pose a lower risk of coronavirus spread, according to health experts. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the administration’s civil lawsuit against John Bolton over his upcoming book. McEnany claimed Bolton’s book is “full of classified information,” saying the former national security adviser “should know all too well that it is unacceptable to have highly classified information from the government of the United States in a book that will be published.” The publisher of Bolton’s book, Simon &amp; Schuster, has said the lawsuit “is nothing more than the latest in a long-running series of efforts by the Administration to quash publication of a book it deems unflattering to the president.” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the Trump campaign’s decision to move forward with a rally planned for this weekend, despite concerns about the spread of coronavirus. McEnany accused the press of having a double standard when it comes to large events, noting recent protests against police brutality have also drawn many participants. She held up a copy of the New York Post comparing the two events to underscore her point. Many commentators have argued protests against racism should not be compared to a political rally. It’s also worth noting that the protests have largely been outdoors, while the rally would be indoors. Public health experts have said indoor events are more susceptible to the spread of coronavirus. McEnany was then pressed on why rally attendees have been asked to sign waivers absolving the Trump campaign of any liability from coronavirus. “As with any event, you assume a personal risk,” McEnany said. “That’s part of life.” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the president supports Republican senator Tim Scott’s newly unveiled bill on police reform. “We fully support the Scott bill and every element of it,” McEnany said during her briefing. The press secretary claimed Democrats have offered “zero, nothing” on policing reform, even though House Democratic leadership has also released a police reform bill. The House intends to vote on the measure next week, and the bill is expected to pass the chamber, considering it already has enough co-sponsors to secure its approval. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany is holding a briefing, and she criticized congressional Democrats for alleged inaction on police reform. “They’ve engaged in meaningless symbolism, as we saw them kneeling for minutes on end,” McEnany said. That was a reference to congressional Democrats recently kneeling for eight minutes and 46 seconds in the Capitol, in recognition of the eight minutes and 46 seconds that a white Minneapolis police officer had a knee on George Floyd’s neck. “This president isn’t about symbols or gestures,” McEnany said. Trump has also repeatedly criticized professional football players for kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality. The White House is reportedly revisiting the idea of renaming military bases named after Confederate generals, which the president previously ruled out. NBC News reports: Conversations among White House officials in recent days about renaming the bases have been spurred by a growing recognition in the West Wing that the names of the bases will eventually be changed — with or without Trump’s backing — given widespread support for the idea and the momentum it has gained in Congress even among lawmakers from the president’s own party. So White House officials are debating whether Trump should support a process for renaming them in order for him to have a say in who they are named after, officials said. The officials said Trump is aware the conversations are taking place. Trump previously said he would “not even consider” renaming the bases, but an amendment laying out a plan to rename the bases within three years has been added to the annual defense authorization act. If the amendment remains in the final version of the bill, which seems likely, Trump would have to veto the defense legislation to block the renaming proposal. Such a move would likely spark criticism from members of both parties, considering the bill also includes a number of spending provisions that are popular with the Pentagon. Here’s where the day stands so far: Senate Republicans unveiled their police reform bill. The bill would incentivize police departments to ban chokeholds and increase reporting of use of force. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the chamber would vote on the bill next week. Democrats criticized the Senate bill, saying the legislation did not go far enough to hold police officers accountable for misconduct. They noted House Democrats’ police reform bill specifically bans chokeholds and no-knock warrants, rather than incentivizing departments to do so. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is signing an executive order to make Juneteenth a holiday for state employees. Cuomo said he hopes to introduce legislation to make Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery in America, an official state holiday next year. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway defended the lawsuit against John Bolton, after the Trump administration claimed the former national security adviser’s upcoming book was “rife with classified information.” “It’s kind of remarkable to have a book be published while people are still in office,” Conway told reporters at the White House, even though a number of former Trump advisers have already published books about their time working for the president. The senior adviser mockingly said to the journalists, “It is actually precious and adorable, how pro-John Bolton you all are now. It’s really cute.” Conway argued Bolton’s book represented a threat to the presidency itself and to national security. “I would just think that it’s very important to the nation’s security, not even the president himself, but for the presidency itself and the nation’s security to make sure the review processes have been completed,” Conway said. The publisher of Bolton’s book, Simon &amp; Schuster, has said the lawsuit “is nothing more than the latest in a long-running series of efforts by the Administration to quash publication of a book it deems unflattering to the president”. New York governor Andrew Cuomo made another noteworthy announcement during his coronavirus briefing: he is ending the daily briefings this Friday. “These daily briefings, while fun, take a lot of time,” the Democratic governor told reporters. “And I’m going to finish the daily briefings on Friday.” Cuomo has held more than 100 daily briefings since the state’s coronavirus crisis started. The briefings made the New York governor one of the most recognizable faces of the US response to the pandemic. Cuomo noted that 17 New Yorkers died of coronavirus yesterday, the lowest number since the start of the crisis. Overall, the state has lost more than 24,000 people to the virus. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is signing an executive order to make Juneteenth a holiday for state employees, he announced at his daily coronavirus briefing today. The Democratic governor also said he hoped to introduce legislation to make Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery in America, an official state holiday next year. Cuomo’s announcement comes one day after Virginia governor Ralph Northam announced he would also be proposing legislation to make Juneteenth a state holiday. The June 19 holiday has attracted more attention this year because of the George Floyd protests and Trump’s initial decision to hold his first campaign rally in more than three months on Juneteenth. The president later decided to delay the rally until June 20. House Democrats are criticizing Senate Republicans’ police reform bill for not explicitly banning controversial policing practices like chokeholds. “If they really wanted to get rid of chokeholds, they’d just ban chokeholds,” Democratic congressman Gerry Connolly said in a tweet. “Our bill does it. It’s not that complicated.” House Democrats’ police reform bill bans both police chokeholds and no-knock warrants, but Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has crticized the legislation as overreaching. This MSNBC graphic summarizes some of the major differences between the House and Senate bills on police reform: One of the most substantial differences is that the House bill explictly bans certain policing practices, such as chokeholds and no-knock warrants. The Senate bill, on the other hand, incentivizes police departments to ban such practices through the distribution of federal funds. Democrats have said the Republican bill, as well as the executive order signed by Trump yesterday, do not go far enough to address officers’ misconduct. Meanwhile, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has said Democrats are trying to “federalize” policing and has made clear that the House bill has no future in the Senate. Those arguments foreshadow what a difficult task it will be for the two parties to negotiate on police reform and try to get a bill approved by both chambers. The Guardian’s Sam Levine provides an update on a controversial voter fraud case in Texas: Crystal Mason, the Texas woman sentenced to five years in prison for illegally voting even though she didn’t know she was ineligible, is asking a state appeals court to reconsider a March ruling upholding her punishment. In March, a 3-judge panel for Texas’ 2nd court of appeals unanimously upheld that sentence, writing that whether or not Mason knew she was ineligible to vote was irrelevant to whether she was guilty of a crime. In a June 1 filing, Mason’s attorneys asked the full court to reconsider the ruling. They argued Mason technically did not vote because her provisional ballot was rejected and that any ambiguity in the law should be seen in her favor. They also noted the March ruling could be used as a basis to prosecute thousands of Texans in upcoming elections. Federal law requires election officials to offer anyone unsure of their voter eligibility a provisional ballot at the polls. Any voter who casts a ballot in good faith but turns out to be ineligible could be prosecuted under the court’s reasoning, Mason’s lawyers wrote. More than 11,000 provisional ballots have been rejected in Mason’s county since 2014. Mason’s case has drawn national attention because of the severity of her sentence. Mason cast a provisional ballot in the 2016 presidential election while she was on supervised release, which is like probation, from a federal felony related to inflating tax returns (Texas does not allow people convicted of felonies to vote until they have entirely finished their sentences). She has always maintained she didn’t know she couldn’t vote and only cast a provisional ballot when poll workers offered her one after they couldn’t find her on the rolls. Election officials never counted her provisional ballot, but in 2018 she was convicted of illegally voting anyway. The appeals court on Tuesday asked Texas to respond to Mason’s request by June 26. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy praised senator Tim Scott’s police reform bill, saying the legislation would improve relationships between “hardworking cops” and the communities they serve. McCarthy has complained that Democratic leaders have blocked Republicans from negotiations over the House police reform bill, but the Democrats already have enough co-sponsors to pass the legislation. At Senate Republicans’ press conference today, Scott noted there were a number of overlaps between the Senate and House bills. However, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has already said Scott’s bill does not go far enough to address police misconduct. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer sharply criticized Republicans’ police reform bill, but he appeared to leave the door open to debating the measure next week. Democrats hold 47 seats in the Senate, which would be enough to block the motion to proceed on the legislation if they are unified in opposition to taking up the bill. Senator Tim Scott said at Senate Republicans’ press conference today, “If we don’t have the votes on a motion to proceed, that means that politics is more important than restoring confidence in communities of color in the institutions of authority.” Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is already criticizing Republicans’ police reform bill, saying the legislation does not include meaningful changes to address misconduct. “We’ve only had the bill for a few hours and are reviewing it,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “But what’s clear is that the Senate Republican proposal on policing does not rise to the moment.” The New York Democrat said the bill’s “greatest flaw” was that it is “missing real, meaningful accountability for individual officers’ misconduct.” “This bill will need dramatic improvement,” Schumer said. Democrats have called for banning qualified immunity so that police officers can be held accountable for misconduct in civil court, but Republican senator Tim Scott described that proposal as a “poison pill.” Senator Tim Scott noted there were overlaps between his police reform bill and House Democrats’ bill, particularly on issues like the duty to intervene and police chokeholds. “The legislation is already bipartisan,” the Republican senator said of his bill. “The question is, can we get bipartisan support?” Scott added moments later, “If we don’t have the votes on a motion to proceed, that means that politics is more important than restoring confidence in communities of color in the institutions of authority.” A reporter noted Republicans have not been using the word “systemic racism” to describe the problem with policing, as many Democrats have. She asked if that would impede negotiations between the two parties. Scott, the only black Republican in the senator, emphasized the two bills shared many similarities and added, “We’re not a racist county. We deal with racism because there’s racism in the country.” Senator Tim Scott took several reporters’ questions about his police reform bill. Asked if he was worried about the effort losing momentum if it is not passed next week, Scott said, “I don’t think the nation is going to allow us to lose the momentum.” The Republican senator added he hoped Trump would support the bill as well. “I hope the president will join forces and jump on board,” Scott said. Scott noted Trump was “the most presidential I’ve seen him” yesterday, as he met with families who had lost loved ones to police brutality. Republican congressman Pete Stauber, a former police officer, will lead the effort on the House side to get senator Tim Scott’s police reform bill passed. While introducing Stauber at the press conference, Scott noted Stauber had been shot in the head on the job in 1995. Stauber said he was “devastated” by the video of George Floyd’s last moments, which showed a white police officer kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes. “What I saw in that video goes against everything I stood for as a police officer,” Stauber said. “George Floyd’s life mattered. And the best way to honor his memory is by enacting meaningful and lasting change within policing.” Republican senator Shelley Moore Capito said Tim Scott’s police reform bill represented an opportunity to be “pro-civil rights and pro-law enforcement.” One of their Republican colleagues, Ben Sasse, added that the legislation would “restore and build more public trust” between law enforcement and communities of color. Sasse also said the bill was an opportunity to use technology to address the issue of police brutality, noting officers are already being held more accountable thanks to cell phones. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has confirmed the chamber will vote on senator Tim Scott’s police reform bill next week. The House will also vote on Democrats’ police reform bill next week, but McConnell has said that bill is a non-starter in the Senate. “We’re serious about making a law here,” McConnell said. “This is about coming together and getting an outcome.” There are some similarities between the two police reform bills, but the House bill is much more sweeping than the Senate version. Senate Republicans are holding a press conference to unveil their police reform bill in response to the police killing of George Floyd. Senator Tim Scott, who led the group who crafted the bill, said Americans are too often asked to choose between supporting the police and supporting communities of color. “This is a false, binary choice,” Scott said. “If you support America, you support restroring the confidence that communities of color have in instiutions of authority.” Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, later added, “We believe that the overwhelming number of officers in this nation are good people.” A one-page summary distributed to reporters showed the bill would call for reporting use of force and no-knock warrants, de-escalation training and incentivizing chokehold bans. This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Belam. A Tulsa judge has denied a request to block the Trump campaign from holding a campaign rally this Friday, despite concerns that the large indoor event could intensify the spread of coronavirus. Some of Tulsa’s residents and businessowners had asked Judge Rebecca Nightingale to intervene in order “to protect against a substantial, imminent, and deadly risk to the community,” but she declined to do so. Many Democratic lawmakers and public health experts have expressed concern about holding the rally in the 19,000-seat BOK Center, but the Trump campaign appears determined to move forward. Even Tulsa’s Republican mayor has expressed some concerns about the rally. “Do I share anxiety about having a full house at the BOK Center? Of course,” mayor GT Bynum said in a statement last night. “As someone who is cautious by nature, I don’t like to be the first to try anything. I would have loved some other city to have proven the safety of such an event already.” In England, soccer is re-starting today, playing in front of empty stands due to coronavirus restrictions. Some teams are filling the grounds with cardboard cut-outs of fans and celebrities so it doesn’t look so bleak. Donald Trump is expected to feature in the crowd at a match due to be played in Cheltenham on Monday night - possibly the only match he’ll be seen at for some time since he has said he will no longer watch domestic matches after US Soccer repealed rule requiring players to stand for anthem. Shaquille O’Neal is also among those whose presence will be felt in the crowds in England. Players in the country’s top division, the Premier League, will have their names on their shirts replaced with the slogan Black Lives Matter for one round of games. London-based side Tottenham Hotspur just posted a picture of their squad taking the knee before the re-opening matches. Ferguson has been at the heart of Black Lives Matter protests since it was thrust into the national spotlight after the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in 2014. Last night the town swore in its first ever African American Mayor, Ella Jones. Jones, 65, was sworn in at City Hall Tuesday night, and a second ceremony is planned for Wednesday at the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis office in Ferguson. She won the three-year mayoralty in an election on 2 June. Term limit rules prohibited the incumbent, James Knowles III, from seeking a fourth term. Jones wore a face-mask at the ceremony - Missouri has suffered around 900 deaths from Covid-19 during the coronavirus outbreak. It is being reported that the wife of Rep. Andy Barr from Kentucky, Eleanor Carol Leavell Barr, passed away unexpectedly in the family’s home in Lexington Tuesday night at the age of 39. The Fayette County coroner was called to the family’s home following the announcement of her passing, WKYT-TV reported. “During this tragic time, we respectfully ask for privacy for Congressman Barr and his family to grieve Mrs. Barr being called home to heaven,” the statement added. “Congressman Barr may release a more detailed statement at a later date, but right now is solely focused on being a father to his two beautiful daughters.” US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement he and his wife are “stunned and heartbroken” by the news, and send their “sincere condolences to Andy, their family and his staff at this terribly painful time.” Condolences for her passing flowed in through the night from other Kentucky politicians, including Gov. Andy Beshear and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul. Barr, who went by Carol, grew up in the state, and went on to attend the University of Kentucky, news outlets reported. She married Andy Barr in 2008 and the couple went on to have two children. She had worked for Pfizer, and as the executive director of Lexington’s Henry Clay Center for Statesmanship. My colleague Amanda Holpuch in New York has been looking ahead to Friday’s Juneteenth anniversary, which, coming directly after weeks of protests, anger and grief over the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police, are sure to be more emotionally charged than ever. She observes that this will be especially true in Tulsa, where Donald Trump has scheduled a contentious rally for the following day. Local lawyers have been trying - and failing - to block the Trump rally on the grounds that it will not be adhering to anti-coronavirus measures. And local Black Lives Matters groups are also organising against the president’s provocatively visit to a state which he easily carried in 2016 and appears in no danger of losing this time around.

It’s the third Confederate statue, and the fourth monument, to be torn down in Virginia in recent days - Confederate president Jefferson Davis, Confederate General Williams Carter Wickham and a figure of Christopher Columbus have been toppled as well. The Howitzer monument showed a Confederate artilleryman standing in front of a gun. Meanwhile in New Orleans the whereabouts of a statue of a slave owner toppled by protesters and thrown into the Mississippi River remains unknown. A video has emerged which shows a group of men using ropes and a plank to carry the paint-splattered bust of John McDonogh out of the river and onto a pickup truck Sunday - but it hasn’t been seen since. Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s office told the local newspaper that the bust is “considered stolen property”. Activists have been demanding not just reforms to policing in the US, but a deep-seated change in police culture. A report this morning by Jesselyn Cook and Nick Robins-Early for the Huffington Post website illustrates exactly why some people see this as a necessary goal. They’ve been studying the places they describe as “the dangerous online fever swamps of American police”: This police media ecosystem is not necessarily a broad representation of what most cops believe. But inside this echo chamber, which has thousands of users and readers, extremist views dictate the narrative. Wild misinformation and bigotry are rampant, with people who claim to be current and former officers posting debunked falsehoods and racist stereotypes about protesters. Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate &amp; Extremism at California State University is quoted as saying “What I think we have here is a market for this kind of racist and divisive garbage across the internet, and unfortunately police are participating in that wave that is witnessed across various professions. It pains me as a former NYPD officer to see this. These posts are devastating.” Read it here: Huffington Post - Inside the dangerous online fever swamps of American police You might not have backed Nascar to be the sports organisation that has done the most in the last few weeks to respond to the wave of Black Live Matter protests across the country - but the sport has made several high profile moves aimed at improving its inclusivity. Andrew Lawrence has been speaking to Nascar’s Bubba Wallace for us about the changes which he has helped bring about in the sport, including a confederate flag ban and driving in a car marked #BlackLivesMatter. It’s a great little interview - and frank about how much work Nascar still has to do - including Wallace also talking about dealing with another driver who had tagged his car with “Back the Blue”. Read it here: ‘We’re fighting for change’: Bubba Wallace on Nascar and the Confederate flag Axios have what they are describing as a scoop this morning - the news that a group of prominent Republican operatives are launching a super PAC to turn out Republican voters in November - for Joe Biden. The report says that they will initially target voters in six battleground states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. They plan to emphasise Biden’s record on “free trade, states’ rights, federal spending and respecting US diplomatic and military alliances — and highlight his Catholic faith — to make the case that most anti-Trump Republicans can feel comfortable supporting him.” That might - of course - point out some of the reasons that the Bernie Sanders supporting left-wing of the Democrat party are a bit uncomfortable with Biden as their nominee. One of the people involved is Anthony Scaramucci. He is quoted as saying he is “very confident that we can convince a large group of Republican voters that Biden is the right person to vote for if they want to stay true to their principles and to the legacy of the Republican Party.” Time will tell if the super PAC are in it for the long haul, or another 10 day wonder like Scaramucci’s stint at the White House. Read it here: Axios - Republican operatives launch pro-Biden super PAC Coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter protests make 2020’s March primary campaigns seem like ancient history, but voting chaos is going to be a big theme for the November election. Politico this morning have a look at a report into why people had to queue for hours in California’s Super Tuesday primary on 3 March. About 15 percent of Los Angeles County voters who responded to a county survey reported waiting more than two hours to vote, and 10 percent said they waited longer than three hours, according to people who responded to a county survey. The report that has been quietly slipped out by Los Angeles County pins the blame on “malfunctions in the electronic tablets used to check in voters at the polls”. The delays were caused by some poll books taking hours to sync their voter lists with each other and with the countywide voter registration database, making them unusable during this time. The devices also had another problem: Poll workers were supposed to be able to look up voters’ records by name and address but were limited to name searches, producing hundreds of false positives in some cases that poll workers had to sift through. There was also a failure rate of around 5% in the electronic voting machines. None of the findings in the report give much confidence for November’s chances of a queue-free election.

They describe it as “the most ambitious GOP policing proposal in years”, although the 106-page bill is not as sweeping as the counter Democrat proposal, which is set for a House vote next week. The proposed Republican legislation would beef up requirements for law enforcement to compile use of force reports under a new George Floyd and Walter Scott Notification Act. It would also establish the Breonna Taylor Notification Act to track “no-knock” warrants. To focus on ending chokeholds, it encourages agencies to do away with the practice or risk losing federal funds. It also provides funding for training to “de-escalate” situations and establish a “duty to intervene” protocol to prevent excessive force. In efforts to gain Democrat support, it also includes a long-sought bill to make lynching a federal hate crime. South Carolina’s Senator Tim Scott is expected to formally unveil the plan later today. Good morning - welcome to our live coverage of US politics and the Black Lives Matter protests that continue across the nation. Here’s the key points from yesterday and overnight to get you started. Democrats and civil rights groups criticized Trump’s executive order on police reform. Critics said the order, which incentivizes police departments to review their use-of-force policies and ban chokeholds in most cases, does not go far enough to address police brutality. The Trump administration has sued to block the publication of former security adviser John Bolton’s book. The lawsuit alleges that Bolton has risked exposing classified information. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell signalled he would be comfortable with renaming military bases named after Confederate generals. Florida, Texas, Arizona reporting their biggest one-day rises in coronavirus cases. What are we expecting today? At 2pm, Trump announces the “Prevents” task force roadmap. The programme is aimed at improving mental health provision for veterans and tackling the high suicide rate among them. Joe Biden heads to Pennsylvania to meet with small business owners in Yeadon, and then will speak about the country’s economic reopening. In Congress, Republican Sen. Tim Scott is expected to unveil his policing bill. The House Judiciary Committee will mark up the Democratic policing proposal.

The Overseas Development Institute, which analysed the figures, found that 46% of Britain’s £6.1bn energy spending in developing countries between 2010 and 2014 went on oil, coal and gas-fired schemes, compared with 22% for renewable energy projects. Overall, fossil fuel support increased by nearly £1bn this decade compared with the previous five years, with a staggering 99.4% of UK export finance support directed towards “dirty” energy investments. Cafod called on the government to clarify how it would bring public support for overseas projects into line with climate commitments under the Paris agreement. Dr Sarah Wykes, Cafod’s lead energy analyst, said: “To tackle climate change we have to leave fossil fuels in the ground and switch rapidly to renewable sources of energy. “Yet the UK carrying on a business as usual spending pattern overseas in recent years suggests a huge inconsistency in policy and a missed opportunity to promote greater investment in renewable technologies, as the Department for International Development (DfID) has tried to do through its spending.” While UK export finance uses public funds to bolster British exports, DfID’s energy spending – 32% of which went to renewables compared with 22% for fossil fuels – is intended as overseas aid. The top five beneficiaries of UK energy support this decade were Brazil, Vietnam, Turkey, India and the Russian Federation, according to the ODI figures. Of the money earmarked for fossil fuels, oil and gas received a total of 87% of UK funds, with 9% going to coal. “It doesn’t make sense for there to still be any public money going into fossil fuels overseas, whether that’s through aid money, loans or export finance to support British companies operating overseas,” Wykes said. Aid agencies see support for small-scale solar and wind projects as vital for connecting poor communities in remote areas to electricity grids. But only 8% of British aid spending aimed to improve energy access for the poor, Cafod said, despite the UK having signed up to a UN sustainable goal of ensuring universal energy access for all by 2030. Twenty-nine per cent of UK energy aid in 2010-14 went to investments using fossil fuels and renewables, or where the energy source could not be identified. One per cent was spent on nuclear power and 2% on energy efficiency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/23/monday-briefing-ministers-knew-scale-of-windrush-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T05:13:05Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: Ministers 'knew scale of Windrush scandal'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/23/monday-briefing-ministers-knew-scale-of-windrush-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/23/monday-briefing-ministers-knew-scale-of-windrush-scandal","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: Ministers 'knew scale of Windrush scandal'","bodyText":"Top story: Rudd and May feel heat from immigration blunders Good morning briefers. This is Martin Farrer and I’ve got the top stories you need to start your week. The immigration scandal engulfing the government shows no sign of abating with the emergence of a letter written by a minister two years ago showing that the Home Office knew its policies were wrecking the lives of some of the Windrush generation. The letter written by then immigration minister James Brokenshire concerns the case of Trevor Johnson, who arrived in Britain as a boy from Jamaica in 1971 and has lived here ever since, but who now faces being deported. It was sent to the Labour MP Kate Hoey, who was seeking help for Johnson, her constituent. Amid calls for home secretary Amber Rudd to quit over the scandal, the justice secretary, David Gauke, said on Sunday the problems with the government’s “hostile environment” policy towards immigrants lay with poor implementation by officials rather than any flaws with the principles. However, the buck may not stop with Rudd because the architect of the policy was Theresa May when she was home secretary. The former Tory cabinet minister Sayeeda Warsi said on Sunday the cabinet had been deeply divided about the policy which has left some like Johnson without benefits or access to health services because they lack the paperwork to prove their residency. “I think we were all responsible,” she said. * * * Facebook ‘morally repugnant’ – Martin Lewis, the consumer champion and money-saving expert, is suing Facebook for allowing fake ads using his face and name. Lewis, who founded the consumer site MoneySavingExpert.com, said he has been used unwittingly to promote get-rich-quick schemes such as trading in bitcoins and is seeking exemplary damages from the social media company. Lewis said: “I get about five messages a day from people saying, ‘I’ve just seen your Bitcoin ad and wanted to check it’ ... [Facebook] is facilitating scams on a constant basis in a morally repugnant way.” * * * Fox hunt – The US court case involving Donald Trump’s embattled legal fixer Michael Cohen has cast new light on the property empire of rightwing Fox News presenter Sean Hannity. Thousands of pages of public records reviewed by the Guardian show that Hannity has spent at least $90m on more than 870 homes in seven states over the past decade. They also show, however, that Hannity acquired some of the properties with the help of the US housing department, a fact he did not disclose when praising the department’s boss, Ben Carson, on his television show last year. Hannity has also been criticised for using his show to defend Cohen and Trump without disclosing that he also consulted Cohen for legal services. * * * Union trouble – More woe for Theresa May, who could face a cabinet revolt if she crosses one of her Brexit red lines and accepts that Britain must remain in a customs union. As peers prepare to inflict more defeats on the government over the EU withdrawal bill, the prime minister’s position has been called into doubt by threats of a leadership challenge from her party’s pro-Brexit wing. Backing down on the customs union issue, which appears more likely after proposals to avoid the u-turn were rejected by Brussels, could trigger rebellions by leading Brexiters such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson. The former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan said the “sabre-rattling” from some in the party was “deeply unhelpful”. * * * Off key – The singer Shania Twain has apologised after saying in a Guardian interview that she would have voted for Donald Trump if she could have done so. The Canadian country star said she regretted her remarks, which were widely derided on social media. She added that the question about the US presidential election had “caught her off guard” and that she did not hold “any common moral beliefs” with Trump. * * * Amazon killing – A Canadian man has been lynched in the Peruvian Amazon after he was accused of killing an 81-year-old female shaman. Sebastian Woodroffe, 41, lived in the region and was believed to be a patient of Olivia Arévalo, an indigenous healer with the native Shipibo-Konibo people. She was shot dead on Thursday and local police said they believed villagers thought Woodroffe was responsible. Ronald Suárez, the highest authority of the 40,000-strong Shipibo-Konibo people, said the men responsible for the lynching had resorted to “traditional justice”. * * * All saints’ days – Today could become a bank holiday if Jeremy Corbyn wins the next election. It’s St George’s day, lest we forget, and the Labour leader will today announce plans to create four new bank holidays celebrating the patron saints of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland if he gets into No 10. He argues that we enjoy fewer bank holidays than any of our European counterparts and need more days off after years of Tory austerity. Under Labour’s proposals, UK-wide public holidays would be held on St David’s day (1 March), St Patrick’s day (17 March), St George’s day and St Andrew’s day (30 November). Lunchtime read: Women lead new band of eco warriors The fight against nuclear power, fossil fuels and industrial pollution gains a new roster of champions today as the world’s foremost environmental prize announces more female winners than ever before. The Latin American winner, for example, is Francia Márquez, who won a battle against mining companies poisoning rivers in Colombia with mercury and cyanide. Other winners include South African anti-nuclear activists Makoma Lekalakala and Liz McDaid, Vietnamese clean-energy advocate Nguy Thi Khanh, US clean-water defender LeeAnne Walters, and the one male winner is Philippine anti-lead campaigner Manny Calonzo. In Europe, the prize was won by French marine-life champion Claire Nouvian, whose bid to save the vampire squid from extinction led to a decade-long effort to outlaw deep-sea bottom trawling. Sport Arsène Wenger has admitted that supporters campaigning for the manager’s removal had created a “hurtful” atmosphere that was damaging Arsenal’s reputation on a worldwide scale. Before Sunday’s game against West Ham, the hope and, indeed, the expectation had been for an outpouring of affection, yet the afternoon was marked by much of the ambivalence and frustration that has characterised the Gunners’ season. Elsewhere, champions Manchester City celebrated their title success with a 5-0 demolition of Swansea City. Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah has been named as the Professional Footballers’ Association player of the year for the 2017-18 season, while Fran Kirby won the women’s award. And Gary Ballance sent Yorkshire to the verge of their first victory in 2018 against newly promoted Nottinghamshire with a calm knock of 82. Business Low interest rates mean the Bank of England won’t have the ammunition to deal with the next recession in the way that it tackled the global financial crisis a decade ago, according to the Institute for Public Policy Research.

Documents seen by the Guardian show Britain “is in non-compliance with its obligations” (page 21) to discuss the possible impact of any accident or other event that could affect those nations in proximity to Hinkley. This is just the latest in a string of problems connected with the planned £18bn project to construct new reactors in Somerset, with the developer EDF of France recently delaying a final investment decision until September. Paul Dorfman, a senior researcher at UCL’s energy institute, said the ruling from the UN Economic and Social Council throws great uncertainty over Hinkley. “This is a huge blow to the government and introduces a whole new element of doubt over the scheme. It is hard to see how EDF can sign off any final investment decision whilst the government has yet to resolve this important issue.” But the Department of Energy and Climate Change said it was convinced that the government had done all it had to do. “Compliance with international obligations is something we take very seriously,” said a spokesman. “We are confident that we have met the relevant international requirements in relation to Hinkley Point C. We have world-leading nuclear safety regulations in the UK, which Hinkley Point C would have to comply with.” The British courts have in the past ruled against An Taisce (the Irish National Trust) which tried to block Hinkley on the grounds of insufficient consultation over the same safety issues. Dorfman said he expected a new legal challenge using the UN ruling. The British government has been arguing for some years with continental countries inside the committee, saying in the past that it did not have to consult them because there was little or no likelihood of “significant transboundary environmental impacts”. But Austria in particular has said that there should have been consultation because of the possibility of a severe accident that could lead to radioactive materials being spread by wind across Europe. The Netherlands, Norway and Ireland have also argued they should have been consulted about Hinkley; the committee has finally agreed with them. It recommends the UK “enter into discussions with possibly affected parties, including parties that cannot exclude a significant adverse transboundary impact from the activity at HPC, in order to agree on whether notification is useful at the current stage.” Nuclear safety has been back in the public eye with the 30th anniversary of the Chernobyl accident last month and the recent fifth anniversary of the Fukushima crisis in March remembered. Hinkley is the first new atomic plant planned in the UK for two decades and is a flagship project promoted at the very highest level of government. But confidence has been undermined by a range of problems. Last week former EDF finance director Thomas Piquemal told a French parliamentary hearing that he had resigned in March because he believed Hinkley threatened the financial health of the energy company. “Who would bet 60 to 70% of his equity on a (European pressurised reactor) technology that has not yet proven that it can work and which takes 10 years to build,” he said. “In January 2015, I proposed to negotiate a three-year delay with our client because we reasoned that it would weigh too heavily on EDF’s balance sheet,” Piquemal said. Since Piquemal’s resignation, EDF has announced a €4bn (£3.2bn) capital increase and the government has agreed to forego cash dividends for two years, generating an estimated €7bn in extra capital. But while EDF has been coming up with plans to strengthen its capital, its even more financially troubled engineering partner, Areva, has run into deeper problems and its share price is now nearly 50% below where it was 12 months ago. The French nuclear regulator, ASN, said it had been informed by Areva that its investigation had found evidence of irregularities in about 400 components produced since 1965, of which some 50 are believed to be in use in French nuclear plants. Areva, which is in the middle of a merger with EDF, has already found faults at a new reactor it is constructing at Flamanville in Normandy. That scheme, like another at Olkiluoto in Finland, is using an EPR like the one planned for Hinkley and is both massively delayed and over budget."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/apr/03/switch-from-nuclear-to-coal-fired-power-linked-to-low-birth-weight-in-us-region-tennessee-valley","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-03T15:51:41Z","webTitle":"Switch from nuclear to coal-fired power linked to low birth weight in US region","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/03/switch-from-nuclear-to-coal-fired-power-linked-to-low-birth-weight-in-us-region-tennessee-valley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/apr/03/switch-from-nuclear-to-coal-fired-power-linked-to-low-birth-weight-in-us-region-tennessee-valley","fields":{"headline":"Switch from nuclear to coal-fired power linked to low birth weight in US region","bodyText":"Children in a region of the US were born smaller after the area switched from nuclear plants to coal-fired power stations, new research has found. The study looked at of the impact of nuclear power plant closures in the aftermath of the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania in 1979 – the most serious such accident in US history – in which one of the power station’s reactors underwent a partial meltdown. “At the time policymakers thought they were protecting public health by scrutinising nuclear power plants, given the partial meltdown that happened in Three Mile Island,” said Edson Severnini, author of the research from Carnegie Mellon University in the US. “But they didn’t anticipate this indirect effect that happened through the relocation of electricity generation from nuclear to coal.” While the study is based on a historical incident, experts say the results are pertinent given the shift from nuclear to coal power in Japan and Germany following the Fukushima accident in 2011, and the eagerness of the Trump administration to embrace coal. Writing in the journal Nature Energy, Severnini describes how he sought to analyse a so-called “natural experiment” whereby a number of nuclear power plants were closed following country-wide inspections carried out after the Three Mile Island accident. Among them were Browns Ferry and Sequoyah in the Tennessee Valley area: both remained closed for several years after they were shut down in 1985. The analysis of data from the US Energy Information Administration by Severnini reveals that the loss of nuclear energy following the two closures was made up almost entirely by an increase in energy production by coal-fired power plants in the Tennessee Valley area, although the increase varied across different plants. The result was that particle pollution increased in areas where coal use rose. Around the Paradise plant, which accounted for almost a quarter of the rise in coal-fired energy, concentration of particulates increased by 27% in the 18 months after the nuclear shutdown. At the same time average birth weight fell. After taking into account a host of factors relating to the child, county and mother, including her age and education levels – although smoking habits were not specifically probed – birth weight in areas with coal-fired plants declined by around 5.4% in the 18 months after the nuclear shutdown. The impact was greatest in the areas which showed the greatest boom in coal-fired power plant activity after closure of the two nuclear sites. With previous research suggesting that air pollution could affect both the health of pregnant women and their unborn babies, Severnini carried out further analysis of the data, revealing that the rise in air pollution appears to be linked to both lower growth of the foetus and premature births. What’s more, he adds, the impact on birth weight only appears to occur in babies born at least three months after the nuclear shutdown. “If the mother is exposed only in the last three months of pregnancy it could be that the formation of the foetus is already advanced and then the effects might be lower – which is what I find,” he said. But the impact, adds Severnini, goes further, with lower birth weights linked to lower incomes, shorter height and even a lower IQ: a drop of 5.4% in birth weight, he notes, suggests a 0.7% decrease in full-time earnings. Jonathan Griggs, professor of paediatric respiratory and environmental medicine at Queen Mary University of London, who was not involved in the research, said the study chimes with previous research showing the impact of air pollution and traffic on birth weight. “What makes it interesting is it is a natural experiment,” he said of the latest research. The study, he adds, could also have important implications for the US, with the Trump administration pledging to expand the coal industry. Marie Pederson from the Center of Epidemiology and Screening at the University of Copenhagen agreed. “I think we have enough evidence to say we should not shift to coal-burning power plants, and really it could be good to push for more clean energy sources, not only for birth weight but for many other outcomes also,” she said, pointing out that air pollution has been linked to respiratory diseases such as asthma as well as health problems in pregnant women, including hypertension and pre-eclampsia. While exactly how air pollution acts on the foetus is unclear and requires further research, said Griggs, but he added the latest findings are troubling. “If you have reduced organ development, both brain and other organs, our concern is that has a disproportionate effect over the whole lifespan,” he said. “What we want as clinicians, we want to maximise foetal development and anything that suppresses foetal development in any way is of concern.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2020/jan/14/democratic-debate-live-news-tonight-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-biden-latest-updates-2020","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2020-01-15T05:43:56Z","webTitle":"Democratic debate: Warren appears to reject handshake with Sanders after clash – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jan/14/democratic-debate-live-news-tonight-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-biden-latest-updates-2020","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2020/jan/14/democratic-debate-live-news-tonight-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-biden-latest-updates-2020","fields":{"headline":"Democratic debate: Warren appears to reject handshake with Sanders after clash – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s it from me tonight. Here are some of the biggest takeaways from the seventh Democratic debate, the final debate before the Iowa caucuses: Elizbaeth Warren and Bernie Sanders clashed over reports that Sanders told Warren a woman could not be elected president, which the Vermont senator denied. After the debate ended, Warren appeared to reject a handshake from Sanders, and the pair engaged in a seemingly contentious exchange that was not picked up by a microphone. Despite the post-debate drama, the night was largely notable for the lack of explosive moments. The candidates were mostly civil toward each other as they laid out their policy differences. The beginning of the debate was dominated by a foreign-policy discussion, as US-Iranian tensions escalate. The candidates outlined their visions for America’s future in the Middle East while largely warning against engaging in “endless wars”, but Sanders made a point to criticize Joe Biden for his 2002 vote in support of the Iraq war. The debate was notable for who was not on stage. Tonight’s event featured the smallest and whitest stage yet, a trend that has sparked criticism against the Democratic National Committee. The US politics live blog will be back tomorrow to cover the latest on the Senate impeachment trial. Thanks for following our live debate coverage from Iowa. Bernie Sanders’ campaign said the Vermont senator brought in $1.7m tonight, marking his strongest fundraising performance during a presidential debate yet. Sanders has outpaced his rivals in terms of fundraising, bringing in $34.5m during the final quarter of 2019 thanks to the strength of his grassroots support. The second-largest Democratic haul during that quarter belonged to Pete Buttigieg, who raised $24.7m. But Trump outraised all of the Democratic candidates with his $46m total for the quarter. Speaking to CBS News after the debate, Amy Klobuchar said she was opposed to proposed press limitations on Capitol Hill as the Senate advances toward an impeachment trial. Roll Call reported earlier today: The Senate sergeant-at-arms and Capitol Police are launching an unprecedented crackdown on the Capitol press corps for the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, following a standoff between the Capitol’s chief security officials, Senate Rules Chairman Roy Blunt and the standing committees of correspondents. Capitol Police Chief Steven A Sund and Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael C. Stenger will enact a plan that intends to protect senators and the chamber, but it also suggests that credentialed reporters and photographers whom senators interact with on a daily basis are considered a threat. Additional security screening and limited movement within the Capitol for reporters are two issues that are drawing criticism from Capitol Hill media. The Standing Committee of Correspondents, which represents journalists credentialed in the daily press galleries in the House and Senate, has come out forcefully against the planned restrictions that it says rejected every suggestion made by the correspondents ‘without an explanation of how the restrictions contribute to safety rather than simply limit coverage of the trial.’ Pressed again about what he overheard between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders after the debate, Tom Steyer said he tried to quickly move away from the contentious-looking exchange. “I felt like, OK, there’s something going on here. Goodnight, I’m out of here,” the billinoaire activist said. “It was one of those awkward moments where I felt like, OK, I need to move on as fast as possible.” The two progressive senators appeared to share tense words after Warren rejected Sanders’ handshake. Speaking to the Guardian’s Daniel Strauss in Des Moines, Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Bernie Sanders, pleaded ignorance on the words the Vermont senator exchanged with Elizabeth Warren after the debate concluded. Daniel Strauss: You don’t know what the two said? Because it looked like a heated exchange. Jeff Weaver: I don’t. I don’t. I saw what you saw. DS: I’ve watched a lot of debates, man. I’ve never seen that. JW: I watched what you watched. DS: What are you going to ask Senator Sanders about that? JW: “Hey Bernie, what was going on in that moment?” Weaver, who served as Sanders’ campagin manager in 2016, added, “Look, they’re friends, they respect each other. They’ve obviously had – it’s a political campaign and when you run in a political campaign, there’s disagreements, so that’s it.” For some, Warren’s refusal to shake hands with Sanders has delivered the most compelling moment of the night. It’s now one of the biggest topics of conversation around the debate happening online, with many calling on experts to decode the exchange: And already the jokes have started to roll in: After the conclusion of the seventh Democratic debate, Trump took to Twitter to criticize (perhaps surprisingly) Tom Steyer. The president reshared a tweet from the Republican National Committee highlighting the billionaire activist’s past financial ties to the fossil-fuel industry, echoing a question moderators posed earlier tonight about whether Steyer was the right messenger for combatting climate change. Steyer has spent nearly $20m on campaign ads so far, an investment that has helped catapult him into the top tier of candidates in the early-voting states of Nevada and South Carolina. But it’s perplexing why Trump lashed out against Steyer, when he spoke the least out of all the Democratic candidates on stage tonight. An AP photographer captured the awkward moment as Tom Steyer appeared to walk into a tense conversation between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The moment when Elizabeth Warren appeared to reject a handshake from Bernie Sanders at the end of the debate may have been the most contentious moment of the night. Depsite many commentators’ predictions that the candidates were headed for the most tense debate yet as they vied for Iowa voters’ affections, the night was generally calm as candidates laid out their policy differences. Amy Klobuchar, whose campaign rests on her performance in Iowa, attributed the candidates’ civility to the kind disposition of the state’s residents. After Elizabeth Warren was seen rejecting Bernie Sanders’ handshake after the debate, much of Twitter erupted with the same question: what did Tom Steyer hear? As the two progressive senators were seemingly engaged in a tense conversation, Steyer walked over to shake their hands and likely overheard some of their exchange. But it appears the billionaire activist is not going to be very forthcoming with any details on what he heard. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, the only African-American candidate left in the Democratic presidential primary, criticized the debate’s moderators for not asking the six white participants on stage tonight about racism. “Tonight, six Democrats were on the debate stage for over two hours,” Patrick said in a statement. “There were many good ideas from strong candidates, but there was not one question about racism in tonight’s debate. Not one. “Let’s face reality. Racism is not all there is to talk about, but when millions of Americans deal with it daily, encouraged by our president, when do we face their truths?” Despite his tension with Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders had the best hour of fundraising during any debate so far, according to the Vermont senator’s campaign. Here’s how long each candidate spoke for during tonight’s debate, according to the Washington Post: Here is the moment when Elizabeth Warren appeared to reject a handshake from Bernie Sanders after the debate concluded: As the candidates moved off stage following the conclusion of the debate, Elizabeth Warren appeared to reject a handshake from Bernie Sanders. The two then engaged in conversation before exiting the stage. The most tense moment of the night came when Sanders denied he told Warren a women could not be elected president, even though Warren substantiated reports indicating he had. Warren addressed the controversy by pointing out that she and the only other woman on stage, Amy Klobuchar, have a better record of electoral success than the male candidates participating tonight. Running about 10 minutes over, the seventh Democratic presidential debate has concluded in Des Moines, Iowa. The Guardian team will have more analysis and updates coming, so stay tuned. Pete Buttigieg said this election represented a unique opportunity to change the direction of the country and ensure average families can enjoy in the country’s economic success. Elizabeth Warren began her closing statement by listing some of the issues that were not discussed tonight, such as student-loan forgiveness and disability rights. But the Massachusetts senator said she came to the stage with “a heart filled with hope” for the future of the country. Bernie Sanders urged Democrats that this was their moment to “think big, not small” and “have the courage to take on the 1%”. Joe Biden began his closing statement by saying, “Character is on the ballot.” The former vice-president also warned another four years of Trump’s presidency would cause irreversible damage to the country. The debate has now moved on to closing statements, with each candidate getting one minute to deliver a final pitch for their campaign. Senator Amy Klobuchar went first, arguing her moderate message would help to bring the country together and end “the noise and the nonsense”. “It is easy to hurl insults,” Klobuchar said. “What is hard is bringing people together and finding common ground instead of scorched earth.” Tom Steyer asked Iowa caucusgoers to support his candidacy in order to “take back the country” and “save the world”. What’s happening over on Michael Bloomberg’s Twitter account at the moment? It’s been posting dozens of tweets over the last few hours, including gems such as this: Has his account been hacked? Is his team trying to get attention? Alarmingly, the answer seems to be that it’s all intentional, and that Bloomberg’s team are the ones behind it all: And shockingly, not everyone is into it: The debate was scheduled to end about two minutes ago, but CNN has now gone to a commercial break, guaranteeing the event will run long. Asked about how he would fare in a debate against Trump, Joe Biden said he was prepared to go toe-to-toe with the president. “I’ve been the object of his affection now more than anyone else on this stage,” the former vice-president said, prompting laughs from the debate audience. Biden argued average families were struggling under Trump’s administration while the wealthiest Americans flourished, and he pledged to press the president on those issues. Who’s winning the debate so far? Here’s a take from the New York Times’ Farhad Manjoo that’s hard to argue with: The debate moderators have repeatedly pressed billionaire activist Tom Steyer on his background, citing his past financial connections to fossil fuels and lack of government experience. After the moderators noted Steyer made his fortune in part thanks to fossil fuels, the presidential candidate responded by pointing out he has since become a harsh critic of the industry and made bold promises on the climate. On the issue of his lack of government experience, Steyer insisted his decades of international business experience had prepared him for the Oval Office. Pete Buttigieg was pressed on his lack of support among black voters, as the former Indiana mayor languishes near 0% in polls of African-Americans. Buttigieg has argued his support among black voters is low because they are not familiar with him, but CNN moderator Abby Phillip pushed back against that, noting Buttigieg has been running for president for a year now. Buttigieg insisted African-American leaders who know him best have backed him, citing his recent endorsement from congressman Anthony Brown. However, Brown is currently the only member of the Congressional Black Caucus to endorse Buttigieg. Over on Twitter some commentators aren’t happy with how uninspired the debate has been so far. The author and Guardian US contributor Matt Stoller has suggested the candidates take matters into their own hands: Meanwhile, others are keen to move on to the really key questions... As the Democratic debate continues in Iowa, revelations are still emerging from the new impeachment evidence that House Democrats released hours ago. The Washington Post reports: New materials released by House Democrats appear to show Ukraine’s top prosecutor offering an associate of President Trump’s personal attorney, Rudolph W Giuliani, damaging information related to former vice president Joe Biden if the Trump administration recalled the US ambassador to Ukraine. The text messages and documents provided to Congress by former Giuliani associate Lev Parnas also show that before the ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, was removed from her post, a Parnas associate now running for Congress sent menacing text messages suggesting that he had Yovanovitch under surveillance in Ukraine. A lawyer for Yovanovitch said Tuesday that the episode should be investigated. The cache of materials released by House investigators late Tuesday exposed a number of previously unknown details about efforts by Giuliani and his associates to obtain material in Ukraine that would undermine Trump’s Democratic opponents. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who will serve as a juror in Trump’s impeachment trial, was asked about how the trial would affect her ability to campaign in the final weeks before the Iowa caucuses. “Some things are more important than politics,” Warren said, adding that it was her “responsibility” to serve as a juror in the trial. The impeachment trial will likely keep Warren, as well as her Senate colleagues Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar, off the campaign trial during a key phase of the primary. The debate has turned to impeachment, with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asking Joe Biden whether he is worried Trump will be able to claim “vindication” if he is acquitted by the Senate. Biden asserted House speaker Nancy Pelosi had “no choice” but to transmit the articles of impeachment because Trump committed impeachable offenses, adding it was up to the Senate to decide whether to remove the president from office. Biden then slammed Trump for the “lies” he has told about his son Hunter’s business activities in Ukraine, while conceding it would be more difficult to unite the country in the wake of the impeachment trial. Amy Klobuchar, who will serve as a juror in the Senate trial, said Trump’s impeachment was serving as a “decency check” on the president. Laura Kelly, the governor of Kansas, has reacted to Amy Klobuchar’s shoutout from the debate stage. Earlier tonight, Klobuchar cited Kelly as an example of how women can win in traditionally red states. But there was an awkward moment when Klobuchar cited Kelly’s 2018 victory, as the Minnesota senator appeared to briefly blank on the Kansas governor’s name. Similar to previous debates, the questions from the moderators have been coming under heavy criticism. One of the most common complaints has been about the approach CNN has taken to questions about the cost of healthcare v the cost of war: Asked about the costs of childcare, Joe Biden recounted caring for his two sons after the deaths of his wife and daughter shortly after he was first elected as a senator in 1972. Biden said he understood the pain of not being able to afford childcare, and the former vice president vowed his administration would vastly increase funds for early education. Biden concluded his answer by lightly mocking his opponents: “My time is up, I know, but I’m not going to go over like everybody.” The debate has turned to the issue of childcare, as moderators took a question from an Iowa resident who was forced to exit the workforce because of high childcare costs. Pete Buttigieg said the costs of childcare pushing Americans out of the workforce made “no sense.” The former Indiana mayor pledged that, under his administration, childcare would not cost more than 7% of a family’s income. Meanwhile the Washington Post has been tracking who has talked the most so far in the debate: Joe Biden got in a jab against Pete Buttigieg after the former Indiana mayor claimed his healthcare plan represented “biggest thing we’ve achieved on healthcare in the last half century”. Biden argued the largest healthcare achievement in recent decades was the passage of the Affordable Care Act, again drawing attention back to his service as Barack Obama’s vice-president. Here’s the moment when all the tensions that have been building between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders this week came to a head. Warren was asked about media reports that Sanders had told her that a woman candidate couldn’t defeat Trump. Her reply? She pointed out a key difference between the men and women on stage: So far, so mild – but Warren then directly challenged Bernie in this awkward exchange: Echoing past debates, a divide developed on stage between those candidates supporting Medicare for All and those advocating for only an expansion of the Affordable Care Act. Amy Klobuchar criticized her Senate colleague, Bernie Sanders, for allegedly being evasive about how much his Medicare for All plan will cost the country. “I think you should show how you’re going to pay for something, Bernie,” Klobuchar said. Elizabeth Warren, who supports Medicare for All, then ackowledged that the healthcare plans proposed by Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg were “an improvement over where we are right now,” but she said their plans were only a “small improvement”. Buttigieg shot back, “It’s just not true that the plan I’m proposing is small.” The former Indiana mayor argued a proposal’s boldness should not be measured by its pricetag. After the first commercial break of the debate, Bernie Sanders had spoken more than any other candidate, taking up about twice as much time as Tom Steyer. Steyer was the last candidate to qualify for the debate with a pair of impressive polls from the early-voting states of Nevada and South Carolina, but the billionaire activist has largely drifted into the background so far. The Democratic debate has returned from a commercial break, and the conversation has turned to healthcare. Bernie Sanders defended his Medicare for All proposal, which he has centered his presidential campaign around. The moderators then turned to Joe Biden, who argued that Sanders and other candidates in favor of Medicare for All were underestimating the costs of switching to a single-payer system. “I think we need to be candid with voters,” Biden said. “I think we need to tell them what we’re going to do and what it’s going to cost.” Just before the Democratic debate went to a commercial break, Joe Biden echoed other candidates’ belief that a woman can win a presidential race. However, earlier this month, the former vice-president seemed to indicate he would outperform Hillary Clinton’s 2016 results because he would not be subjected to sexism. Biden said Clinton had been the victim of “unfair” sexist attacks before adding, “That’s not going to happen with me.” After Bernie Sanders denied he ever said that a woman cannot be elected president, CNN moderator Abby Phillip then cheekily asked Elizabeth Warren what she thought when Sanders expressed that view. “I disagreed,” Warren said. “Bernie is my friend, and I’m not here to fight with Bernie.” But the Massachusetts senator then noted she was the only person on stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican in 30 years. “Look at the men on this stage,” Warren said. “Collectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they’ve been in are the women. Amy and me,” referring to senator Amy Klobuchar. Responding to a report that he said a woman could not win the White House, Bernie Sanders denied ever expressing that view. “Well, as a matter of fact, I didn’t say it,” Sanders said. According to a CNN report, the Vermont senator told Elizabeth Warren that a woman could not win a presidential race during a private 2018 meeting. Sanders said it was “incomprehensible” that he would hold such a view, referring the debate audience to 30-year-old YouTube videos contradicting that opinion. Bernie Sanders stood by his opposition to the renegotiated North American trade deal, even though the agreement has been endorsed by the union federation AFL-CIO. Sanders argued the deal was opposed by many other labor groups and a number of environmental groups, indicating the agreement was still not good enough to support. Another senator on stage who supports the deal, Amy Klobuchar, then jumped in to say, “I want to hit reality here.” The Minnesota senator argued real Americans had been hurt by Trump’s trade wars and that they would be helped by this deal. Tonight’s debate kicked off with a wide-ranging discussion on foreign policy, amid rising tensions between the US and Iran. Here’s what some notable viewers have made of it so far, starting with the Guardian US columnist and former labor secretary Robert Reich: And here’s Rich Lowry, the editor of the National Review, with a jibe at Biden’s record during the Obama years: Although not everyone has been taking everything so seriously; here’s the Financial Times’ chief US commentator: Democrats expected this debate to be a bare-knuckle brawl centered on the newly tense rivalry between the senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Healthcare and whether a woman could beat Donald Trump seemed like the most likely debate topics. Instead the first half an hour of the debate was a fairly civil discussion on foreign policy and the Middle East. At times Sanders tried to contrast his opposition to the war in Iraq with Biden’s past support, but neither candidate engaged in the kind of heated exchanges that marked major moments in previous debates. Senator Amy Klobuchar refrained from bashing the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg on his foreign policy credentials. And Warren didn’t try to bash Sanders. The candidates seemed more willing to articulate their positions than really bicker with each other. Joe Biden and Tom Steyer have both said they would not meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un without preconditions, criticizing Trump’s approach to Pyongyang. Biden noted that Kim once called him a “rabid dog” who should be “beaten to death”. That prompted Bernie Sanders to jump in with a joke: “But other than that, you like him?” Asked about preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, Pete Buttigieg said his administration would make that goal “a priority” in order to keep Americans safe. “Our security depends on ensuring that Iran does not become nuclear,” the Afghanistan war veteran said. Buttigieg accused the Trump administration of increasing the likelihood that Iran becomes a nuclear power by abanding the 2015 nuclear deal. Pete Buttigieg said the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) that has allowed presidential administrations to carry out military actions in the Middle East needs to be replaced. Joe Biden quickly echoed Buttigieg’s argument, but prominent Democrats – including the House speaker Nancy Pelosi – have warned that passing a new AUMF will require extensive debate on the timing, geography and scope of the measure. Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said she would pull “combat” troops out of the Middle East, but that distinction could leave her some wiggle room to keep some US forces in the region. Pete Buttigieg, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, addressed the issue of leaving troops in the region by recounting the sacrifices made by his fellow service members. Asked about America’s continued presence in the Middle East, Joe Biden said he would keep “small numbers of troops” in the region with the goal of “patrolling the Gulf” and confronting the Islamic State. The former vice-president then said he believed that Trump had “flat-out lied” about the threat posed by the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. The president has claimed Iranians were planning attacks on four US embassies when he ordered the drone strike that killed Suleimani, but he has provided no evidence to support that. Addressing how he was prepared to serve as commander-in-chief, Pete Buttigieg, who is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, argued his generation was suffering the consequences of votes cast more than 15 years ago. “There are enlisted people I served with barely old enough to remember those votes,” Buttigieg said. Bernie Sanders, who has criticized Joe Biden for voting in favor of the Iraq war in 2002, was pressed by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on his initial support for the war in Afghanistan. But the Vermont senator dismissed that question, arguing the war in Iraq was a much more significant blunder than the conflict in Afghanistan. Addressing why he was best prepared to serve as commander-in-chief, Joe Biden said his oft-repeated line about coming to oppose the Iraq war, even though the former senator originally voted in favor of the war. Biden defended his foreign-policy record by pointing to his service as Barack Obama’s vice-president. “The man who also argued against that war, Barack Obama, picked me to be his vice-president,” Biden said. Biden ultimately said he was overall the most experienced candidate when it came to foreign policy. “I’m prepared to compare [my record] to anybody’s on this stage,” Biden said. CNN’s Wolf Blitzer posed the first question of the debate, unsurprisingly asking the candidates why they were best prepared to serve as commander-in-chief while US-Iranian tensions escalate. “I think my record speaks to that,” Bernie Sanders said, pivoting to his 2002 vote as a House member against the Iraq war, saying he predicted the war would lead to “unprecedented levels of chaos in the region”. “I not only voted against the war; I helped lead the effort against that war,” the Vermont senator said. The seventh Democratic presidential debate, the final debate before the first caucuses take place in Iowa on 3 February, has begun. The six Democratic presidential candidates participating in tonight’s debate – former vice-president Joe Biden, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, former South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar and billionaire activist Tom Steyer – have taken the stage. The candidates’ podium order on stage was determined by polling in recent weeks, giving Biden and Sanders center-stage placement for tonight’s event. Meanwhile, Klobuchar and Steyer’s podiums are on the ends of the debate stage because of their lower polling numbers. The six Democratic presidential candidates participating in tonight’s debate have taken the stage, and the event will begin in just a few moments. The seventh Democratic debate is set to begin in less than 10 minutes here in Des Moines, Iowa. The event is scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. local time and should wrap up around 10 p.m. Tonight’s debate will be hosted by CNN, in partnership with the Des Moines Register, and it will be held at Drake University. It can be streamed on CNN, CNN en Español and CNN International, as well as the Des Moines Register’s homepage. The three moderators for tonight’s event are CNN’s Wolf Blitzer and Abby Phillip and the Des Moines Register’s Brianne Pfannenstiel. The live blog will be providing updates and analysis from the debate site, so stay tuned. Six candidates will soon take the debate stage at Drake University here in Iowa, making it the smallest debate yet of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. Those six candidates represent half of the field. The requirements for the debate were the highest yet of this cycle, preventing six contenders from making the debate stage. The debate is also the least diverse so far, with no people of color on the stage and only two women. That’s a point that hasn’t been lost on some of the candidates who didn’t make the stage. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who is the only African-American remaining in the race, released a lengthy statement earlier in the day urging candidates who qualified for the debate to address topics germane to people of color. “The remaining candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for president, and in particular, those who have the privilege of being on the debate stage tonight must keep the issues facing people of color in the forefront as we address the future of our country,” Patrick said. “Racism, environmental justice, economic opportunity, gun safety, health disparities, and mass incarceration cannot be issues reserved for politically comfortable places. We cannot win in November without voters of color, nor should we. More importantly, America cannot win without fully and fairly addressing the unfinished business of race.” The campaign for Tulsi Gabbard, another candidate who didn’t make the debate, sent an email to supporters from Cody Two Bears, who has backed the Hawaii congresswoman, saying none of the candidates represent her base. “Not one of those candidates on the stage tonight speak for me. Most don’t speak for you,” Two Bears wrote in the email. “Billionaires and millionaires, people who bought their way onto the stage, establishment mouthpieces, a candidate who appropriated my culture — they don’t represent our diverse American voices.” The debate is set to begin in about 30 minutes, so here is a refresher on the candidates who will be on stage tonight. Joe Biden, the former vice-president who has proven to be a very durable frontrunner as he continues to lead in national polls, despite a number of gaffes on the campaign trail and the debate stage. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who has surged into second place and attracted the support of a number of progressive groups in recent weeks. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who has seen her polling numbers slump recently, while Sanders has overtaken her as the top-polling progressive candidate. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who continues to poll well in the first caucus state of Iowa but has had trouble recreating that success elsewhere as he struggles to win over voters of color. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator who has pitched herself as the candidate best-suited to winning over Midwestern voters but has languished in single digits in polls. Tom Steyer, the billionaire activist who has spent nearly $20m on ads and become one of the top-polling candidates in the early voting states of Nevada and South Carolina. Those six candidates will soon face off in Des Moines, Iowa, so stay tuned to the blog. As the Democratic presidential candidates prepare to debate in Des Moines, Iowa, Trump has taken the stage at his campaign rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The president defended ordering the drone strike against the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, again repeating his unfounded claim that Iranians were planning an attack on several US embassies. “If I didn’t kill him, and let’s say we lost three, four, five embassies,” Trump said, calling Suleimani a “son of a bitch”. The president also weighed in on reports that Bernie Sanders told Elizabeth Warren during a private meeting in 2018 that a woman could not win the White House. “I don’t believe that Bernie said that, I really don’t,” Trump said. One question certain to come up tonight will be what America’s future in the Middle East looks like, as tensions between Washington and Tehran escalate. After the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani was killed in a US drone strike approved by Trump, several Democratic presidential candidates rushed to warn against America becoming involved in another “endless war”. The president and a number of senior administration officials initially claimed the Suleimani strike was carried out to prevent an “imminent” attack on Americans, but the White House declined to provide specifics on the threat. Then, Trump said that the Iranians were planning attacks on four US embassies, a claim that the Washington Post called “at best an unfounded theory and at worst a falsehood”. The Democratic presidential candidates will likely be quick to criticize Trump for his handling of the Suleimani strike, but it will be interesting to see how they differ on their visions for America’s future in the Middle East. Each of the six Democratic presidential candidates participating tonight will have guests cheering them on at the debate, but it’s safe to say that only one of them will have a television star in their corner. Actor Mandy Moore, one of the stars of This Is Us, is attending the Des Moines debate as a guest of former Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg. Moore also attended a town hall alongisde the predential candidate in Ames, Iowa, yesterday, drawing a crowd of about 800. “He’s truly an original, and that’s what this country need right now,” Moore said in Ames. “This is not a TV show, this is reality, this country needs a leader right now, a leader who knows how to bring people together.” The yearlong truce between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders – the field’s leading progressives – appears to be broken after an escalating war of words leaves both of them politically vulnerable. On Monday, Warren confirmed a CNN report that Sanders told Warren he believed a woman could not win the presidency during a private meeting in 2018. Sanders vehemently denies this account. “I thought a woman could win; he disagreed,” she said. “It is ludicrous to believe that at the same meeting where Elizabeth Warren told me she was going to run for president, I would tell her that a woman couldn’t win,” Sanders said in an earlier statement. Tensions have been simmering between the two campaigns for weeks as Sanders began to consolidate support in the early states. Over the weekend, Politico reported that the Sanders campaign had urged volunteers to describe Warren as the preferred candidate of affluent voters. Sanders distanced himself from the talking points, saying that his campaign employs hundreds of people who “sometimes say things that they shouldn’t.” He added: “I have never said a negative word about Elizabeth Warren, who is a friend of mine.” Still Warren told reporters that she was “disappointed to hear that Bernie is sending his volunteers out to trash me.” Both candidates seem eager to avoid an epic clash during the debate, but they will surely be asked to clarify their different recollections of the 2018 discussion. The political repercussions of this breach are still unknown but many progressive activists are starting to worry this internecine fight will undermine their cause and take the pressure off of Biden, the frontrunner and leading moderate in the race. As the Democratic presidential candidates prepare to debate in Iowa, the most recent polling shows a close, four-way race in the first caucus state. According to the latest poll from CNN and the Des Moines Register, the two outlets hosting tonight’s debate, Bernie Sanders narrowly leads in Iowa. The Vermont senator hit 20% in the widely respected survey – putting him 3 points ahead of Elizabeth Warren, 4 points ahead of Pete Buttigieg and 5 points ahead of Joe Biden. But another poll from the Hawkeye State, released by Monmouth University yesterday, showed Biden leading the pack with 24%. According to that survey, the former vice-president leads Sanders by 6 points, Buttigieg by 7 points and Warren by 9 points. There are still almost three weeks left before the 3 February caucuses, leaving plenty of time for those numbers to shift. Many Iowans attending campaign events in recent days have also said they could change their minds up until the day of the caucuses, so tonight’s debate could go a long way in convincing the state’s undecided voters. The final Democratic debate before the Iowa caucuses is about an hour away, but the biggest news is currently coming from Capitol Hill, where House Democrats just released new information to be used in the Senate impeachment trial. The new information includes documents from Lev Parnas, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani’s who has been indicted on campaign-finance charges. According to one document, Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, sent a letter to Ukrainian president-elect Volodymyr Zelenskiy in May 2019. In the letter, Giuliani requests a meeting with Zelenskiy, claiming he was acting with Trump’s “knowledge and consent.” “In my capacity as personal counsel to President Trump and with his knowledge and consent, I request a meeting with you ... I will need no more than a half-hour of your time,” Guiliani’s wrote in the letter. Trump has previously claimed that he did not direct Giuliani to try to pressure Kyiv to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter’s business activities in Ukraine. Hours before the debate on Tuesday, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House would vote to send its impeachment charges against Donald Trump to the Senate the following day. This clash of news cycles was inevitable albeit less disruptive than initially feared. (The Democratic National Committee was prepared to move the debate if a Senate trial was already underway.) Still, according to the timeline offered by Pelosi and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, on Tuesday, the ensuing impeachment trial is likely to play out at a critical moment as the candidates make their closing arguments before voting begins on 3 February. The upcoming Senate trial, expected to begin next Tuesday, creates uncertainty for the senators running for president. Three of the candidates on stage – senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar – will be pulled off the campaign trail for days or possibly weeks to sit for the Senate’s impeachment trial. They are not allowed to speak during the trial, eliminating the chance for a courtroom showdown between a presidential hopeful and the president’s team. Meanwhile, Joe Biden, the field’s frontrunner, has been a central figure in the impeachment scandal. The charges against Trump stem from his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who worked on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice-president. Despite no evidence of wrongdoing, Republicans are demanding Hunter Biden testify before the Senate. Compounding the situation, the New York Times reported that the Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, was “successfully” hacked by Russia, an effort that mirrors the Kremlin’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. Biden has said these efforts are an indication that not only Trump but Russia, too, is afraid to run against him. Even though six Democratic presidential candidates failed to meet the polling requirement for tonight’s debate, one candidate who did manage to cross that threshold will not be onstage tonight: Michael Bloomberg. The former New York mayor has surged into fifth place in national polls. According to the RealClearPolitics average, Bloomberg is polling at 6.2% nationally, putting him only one point behind Pete Buttigieg. But Bloomberg did not qualify for tonight’s debate stage because the self-funded billionaire candidate has pledged to not accept supporter contributions, leaving him unable to meet the Democratic National Committee’s donor requirement. Despite his absence from the debate stage, Bloomberg is building a formidable campaign operation. The candidate, who only jumped into the race in late November, has already spent more than $200m on ads and has hired more than 1,000 staffers spread out across 33 states. Campaigning in the Super Tuesday state of Texas this past weekend, Bloomberg did not rule out the possibility of spending up to $1bn on the election. He added that he would make the most of his time spent off the debate stage. “If I wanted to complain, I could make a good case that it wasn’t fair,” Bloomberg said of being excluded from tonight’s event. “In the meantime, while they’re debating, I’m out visiting a whole lot of people. I’m not wasting the time.” Six Democrats qualified for the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday. All are white. What began as the largest and most diverse presidential primary field in history has winnowed to an all-white top-tier that does not reflect the demographic diversity of the Democratic party. Now the party’s candidates and voters are grappling with their lack of diversity, which was underscored on Monday by the departure of senator Cory Booker, who is black. Earlier this month, Julián Castro, the only Latino candidate to run in 2020, ended his campaign. Businessman Andrew Yang was the sole candidate of color on stage during the last debate in Los Angeles but did not qualify for this round. “No one on that stage has ever been questioned about their citizenship or if they’re a ‘real’ American or been followed by store security when shopping,” said former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who is the only black candidate still in the race. “No one has ever asked themselves whether a rejection for a job or an apartment or a loan was because of their race — though millions of Americans still do. Racism is the most consequential unfinished business of America. An election without those issues addressed by all the candidates is not consequential enough.” In an interview on CBS, Booker said the party has to “do a better job” of addressing the structural barriers that still exist for candidates of color and women running for office. Part of that problem is that Iowa and New Hampshire, two of the whitest states in the country, play an outsized role in selecting the presidential nominee. Polling in these early states helps qualify candidates for the debates. But there is also a heightened focus on “electability” this cycle among a Democratic electorate that still carries scar tissue from losing to Trump in 2016. Electability is an ill-defined concept that often works against candidates of color and women. To be sure, there is still opportunities to break barriers: senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar would be the first female president; Bernie Sanders would be the first Jewish president and Pete Buttigieg would be the first openly gay president and the youngest. Greetings from Iowa, live blog readers! The seventh Democratic debate is set to kick off in about two hours, as presidential candidates face off for one last time before Iowa holds the first caucuses in 20 days. Tonight’s debate is taking place at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, and it will feature the smallest (and whitest) field yet. Only six candidates qualified for tonight’s event: the former vice-president Joe Biden, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, former South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar and billionaire activist Tom Steyer. With less than three weeks to go until the Iowa caucuses, tonight’s debate could quickly turn contentious quickly as candidates seek to win over still-undecided voters. We’ll soon find out. The blog will have more updates and analysis as we prepare for the debate to begin, so stay tuned."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2019/jul/30/sterling-pound-us-dollar-euro-boris-johnson-hard-line-no-deal-brexit-bank-of-england-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-30T14:04:41Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump launches attack on China over trade 'rip-off' – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/jul/30/sterling-pound-us-dollar-euro-boris-johnson-hard-line-no-deal-brexit-bank-of-england-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2019/jul/30/sterling-pound-us-dollar-euro-boris-johnson-hard-line-no-deal-brexit-bank-of-england-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump launches attack on China over trade 'rip-off' – as it happened","bodyText":"Messrs Trump and Johnson have both moved markets today with their respective central concerns: trade with China and Brexit. US stock markets have caught a cold from Donald Trump’s latest Twitter outburst, which suggests that his patience with negotiations with China is wearing thin. Investors had not been betting that the two days of trade talks currently happening in Shanghai would reach a resolution, but some had hoped for the groundwork for more detailed talks could be laid. That hope now appears to be forlorn. Trump’s criticisms of China will form the backdrop tomorrow for the Federal Reserve, which is expected to cut interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis – partly because of the risks to growth from the trade war. On the British side of the pond, new Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s insistence that the EU must ditch the backstop (an insurance policy to avoid a hard Irish border) if there is to be a deal. That pushed sterling to a 28-month low against the US dollar. Sterling has become “increasingly politicised” because of Brexit, becoming more sensitive to news from Westminster and Brussels than the economic fundamentals, according to Peter Dixon, senior economist at Commerzbank. For all the words of warning from politicians, economists and central bankers of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit, the market judgement comes as a brutal reminder that investors are not prepared to take politicians on trust and that the balance of risks is clearly tilted to the downside. Usually a slide in the pound and the consequent inflation would prompt the Bank of England to favour an interest rate hike, but with Brexit in play that could change very quickly. The pound is unlikely to remain at current levels for long: Either the government delivers a no-deal Brexit, in which case sterling might be expected to fall much further, or this prospect is avoided in which case the currency retraces some lost ground. Either way, holding for now would be the sensible option, Dixon said. And in corporate news, Centrica boss Ian Conn will step down after announcing that the British Gas owner had slashed its dividend following a first-half loss. Thanks for joining us today for coverage of business, economics and markets. Please do join my colleague, Julia Kollewe, tomorrow for coverage of the buildup to the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. JJ US stock markets have fallen after US President Donald Trump’s attacks on China, which analysts have said could scupper trade talks. The Nasdaq composite index lost 0.68% in early trading, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.52% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.34% at the opening bell. The FTSE 100 is now down by 0.3%, and the pain has increased for Centrica and Fresnillo after their poor results: the former has lost 17% and the latter has lost a fifth. On the mid-cap FTSE 250 CYBG, the owner of the Virgin Money, Clydesdale and Yorkshire bank brands, is the biggest faller. Shares in the bank have lost 12% after it reported a fall in mortgage lending and lower net interest margins, a key measure of how much money they make on their loans. US stock market futures are pointing to a difficult time for Wall Street today, after Donald Trump’s Twitter attacks on China. Dow Jones industrial average futures prices have fallen by 0.4% with half an hour to go until the opening bell, while futures for the S&amp;P 500 are down by 0.5% and those on the Nasdaq 100 are down by 0.8%. The latest German inflation data might add to the case for the European Central Bank to go ahead with an interest rate cut in September: the harmonised index of consumer prices (used by the ECB) fell to 1.1%, the lowest since November 2016. In the previous month the inflation measure had reached 1.5%, much closer to the ECB’s 2% inflation target. Economists had expected a drop, but only to an annual rate of 1.3%. The data add to a picture of a European economy that is struggling to sustain its momentum. The German manufacturing industry’s travails have been a major part of that story. Trump’s tweets appear to have scuppered any hopes for progress in the latest talks, barring some major concessions on the Chinese side. Stephen Innes, managing partner at VM Markets Pte, said: Whatever shred of optimism markets had about the ongoing trade negotiations were dealt as a severe blow when President Trump flew off the handle again at China for not buying American agricultural products. Following another month of escalating tensions, agreement on practically anything would have been viewed positively, but I think you can throw that view out the window. Trump’s belief that China is hanging on for a Democrat to replace him as president in 2020 could lead the US to take a more aggressive tone, Innes added. European equities have suffered today after poor earnings from big companies, and the slide has accelerated after Trump’s trade comments. Germany’s Dax is now down by 2.2% today – and has hit its lowest level in more than a year. France’s Cac 40 is down by 1.5%. The FTSE 100 is now in negative territory after Trump’s trade interventions, down by 0.2%. An update on banking regulation: the Bank of England has today confirmed plans to make big British lenders publish plans to show that they could go bankrupt without needing the government to step in like it did with the £45bn bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland a decade ago. The UK will become the second country to force its largest lenders to publicly disclose their “living wills” and prove they can afford to foot the bill for their own failures in order to avoid costly taxpayer bailouts, reports the Guardian’s Kalyeena Makortoff. New rules confirmed by the Bank of England and its regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, on Tuesday mean banks will face further pressure to lay out plans that ensure they wind down in an orderly fashion – or risk the scrutiny of both the public and investors. The public disclosures, due every two years from 2021, will be the first made by major banks outside of the US. With the new rules confirmed, UK’s seven largest high street banks – RBS, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Standard Chartered, the UK arm of Santander and Nationwide building society – will soon start assessing whether they are in a position to continue serving customers and fulfilling existing contracts even if they are headed for a full shutdown or major reorganisation. The president of the United States is awake, and he appears to be doing his best to prevent any progress in trade talks with China that are taking place in Shanghai. Donald Trump clearly is not holding out much hope for the latest round – which will not be welcomed by jittery investors hoping for a resolution. The trade war between the two countries has been highlighted as one of the major risks to the global economy for months. Raoul Leering, head of international trade analysis at the ING investment bank, said: Markets could be in for another disappointment because, as of yet, there are no other concrete signs that negotiators are getting closer to a deal. On the contrary, China has demanded that the US lift all tariff hikes before a deal can be cut, which doesn’t align well with the American approach to keep the pressure on even after a deal. However, both China and Trump could do with a deal, one to help its economy, ther other to parade his trade negotiating successes. But “Trump will need to back down”, said Leering. Markets were yesterday pricing in a 50% chance of a Bank of England interest rate cut before the end of the year, Archer added. However, a fiscal boost from a free-spending new government could add to pressure not to cut interest rates. In yet another complication, the UK economy is weakening. Indeed, the influential National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) last week said there was a one in four chance the country is in a recession already. That is backed up by recent Bank of England data, said Costas Milas, a professor at the University of Liverpool. According to fresh Bank of England data, “divisia money” grew in June 2019 by only 3.5%, the worst rate of growth for more than seven years. “Divisia money”, which has been found to predict GDP movements quite well, weights different forms of money according to their likelihood of being spent (hence, notes and coins have a higher weight than money held in mutual funds, for example). Milas said: The fact that divisia money is now slowing down rapidly indicates that GDP contraction is almost imminent which, of course, is hitting our currency in addition to the no-deal Brexit talk. There has been something of an about-turn in views on the Bank of England’s interest rate path in recent weeks. Governor Mark Carney and co had been hinting that interest rates could rise in the event of a smooth Brexit – their central assumption. But as government policy has taken on more of a no-deal flavour that is looking increasingly strained. The Bank also runs the risk of being out of step with other major central banks – an uncomfortable feeling for policymakers who meet regularly at various economic fora. The US Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates tomorrow, and the European Central Bank’s September rate cut has already been pencilled in by investors. It would be a “major surprise” if there is anything other than a 9-0 vote in favour of leaving policy unchanged, but the Bank could back away from its guidance that rates will rise gradually, according to Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club. Until very recently (including the June MPC meeting), the main focus on UK monetary policy was when the Bank of England is most likely to raise interest rates. However, there has been a marked turnaround in sentiment regarding likely Bank of England action and the key question is now whether the central bank’s next move will be to raise or cut interest rates. We suspect that the Bank of England will acknowledge that the risks to the UK economic outlook have increased but play down the prospects of an interest rate cut unless there is a disruptive “no deal” Brexit in October. It would probably take conciliatory noises from the government or the EU to push the pound back up, although perhaps don’t hold your breath for any change in tone any time soon, given that many key figures on either side will be on holiday in August. Currency traders are trying to work out what it will take for sterling to fall further, given that markets appear to have finally priced in Boris Johnson’s no-deal Brexit threat. Added to that is the complication that the Bank of England (due to meet tomorrow before Thursday’s decision) would likely have to cut interest rates if there is a no-deal Brexit. John Goldie, a dealer at foreign exchange company Argentex Group, said: The market finally seems to be waking up to the potential for No Deal Brexit, despite the fact that it has been the legal default for over two years now and consecutive prime ministers have maintained that they would prefer to leave without a deal than with a bad deal. The difference is that, this time, people believe Boris Johnson just might be crazy enough to carry out the threat. The Bank of England corrected its panic cut post-referendum when they raised rates in 2017 and then took interest rates to the highest since the financial crisis in mid-2018. With this buffer, as well as a seemingly synchronised dovish shift across the major economies, the market is already pricing over 50% likelihood of a reduction in rates later this year. There is not likely to be any change from the MPC this week but any suggestion that a cut has been considered would cement the expectation for action in the coming months and likely undermine the pound further. The number of insolvent companies in England and Wales hit a five-year high in the second quarter of 2019, in the latest ominous economic signal for the British economy. There were 4,321 company insolvencies between April and June, 2.6% higher than in the first three months of the year and an increase of 11.9% year-on-year. The last time insolvencies hit this level was the start of 2014. Duncan Swift, president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3, said: Today’s figures are evidence of a difficult period for UK businesses. Tighter constraints on consumers and significant uncertainty about the future of the UK economy and the UK’s relationship with the EU are just some of the key factors at play that are making the business climate a challenging one. Questions around what Brexit really means have hit investment and growth levels, and led to a degree of economic stagnation. Businesses in a variety of industries are struggling right now. Retailers are suffering as the world in which they operate changes and more and more people shop online. Manufacturing output and confidence is low. Private and business car sales are down. And businesses which stockpiled items ahead of the original Brexit deadline of 29 March will now be seeing those decisions have an impact on their cash flow levels. Simply put: it’s an uncertain, difficult time to be in business right now. The pound has moderated some of its losses for the day: it has now lost 0.3% for the day to trade at around $1.2184 against the US dollar. The slight recovery has weighed on the FTSE 100, which is now up by only 0.07%. But any talk of recovery comes in the context of a very difficult month for sterling owners. The pound remains down by 4.5% over the year to date, or 4% in the past month alone – leading to some rather unflattering comparisons: Important pensions news from the Financial Conduct Authority. Britain’s financial watchdog has proposed measures to protect consumers transferring out of defined benefit pension schemes, including a ban on contingent charging for advice and a clampdown on ongoing fees over 20 to 30 years – practices it said were costing customers £2bn a year. Many savers have been encouraged to move their pensions when they would be better advised to stay put. You can read more from the Guardian’s Julia Kollewe here: Giffgaff has been fined £1.4m for overcharging 2.6 million mobile phone customers. An Ofcom investigation revealed the network, which is owned by O2’s parent company Telefónica, overcharged users a total of almost £2.9m, writes the Guardian’s Mark Sweney. The communications regulator said the billing mistake was “unacceptable” and imposed a further £50,000 fine because Giffgaff failed to provide accurate information during its investigation. You can read more here: Some more interesting detail on the UK from the eurozone economic survey: consumers don’t appear to be that bothered by the Brexit chaos. Here’s more from Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics: The overall sentiment indicator for consumers jumped to -7 in July – its highest level since August 2018 – from -11 in June. Confidence among households about the economic outlook recovered in July, while households’ optimism about the 12-month outlook for their personal finances rose further above its long-run average. Although caveated by the fact that the survey was carried out before Johnson ascended to the premiership, “there’s no sign yet that consumers are going to tap the brakes on spending in the run-up to the October Brexit deadline”, Tombs said. The weakening in the eurozone is reflected across the world, and it has drawn a response from central bankers who are planning to add support to their ailing economies. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates tomorrow, and the European Central Bank has all but committed to moving in September (although the Bank of England is expected to remain on hold until the Brexit path becomes clearer, for better or worse). The Bank of Japan’s Haruhiko Kuroda this morning added to the sense of wariness among central bank governors, saying that he was prepared to ease monetary policy if need be. While the BoJ did not change interest rates, it said it would add more stimulus “without hesitation” if there is a global slowdown that threatens to weaken inflationary pressures. Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Kuroda echoed what other policymakers have been saying in recent weeks. The language now promises further easing if downside risks materialise, mainly regarding developments in overseas economies. Eurozone business confidence fell to an almost six-year low in July, according to closely followed indicators published by the European commission. Business confidence for the eurozone fell “markedly”, the commission said, from a reading of 0.17 points in June to a negative reading of 0.12 in July. That was the first negative reading for business confidence since October 2013, and the lowest since August of that year. It was also well below economists’ average expectations of 0.08. The commission’s economic sentiment indicator, which combines consumer and business confidence, fell to its lowest since 2016. The figures add to an ominous picture for the eurozone economy, which has been blighted in particular by the struggles of the German manufacturing industry – with fears rising of a global economic slowdown. British bakery chain Greggs has reported a 58% rise in profits today, after the buzz around its vegan sausage roll boosted sales. The Newcastle-based company announced a special dividend of 35p per share – a vegan sausage roll payout, perhaps. Greggs launched its vegan sausage roll in January with a hugely successful marketing campaign that drew the ire of famous ranters but boosted sales. Underlying pre-tax profits came in at £40.6m for the six months to 29 June, up from £25.7m the year before. There were heavier sterling trading volumes than normal in Asia trading hours, say analysts at Deutsche Bank led by Jim Reid. The renewed selling this morning has left the pound just a percent away from hitting a 34-year low (if ignoring the “flash crash” of October 2016). They said: With 93 days until the UK’s scheduled departure from the EU on October 31, and with Johnson’s policy of leaving that day “no ifs or buts”, fears of a no-deal outcome are increasingly being reflected in the currency. It isn’t only sterling markets that are being affected: the yield on the 10-year gilt, the benchmark rate for UK government borrowing, has matched its almost-three-year low of 0.628% this morning. Yields fall as prices rise in response to higher demand for the bonds. That demand has been driven in part by expectations that a no-deal Brexit would lead to economic stimulus from the Bank of England. Lower interest rates tend to make the returns from bonds more attractive. Remember that Johnson and much of his cabinet have already voted in favour of the withdrawal deal that Theresa May agreed with the EU. But his new-found conversion to leaving without a deal if necessary reflects the apparent impossibility of getting enough votes to pass that deal. Kit Juckes, chief foreign exchange strategist at Société Générale, said: UK PM Boris Johnson’s position that there is no point talking about the exit deal with the EU until the Irish border backstop arrangement is removed, reflects his inability to get the deal in its current format through Parliament. His hard-line stance is seeing the Conservatives win voters back from the Brexit Party, according to recent polls, and he needs either to get a deal from the EU that he can get through Parliament or win back enough Brexiteer votes to be able to win an election. Either way, he is committed to a hard-line stance towards the EU that will of course, be rebuffed aggressively. In the process, sterling moves to the bottom of its post-referendum ranges and re-tests historical trade-weighted lows. Oh, to be a fly on the wall in 10 Downing Street today as they discuss a fall in sterling at peak holiday season. Perhaps, counterintuitively, Boris Johnson and his new strategy supremo, Dominic Cummings, may welcome the fall (or what it represents), says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at foreign exchange firm Oanda. The weakness in the pound is a reflection of the fact that Boris Johnson’s plan is working. He wants his no-deal threats to be taken seriously by the EU in the hope that it forces them to re-engage on the backstop. Clearly he has traders convinced. Ultimately, May failed to convince anyone that no-deal was ever an option, despite repeated warnings that it was better than a bad deal. Boris Johnson is determined not to make the same mistake and it now remains to be seen whether the EU will take his threats as seriously as the market is. Traders are currently not optimistic but it’s still early days. For now, the currency may remain under severe pressure. The FTSE 100 is the one gainer among major European stock markets, still up by 0.14%. Elsewhere Germany’s Dax index has been shaken by poor earnings from the Lufthansa airline and chemicals company Bayer. It fell by 0.5%. Italy’s FTSE MIB benchmark index has hit a four-week low after falling by 0.8%. British Gas owner Centrica’s shares are sputtering: they are now at a 21-year low. Silver and gold miner Fresnillo is the second-worst performer on the FTSE 100, after it reported a drop in production and higher costs. Profits dropped by two-thirds. And consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser missed analysts expectations for sales thanks to slower sales of infant formula in the giant Chinese market. A bit more detail on those BP earnings: profits fell by 35% in the second quarter on the back of sliding crude oil prices. But investors of course know the effect of lower oil prices on oil company earnings; better than expected production figures helped make up for the lower prices. (Despite all of its talk of supporting the energy transition, BP is in the middle of a five-year plan to expand production.) Via AFP: BP said that its underlying replacement cost profit – a widely-watched measure which strips out exceptional items and changes in the value of oil inventories – was broadly unchanged at $2.8bn. That beat the average analyst forecast of $2.48bn, according to Bloomberg. Centrica shares have fallen by 10% in early trading on the FTSE 100. Here is the chart which probably goes some way to explaining why Centrica boss Ian Conn is being shown the door. London’s benchmark index is up by 0.35%, however, after stronger-than-expected BP results boosted the weighty mining contingent. And don’t forget that the FTSE 100’s multinationals are usually boosted by the falling pound, which makes their foreign currency earnings more valuable in sterling terms. Back on sterling, it’s “relentless selling pressure” says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. If sterling weakens further “it’s anyone’s guess where cable [sterling against the dollar] could land,” he said. Remember the previous post-2016 low was before no-deal was on the table – it was all talk of a hard v soft Brexit – no deal wasn’t even being discussed. The reasons behind the slide are well trodden but worth noting again: increased risk of a no-deal Brexit as the new government regime pivots squarely towards making no-deal a reality. And Johnson will not be endearing himself to many families about to go abroad ... Terrible timing for the holidays. Why is it always August? Ian Conn’s departure came after what he described as an “exceptionally challenging environment in the first half of 2019”, resulting in Centrica slashing its dividend in half. Centrica slumped to a loss of £446m in the first six months of 2019, after making a profit of £704m in the same period last year. The company blamed a litany of factors for the £1.1bn downturn in its fortunes: the UK default tariff price cap, low UK natural gas prices, extensions to outages at the Hunterston B and Dungeness B nuclear power stations, and warmer than normal weather in both the UK and North America. The British Gas owner’s adjusted earnings for shareholders, which attempts to strip out one-off costs, slumped by 63% year-on-year to £134m. The dividend to be paid to investors fell to 1.5p per share, down from 3.6p last year. Centrica’s UK consumer business will be “fundamentally rebased”, and it will seek another £250m of efficiencies per year, part of a £1bn cost-cutting programme. British Gas owner Centrica has announced that its chief executive, Ian Conn, will step down next year. Conn will remain with Centrica at least until the 2020 annual general meeting and “provide his full support to help with the transition”, the company said. The board said it will plan for his succession and provide an update at a later point. Conn will remain on the same pay policy until the end of his employment, Centrica said. However, bonus payments whose conditions have not yet been fulfilled will “lapse in full” and no further bonuses will be granted. Conn has previously been the object of criticism after receiving a 44% pay rise to £2.4m for 2018, despite a difficult year in which the company imposed two bill increases, warned on profits and announced thousands of job cuts. Charles Berry, Centrica chairman, said: Iain has now agreed with the Board that, while he will continue to focus on driving [the] transformation, including pursuing the announced divestments and continuing to drive performance and efficiency, he will also support an orderly succession before stepping down in due course. Here’s a graph regular readers will have seen yesterday, but it certainly bears repeating: sterling against the US dollar since the start of 2016, ahead of the June 2016 referendum. Note that sterling popped to above $1.50 as the results of the referendum started to come through. It has since suffered, recovered somewhat, and then fallen back as it became clearer that a no-deal Brexit was increasingly likely. Boris Johnson’s financial markets welcoming party has delivered another blow this morning, sending sterling to fresh lows. When campaigning for the Conservative leadership, the new prime minister made it very clear that he intended to leave the EU on 31 October with or without a deal. Markets appeared not to believe him; they now appear to have caught up. Johnson again rejected the backstop, the insurance policy that aims to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Speaking in Scotland, he said: We can’t accept the backstop, it was thrown out three times, the withdrawal agreement as it stands is dead and everybody gets that. But there is ample scope to do a new deal and a better deal. Investors were not reassured and sterling tumbled again this morning, losing as much as 0.7% against the US dollar and 0.6% against the euro. One pound bought as little as $1.2121 US dollars this morning, the lowest since 14 March 2017. Watch for the $1.2106 level: that will be the lowest since January 2017. It has been an uncomfortable month for the pound, making it one of the worst-performing currencies across the world in recent days. Sterling’s Johnsonian weakness will also have tricky implications for the Bank of England, whose rate-setting monetary policy committee will be looking at the fall in the pound with a certain trepidation ahead of their latest interest rate decision on Thursday. Falls in the pound feed eventually through into higher inflation – but it is not the kind of inflation that signals an economy that is heating up. That leaves an uncomfortable decision to leave rising inflation, or to raise interest rates to combat it at a time when the economy may be struggling even more.

National Grid reacts to fossil-fuel vehicle ban","bodyText":"National Grid has welcomed the plan to make electric or zero-emission cars and vans account for all new sales from 2040, but said the government and industry now faced big decisions on how the extra power was provided and demand for it was managed. The grid recently warned that, by 2030, electric cars could require 3.5-8GW of additional capacity, on top of the current peak demand of 60GW. By comparison, the nuclear power station being built at Hinkley Point in Somerset will add 3.2GW of capacity to the system. By the middle of the century, when it is assumed almost all cars will be electric, that extra peak demand could be up to 18GW. The lowest estimates of extra demand assume that drivers charge their cars at off-peak times. Smart meters and time-of-day tariffs could incentivise owners to charge when wind and solar power are plentiful and electricity is cheaper. Energy networks could also manage demand via automatic time-shift charging, whereby a car plugged in at home at 6pm is not actually charged until the early hours of the morning, when demand is low. Ministers have already urged drivers to think carefully and avoid placing extra pressure on the grid. James Court, head of policy at the Renewable Energy Association, a trade group, said: “We need smart vehicle charging and price-reflective tariffs if the future electric fleet is to be a huge benefit and not a hindrance to our grid.” Regardless of how sensibly the extra demand is spread across the day, electric cars will require investment in new power generation. The energy analyst Wood Mackenzie estimates that if one in three cars sold in 2035 is fully electric, the vehicles would collectively account for 3% of the UK’s total electricity demand. Building 400,000 charging points for them all would cost £30bn, the group has said. National Grid said the extra power would be generated from gas, windfarms, imports and nuclear reactors – not from coal, which is scheduled to disappear from the UK’s power mix by 2025 at the latest. And the switch to electric vehicles could even provide an eventual boost to the grid. The government recently announced £20m of funding to support research on vehicle-to-grid technology, where the grid could call on the power stored in the cars’ batteries to help cope with fluctuations from intermittent wind and solar farms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/16/leaflet-tory-win-copeland-cost-mums-children-labour-gillian-troughton","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-16T18:43:16Z","webTitle":"Leaflet says Tory win in Copeland will 'cost mums their children'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/16/leaflet-tory-win-copeland-cost-mums-children-labour-gillian-troughton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/16/leaflet-tory-win-copeland-cost-mums-children-labour-gillian-troughton","fields":{"headline":"Leaflet says Tory win in Copeland will 'cost mums their children'","bodyText":"A graphic Labour pamphlet warns voters in Copeland that a Tory victory in the by-election will “cost mums their children” in an open letter aimed at highlighting the risks of NHS cuts in the constituency. The handwritten letter in support of Labour candidate Gillian Troughton, a St John ambulance driver and former hospital doctor, is from local mother Paula Townsley. The leaflet is the second posted through letterboxes by Labour activists to contain dire warnings about the closures of maternity services at West Cumberland hospital. Townsley’s letter describes how she gave birth to twins who were 15 weeks premature at West Cumberland hospital, but one of her sons did not survive. Expectant mothers will need to travel more than 40 miles to give birth in Carlisle if the maternity services in the area are closed. “If I had to travel to Carlisle, I would have lost them both,” she wrote. “West Cumberland hospital has been a lifeline for me and my family. “The staff still remember my son when he goes in now. They call him the miracle baby. If the Tories are voted in they’ll take it as a green light for the local NHS closures. Their cost-cutting will cost mums their children.“As a mum to a miracle son, I’m asking you to please vote Labour in our local NHS services on 23 February. It’s only 10 minutes to go to vote for Labour’s Gillian Troughton, but it could save so much.” The previous Labour byelection leaflet also included a quote from unnamed midwives, warning “mothers will die, babies will die, babies will be brain-damaged”. Chris Whiteside, who has previously stood for the Conservatives in the seat, said: “I don’t know whether this will help Labour win the Copeland byelection but their tactics on the hospital deserve to lose.” Labour’s campaign was given a boost on Thursday after negative headlines in the local paper about Theresa May’s visit to the constituency, where she repeatedly refused to answer questions on whether she would back the maternity cuts or over whether the government would underwrite the Moorside nuclear plant, after the Japanese company Toshiba pulled out of the project. Canvassing is believed to show that Labour has a vote retention in some parts of the constituency as low as 70%. Few Labour voters are switching directly to the Tories, one Copeland campaign source said, but many have told the party they are opting to stay at home. The party is said to be relying on legwork from the GMB union on the day of the byelection to persuade Sellafield workers to turn out and vote Labour. Corbyn has confirmed he does not intend to campaign in the constituency again before polling day on 23 February. The Tory campaign has been hinged on support for nuclear power and the Sellafield plant, a major employer in the area, highlighting Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s opposition to nuclear power. Tory leaflets distributed in the constituency feature a quote from Corbyn saying: “I say no nuclear power, decommission the stations we’ve got.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2018/mar/20/phoenix-least-sustainable-city-survive-water","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-03-20T07:00:35Z","webTitle":"Plight of Phoenix: how long can the world’s 'least sustainable' city survive?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/mar/20/phoenix-least-sustainable-city-survive-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/mar/20/phoenix-least-sustainable-city-survive-water","fields":{"headline":"Plight of Phoenix: how long can the world’s 'least sustainable' city survive?","bodyText":"Jennifer Afshar and her husband, John, pushed their bikes across the grass and paused to savour the sunshine, while their two boys went to look at the duck pond. Other kids were playing soccer or doing tricks in the skate park, and families picnicked on blankets or fired up a barbecue across from the swimming pool. “We moved here from Los Angeles, to get away from the rising cost of living and the traffic,” said Jennifer. “When we saw this park, we thought they were punking us it was so good. There’s low crime, the home owners association takes great care of the grass and trees – we like it.” The Afshars live in the squeaky-clean suburb of Anthem, Arizona. It’s part of a giant conurbation of satellite towns surrounding Phoenix, and is a classic example of why this metropolitan – or “megapolitan” – area is tempting fate. Twenty years ago, Anthem sprung out of virgin desert, a community “masterplanned” from scratch with schools, shops, restaurants and spacious homes – many behind high walls and electronic gates – and its own country club and golf course. It now has a population of 30,000. To look around Anthem would be to imagine there is no such thing as a water shortage. But the lush vegetation and ponds do not occur naturally. Phoenix gets less than eight inches of rainfall each year; most of the water supply for central and southern Arizona is pumped from Lake Mead, fed by the Colorado river over 300 miles away. Anthem’s private developer paid a local Native American tribe to lease some of its historic water rights, and pipes its water from the nearby Lake Pleasant reservoir – also filled by the Colorado. That river is drying up. This winter, snow in the Rocky Mountains, which feeds the Colorado, was 70% lower than average. Last month, the US government calculated that two thirds of Arizona is currently facing severe to extreme drought; last summer 50 flights were grounded at Phoenix airport because the heat – which hit 47C (116F) – made the air too thin to take off safely. The “heat island” effect keeps temperatures in Phoenix above 37C (98F) at night in summer. Phoenix and its surrounding area is known as the Valley of the Sun, and downtown Phoenix – which in 2017 overtook Philadelphia as America’s fifth-largest city – is easily walkable, with restaurants, bars and an evening buzz. But it is a modern shrine to towering concrete, and gives way to endless sprawl that stretches up to 35 miles away to places like Anthem. The area is still growing – and is dangerously overstretched, experts warn. “There are plans for substantial further growth and there just isn’t the water to support that,” says climate researcher Jonathan Overpeck, who co-authored a 2017 report that linked declining flows in the Colorado river to climate change. “The Phoenix metro area is on the cusp of being dangerously overextended. It’s the urban bullseye for global warming in north America.” One of those plans is Bill Gates’s new “smart city”. The Microsoft founder recently invested $80m (£57m) in a development firm that aims to construct 80,000 new homes on undeveloped land west of Phoenix, and a new freeway all the way to Las Vegas. Another firm wants to build a “masterplanned community”, like Anthem, south of Tucson, and modelled after the hilltop towns of Tuscany. It envisages five golf courses, a vineyard, parks, lakes and 28,000 homes. The promotional video contains no details about where all the water will come from, but boasts: “This is the American dream: whatever you want you can have.” What these cities want is water. The Phoenix area draws from groundwater, from small rivers to the east, and from the mighty Colorado. The Hoover Dam holds much of the Colorado’s flow in the vast Lake Mead reservoir, but the river itself is sorely depleted. That water has now dropped to within a few feet of levels that California, Nevada and Arizona, which all rely on it, count as official shortages. Lake Powell, the reservoir at the other end of the Grand Canyon, similarly averages half its historic levels. And yet despite the federal Bureau of Reclamation reporting in 2012 that droughts of five or more years would happen every decade over the next 50 years, greater Phoenix has not declared any water restrictions. Nor has the state government decided its official drought contingency proposal. “There’s an enormous fight over all this,” says Jim Holway, vice president of the Central Arizona Water Conservation District. “Climate change is having an impact but that’s a controversial, unsettled issue in the western US.” ‘Sprawl is the norm’ As a hummingbird flitted to a shrub near Holway’s swimming pool – Phoenix from above is a blue mosaic of back-garden pools – Holway explained that the Valley of the Sun may have to choose between agriculture and further urbanisation. Twenty years ago, when he moved here, his house looked out on to citrus groves and flower farms. Now the valley is dominated by mega-farms growing winter vegetables for export and thirsty alfalfa for the cattle feed market. “Do we want to grow houses or crops?” he asks. The conversation in Arizona even turns periodically to the outlandish ideas of drawing water from the Great Lakes 1,700 miles away, or building expensive desalination plants on the Pacific Ocean, instead of imposing water restrictions. Greater Phoenix is good at recycling waste water, but most of it is used for cooling the Palo Verde nuclear power plant to the west of the city, the largest in the US and the only one not on its own body of water. Conversely, the water department is Arizona’s biggest electricity consumer, because it has to pump the water uphill from the Colorado along miles of canals into Phoenix and Tucson. And most of that electricity comes from the heavily polluting, coal-fired Navajo Generating Station in the north of the state. Meanwhile, despite enjoying more than 330 days of bright sunshine a year, Holway estimates that Arizona only derives 2-5% of its energy from solar power. Phoenix is extreme but not alone. “Most American cities use more resources than necessary and that’s the way they were designed,” says Sandy Bahr, director of the Arizona chapter of the Sierra Club. “There is overconsumption and a disposable mentality. Our waste is taken to remote landfill sites, the cities are designed for cars, and sprawl is the norm.” In his 2011 book Bird on Fire, the New York University sociologist Andrew Ross branded Phoenix the least sustainable city in the world. He says he stands by his assessment and warns of an “eco-apartheid”, whereby low-income neighbourhoods on the more polluted south side of the Salt River (which once flowed vigorously through the city and is now a trickle) are less able to protect themselves from the heat and drought than wealthier citizens. “There’s a stark disparity,” he says. “The resource havens, with their hybrid cars, their solar panels and other green gizmos; and the folks on the other side struggling to breathe clean air and drink uncontaminated water. It’s a prediction of where the world is headed.” Or, he says, you can just look at the past. The Hohokam people were the original irrigators of the valley that later became home to Phoenix. Their society, numbering an estimated 40,000, collapsed in the 15th century – for reasons believed to relate to disagreements over scarce water. This week, the Overstretched Cities series examines the impact of the rush to urbanisation, which has seen cities around the world explode in size.

Yet companies still aren’t doing enough to protect themselves from water risks, according to a new report. Compiled by environmental non-profit CDP and released Tuesday at the climate summit in Marrakech, Morrocco, the report approached more than 1,200 of the largest listed companies around the world in sectors exposed to water risk. Just over 600 responded, meaning the $14bn figure is likely to be hugely underreported. The businesses, which included consumer goods giant Unilever and oil and gas company Suncor Energy, were measured on a number of factors, such as their efforts to track their water use and goal-setting to save water. Much of the increase in spending was related to Japanese power giant Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), which spent $10bn over the past year to clean up groundwater pollution from its Daiichi nuclear power plant, damaged in the 2011 tsunami. More than a quarter of the companies said water-related issues, including floods and pollution, had affected their bottom line, typically due to higher operating costs and a disruption in production. One of the companies, Anglo American Platinum, said it was spending millions of dollars on infrastructure at its Mogalakwena mine in South Africa to protect its water supply against shortages, including a $6m upgrade to a nearby sewage works. “Every business in every sector needs water in some form or another,” said Morgan Gillespy, head of water at CDP. “Addressing water risks is vital for business continuity, protecting the bottom-line and to enable an effective response to climate change.” Many businesses rely on water for their operations, but water supplies are at risk in many parts of the world due to pressure on resources, likely to be exacerbated by the effects of climate change. Although more companies than ever are making climate change a priority [pdf] in their sustainability efforts, they still aren’t moving quickly enough to tackle water risks, says the report. Of the companies surveyed, around 60% said they tracked their water use, up only 3% from last year. Nearly half of the companies approached responded to the survey, up from 38% in 2015. Some sectors were more forthcoming than others. Almost three-quarters of IT companies responded, followed by the consumer staples industry, which includes food and beverage companies. The energy sector lagged behind, with less than one-third of companies responding (just 32 out of 109 firms). It’s a trend that has remained consistent, write the report’s authors, who highlight energy giants Exxon Mobile, Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell as having “failed to disclose critical water information to their investor shareholders” via CDP for the last five years. A spokeswoman for Chevron said the company reports on its water impacts through its website and corporate responsibility report, which she says “provide a clear description of how we identify and manage water risk.” Neither Shell nor Exxon had responded to the Guardian’s request for comment at the time of publication. “For a long time, companies have regarded water as a free and plentiful resource,” said Gillespy. “This current understanding, especially in the energy sector, means that they don’t see water as a material concern.” Of those energy companies that did respond to the survey, more than a third said they hadn’t examined how water risk could affect their business in the future. And yet energy companies, along with materials and utility firms, were hit the hardest financially from water-related issues. Energy companies reported being liable in their last reporting period for $78m in fines and penalties for incidents such as spills and violating environmental regulations, more than any other industry and seven times the amount that they reported paying last year. More than half of companies said they had set targets and goals to better manage their water supply. UK pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline reported it had met its target to cut the water used in its operations by 20% last year against 2010 levels. Reducing their water use also led to energy savings, according to over 50% of companies. Food and beverage giant Nestlé cut water use by 1.7m cubic meters at the same time as reducing carbon emissions by 80,000 tons in 2015. To make setting targets easier, CDP is teaming up with other non-profits and charities, including WWF and The Nature Conservancy, to develop a tool to help companies set water targets aligned with climate science and global efforts such as the Paris climate agreement. “Our goal is to enable companies to set targets that would, for example, allow them to make sustainable withdrawals from the river basins they operate in, rather than compete with other local users for that resource,” says Gillespy. The CDP report also highlighted 24 brands that were leading the way in mitigating water risks, up from eight that made the list last year. L’Oréal and German chemical company BASF were among the new additions, joining six firms that made the list for the second year in a row, including Ford and consumer goods company Colgate Palmolive."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"us-news/live/2019/sep/11/trump-news-today-live-fed-recession-polls-2020-democrats-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2019-09-12T00:56:11Z","webTitle":"Supreme court lets Trump administration enforce new asylum restrictions – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/sep/11/trump-news-today-live-fed-recession-polls-2020-democrats-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2019/sep/11/trump-news-today-live-fed-recession-polls-2020-democrats-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"Supreme court lets Trump administration enforce new asylum restrictions – as it happened","bodyText":"Well, it’s been... a day. As CQ-Roll Call immigration reporter Tanvi Misra put it: Here’s an updated recap of today’s US politics news: The supreme court ruled on Wednesday to allow the Trump administration to enforce nationwide restrictions that would prevent most Central American immigrants from seeking asylum in the US. As the president celebrates the highest court’s order as a victory, other lawmakers and immigrant rights activists say the move could cost lives. Democratic lawmakers also slammed federal immigration officials for refusing to explain why they stopped considering requests from immigrants looking to defer deportation due to medical reasons. In a tweet, the president announced he will be delaying implementing increased tariffs on Chinese goods as a “gesture of good will” toward Beijng. Trump referenced his canceled plan to hold peace talks with the Taliban while speaking at the Pentagon’s 9/11 memorial ceremony. It has been 18 years today since the attacks that claimed nearly 3,000 lives. Trump said his administration was moving to ban flavored e-cigarettes in an attempt to crack down on teen vaping. Trump reportedly pushed his staff to pressure the NOAA to back up the president’s false hurricane claim. Trump dismissed the reports as “fake news.” The president has offered no clarity on what gun legislation he would support, despite meeting with a bipartisan group of senators on the issue today. Joe Biden maintained his lead in the latest CNN polling, but he has lost his double-digit advantage on the eve of the next democratic debate, which will take place tomorrow in Houston. Biden also leads among registered voters in the NPR/PBS NewsHour Marist Poll, but trails Elizabeth Warren among democratic and democratic-leaning voters. Tomorrow is the third 2020 democratic presidential debate. The Guardian will be liveblogging as the two top contenders — Warren and Biden — face off for the first time. Andrew Yang has also promised a “big” and “unprecedented” surprise — perhaps a new look? The Trump administration’s acting director of citizenship and immigration services further celebrated the supreme court’s action by calling it a “YUGE Win”, alluding to Donald Trump’s particular way of speaking. The highest court’s order allowing the administration to enforce nationwide restrictions on asylum seekers would prevent most Central American immigrants from seeking protection in the US, and render ineligible refugees from Africa, Asia and South America who arrive regularly at the southern border. Meanwhile, politicians and immigrant rights activists are decrying the move. 2020 presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke, who lives in and once represent the border town of El Paso, Texas, said, “The Supreme Court has put lives in danger.” Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, who chairs the House appropriations committee on homeland security, said the court is “jeopardizing the lives of coutless asylum seekers — innocent men, women, and children.” The Trump administration policy restricting asylum would ban everyone — including children traveling on their own — from seeking asylum in the US unless they apply first in their country of transit. In July, a federal judge in California who blocked the policy said it was unclear that Mexico and Guatemala could handle the volume of migrants passing through their countries and process their asylum claims. The president announced in a tweet that he will delay increasing tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods from China by two weeks, at the request of Beijing. Because October 1 — when the tariff increase was meant to kick in — is National Day of the People’s Republic of China, Trump announced that he’ll delay until October 15. US and Chinese officials have agreed to continue trade talks this month. California lawmakers approved statewide rent control, to ease the housing crisis. California has the nation’s highest housing prices and a growing homeless population. The new bill will limit annual rent increases to 5 percent after inflation. It’s likely to be signed by the state’s democratic governor Gavin Newsom. In February, Oregon was the first to pass statewide rent control. Maryland, New Jersey, New York and the District of Columbia are the only other states to have rent control in some localities. Donald Trump is celebrating the Supreme Court ruling on asylum seekers as a victory, tweeting, “BIG United States Supreme Court WIN” Congress has passed a bill that would permanently bar drilling off US’s Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and extend a moratorium on drilling off Florida’s west coast. The bill is now headed to the Republican-controlled Senate, which is unlikely to act on it. Still, the legislation is a strong repudiation of the Trump administration’s plans to expand offshore drilling, from both republican and democratic members of the House . Coastal lawmakers from both parties oppose offshore drilling, fearing another disaster like the 2010 BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico. More from the AP: “If we don’t act, drilling rigs could soon appear off our beaches,” said Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., the lead sponsor of the bicoastal drilling ban. Cunningham won his seat last year in part because of his opposition to drilling off South Carolina’s beach-dominated coast. “The Low Country (near Charleston, S.C.) is a force to be reckoned with, and we stand firm in our opposition to drilling off our shoreline,” Cunningham said. Offshore drilling could ruin the state’s tourism-based economy, “ruin our vibrant natural resources” and harm the state’s “unique way of life,” he said. “Drilling off the coast of Florida would create an industrial coastline less appealing to visitors, hinder our military readiness and adversely affect our environment,” said Rep. Francis Rooney, R-Fla., co-sponsor of the Florida bill, which extends a moratorium set to expire in 2022. The Supreme Court’s decision today undoes the lower court’s ruling blocking Trump’s asylum policy in some states along the border. Groups challenging the policy in court say that it violates the US refugee act and the UN refugee convention guaranteeing the right to seek asylum to those fleeing persecution. In a scathing dissent to today’s order, justices Ruth Bader Ginsberg and Sonya Sotomayor say that the Supreme Court “sidesteps the ordinary judicial process” by overriding proceedings in the lower courts. Their dissent is also critical of the Trump administration: Once again the Executive Branch has issued a rule that seeks to upend longstanding practices regarding refugees who seek shelter from persecution. Although this Nation has long kept its doors open to refugees—and although the stakes for asylum seekers could not be higher—the Government implemented its rule without first providing the public notice and inviting the public input generally required by law. Remember when the Trump administration tried to make a rule that would essentially ending asylum protections for almost all migrants who arrive at the US-Mexico border? The policy announced in July held that any asylum seekers who pass through another country before arriving at the southern border wouldn’t be eligible for asylum unless they first applied for projection in the country they passed through? A federal judge in California blocked the policy. But today, in a brief, unsigned order, the Supreme Court permitted the Trump administration to carry on with the policy while legal challenges are ongoing. The president, who has been floating Eugene Scalia as a nominee for labor secretary since July, has formally sent the nomination to the senate. If approved, Scalia — son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia — would succeed Alexander Acosta, who resigned over public criticism of his handling of charges against late billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Joe Biden is leading not only in newly released CNN poll, but also in the NPR/PBS NewsHour Marist Poll. Among all registered voters, the former vice president has the highest favorability at 45%. But Warren is a close second, at 41%. Among democrats and democratic-leaning independents, however, Warren has the lead at 75% — up from just about 50% in January. That’s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here’s where the day stands so far: Trump said his administration was moving to ban flavored e-cigarettes in an attempt to crack down on “vaping.” The president said his national security adviser, John Bolton, was leaving the administration because they disagreed on matters like Venezuela and North Korea, although Bolton’s stances on those issues was well known when he took the job. (Trump also laughably said he hoped the two had parted “on good stead.”) Trump referenced his canceled plan to hold peace talks with the Taliban while speaking at the Pentagon’s 9/11 memorial ceremony. It has been 18 years today since the attacks that claimed nearly 3,000 lives. Trump reportedly pushed his staff to pressure the NOAA to back up the president’s false hurricane claim. Trump dismissed the reports as “fake news.” The president has offered no clarity on what gun legislation he would support, despite meeting with a bipartisan group of senators on the issue today. Joe Biden maintained his lead in the latest CNN polling, but he has lost his double-digit advantage on the eve of the next Democratic debate, which will take place tomorrow in Houston. Maanvi will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. CNN is one of the approved pollsters for the Democratic National Committee, so presidential candidates can use it to qualify for the fourth debate next month. But a Politico reporter noted that the results didn’t push any candidate closer to the debate stage next month. Joe Biden still leads the pack of Democratic presidential candidates in the latest CNN poll, but he has lost the double-digit advantage he held last month as the primary race has tightened. According to the poll, Biden attracts the support of 24 percent of Democratic supporters, while Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are virtually tied at 18 and 17 percent. No other candidate reached double digits. Biden’s showing is still impressive, but he has slipped a bit from his 14-point lead over the second-place finisher, Sanders, in August. The poll adds to the evidence that the primary is currently a three-way race between Biden, Warren and Sanders. The fourth-place finisher, Kamala Harris, has slipped to 8 percent. This dynamic will likely weigh heavily on candidates’ minds when they take the debate stage in Houston tomorrow. The top two candidates in CNN’s poll, Biden and Warren, have never faced off onstage before. Democratic presidential candidates are denouncing the Trump administration’s decision not to grant Temporary Protected Status to the Bahamians affected by Hurricane Dorian. Trump and the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Patrol, Mark Morgan, sent contradictory messages Monday about Bahamians receiving TPS. Morgan said during a White House briefing he thought it would be “appropriate” to grant TPS, while Trump seemed to dismiss the idea. Another debate unfolding on Capitol Hill revolves around how exactly House Democrats will define an impeachment inquiry. The House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, sparked confusion earlier today when he told reporters that Democrats were not conducting an “impeachment inquiry.” That comment flew in the face of arguments from the House judiciary committee chairman, Jerry Nadler. So Hoyer walked that initial comment back, saying he misunderstood reporters’ question. “I thought the question was in regards to whether the full House is actively considering articles of impeachment, which we are not at this time,” Hoyer wrote in a statement. “I strongly support Chairman Nadler and the Judiciary Committee Democrats as they proceed with their investigation ‘to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment to the full House,’ as the resolution states.” But that statement also seemed to contradict Nadler’s position, as a Politico reporter noted. Confused? You’re not alone. House Democrats’ messaging on impeachment has become increasingly muddled, likely in an attempt to appease the progressive and moderate wings of their caucus. But the strategy is starting to irritate even fellow Democrats, as demonstrated by this tweet from a former senior adviser to Barack Obama. It appears Trump was similarly vague on supporting a background check expansion while meeting with a bipartisan group of senators earlier today. Toomey, a Democrat, and Manchin, a Republican, were the architects of a 2013 proposal to expand background checks to gun shows and Internet sales, which was defeated in the Senate. Murphy, a Democrat, has been a fierce advocate for strengthening gun laws since the Sandy Hook shooting took place in his home state of Connecticut. Asked about what gun proposals he is considering after last month’s mass shootings, Trump offered no clarity, surely enraging the Democratic leaders calling on him to endorse the House-approved background checks bill. “There’s a lot of things under discussion,” the president said. “Some things will never happen … and some very meaningful things can happen.” Keep in mind that this was in response to a question about whether Trump would support background checks on all private gun sales. So the president responded to a very specific question with an exceedingly vague response, which doesn’t inspire much confidence about actually getting a gun bill signed. While speaking to reporters in the Oval Office today, Trump was asked about the New York Times’ reporting that senior White House officials were involved in pressuring the NOAA to back up the president’s false hurricane claim. “No I never did that,” Trump told reporters. “I never did that. That’s a whole hoax by the fake news media, when they talk about the hurricane and when they talk about Florida and when they talk about Alabama. That’s just fake news … it’s a fake story.” But another outlet, the Washington Post, has now confirmed the Times’ reporting, adding that the president himself pressed his staff on the issue. President Trump told his staff that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration needed to deal with a tweet that seemed to contradict his statement that Hurricane Dorian posed a significant threat to Alabama as of Sept. 1, in contrast to what the agency’s forecasters were predicting at the time, senior administration officials said. This led chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to call Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to tell him to fix the issue, the officials said. Trump had complained for several days about the issue, according to the senior officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. Mulvaney then called Ross but did not instruct him to threaten any firings or make any punitive threats, officials said. He simply told Ross that the agency needed to fix the matter immediately, leading to a new statement that was issued Friday, Sept. 6. A Chinese woman who was arrested at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida club, earlier this year was found guilty of lying to a Secret Service agent and trespassing. NBC News reports on the bizarre trial: Jurors handed down the verdict against Yujing Zhang on Wednesday. Zhang was arrested on March 30 after she allegedly told a Secret Service agent guarding Mar-a-Lago that she was there to use the pool. Once inside the posh Palm Beach resort she told a receptionist she was there to take pictures for a United Nations friendship event. Prosecutors said Zhang knew that the event had been canceled. The trial had several twists and turns. The 33-year-old consultant from Shanghai fired her public defenders in June and chose to represent herself, a decision Judge Roy Altman did not like. He tried several times during the trial to convince Zhang to let her public defenders try the case but she refused. ... She was charged with unlawful entry of restricted buildings and grounds and false statements and was convicted on both counts. Oil tycoon and corporate raider-turned philanthropist T. Boone Pickens, who amassed a fortune and and gave much of it away, has died. He was 91 and lately had become an advocate for renewable energy. Spokesman Jay Rosser confirmed Pickens’ death Wednesday to The Associated Press. Pickens made his first millions in oil, burnishing an image as a maverick, unafraid to take on giants in the oil patch. Even his name seemed to fit, like central casting’s idea of what an oilman should be named. Starting in the 1980s, he became known for launching hostile corporate takeover bids that often resulted in a huge payoff. His fortune soared into the billions. Pickens flirted with the idea of marketing water from West Texas to the state’s metropolitan areas. In a break from his past, he also developed wind farms. In an interview with the Guardian at the Dallas offices of his new wind turbine venture 11 years ago, he said: “Don’t get the idea that I’ve turned green. My business is making money, and I think this is going to make a lot of money.” A busy news morning and every chance the rest of the day will continue in the same vein. Here are the main developments so far: Donald Trump said his administration will propose banning flavored e-cigarettes over health concerns about vaping, especially among children. He spoke at an Oval Office briefing for reporters, with Melania Trump present. Gone John. Trump said of departing national security adviser John Bolton “I hope we left in good stead” after yesterday’s sudden firing of the longtime Republican hawk, over policy and personality clashes. At a ceremony at the Pentagon to mark the 18th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks by Al-Qaida, the president repeated a dubious claim about time spent at “Ground Zero” as the attack site in New York was known. Trump slammed leaders of the Federal Reserve as “boneheads”, in another attack on chairman Jerome Powell, demanding lower interest rates. More on Trump’s tension with Bolton: the president said he bristled at the national security adviser’s positions on Venezuela and North Korea. But those stances were well known for much of Bolton’s tenure and, in the case of Venezuela, bolstered by the administration’s own position. For example, Trump said, “When [Bolton] talked about the Libyan model for Kim Jong-un, that was not a good statement to make. ... It set us back.” But a Post reporter noted that comment came more than a year before Bolton’s ouster. Alexander Azar, the health and human services secretary, provided additional clarification on the new regulation after Trump’s Oval Office meeting with reporters. E-cigarette companies appeared taken aback by the White House’s announcement, if this comment to a CBS News reporter is any indication. But some of Trump’s former aides may use their influence to try to change the president’s mind in the coming weeks, a Politico reporter noted. Minor correction: the White House does not appear to be trying to ban vaping entirely. The FDA is looking at banning flavored e-cigarettes, which are particularly popular among the industry’s youngest customers. Trump has now concluded his Oval Office meeting with reporters, where he announced the planned regulation on e-cigarette companies. But the president touched on a number of other topics while taking reporters’ questions, including the ouster of his now-former national security adviser, John Bolton. “I hope we left on good stead, but maybe we haven’t,” Trump said. Given that the president appeared to fire Bolton by tweet and then Bolton almost immediately contradicted Trump’s version of events in his own tweet, it seems safe to say that they did not leave on “good stead.” “John wasn’t in line with what we were doing,” the president said in explanation of Bolton’s departure. But Trump emphasized he would not have trouble filling the job: “We have a lot of good people who want that position. ... We’ll have five people who want it very much.” Trump said he would announce his new national security adviser, his fourth in less than three years, next week. It appears e-cigarette companies will have some time to prepare for (and likely lobby against) the proposed ban. Trump noted in his informal announcement of the policy that the first lady has been passionate about the issue. “She’s got a son ... she feels very strongly about it,” the president said of his wife and the son they share, Barron. Trump is attempting to crack down on e-cigarette products despite the fact that several of his former advisers have gone on to work for Juul, one of the biggest suppliers of e-cigarettes. Trump denied he had any involvement with his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, pressuring the NOAA to back the president’s false hurricane claim, as the New York Times just reported. Trump is taking questions from reporters in the Oval Office and said he would announce a new national security adviser to replace John Bolton next week. The president said Bolton “wasn’t in line with what we were doing” and that his hawkish history was unflattering to leaders like Kim Jong-un. The health and human services secretary, Alexander Azar, said his department was currently finalizing the guidance on banning flavored e-cigarettes. The first lady, who was present for Trump’s e-cigarette announcement in the Oval Office, tweeted Monday about the “epidemic” of the product’s use among minors. Trump just announced in an Oval Office meeting with White House reporters that the Food and Drug Administration is banning flavored e-cigarettes. Michigan became the first state to ban flavored e-cigarettes earlier this month, falling in the footsteps of liberal cities that have done the same. Jessica Glenza reported a week ago: Michigan’s Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer announced the state health department would immediately ban retail and online sales of flavored e-cigarettes through an emergency rule-making process. The move will prohibit the sale, and the misleading marketing, of flavored nicotine vaping products. ‘I’ve got teenagers at home,’ Whitmer said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Wednesday. ‘I was talking with them about the prevalence of vaping in their schools, and it’s everywhere.’ Whitmer said she was concerned about fruit and candy flavored e-cigarettes being marketed to children as healthier alternatives to smoking. Trump appears to be planning to make an announcement about e-cigarettes any minute at the White House. At least three people have died recently as a result of a severe respiratory illness linked to vaping, Jessica Glenza reported last week. Officials are investigating more than 450 possible cases of a severe breathing illness among otherwise ‘healthy young people’, they said on Friday. Possible cases have been identified across 33 states and one US territory. Symptoms of the illness include vomiting, nausea, shortness of breath, coughing and chest pain. All confirmed cases appear to have a kind of non-infectious pneumonia, called lipoid pneumonia, developed when oil is inhaled. In all confirmed cases, patients vaped either nicotine or the marijuana constituent THC in the last 90 days. An estimated 9 million adults and 3.6 million US teenagers vape, including 20% of high school students. It looks like the president may be preparing to speak to reporters at the White House, so stay tuned. White House officials were directly involved with efforts to pressure the NOAA to affirm Trump’s false claim that Hurricane Dorian was threatening Alabama, the New York Times reports. Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, told Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, to have the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration publicly disavow the forecasters’ position that Alabama was not at risk. NOAA, which is part of the Commerce Department, issued an unsigned statement last Friday in response, saying that the Birmingham, Ala., office was wrong to dispute the president’s warning. In pressing NOAA’s acting administrator to take action, Mr. Ross warned that top employees at the agency could be fired if the situation was not addressed, The New York Times previously reported. Mr. Ross’s spokesman has denied that he threatened to fire anyone, and a senior administration official on Wednesday said Mr. Mulvaney did not tell the commerce secretary to make such a threat. Quick reminder: this whole controversy stems from an incorrect tweet the president sent more than a week ago. If he had just corrected himself and left it at that, the White House could have avoided all of this bad press. But acknowledging fault isn’t really Trump’s style. A third former aide to John Bolton has announced she will also leave the National Security Agency. Reuters has more on the departures: Garrett Marquis, Bolton’s top spokesman, Sarah Tinsley, his communications director, and scheduler Christine Samuelian all resigned in what a source called an amicable fashion. ‘It was an honor to serve my country, and I wish the president and the administration success moving forward,’ Marquis said in a brief statement. The trio of aides has worked for Bolton for years. Meanwhile, fallout continues from Trump’s abrupt firing of his national security adviser, John Bolton. (Or did he resign? More on that later.) At least two of Bolton’s closest aides at the National Security Council have announced they will also leave their roles. Trump’s acting chief of staff said yesterday there would not be mass firings at the agency in light of Bolton’s departure, but the former national security adviser’s allies likely see little reason to stick around. Several Democratic presidential candidates have shared statements and remembrances in honor of the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. “I was a sophomore in college when the planes hit. My roommates and I sat transfixed on a futon, glued to the horror unfolding on NBC’s Today Show,” wrote Pete Buttigieg, a veteran who served in Afghanistan. “Years later, I would find myself carrying an M-4 in Kabul, Afghanistan — the country that had hosted the men who had conceived and implemented unimaginable attacks against other human beings. But in that moment I just sat there, stunned.” Several other Democratic candidates expressed their gratitude for the first responders and remembered the attacks’ victims. And Bernie Sanders used the anniversary as an opportunity to discuss his foreign policy proposals: A New York Times reporter who previously covered the rebuilding of the World Trade Center said back in July, when the president claimed he spent “a lot of time” at Ground Zero, that she recalled only one instance of Trump visiting the site. She also drew a distinction between Trump and the first responders who came to the aid of the attacks’ victims: While speaking at the Pentagon’s 9/11 memorial ceremony, the president also repeated his dubious claim that he went down to Ground Zero shortly after the attacks. Trump recounted how he was watching CNBC when the first plane struck the World Trade Center. “I was looking out of a window from a building in midtown Manhattan directly at the World Trade Center when I saw the second plane at a tremendous speed go into the second tower,” Trump said. “It was then that I realized the world was going to change.” He continued: “Soon after I went down to Ground Zero with men who worked for me to try to help in any little way that we could. We were not alone.” Trump similarly said back in July, while signing a bill to fund the medical care of 9/11 first responders, that he spent “a lot of time” at Ground Zero. But Richard Alles, a retired deputy chief with the New York Fire Department, cast doubt on that. “I spent many months there myself, and I never witnessed him,” Alles told the New York Times in July. “He was a private citizen at the time. I don’t know what kind of role he could have possibly played.” Here is Trump’s full quote on the canceled Taliban peace talks while speaking at the Pentagon’s 9/11 memorial ceremony: “We had peace talks scheduled a few days ago. I called them off when I learned that they had killed a great American soldier from Puerto Rico and 11 other innocent people. They thought they would use this attack to show strength, but actually what they showed is unrelenting weakness. The last four days, we have hit our enemy harder than they have ever been hit before. And that will continue. “And if for any reason, they come back to our country, we will go wherever they are, and use power, the likes of which the United States has never used before. And I’m not even talking about nuclear power. They will never have seen anything like what will happen to them. No enemy on earth can match the overwhelming strength skill and might of the American armed forces.” The president has just finished speaking at the Pentagon’s memorial ceremony for the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. It’s safe to say he likely went off the teleprompter a bit. Most notably, Trump invoked his scrapped plans to hold peace talks with the Taliban at Camp David. “We had peace talks scheduled a few days ago,” Trump told the crowd assembled at one of the sites of the attacks that collectively killed thousands. “I called them off when I learned that they had killed a great American soldier from Puerto Rico and 11 other innocent people ... The last four days we have hit our enemy harder than they have ever been hit before.” One reporter described the audience’s response as “polite.” Joe Biden released a statement in honor of the 9/11 anniversary, saying the event “has become synonymous with America’s iron will to never bend, never break in the face of terror.” “It’s also become a reminder of who we are as a nation and what Americans are capable of when we come together, united in shared purpose,” said the Democratic presidential candidate, who was in the Senate when the attacks occurred. Biden concluded: “This year, on 9/11, we once more honor the memories of those Americans whose lives were too cruelly cut short, and we renew our commitment to upholding the best of what it means to be an American—and to all that sets the United States apart.” More on that Washington Post/ABC News poll: Joe Biden has the largest lead over Trump in a hypothetical match-up, besting the president by 15 points. Bernie Sanders holds a 9-point lead over Trump, and Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris both have 7-point leads. Pete Buttigieg has a more narrow lead over Trump that falls within the poll’s margin of error. So overall, the poll is good news for Democrats. But pollsters and strategists are historically skeptical of general election polls this far out from Election Day. The Fed isn’t the only thing irking the president this morning. More results have been released from the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll, and they show Trump trailing Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris in hypothetical general election match-ups. This two-part tweet thread continues several falsehoods, not to mention the derogatory nickname he throws in for Warren, so let’s take them one at a time. First of all, as the blog covered yesterday, the Washington Post/ABC News poll is well regarded. It has an A+ rating from the polling and analysis website FiveThirtyEight. Second of all, the outlets’ final poll before the general election in 2016 showed that Hillary Clinton would beat Trump nationally by 4 points. That was very close to the actual result, where Clinton defeated Trump in the popular vote by 2 points. (She obviously lost the Electoral College and the presidency along with it.) Third, there is no evidence that pollsters are skewing their results in an attempt to undermine Trump. Fourth, Trump has been campaigning since he took office. He has held campaign rallies consistently since his inauguration. Fifth, Russia’s 2016 election interference is very much confirmed and is not at all “fake news.” Sixth, Trump has egregiously exaggerated how much Dan Bishop, the Republican who won last night’s special congressional race in North Carolina, was down in the polls. It’s amazing how many falsehoods can be stuffed into two 280-character tweets. Good morning, live blog readers — I hope you all take a moment today to remember the 2,997 people lost 18 years ago. Our president’s focus seems to be drifting toward other topics this morning. While simultaneous celebrating his party’s narrow victory last night in a North Carolina special congressional race, Donald Trump is lashing out against the leaders of the Federal Reserve as “Boneheads.” The central bank is expected to once again lower interest rates next week after doing so for the first time in a decade during its July meeting. But that doesn’t seem to be appeasing Trump, who has previously complained that the Fed’s chairman, Jerome Powell, supposedly raised interest rates too fast and then lowered them too slowly. This is very well-trodden territory for Trump. He has repeatedly lashed out against Powell to blame the chairman for the slowing US economy, even though the president’s trade war has done far more damage in that arena. But this poll released yesterday, showing a majority of Americans expect a recession in the next year, is almost certainly on the president’s mind, too. Trump is counting on a strong economy to win re-election. If he doesn’t have it, he’ll at least need a bogeyman to blame for the slump. Why not the Fed chairman? Here’s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Americans across the country will recognize the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Trump and the first lady are attending a 9/11 observance ceremony at the Pentagon. Robert Wilkie, the VA secretary, will continue his five-day trip through Israel. The blog is watching all of that, so stay tuned."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/jul/28/the-guardian-view-on-hinkley-c-wrong-project-wrong-price","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-28T18:54:40Z","webTitle":"Hinkley C is the wrong project at the wrong price | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/the-guardian-view-on-hinkley-c-wrong-project-wrong-price","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/28/the-guardian-view-on-hinkley-c-wrong-project-wrong-price","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Hinkley C: wrong project, wrong price","bodyText":"The French energy giant EDF today finally decided to go ahead with Hinkley C . It may be a disaster for the largely state-owned company. If the British government now gives the nod to the first round of subsidies, it will surely be a disaster for British energy policy. This is not an untested model – worse than that. Its two sister stations, currently under construction in Finland and France, are overdue and over budget. Hinkley is predicted to cost £18bn to build, and it will cost consumers upwards of £30bn to run. It will displace billions of pounds of investment that could otherwise be spent reducing demand and developing renewable alternatives. The new prime minister and her ministers at the Department of Business and Energy, Greg Clark and Nick Hurd, should use the prerogative of a new government: stop it, now. The justification for Hinkley C, originally conceived under Labour in 2008 and signed off by the coalition in 2011, is that when it finally comes on stream, perhaps in 2025, it will provide a large amount of carbon-free energy generation – 7% of total demand, which cannot be met by the weather-dependent energy that comes from renewables such as wind or solar. It will be a vital contribution to the UK’s low-carbon energy target. It looks like a bold solution to a big problem. But it is not. The technology is too uncertain, and the scale is too large: so huge that it has been described as like building a cathedral within a cathedral. The construction costs are so great that EDF has had to be guaranteed a price for the electricity it generates that is higher than the cost of off-shore wind (which is expected to come down), and linked to the rate of inflation; to help finance it, the Chinese are providing £6bn and will own a third of the plant. The government likes to suggest that there is no alternative. That is not what energy experts think. They point to different technologies, such as the Japanese-made advanced boiling water reactor, once scheduled to be built on Anglesey but now threatened by the voracious demands for cash of Hinkley C, or the US-made pressurised water reactor, the AP1000. The Chinese, keen to have viable European projects as a calling card for their own nuclear industry, may build modular reactors in East Anglia. Better than any of these nuclear options, however, would be investment in renewables. Technology for tidal energy that will come from projects like the lagoons at Cardiff and Swansea is maturing. One of the world’s largest proposed wind farms, at Dogger Bank, off the north-east Yorkshire coast, could challenge the output from Hinkley C. More extensive interconnection with France, Norway and Denmark could smooth supplies. Most effectively, an investment of less than £1bn a year in domestic and industrial energy efficiency would halve demand by 2050. Hinkley C has been repeatedly delayed by the EDF board in Paris; the unions think it will jeopardise their jobs. Two directors have resigned in protest. The project has been staggering along for years. Governments always fear changing their minds. But Theresa May says she wants to do things differently. She should start here. • This article was amended on 29 July 2016.

The information commissioner’s office has turned down a freedom of information (FoI) request for state aid arrangements between the UK and the European commission to be made public. The FoI complainant, David Lowry, has launched an appeal, claiming it is in the public interest for British citizens to be able to judge whether their government had made the right decision about the new reactors in Somerset. Lowry, a British-based senior research fellow with the Institute for Resource and Security Studies in the US, said: “I do not believe the balance of judgment should be in favour of a foreign company, EDF Energy, who will potentially make huge multibillion-pound financial gain from the continued non-disclosure, and hence non scrutiny, over myself as a British tax and electricity bill payer.” The government said that anyone building new reactors in Britain must manage and pay for the cost of handling waste products, unlike the existing situation where all radioactive materials are effectively dealt with through the public purse via the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. However, although the operator must agree to take responsibility for the spent fuel and other radioactive waste, the cost is expected to be passed on to the domestic electricity user through higher bills. Under the new arrangements, the prospective nuclear operators must enter into a waste transfer contract (WTC). Those contracts, like the one covering Hinkley, must be submitted for scrutiny by the EC under its state aid rules. It is the pricing methodology of the WTC that Lowry wished to review and which remains under wraps. Greenpeace said Lowry raised critical issues that went to the heart of whether the £18.5bn project was good or bad value for the taxpayer and British energy consumers. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace, said: “The government has repeatedly said that Hinkley is great news for the British public and our energy security. But they refuse to back this up with hard evidence. In fact, DECC is incredibly cagey and is failing to answer questions on where the dangerous radioactive waste will go or how much Hinkley will cost us. “If Hinkley is such a good deal, it should be no problem for the government to release the information to prove it. Their failure to do so leaves us to believe that their assumptions are correct - it’s a terrible deal for bill payers and they simply don’t know what to do with the nuclear waste.” DECC turned down the original request under regulation 12(5)(a) of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 arguing, “disclosure would adversely affect international relations, defence, national security or public safety”. This argument was accepted by the information commissioner who believed that disclosure of the state aid discussions with the EC “would adversely affect the relationship between the (UK) government and the commission’s ability to work effectively together”. The information commissioner acknowledged that there were “strong public interest arguments in favour of disclosure” but he believed there was a stronger argument for protecting the confidentiality of the material. Lowry said he thought the real reason the government did not want to disclose the information was to save ministers from embarrassment. “I think the concern is if the truth were to come out with documents being made public would adversely affect the credibility of the government submissions as their threadbare content would be laid bare for all to see,” he said. DECC declined to comment, saying it was a matter for the information commissioner."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/may/20/hitachi-hnuclear-plant-wales-hinkley-point-edf-bechtel","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-20T12:51:38Z","webTitle":"Hitachi heads up new bid to build nuclear plant in Wales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/20/hitachi-hnuclear-plant-wales-hinkley-point-edf-bechtel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/may/20/hitachi-hnuclear-plant-wales-hinkley-point-edf-bechtel","fields":{"headline":"Hitachi heads up new bid to build nuclear plant in Wales","bodyText":"Hitachi has unveiled a construction consortium to build a £10bn nuclear power station in Wales “on time and on budget”, as a rival to the French-backed plans for Hinkley Point C. There are no British firms involved but among the partners of the Japanese firm are Bechtel of the US, which has just brought a new atomic power plant online in America, but is better known here for work on the Channel tunnel and CrossRail. Hitachi has yet to reach agreement on financial subsidies from the UK government for the planned new plant at Wylfa, in Anglesey, and its reactor design is yet to be officially approved in this country. But the Japanese firm is aiming to have the 2,700MW reactors on stream by 2025 aided by the fact that it is using a reactor design that has already been proved to work in a number of domestic projects. That puts the Horizon project in Wales in competition with Hinkley, which EDF hopes to open around the same time, although the Somerset scheme has already been delayed and hit by EDF’s own financing problems. Malcolm Twist, project director for the Menter Newydd construction consortium involving Hitachi, Bechtel and Japanese engineering group JGC, said all the partners were proven at the highest level. “I’m delighted we’ve established the balance of expertise to safely deliver for Horizon, on cost and on schedule. We expect to begin firming up relationships with our main subcontractors – many of them British – very soon.” The government is no doubt relieved to see a second nuclear project moving forward after a raft of headlines caused by internal disagreements at EDF over the £18bn cost of Hinkley. Andrea Leadsom, the energy and climate change minister, said she was pleased to see a new project taking shape at the Wylfa site where an old plant is now being decommissioned. “We have to replace our ageing energy infrastructure and new nuclear is an essential part of our plan to power the country now and for the next generation. “Keeping the lights on is non-negotiable, and new nuclear is the only proven low-carbon technology that can provide clean, continuous power, irrespective of whether the wind is blowing and the sun is shining.” Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: “The appointment of the delivery team for the Wylfa Newydd project is a vital step in ensuring the UK has the infrastructure and generating capacity to meet its energy needs in the future. “North Wales has a long established and highly skilled nuclear workforce who will warmly welcome today’s announcement. Menter Newydd has vast global delivery expertise and the UK supply chain is ready to make the most of the opportunities the project will bring.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/aug/05/brazilian-hiroshima-survivors-campaign-against-new-push-for-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-05T11:00:10Z","webTitle":"Brazilian Hiroshima survivors campaign against new push for nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/05/brazilian-hiroshima-survivors-campaign-against-new-push-for-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/aug/05/brazilian-hiroshima-survivors-campaign-against-new-push-for-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Brazilian Hiroshima survivors campaign against new push for nuclear power","bodyText":"Seventy years on and more than 10,000 miles away, a group of atomic bombing survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki are campaigning for a nuclear-free world in their adopted home of Brazil. Despite their advanced age – some are in their 90s – they have stepped up their activities this year both to mark the anniversary of the US attacks, and to oppose the Brazilian government’s plans to more than double nuclear power generation. The survivors – known in Japanese as hibakusha – were among a wave of 20th-century migrants who moved across the world in search of a better life. There are now believed to be more than 1.5 million people of Japanese descent in Brazil – the biggest diaspora in the world. More than 100 of them are registered survivors of the bombings on 6 and 9 August 1945, a trauma that continues to define their identities despite the intervening distance and years. Takashi Morita was 21 years old when Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima. “I was walking on the street, when suddenly paaaaa! a big flash and then everything collapsed,” he recalls. Morita was burned and injured by debris, but recovered and 10 years later took a boat to start afresh in Brazil, which relaxed restrictions on Asian immigrants in the late 1950s. Like many of his counterparts in Japan, he and other hibakusha formed a peace association dedicated to banning nuclear weapons and closing nuclear power plants. In the 1970s and 80s, both were a major concern in Brazil. The military dictatorship – in competition with Argentina – had launched an atomic weapons programme, starting with construction of two pressurised water reactors at Angra dos Reis in Rio de Janeiro state. Public fears about radiation hit a peak in 1987 when a capsule of caesium 137 from a radiotherapy device was taken from an abandoned hospital and lead to widespread contamination and the death of at least four people. The hibakusha have worked with victims’ groups of this and other contamination cases to raise public awareness of radiation risks posed by power plants, waste dumps, mines, factories, medical devices and mineral dumps – including more than a thousand tonnes of uranium and thorium residues which are still held at a former Nuclemon site in a densely populated neighbourhood of São Paulo. “Many people don’t know that radiation is so close to our lives. People must be aware of it, what radiations are and what kind of effect they have in our body,” said Junko Kosumo, a hibakusha who lives in São Paulo. “We must pass on [what we know of the risks] to future generations. Brazil’s anti-nuclear campaigners claimed a victory in 1990, when the government renounced its nuclear weapon ambitions. They have also been relieved by long hold-ups in reactor construction plans. Today, Brazil still has only two nuclear reactors, which generate 3% of its electricity. But, under the Workers party, the government has resurrected the nuclear energy program as a back-up to hydroelectric dams during the dry season. The state-run operator, Electronuclear, has resumed construction of a third reactor at Angra, which is due for completion in 2019 after a two-decade delay. Earlier this year, the energy minister, Eduardo Braga, announced that he was looking for private sector investment for another long-mooted plan to build four new nuclear plants. Opponents, however, question the wisdom of any expansion, considering the industry – even at its relatively small scale – has been hit by a succession of accidents and scandals. In February, Angra 1 had to be powered down after a cooling system problem. Last month Othon Luiz Pinheiro da Silva, a retired admiral who heads Electronuclear (and formerly ran a government project to build nuclear submarines), was arrested for allegedly taking 4.5m reais (£800,000) in bribes from engineering firms working on Angra 3. Such cases give the hibakusha fresh motivation to continue their long struggle. Morita makes at least one visit each month to a church, school or university. This June, he estimates he gave 20 lectures. He has also been to the Angra site to register his opposition to the construction of the third reactor. This week, anti-nuclear groups will attend an exhibition in Angra on the fallout from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. “We have to warn the population of the danger. I believe that Brazil, being a country that is close to the equator with a tropical climate has no need for nuclear energy,” said André Lopes Loula, a teacher who works with the hibakusha. Morita, meanwhile, is in Japan to mark the 70th anniversary commemorations. Speaking by phone from Hiroshima, he said that after he returns to Brazil, he will continue the work that has defined his life. “I experienced the bomb. I saw many die. I have lived until now with a spirit dedicated to ensuring humanity never again sees such a terrible thing.” Additional reporting by Shanna Hanbury"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2017/nov/28/it-feels-a-little-forgotten-west-somerset-bears-brunt-of-social-mobility-challenge","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-28T19:35:55Z","webTitle":"'It feels a little forgotten': West Somerset bears brunt of social mobility challenge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/28/it-feels-a-little-forgotten-west-somerset-bears-brunt-of-social-mobility-challenge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2017/nov/28/it-feels-a-little-forgotten-west-somerset-bears-brunt-of-social-mobility-challenge","fields":{"headline":"'It feels a little forgotten': West Somerset bears brunt of social mobility challenge","bodyText":"“I don’t want to sound super bleak, but this isn’t the greatest place to live,” said 19-year-old Emily Hunter. “It feels like there’s a lack of opportunity. As a young person you want options. I’m not sure there are that many options around here.” Hunter is a volunteer helper at the Minehead Eye youth centre on the West Somerset coast. As she spoke, 10-year-olds whizzed around a skate park on scooters. “I look at them and worry for their futures – which is pretty sad. It’s beautiful round here, but it feels a little forgotten.” West Somerset is certainly picturesque. Hikers enjoy tramping across Exmoor, the Quantock Hills and the Brendon Hills; tourists head in their droves to the coast to visit the spectacular Dunster Castle or stay at the Butlin’s holiday resort. There are good reasons to live in West Somerset if you have money. It is peaceful and spacious – and, with fewer than 35,000 inhabitants, it has the lowest population density of all local authority districts in England. Little wonder that it is popular with retirees, who push the average age up to 54. For younger people it is much more challenging. The difficulty they face was confirmed on Tuesday when the area placed bottom of a league table charting prospects for those from disadvantaged backgrounds, drawn up by the Social Mobility Commission. The report flagged up a lack of job opportunities, poor wages, problems in education, high house prices (which are inflated by those retirees) and the very remoteness of the area as reasons for its poor standing. Another volunteer at the Minehead Eye, 19-year-old Mason Hawker, summed up the area as “a bit barren”. “I don’t want to knock it. A lot of people like to live here. If you’re older, if you like the quiet life or walking, for example, there’s a lot here for you. Its much harder for younger people to make their way.” Career choices are limited. Three sectors – restaurants and hotels, retail and wholesale, health and social care – make up 52% of all jobs in West Somerset, compared with 36% in England overall. The average wage is £312 a week, less than half of the best-performing areas of Wandsworth, Richmond upon Thames and Westminster. Courtney-Paige Pugh, 16, tried to break away from the West Somerset coast by signing up to study child development in Bridgwater, 26 miles away, but only lasted a month. To get to her lectures in time she had to catch a bus at 7am. The journey lasted an hour and a half each way. She got home at 6pm every night, got changed and left for her shifts working as a waitress to help pay her way. “It was really draining,” she said. “I had to pack it in. Everyone says that Minehead is the end of the road. When you’re born here, you’re stuck here. It does feel like that sometimes.” Courtney-Paige landed on her feet and was taken on as an apprentice at the Beach Hotel, which is run by the charity YMCA Somerset Coast. “I like it here and I’m learning a lot, but I don’t know what I’ll do in the end.” Her colleague, Charlie Osborne, 19, is an apprentice chef at the hotel. But that apprenticeship finishes soon and he doesn’t think he will carry on working in West Somerset. “It’s too small,” he said. “I think I’ll need to move away to make a career and keep moving forward.” As part of a government drive to help, West Somerset was chosen as an “Opportunity Area”, one of 12 parts of the country receiving government funding to improve social mobility. It will get a share of a £60m pot. One catalyst for change flagged up in the report is the building of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, which is creating thousands of jobs in Somerset. But the need to improve education is central. Just over half the children in West Somerset achieved a good level of development at the end of reception in 2015-16, compared with almost 70% nationally. A significantly lower proportion of pupils from West Somerset go on to attend higher education compared to elsewhere. Only 26% of 16- to 18-year-olds who took A-levels or other level 3 qualifications in the 2013-14 academic year attended university the following year, compared with 38% in Somerset as a whole and 49% nationally. Susan Clowes, the manager at the independent advice centre in Minehead, tries to point people in the right direction. “I feel the population is dispirited. It’s almost as if life is done to them. They just grab what they can. We deal with a lot of people here who are not profligate, who spend every penny wisely and still struggle.” Frances Nicholson, the Somerset county council cabinet member for children and families, said solving the issue of social mobility was crucial. “The population is unbalanced,” he said. “If we don’t address it eventually there will be no society, no community. It’s as stark as that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/mar/25/foreign-firms-flock-to-build-nuclear-plants-in-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-25T16:00:06Z","webTitle":"Foreign companies flock to build nuclear plants in the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/25/foreign-firms-flock-to-build-nuclear-plants-in-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/mar/25/foreign-firms-flock-to-build-nuclear-plants-in-uk","fields":{"headline":"Foreign companies flock to build nuclear plants in the UK","bodyText":"Nuclear energy faces an uncertain future globally as concerns over safety and cost dog the industry. But in the UK, foreign investors are queueing up to back projects. The latest is South Korea. Its biggest power company is in talks to join the consortium backing a nuclear power station in Cumbria, in a sign of the continuing allure of Britain’s atomic ambitions to international companies. Kepco said last week it was interested in taking a stake in NuGen, which is 60% owned by Japan’s Toshiba and 40% by France’s Engie, confirming what had been an open secret in the industry for months. Kepco’s president, Cho Hwan-eik, said that once the terms of a potential deal were ironed out, “we will be the first to jump into the race”. The idea of a Seoul-based company developing the Moorside plant near Sellafield is not as strange as it might seem. The UK government needs new nuclear power stations to meet greenhouse-gas reduction targets and keep the lights on as ageing coal and atomic plants are retired. This month, officials reiterated how important nuclear will be to Britain’s future energy security, with projections that showed 38% of power coming from nuclear by 2035, up from 24% last year. Potential investors have been drawn by the UK government’s enthusiasm and a nuclear standstill elsewhere, amid lingering safety fears in the wake of the Fukushima disaster and cost overruns at the Flamanville site in France which is using a new reactor design. As a result, South Korea has joined Japan, China and France in showing interest in British nuclear. “It’s pretty simple. We are the only people building new nuclear power stations and we have by far the biggest new nuclear programme outside China for the next 10 years,” said Peter Atherton, an analyst at consultancy Cornwall Energy. “The civil nuclear programme globally doesn’t have any orders.” One expert, Mycle Schneider, called the UK the “last hope” for the nuclear construction giants of the world. The Paris-based nuclear consultant said: “In Korea the political situation will dramatically change after the upcoming elections, [probably] not in favour of the nuclear industry. Success overseas will help survival at home. The Japanese industry clearly has no future at home and little prospects abroad [because of Fukushima].” The UK has also dangled the prospect of economic support for foreign nuclear builders. French state-owned EDF, which is building two new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset at a cost of £18bn, struck a subsidy contract with the government that will see it guaranteed twice the wholesale price of electricity for 35 years. The deal means Hinkley would be an “absolute goldmine” when operational, Atherton said. He said UK financial support was not dissimilar to the deal Kepco has in the United Arab Emirates, where it is building four new reactors paid for by the UAE’s state-owned utility. “The economics of the project, and the economic risks of the project, fall on the host government,” said Atherton. There is also the prospect that the UK government could take a stake in one of the new nuclear sites. Leaks to Japanese media revealed officials in London and Tokyo had discussed the UK offering state finance to a project led by Japan’s Hitachi to build reactors next to the site of an old one at Wylfa in Wales. Another lure for foreign companies is the prestige of having their reactor design pass the UK’s strict regulatory and licensing process. Antony Froggatt, a nuclear expert at the thinktank Chatham House, said: “It gives you that important status for getting orders elsewhere.” That is particularly true of the Chinese state-owned company, which is providing a third of the money for Hinkley and whose design for a reactor at Bradwell, Essex is expected to complete the UK regulatory process in 2021. “It would be important because it would be first time that reactor type was built outside China, so having it approved by the UK regulator would be significant,” said Atherton. Kepco’s motives for the Moorside interest are not yet clear. It may want to get a foothold in the UK and provide the finance to build AP1000 reactors designed by Toshiba subsidiary Westinghouse, with the Office for Nuclear Regulation expected to give clearance for the technology imminently after a four-year process. But it is thought to be more likely that Kepco would want to build its own South Korea-designed reactors at the site. Froggatt said: “The question is, does Kepco want to build AP1000s? The answer is no, it doesn’t want to build them. If it went ahead, I assume they’re buying the site and infrastructure. I assume they would put their own reactor through the licensing process.” Kepco has a good recent track record of building reactors abroad. The first reactor in UAE is due to be connected to the grid this year, which Schneider said would be an “outstanding achievement” if achieved. In total, it operates 25 and is building three at home. The UK may be joining that list."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2019/nov/13/general-election-johnson-re-launches-tory-campaign-as-labour-unveils-nhs-plan-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-13T22:46:10Z","webTitle":"General election: Boris Johnson urges voters to reject 'Sturgeon-Corbyn alliance' – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/13/general-election-johnson-re-launches-tory-campaign-as-labour-unveils-nhs-plan-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2019/nov/13/general-election-johnson-re-launches-tory-campaign-as-labour-unveils-nhs-plan-live-news","fields":{"headline":"General election: Boris Johnson urges voters to reject 'Sturgeon-Corbyn alliance' – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s all from us for this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. For a comprehensive rundown of the day’s events, see my colleague Andrew Sparrow’s daily election briefing: And, since he put that together, Kate Hoey – who spent 30 years as a Labour MP – admitted she would be voting for the DUP at the general election. Hoey added she would otherwise vote for the Tories or the Brexit party. If you’d like to read yet more, my colleagues Rowena Mason and Josh Halliday have tonight’s main story: Hoey also said complained that MPs had spent the last two years trying to thwart Brexit, telling LBC: We’ve had two years of parliament – a remain parliament – doing everything they can to stop us leaving; by different methods and some not so serious as others. But most of the Labour MPs in there and a substantial number of Conservatives have tried to stop it. In fact, MPs voted to give Theresa May the power to trigger article 50 by a huge majority in February 2017. Hoey was then among the MPs who rejected her deal to leave the European Union in all three of the meaningful votes on it. More recently, the Commons voted to give a second reading to the legislation that would have enacted Boris Johnson’s deal to withdraw from the EU. It was the prime minister who pulled it because MPs refused to allow him to fast-track it through parliament. The former Labour MP, Kate Hoey, has admitted she will not be voting for the party in next month’s general election. She has told LBC radio this evening: I’m actually going to be voting in Northern Ireland and unfortunately the Labour party is so anti-democratic in Northern Ireland that they allow people to join but they don’t put up candidates. So, I’ll be voting for a pro-union candidate in Northern Ireland. Hoey confirmed she meant a DUP candidate, saying: I’m pro-union. I would not dream of voting for Sinn Féin, I wouldn’t dream of voting for the SDLP and the Alliance party is in hock with both. Hoey, whose three decades as a Labour MP ended at the dissolution of parliament a week ago, said the London constituency in which she lives – Bethnal Green and Bow – would remain strongly Labour, meaning her vote would be wasted there. She said she would advise those who “believe in Brexit”, which she identified as the main focus of the election, to “look at who’s standing in their constituency, what their views are on the EU, how they voted, have they delayed”. Asked if that meant she would have voted for the Brexit party or the Conservative party, had she chosen to vote in Great Britain, she said: Yes, I would. In this case, I think people have to realise the country comes before party politics in this election. And, for many people, that means – holding their nose, perhaps – but voting for parties that they may not have voted for in the past because they think that, actually, what we need to do is to get out and to honour that referendum. And I’m afraid the Labour party’s policies now on the EU are so confusing, so wrong and have reneged on everything that they promised at the last election. In May, Tony Blair’s former director of communications, Alastair Campbell, was automatically expelled from the party for saying he had voted for the Lib Dems in that month’s European elections. Labour has not yet said whether or not it will take similar action against Hoey. Earlier, we reported the former Conservative cabinet minister David Gauke’s claim that the Tories are not “being straight with the British public” when they say they can wrap up a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020 (see 7.41pm). This evening, the business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, insists they can do just that. She has told ITV’s Peston programme: We have to leave the European Union. We have to deliver on it. The fact is we are determined. I’m absolutely confident we will get that free trade deal done by the end of 2020. Until we reach the end of 2020, we won’t know for sure. What I’m saying is we can count on the fact that the prime minister managed to change the deal when people said he wouldn’t be able to. We do have a 30-plus-page political declaration that sets out that template for that deal. We have a firm commitment from the European Union to signing a deal by the end of 2020. And, if we can get a majority, we will also have a UK government and a UK parliament that is determined not just to leave the EU but to get that good deal that will work for the UK and for the European Union. My colleague, Lisa O’Carroll, has produced this fact-check on whether or not the UK really can get a deal done in that timeframe. As she points out, it took Canada and the EU seven years to come to a deal and experts say that, on average, trade deals take four years to negotiate: The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, has commented on Boris Johnson’s speech earlier this evening. She has said: If Boris Johnson is so keen on a ‘green industrial revolution’ why didn’t he announce one? Labour is rolling out policy after policy, but we’ve seen nothing from Boris Johnson. The Tories have scrapped solar subsidies, torpedoed carbon capture research, effectively banned new onshore wind and U-turned on banning fracking. The Tories are out of ideas. It’s time for real change with Labour. A lot of longstanding traditional Conservative voters are “very uncomfortable” with the party’s approach to Brexit, David Gauke has claimed. In particular, he cited a “failure to be straight with the British public that if we are going to get a free trade agreement with the European Union it’s going to take more than 11 months”. The former Tory, who is standing as an independent, has told Channel 4 News: It’s going to take some time and it’s simply not possible to do it on a timetable that says: ‘We will leave the implementation period do or die at the end of next year’. My point is not really about the merits in general of Boris Johnson. It is about a policy which I think is going to be very damaging to the country. I do think there is a failure to level with the British people that the idea that we’re just going to kind of get Brexit done on 31 January and then we can move on to other things and no-one will hear about Brexit ever again – it will all be in our past – simply doesn’t reflect the reality. He added: I think the Conservative party is not being straight with the British public, that this is more complex, that if we want to get a good settlement with the European Union then we are going to have to take longer to negotiate a free trade agreement and you simply cannot reconcile the reality with the government’s rhetoric. Gauke said the party has “changed very rapidly” in the last few months, adding that it should accommodate a range of views. But it is now taking a purity test if you like on Brexit. It is very focused on appealing to the supporters of Nigel Farage. Some of the reasons offered by the government for failing to release the report on Russian meddling in the democratic process before the election are “utterly bogus”, according to the former chair of the committee that produced it. Dominic Grieve, who sat at the head of the cross-party intelligence and security committee until the dissolution of parliament, has told LBC Radio this evening: I very much regret that this report as not published before the election because there was, in my view, absolutely no valid reason for that not happening. Indeed, we’d worked very hard and everybody knew we wanted to get it out before the election ... and we got the classification cleared so that we had worked with the intelligence agencies and the national security secretariat to ensure that it could be published. And they were completely satisfied. So, the sign-off from the prime minister I would normally have expected to be an issue of routine, which would – generally speaking – take place in 10 days. And, if there was a problem, I would expect to have heard directly from the prime minister as to what the problem was. He’s never indicated what it was. A whole series of explanations has been offered since; most of which, I’m afraid, don’t stack up. Some of them are utterly bogus. Asked if he felt Boris Johnson had “something to hide”, he said: I have no idea why he’s decided not to publish it and, in a way, I can’t comment beyond that because that places me at risk of revealing what the content of the report might be ... this committee doesn’t leak and, if the report is classified, then it remains classified. Grieve added that he was concerned the report might never come out at all. The Brexit party will refund its £100 fee to any general election candidate Nigel Farage has now ordered to stand down who wants it, a spokesman confirms. Farage said the Brexit party would no longer stand in any of the 317 constituencies won by the Tories in 2017 as he backed out of a fight with the party on Monday. Boris Johnson has refused to harden up his Brexit stance in a way that might have increased the chance of Nigel Farage giving the Conservative party a firmer electoral endorsement. Farage has already said that his Brexit party will not stand candidates in Tory-held seat and, ahead of the deadline tomorrow for nominations, he has been under pressure to withdraw his candidates in Labour-held marginals to help the Conservatives’ chances. There was speculation that an explicit commitment by Boris Johnson to have a no-deal Brexit by the end of 2020 if the UK-EU trade deal could not be agreed by then might have been enough to win Farage around. Farage hinted as much himself this afternoon. Johnson has ruled out extending the Brexit transition beyond the end of 2020. But in interviews this morning his ally Michael Gove repeatedly insisted that there was no prospect of a no-deal Brexit at the end of next year. And, in the Q&amp;A after his speech, Johnson also declined various opportunities to talk up his willingness to countenance a no-deal Brexit, in language that might appeal to Farage. Instead he just urged the Brexit party to back the Tories to get Brexit done. He said: I just want to say about Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party. It is always a very difficult thing for any party leader to withdraw candidates from an election and I understand that. But all I can say ... for the avoidance of doubt, to repeat my central message, there is only one way to ensure that we get Brexit done - get this thing finished, get us out, do a fantastic free-trade deal - and that is to vote for us and the Conservatives. Having earlier said that it might be possible for him to vote Tory in the election, Farage posted a tweet, at around the time Johnson’s Q&amp;A was coming to an end, saying that this was now impossible. This means the Tories are now set to face a Brexit party challenge in many or all of their target seats. Johnson’s unwillingness to harden up his Brexit stance probably tells little about the Brexit policy he would adopt if he won the election. It is more likely that he is worried that any further pivot towards Faragism would cost him more votes from remain-inclined Tories. Johnson has recast his opponents in the election as the “Sturgeon-Corbyn alliance”. Yesterday Jeremy Corbyn argued that the Brexit party decision to stand down in some seats meant Labour was fighting what amounted to a Trump/Farage/Johnson alliance. Today Johnson hit back by arguing that he too was up against an alliance. In his speech he argued: One thing is clear: the Sturgeon-Corbyn alliance would consign this country to months, if not years, of dither, delay, discord, division. When every month of pointless delay, insisted on by Corbyn by the way, is costing this country a billion pounds for nothing. This is a rehash of an argument that David Cameron used in 2015, when he argued that an Ed Miliband government would be dependent on SNP support. The argument reflected an assumption that Labour could not win an outright majority, but it also appealed to latent anti-Scottish sentiment amongst English voters uncomfortable at the idea of Scotland having an undue influence on UK policy. Johnson also repeated his long-standing claim that the “Sturgeon-Corbyn” alliance would hold two referendums this year, even though Labour is saying it would not agree to a second Scottish independence one until after the Scottish parliament elections in 2021. But as he delivered the speech, Johnson did not deliver the line about how more referendums would amount to “more political self-obsession and onanism”. He joked that this was because the press got hold of a “stray early draft”, but he knows full well the comment was in a text press-released by CCHQ. Johnson claimed that Corbyn was “naive” when he told an interviewer earlier that it would have been better if the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, had been arrested by US special forces, not killed by them. In response to a question that gave a partial account of what Corbyn said, Johnson replied: Al-Baghdadi was an absolute diabolical foe of this country, of our liberal values, everything we believe in and support. I think his [Corbyn’s] approach is naive and it is naive to the point of being dangerous. Corbyn did provoke outrage and incredulity in 2015 when he said it was a “tragedy” that Osama bin Laden had been killed by the US, not put on trial. But today, when asked if he also considered Baghdadi’s death a tragedy, Corbyn avoided that phrase and gave a measured response, arguing that if it had been possible to put Baghdadi on trial, that would have been preferable. Johnson said in his speech that, after Brexit, he wanted public procurement projects to prioritise hiring British apprentices. He said: We will insist that all big public sector projects must hire British apprentices so that they can learn new skills on the job. The former Conservative justice secretary David Gauke has urged people to vote for Liberal Democrat and independent candidates, saying a majority Tory government would lead to a “very hard Brexit” that would be “disastrous” for the UK. Jeremy Corbyn’s key union supporter, Unite’s Len McCluskey, has told the Labour leader that victory in the general election means winning over the party’s traditional working-class supporters with a tough line on free movement of workers. Labour’s NHS “rescue package” will be funded by higher income tax rates, at 45p for those earning more than £80,000 a year and 50p for those bringing in over £150,000, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said. Jo Swinson has sought to quell a mini-rebellion in the Liberal Democrats about whether to stand in highly marginal seats held by Labour over the Conservatives, insisting the party must give voters a genuine remain option in the election. That’s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is writing the blog now for the rest of the evening. Labour are casting this afternoon’s news that Royal Mail has won an injunction preventing the first national postal strike in a decade as evidence the system favours employers over workers. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, has said: The privatisation of Royal Mail has seen the denigration of postal workers’ terms and conditions, all whilst dividend payouts to private shareholders has reached £1bn. Companies should engage with their workforce, rather than take them to court. This injunction will solve nothing; only negotiations will. This is further evidence that the current system is rigged against workers and trade unions. Our hardworking postal workers deserve better, that’s why Labour will reverse the privatisation of Royal Mail. We will empower workers by repealing the trade union act, rolling out collective sectoral bargaining and strengthening workplace and trade union rights. Labour’s plans to transition from oil and gas will be the “polar opposite” of the Conservative move away from coal in the 1980s, the party’s Scottish leader has said. Speaking at a miners’ welfare in Uddingston, in South Lanarkshire, Richard Leonard said the “green industrial revolution” being touted by Labour will be “by consent”. We’re sitting here today in a miners’ welfare in the heart of the Lanarkshire coal field and it’s an important reminder that, if you just let the market wreak havoc through industries and communities, it can spell disaster. What we’ve said is in the change that’s needed in our economy, to net-zero carbon, we need to have a just transition. It needs to be a transition in such a way that communities are not left behind. The stark contrast of our approach, which will diversify the Scottish economy away from oil and gas, couldn’t be more polar opposite from the way the Tories handled the decline of the coal industry. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said he does not think his party’s environmental policy would spell the end for fossil fuels. He added that he was aware of the number of jobs dependent on the fossil fuel industry. That won’t end immediately, although obviously I want to end our reliance on fossil fuels. But that doesn’t mean there will never be any fossil fuels. It just means that it will form part of an energy system that is more sustainable for our natural world. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is now saying that he could not vote Conservative on the basis of what they have done this week. Earlier he suggested he might. (See 5.14pm.) Q: Corbyn has ruled out a second referendum next year. Aren’t you misleading the public by saying otherwise? And is not your deal with the Brexit party just as shady as any Labour/SNP cooperation? Johnson says the Tories do not do deals. On what he calls “the Sturgeon/Corbyn alliance”, he says Nicola Sturgeon is Jeremy Corbyn’s “path to power” and his “yoke-mate of destiny”. She wants a referendum next year. So it is hard to see how Corbyn could turn her down. He says this country has had enough of referendums like this. He wants to get on and get Brexit done, he says. He says the potential of this country is perfectly represented by the electric vehicles being made at this factory. He is going to turbocharge – if you can turbocharge an electric vehicle – the opportunities for this country. And that’s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: What will it mean if the Brexit party do stand against you? Johnson says his deal is ready to go. We can slam it in the oven, and be ready to leave in January. Q: Have you got a message for Nigel Farage? And why did you refer to onanism in the extracts released last night, when you did not use that word this afternoon? Johnson says he would urge people to back Conservative candidates. And he says the “onanism” reference was in a “stray early draft” of his speech. Q: (From the Daily Mail) Earlier today Jeremy Corbyn questioned the US government’s account of the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. [Er, not quite - see 4.28pm.] What is your reaction? Johnson says it is unrealistic to think Baghdadi could have been captured. He says he does not know the details of what Corbyn said. But if it is as the questioner suggested, Corbyn is being naive. It is naive to the point of being dangerous. Q: What would you do to restore council budgets? Johnson says the government is putting more into social care, because that is where the real pinch is. But the best way to support councils such as Coventry is to support the economy, so that the tax base is there. Q: David Gauke says if you win, that will be bad for the UK. Why should people trust you to lead the country when people who worked with you in cabinet don’t trust you? Johnson says he leads a one nation government. He wants to deliver on the people’s priorities. But the problem at the moment is that parliament won’t push Brexit through. He says he would say to Gauke, unless the Tories have a working majority, there will be a coalition led by Jeremy Corbyn and “years of paralysis”. Q: Will you apologise to the flood victims? Johnson says the emergency services have been working flat out to help people. Being hit by a flood is a terrible thing. A huge amount of work is going on. He says it is important for people to understand what financial compensation is available. He says the UK needs to invest in flood defences. Some £2.6bn has already been put in, he says. But there is “much more work to be done”. Johnson is now taking questions. Q: You have been criticised for your handling of the floods, and you have got former Tories running as independents. Are you in control of this campaign? Johnson says he has visited the flood areas twice now. He pays tribute to how people are coping. The government is ready to do what it can. No one can overestimate how terrible this is for people, he says. Where there are gaps in insurance, he will sort it out, he says. On the campaign generally, he says of course we need to get Brexit done, “because it has been paralysing politics for three years”. This is from the Times’ Steven Swinford. Johnson says he will make Britain the greatest place on earth. We should get on with it, he says, instead of wasting 2020 on two referendums. He asks people if they want to wake up on 13 December and find a Corbyn-Sturgeon “technicolour coalition of chaos”. Johnson says it is technical breakthroughs, like the ones being promoted by this factory, that will enable the UK to cut carbon emissions. Johnson says in 10 years’ time we will all be citizens of a proud, strong and still United Kingdom that is more united than ever. Johnson repeats the discredited claim that a Labour government would mean tax rises of £2,400 per person per year. He also claims John McDonnell has called for exchange controls. (McDonnell has said the opposite.) Johnson says 1.4m businesses have been created in the UK since 2010. That is more than in France and Germany combined, he says. He says this is a tribute to the enterprise economy supported by the Conservatives. He says the Tories will double funding on research and development in the next parliament, to £18bn. (He says this will fund work on electric cars, but he is not clear whether all that money is for electric vehicles, or just some of it.) Johnson says, when the UK leaves the EU, the government will insist public sector procurement projects hire British workers. Johnson says British workers will get priority under Tories on public procurement projects after Brexit. Johnson says people do not know where Corbyn stands on a second referendum. Is he for leave? Is he for remain? Or is he like Schrödinger’s cat, occupying both positions at once. He argues that the Corbyn/Sturgeon coalition would be damaging to the UK. And he says that delaying Brexit would cost the UK an extra £1bn a month. (That is not true, at least for 2020. Under a Johnson Brexit the UK would have a transition period until the end of next year, during which contributions to the EU would effectively continue at the rate they are paid now.) Johnson claims there is a “pent-up tidal wave” of new investment waiting to flow into the UK once Brexit is done. It would be worth tens of millions, he says. He says his Brexit is ready to go. Just add water, and stir the pot, he says. (He seems to be comparing Brexit to a Pot Noodle.) Here is the extract from the speech released in advance. The UK is admired and respected around the world but people are baffled by our debate on Brexit and they cannot understand how this great country can squander so much time and energy on this question and how we can be so hesitant about our future. If we can get a working majority we can get parliament working for you, we can get out of the rut. We can end the groundhoggery of Brexit … We face a historic choice. At this election the country can either move forwards with policies that will deliver years of growth and prosperity, or it can disappear into an intellectual cul-de-sac of far left Corbynism. We can honour the wishes of the people, or else we can waste more time, at the cost of a billion pounds per month, and have two more referendums, one on Scotland and one on the EU – an expense of spirit and a waste of shame, more political self-obsession and onanism. This is why I urge everybody undecided how to vote -- imagine waking up on Friday 13th December after the election to find the Corbyn-Sturgeon coalition in Downing Street. They will ruin 2020 with two referendums, they will ruin the economy with out of control debt, they will put taxes up for everyone and instead of an Australian points system we’ll have uncontrolled and unlimited immigration. Johnson says LEVC, the electric taxi company where he is speaking, represents the future. The economy has grown solidly for nine years, he says. And he says unemployment is at its lowest level since 1974. Boris Johnson has just started giving his speech. He is at a factory in Coventry that makes electric taxis. He says these taxis are symbolic of the type of politics he represents. He wants to drive change, he says. And he claims he was the midwife of these vehicles. Here is Stewart Wood, a Labour peer and a policy adviser to Ed Miliband when he was Labour leader, responding to Len McCluskey’s comments on free movement. (See 1.30pm.) Who’s making promises they can’t keep and who do the voters trust to spend their money? To try and figure this out, Heather Stewart is joined on the Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast by the Guardian’s economics editor Larry Elliott, Momentum’s national coordinator Laura Parker, and professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London Tim Bale. In an interview with LBC Jeremy Corbyn was asked about the killing of the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, by US special forces in Syria last month. Corbyn replied: If we preach international law and international legal process through the international court of justice in the Hague, then we should carry it out and if it’s possible to arrest somebody and put them on trial, then that is what should have been done ... Him being removed from the scene is a very good thing. If it would have been possible to arrest him - I don’t know the details of the circumstances at the time, I’ve only seen various statements put out by the US about it - surely that would have been the right thing to do. If we want to live in a world of peace and justice, we should practise it as well. In response the Conservative party has put out a statement from the security minister Brandon Lewis claiming that Corbyn’s comment shows his “inability to stand up to people who reject our values” and that: “Every time [Corbyn] is given the opportunity to take the side of this country’s enemies he does so.” But it is hard to see how Corbyn’s quote does amount to siding with Baghdadi. Even President Trump, announcing Baghdadi’s death, said that capturing or killing him were both objectives for the US armed forces. ITV has some footage of Boris Johnson speaking to residents in Doncaster about the flooding. When Tory MPs chose him as their leader in the summer, some of them thought he had a magic touch with voters. There doesn’t seem to be much evidence of that from the video footage we’ve seen of him today (although of course that’s not to say Theresa May would have been any better). Alastair Campbell, the former communications director for Tony Blair who was expelled by Labour in the spring for voting Lib Dem in the European elections, has said that he will be campaigning for David Gauke, the Tory-turned-independent pro-European, in South West Hertfordshire. He told the ITV election podcast, Calling Peston: I will go to [South West Hertfordshire] and campaign for David Gauke, I would go and help Philip Lee, I think we’ve all got to do what we can do … It really depresses me, why are the Greens standing against Anna Soubry? A prominent campaigner for a second referendum, Campbell has also argued on Twitter that it is essential for the pro-remain parties to cooperate. The call from Leave.EU’s Arron Banks for Nigel Farage withdraw candidates in Labour seats to avoid splitting the rightwing vote has been rubbished in Peterborough by the Brexit party candidate, Mike Greene, who told the Guardian: “I have never been driven by Arron Banks.” Labour squeaked to victory in the marginal by just 683 votes in the June byelection but only after the Conservatives and Greene gathered 17,044 votes between them - 6,560 more than Labour’s Lisa Forbes. Greene, a multi-millionaire businessman who is campaigning in a Brexit party-branded Land Rover Defender with personalised plates, predicted that far from allowing the Conservatives to win if he stood aside, as hundreds of Brexit candidates did in Tory-held seats on Monday, Labour would increase its majority. “I am not going to step aside for party politics,” Greene said while campaigning in the pro-leave ward of Werrington. I am going to do what is right for Peterborough. Boris’s version of Brexit will be weak. If I step aside we are going to end up with another MP who will become a parliamentary puppet and won’t do anything for the city. The argument against what Banks says is I want to put people first. There is more to Britain, more to Peterborough and more to life than Brexit. Voters in Peterborough appear in confusion with some Brexit party voters saying they will switch to Conservative, and Labour voters switching to Lib Dem and Conservative depending on Brexit allegiances. Many others are losing faith with parliament to deliver whatever they vote and considering abstaining. Labour is hoping it can focus on the impact of austerity on public services rather than Brexit, to bolster its slim lead. Greene admitted Brexit would mean “you are going to go through some pain” but dismissed as biased a recent study by economists at Kings College London and London School of Economics suggesting annual economic losses of up to £2,500 per capita after a decade. He said: We know over 70% of academics are left-leaning and a lot of EU funding goes into them. The whole academic system is academically biased. It ain’t going to be roses from the day we leave. You need to look at the hockey stick in its entirety and realise how much more upside there is. Plaid Cymru is today calling for for the establishment of a national health and care service, with social care provided free at the point of need. On social care, we do seem to be getting closer to the point where the parties are reaching consensus on the need for a national care service. Yesterday the IPPR thinktank published a report calling for free personal care to be introduced in England, at a cost of up to £10bn. The IPPR is a leftwing thinktank, but its recommendations were quite similar to those from the House of Lords economic affairs committee in a report this summer, and that committee is chaired by Michael Forsyth, who was about the most Thatcherite member of the cabinet when the Tories were in power in the mid-1990s. Labour has already proposed a “national care service”, and it is due to publish further details of how this might work soon. And there are rumours that the Conservatives will offer something similar. Plaid may be pushing at an open door. From the New Statesman’s Jeremy Cliffe At his news conference this morning John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said that 95% of taxpayers would not pay higher rates of income tax or national insurance under Labour. (See 11.23am.) Sajid Javid, the chancellor, signalled last week that the Conservative manifesto will include tax cuts. But the Resolution Foundation, an economic thinktank, has published a report (pdf) today on tax policy saying that, whoever wins the election, tax increases will be likely. Here is an extract from the summary in its news release. [The report] warns that many popular claims about UK tax are misleading, and need to be set straight. For example, it says that while tax receipts as a share of GDP are on course to reach a 40-year high in the next parliament, the average amount of total tax people pay relative to their income has been falling over the past four decades. Income taxes specifically are also low by international standards. In fact, the average effective tax rate on typical earnings has fallen from 30 per cent in 1975, to 25 per cent in 1990 and 18 per cent today. Were taxes on earnings still at their 1990 level, the average worker today would be paying an extra £1,800 a year in tax. The report says that whoever wins the election is going to face pressure to raise taxes to fund existing public services in an ageing society. The cost of maintaining existing education, health and social security provision is set to rise by £36bn a year by the end of the decade. Added to this, the transition from fossil fuel to electric cars – a policy endorsed by all main parties – could reduce revenues from duties by up to £35bn a year. The Tories have not announced their plans yet, but there is speculation that the party will propose lifting the national insurance threshold, to bring it into line with the income tax personal allowance. “This would give most workers a tax cut of up to £480, at a cost of £11bn,” the report says. But it says low-income families would not get much benefit from this. It explains: That’s because working families on universal credit (UC) will immediately lose around two-thirds of any tax cut through lower benefit awards. To ensure that poorer workers gain as much as richer ones, the foundation says that the Conservatives should pledge to ensure that UC’s work allowances go up in line with any tax cuts. The Liberal Democrats are now looking for a new candidate in High Peak after their original candidate, Guy Kiddey, said people should vote Labour, the BBC’s Chris Doidge reports. High Peak is a Labour/Tory marginal. Kiddey was angry about his party not standing down in Canterbury. (See 10.02am.) The Conservatives have claimed that Jeremy Corbyn is “in complete disarray’ over Scottish independence in the light of his comment this morning, and the subsequent briefing clarifying the party’s stance. (See 1.21pm.) Stephen Kerr, the Scottish Conservative candidate for Stirling said: On the biggest issue in Scotland, the future of the Union, Jeremy Corbyn is in complete disarray. Barely before he’d finished speaking, he was being ‘clarified’ by his aides. The only thing that’s clear is that he simply cannot be trusted to back Scotland’s place in the UK. It’s no wonder leading Labour party figures like Tom Harris [see 8.42am] are urging Scots to vote Scottish Conservative at this election, to stop Scotland going back to a second referendum. From HuffPost’s Paul Waugh The person who heckled Jeremy Corbyn in Scotland (see 12.45pm) was a Church of Scotland minister, as the Church Times’ Adam Becket reports. He is also a minister who allegedly has what appear to be extreme views. These are from Sky’s Tom Rayner. These are from Torsten Bell, a former Labour policy adviser who now runs the Resolution Foundation, an economic thinktank, on Labour’s health proposals. In a statement issued by the SNP, Neil Gray, the party’s candidate in Airdrie and Shotts, has said that Jeremy Corbyn would not have the right to refuse Scotland a second independence referendum. (See 1.21pm.) Gray said: These latest comments show that privately Labour are well aware that their undemocratic position of simply ignoring the Scottish people, no matter what they say, is completely unsustainable. And with the once-dominant Scottish Labour party now at the point of extinction, and Labour voters turning to the SNP, Jeremy Corbyn is in absolutely no position to tell the people of Scotland if and when they can have a say over their own future. As we have made crystal clear, no one looking for support from the SNP after this election should bother to even pick up the phone unless they are prepared to accept the democratically expressed will of Scotland. In his interviews this morning Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, rejected claims that there might be a no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020 because negotiating a trade deal with the EU within a year may prove impossible and because Boris Johnson has ruled out extending the Brexit transition into 2021 or 2o22. But, in an interview with ITV’s Daniel Hewitt, Gove could not give an example of a trade deal like this being negotiated so quickly. Boris Johnson has been accused of doing nothing to help flood victims as he visited one of the worst hit areas and told residents: “We’ve been on it round the clock.” My colleague Josh Halliday has written up his visit here. Jeremy Corbyn’s key union supporter, Unite’s Len McCluskey, has told the Labour leader that victory in the general election means winning over the party’s traditional working-class supporters with a tough line on free movement of workers, my colleague Larry Elliott reports. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has insisted that her party will field candidates in Canterbury, a Labour/Tory marginal where local activists want the party to stand down to help the pro-remain Labour candidate (see 10.02am), and in South West Hertfordshire, where the pro-remain former Tory cabinet minister David Gauke is standing as an independent. On a visit to a boxing club in Crouch End in north London, Swinson was asked if she was losing control of Lib Dem candidates. She told the Press Association. No. Clearly as Liberal Democrats we are committed to stopping Brexit. We have a healthy debate within the party and some candidates have made their own decisions. And here is more footage of Boris Johnson getting a frosty reception from residents affected by flooding in South Yorkshire. Jeremy Corbyn also had his own encounter with a hostile member of the public this morning, the BBC reports. Probably the most powerful attack line used by the Conservatives against Labour in this campaign is the charge that, under Jeremy Corbyn, there would be two referendums in 2020. The latest incarnation of this allegation is in Boris Johnson’s onanism quote. (See 9.43am.) It is true that Labour would hold another Brexit referendum next year. And it is true that the SNP wants to hold a Scottish independence referendum in 2020, and that it would demand one from a Labour government. It is also true that Corbyn would agree to one at some point, but Labour has ruled out holding one in the early years of a Labour government. In an interview in Glasgow this morning Corbyn said something that appeared to close down this Tory line of attack. He said there would be: No referendum in the first term for a Labour government because I think we need to concentrate completely on investment across Scotland. But, according to the Press Association, aides later clarified the party’s position, saying that if the SNP won a majority in the Holyrood elections in 2021 (although in government, the SNP does not currently have a majority in the Scottish parliament), Labour’s position could change. This is from the BBC’s Scotland editor, Sarah Smith. And these are from the BBC’s Nick Eardley. Meanwhile, in South Yorkshire, not everyone has been happy to see the prime minister ... Q: Under the Tories NHS staff have to ask patients at A&amp;E for their passports to check they are entitled to treatment. Would you stop this? Ashworth says this policy is “obnoxious”. Labour has asked for the impact assessment of this policy, but the government has not published it. He says Labour would suspend those regulations. Ashworth says Labour would stop hospital staff having to check the nationality of patients to be sure of their entitlement for free treatment. The Q&amp;A is now over. Ashworth says Labour will introduce plans in its first Queen’s speech to end privatisation in the NHS. Q: Would you extend the sugar tax? Ashworth says Labour would expand it to milky drinks, milkshakes. He says Matt Hancock thinks all you need to improve public health is a smartphone and an app. Ashworth says he does not agree with this. He says A ”Future Generations Wellbeing Act” would make a big difference. There is something similar in Wales, he says. Legislation like this would force public bodies to get serious about public health. He says Nye Bevan described the NHS as “socialism in action” when he set it up. But it has never addressed health inequalities. It is not right that people living in the constituencies that he and McDonnell represent will die 10 years on average before people in other places. Q: Are you happy to have a Labour candidate who posted a picture on social media of a gun being held to Theresa May’s head? McDonnell says people can make mistakes, and learn from them. He says, as a Catholic, he was brought up to believe in redemption. Q: Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, used to work for a big US health company. People think he is a privatiser. Would you get rid of him? Ashworth says Stevens also used to work for Frank Dobson. He says it is not right to comment on civil servants, but he says that he has worked well with Stevens and that he respects him. Q: Under a Labour Brexit would you allow freedom of movement to continue? Ashworth says his position is that trusts should be able to continue to recruit internationally. Q: Will you reform doctors’ pensions? The current rules are forcing doctors to retire early. Ashworth accepts this is an issue. Labour would review the rules urgently. There must be a fair solution, he says. Q: What do you think of the Brexit party standing down in Tory-held seats. And what will happen if they stand down in Labour-held seats? McDonnell says this decision helps Labour, because it shows voters they are up against a Trump/Farage/Johnson alliance to sell off the NHS. He says Nigel Farage was only doing what Donald Trump said he should do in their LBC interview. He says the public don’t like deals like this anyway. I don’t think our people like these dodgy deals behind the scenes. He says, when people go to vote, he wants them to be aware of the risk to the NHS from this alliance. Q: Was Ashworth wrong to say the NHS would not be covered by the four-day week? McDonnell says Ashworth was destroying the “myth” put out by the Conservatives that the NHS would be destroyed by a four-day week coming in from day one. He repeats the explanation of the Labour policy he went through earlier. (See 11.53am.) He says he wants the economy to grow. That generates more in tax revenue. He says that would mean you could afford to hire more staff to compensate for the shorter hours being worked. It is a 10-year programme he is proposing, he says. He says he wants to build a consensus and take people with him. That is how Labour introduced the minimum wage. It would introduce a working time commission, he says. Q: What would you do on social care, and on free movement? Ashworth says Labour will be making an announcement about social care later in the campaign. On free movement, he says if an NHS trust thinks a doctor or nurse is qualified enough to care for the sick and elderly, they should be allowed in. The Tories announced plans for an NHS visa. But that would still amount to a £400 nurses’ tax, he says. John McDonnell and Jonathan Ashworth are now taking questions. Q: Are you worried that you might be raising expectations unreasonably? Ashworth says this is “substantial investment”, not just for the NHS, but for related services. He says the Tories last year announced more money for the NHS day-to-day health budget. But other health services, like sexual health services, continued to be cut. He says it has got to the point where maternity units are now finding babies with neo-natal syphilis because sexual health services have been cut back by so much. Organisations like the Health Foundation are saying this is a big increase, he says. Q: At Labour conference you said you wanted a four-day working week. You said you it would apply to everyone. But Ashworth said it would not apply to the NHS. Which is it? McDonnell says he is proposing moving towards a 32-hour working week. He thinks this should be planned and negotiated over time. As investment goes into the economy, it should be more productive. That wealth should be shared with workers. It can be shared in two ways: through higher wages, or a shorter working week. The process of cutting working hours started in the 1860s, he says. But he says recently that process stalled. He wants further cuts. “We work to live, we don’t live to work,” he says. He says he wants this process to apply to everyone. He says what he is proposing would happen over a decade. He says Ashworth was making the point this would happen gradually. This will be popular, he says. He says in his constituency parents work different shifts. Family life breaks down. He says what Labour is trying to do is change that. Ashworth says he would be a health secretary who cares for NHS staff, not one who picks fights with them. We will increase the budget for training, development and education by £1bn a year. We will allow the NHS to recruit internationally ethically but without hindrance. We will bring back a training bursary for nurses, midwives and allied health professionals and we will expand GP training places to 5,000 to recruit more family doctors in local communities providing 27m extra GP appointments. Announcements on allocations for our national care service and free personal care will be made in the coming days. Ashworth says addressing vaccination rates will be a particular priority. Earlier this year we lost our measles free status. Measles is a horrible, life threatening disease and yet vaccination rates have fallen now five years in a row. This isn’t simply about anti vaxx propaganda on social media - as Mr Hancock claims - but the toxic combination of the Tory Health and Social Care Act reorganisation, the squeeze on primary care and cuts to public health services. We are determined to restore our WHO measles free status, so as a start we will invest £35m a year in improving vaccination uptake and we will recruit an extra 4,800 health visitors and school nurses too. Ashworth says Labour would address inequality through a Future Generations Wellbeing Act. Rates of premature deaths including deaths linked to heart disease, lung cancers, COPD are two times higher in the most deprived areas of England compared to the most affluent. We see a higher rate of suicide in more deprived areas and higher rates of addiction. We will relentlessly target health inequalities as part of our wellbeing strategy. We will legislate with a new Future Generations Wellbeing Act. We will commit to halving childhood obesity by 2030 and tackle the wider determinants of ill health such as banning junk food advertising before the 9pm watershed. Ashworth pays tribute to Frank Dobson, the former Labour health secretary whose death was announced yesterday. He goes on: Frank said “inequality in health is the worst inequality of all. There is no more serious inequality than knowing you’ll die sooner because you’re badly off.” He was so right. Ashworth says Labour would prioritise mental health. I don’t believe a comprehensive mental health service has ever been delivered. Yet today stress, anxiety and depression are the biggest cause of sickness absence in our society, responsible for 91m working days lost every year costing the UK economy £99bn a year. Last year the number of prescriptions for anti-depressions hit their highest level - with over 70m prescriptions dispensed. 100,000 children and young people simply don’t get the mental health support they need. We will as a government prioritise mental health and wellbeing like never before. Ashworth explains what he expects to happen under the Labour plan. Firstly, the money available for our primary and secondary care services will increase. The so-called NHS England revenue budget will increase by 3.9 per cent. An increase on Tory plans. We will invest more to relentlessly drive up performance and drive down waiting times ... Faulty and out of date equipment lead to cancelled operations and increasing delays for patients receiving diagnostic tests results. We will deliver our commitment that less than one per cent of patients should wait longer than six weeks for a diagnostic test. And because we want cancer survival rates to be amongst the best in the world we will invest to deliver a shift in early cancer diagnosis from 2 in 4, to 3 in 4 cancer cases over the next decade. So today we are committing an extra £1.5bn of capital for diagnostics. We have fewer MRI and CT scanners per capita than most OECD countries so will increase the numbers of scanners towards the international average. Overall NHS capital expenditure will increase to meet the OECD average through public investment. That will mean an extra £15 billion capital investment to rebuild crumbling hospitals and invest in the cutting-edge medical technology of the future ... The NHS will be literally rebuilt under a Labour government. We will honour confirming hospital rebuilds but future decisions on hospital rebuilds will be based on not on party political considerations as it is now under the Tories, but based on critical needs, be fully transparent and spread fairly across the regions. We will institute a green new deal for the NHS to ensure trusts can access funding to reduce their carbon footprint and we will institute an NHS Forest with a million extra trees across the estate. We will ensure an extra £2.5 billion investment to upgrade primary and community health facilities. Ashworth summarises problems with the NHS. Cancer waiting times are the worst on record. Last year over 34,000 people with cancer waited beyond two months for treatment. On all eight measures collected 2019/20 performance is lower than the previous year. Meanwhile waits for diagnostic tests are at their highest for 11 years. At the Labour event Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, is now speaking. He claims patients face a “winter of misery”. In the last year 625,000 have languished on trolleys in corridors. Our A&amp;E departments have been in year-round crisis. Indeed, September’s A&amp;E waits were the worst performance outside the winter months. Ambulances are unable to off load patients because A&amp;Es are full. A&amp;E patients can’t clear spaces because there are no acute beds to move patients to. In a typical hospital this winter, there will be no acute beds for the medically fit but vulnerable and elderly people can’t be discharged because social care services have been savaged. Tomorrow we anticipate further NHS performance data confirming our worst fears of a winter of misery for patients. Just as patients wait longer in A&amp;E, they wait longer for treatment to. Waiting lists for treatment have risen to record levels and patients are increasingly waiting longer for care. McDonnell says, unlike the Tories, Labour is explaining how it would fund its proposed NHS spending increase. The other dividing line between us and the Tories is that we are responsible enough to commit to where our funding comes from. We have had none of that from the Tories. Last week I announced in Liverpool a newsocial transformation fund – £150bn over five years for the social infrastructure that is the glue that holds our communities together. Our £15bn capital commitment today will come from that social transformation fund and the day-to-day spending increase will be funded by taxing the top 5% at a higher rate of income tax. As I have said before, income tax rates, national insurance, and VAT will not increase for 95%. It is only the 5% we will ask to pay a little more. (We will reduce the threshold for 45p rate to £80,000 and reintroduce the 50p rate for £125,000.) That is our pledge. McDonnell is now summing up the Labour NHS proposal. A £26bn real terms healthcare funding boost from 2018-19 to 2023-24. An annual average 4.3% real-terms increase for health spending over the next four years, which will take the total Department of Health and Social Care budget to £178bn in 2023-24. With capital expenditure – so neglected by the Tories – rising to the international average, and boosted by £15bn over five years. On each of these fronts, the Tories have offered weak commitments, reflecting their hostility to free public services and the need for us to care for each other. On overall funding between 2019 to 2024, the Conservatives have promised just £20bn in real terms, £6bn more than Theresa May announced in 2018. On annual increases, almost everyone in the room will be familiar with what the Tories have spent in this decade of decay. McDonnell says austerity was a political choice. It has left the NHS underfunded, he says. As the Tories have spent money cutting capital gains tax accruing to the rich, cuts and privatisation to our NHS has left our country struggling to treat cancer patients safely. As the Tories waste money by failing to properly tackle tax avoidance, support services for young people have been ripped out of their communities. As the Tories’ cuts to corporation tax have continue to increase dividends for the very richest, more than 1 million NHS patients could face long waits in emergency departments and almost 300,000 patients could also be left waiting on trolleys. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is speaking at the launch of Labour’s £26bn “rescue plan” for the NHS. He claims the first week of the election campaign has shown the Conservatives in their true colours. It is a week where we have seen the Tories’ true colours: Jacob Rees-Mogg showing unforgivable arrogance in criticising the “common sense” of the Grenfell Tower victims. The Tories resorting to fake news in the fantasy numbers they’ve concocted to criticise our plans. Then the chancellor refusing to debate me to defend their record and their lies. We will continue to present our positive vision to tackle climate change and rampant inequality, and we will continue show at every opportunity our comprehensive costed plan to deliver on that vision. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has challenged Westminster to “stop obsessing” about nuclear power and “get its act together” on green energy. As the Press Association reports, at a campaign event in Edinburgh she said that a large team of SNP MPs in the House of Commons would push the UK government to act on the climate emergency. She said: At this election, Scotland can elect a strong team of SNP MPs to demand the radical action needed to tackle the climate emergency and secure the future of our green energy industry. Scotland is already a world leader on tackling the climate crisis and delivering green energy. By contrast, Westminster has wasted years obsessing over nuclear power and a complete lack of vision and ambition over the energy technologies of the future. Put bluntly, there is no more time to waste - it’s time for Westminster to get its act together. The Scottish government has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2045 - five years ahead of the corresponding UK target. My colleague Peter Walker says Liberal Democrat HQ is not willing to stand down in High Peak. (See 10.02am.) When Theresa May announced her plan in 2018 to give the NHS a £20bn, long-term spending increase, she liked to argue that what she was offering was more generous than what Labour was proposing for the NHS in its 2017 election manifesto. There was some dispute about that (Channel 4 News’ FactCheck has a good analysis here), but the Labour manifesto offer two years ago was certainly quite modest compared to what is on the table today. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has just published an analysis of Labour’s plan and here is a chart summing up what’s on offer. And here is an extract from the IFS analysis. It says Labour’s plans amount to a real-terms increase in health spending worth 4.3% a year. UK health spending has historically grown at an average real rate of 3.6% per year, but grew by just 1.3% per year between 2009−10 and 2018−19. Growth in total Department of Health and Social Care spending of 2.9% per year [an assumption based on the government’s plans for extra NHS-spending, but assuming non-NHS health spending is frozen after 2021] would therefore be at a slower rate than the long-run average, but at a faster rate than has been the case since 2010. Annual real growth of 4.3% per year, as under Labour’s new proposals, would be at a faster rate than the historical average, and puts health spending on a far more generous path than was implied by both parties’ 2017 general election manifestos. From YouGov’s Chris Curtis, on the latest YouGov poll out yesterday Here is Sky’s Lewis Goodall on Boris Johnson’s onanism remark. (See 9.43am.) ITV’s Joe Pike says Boris Johnson is not giving interview to regional media on his visit to South Yorkshire. Boris Johnson is in South Yorkshire inspecting areas affected by the flooding. Sky News is showing some live footage. To a casual observer it might look as though he is following in the footsteps of Jeremy Corbyn, who was in the region yesterday, but Johnson also paid a visit to a flood-affected town last week. That trip was notable for what it revealed about his inability to use a mop properly. These are from YouGov, the polling organisation. Politicians have always been sceptical of these questions - they think the people’s theoretical willingness to pay more in tax to for better public services is not matched by their actual enthusiasm for this - although when Gordon Brown increase national insurance in his 2002 budget to raise more money for the NHS, the decision turned out to be extraordinarily popular. (Brown’s move remains a textbook example in how to win popular consent for a tax rise; he did it by orchestrating a year-long public debate showing why the NHS needed the money.) As my colleague Peter Walker reports, the Liberal Democrats are facing a revolt from activists in Canterbury, where local members are unhappy about party HQ’s decision to select a new candidate to replace Tim Walker, who stood down to help Labour hold the seat where it had a majority of just 187 at the last election. Walker and other local Liberal Democrats are worried that if their party stands Labour’s Rosie Duffield, a remainer, will be defeated and replaced by a pro-Brexit Tory. According to the BBC’s Chris Doidge, Guy Kiddey, the Lib Dem candidate in High Peak in Derbyshire is also planning to stand down in solidarity with Tom Walker. High Peak is another Labour/Tory marginal, where Labour had a majority of 2,322 in 2017. Two years ago the Lib Dem candidate in the seat got 2,669 votes. BBC Scotland has rejected a request from the Scottish Greens to be included in its live election debate two days before polling day, claiming the party has insufficient electoral support. The BBC debate at 8pm on Tuesday 10 December is expected to feature the leaders of Scotland’s four main parties – Nicola Sturgeon for the Scottish National party, Jackson Carlaw for the Conservatives, Richard Leonard for Labour and Willie Rennie for the Lib Dems. The Scottish Greens are putting up 22 candidates for the general election, leaving the majority of Scotland’s 59 Westminster seats uncontested. They have six Holyrood seats, one more than the Lib Dems, and took part in the BBC’s 2017 general election debate alongside Ukip. However, the BBC has ruled this year they and the Brexit party have insufficient popular support in a Westminster election to justify inclusion: in the 2017 snap general election, the Scottish Greens only polled 0.2% of the national vote, down 1.1 percentage points on the 2015 general election. It is understood BBC executives are annoyed that in 2017, the Scottish Greens said they were contesting a large number of seats but eventually put up only three Westminster candidates. The BBC had set a threshold of 10 candidates to merit inclusion in 2017; the party admits its scarce resources were overstretched fighting a council election that May. Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Greens co-leader, said the BBC decision meant there was no candidate to challenge the stance of the main parties on the climate crisis. He said: All four parties support extracting fossil fuels until 2050 and beyond. They all want to expand major roads and aviation. Only the Greens recognise this can’t happen. But it’s not just on climate. The Scottish Greens are the most influential opposition party in Scotland. We have changed the tax system, granted new powers to councils and only last week, John Finnie’s bill on the equal protection of children received royal assent. To leave us out of the debate is ridiculous. The Michael Gove/Nick Robinson exchange may not have shed much light on the Conservatives’ policies on Brexit, or on anything else (Gove firmly rejected the suggestion that a no-deal Brexit was possible at the end of the transition period, but without properly explaining why), but it did feature what is probably a general election first - a Today programme discussion about the similarities between contemporary politics and masturbation. Here is the key exchange. NR: The prime minister has got some colourful language in a speech today. He warns of onanism, which for those who are not familiar with their Bible may not realise is a posh word for self-gratification. Would that word not be better applied to those of you who have obsessed with our membership of the European Union, rather than getting on with the people’s priorities. MG: I’m glad that you say we should get on with the people’s priorities. If you want to have a pointless, repeated, self-indulgent activity perpetuating, then we can have a parliament with Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister in which we have pointless, repeated and self-indulgent referenda, rather than, as you say, quite rightly getting on with the people’s priorities. The question was prompted by this extract, release overnight by the Tories, from the speech that Boris Johnson will give later today. Johnson will say: We face a historic choice. At this election the country can either move forwards with policies that will deliver years of growth and prosperity, or it can disappear into an intellectual cul-de-sac of far left Corbynism. We can honour the wishes of the people, or else we can waste more time, at the cost of a billion pounds per month, and have two more referendums, one on Scotland and one on the EU – an expense of spirit and a waste of shame, more political self-obsession and onanism. (Johnson’s own expertise on this subject, at least according to one of his biographers, may be limited. In her excellent book Just Boris, Sonia Purnell writes: “Sex, sexual organs and sexual conquests are Johnsonian mainstays of conversation. Later, Boris infamously told a girlfriend that such was the number of his sexual partners that he hadn’t had ‘to have a wank for 20 years’.” During his combative Today interview with Nick Robinson, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, was asked why the proposed Conservative inquiry into Islamophobia in the party had turned into an inquiry into Islamophobia and prejudice. Robinson said that when Gove was on the programme only last week, he said it would be an Islamophobia-only inquiry. Gove denied this. A bit later on the programme Robinson offered a clarification. He said that at one point in his interview last week Gove implied it would be an Islamophobia-only inquiry. At another point in the same interview he implied it would be a more general inquiry. Lady Warsi, the former Conservative party chair and a longstanding campaigner for a specific inquiry into Islamophobia in the party, told the programme: Well, I welcome any form of inquiry. I’ve got to the point where beggars can’t be choosers any more. But I am disappointed that the party, having now realised that there is a real problem in relation to a specific form of racism, is still trying to absolve its responsibility by trying to dilute what it is that it’s going to look at ... The fact that we’re still prevaricating about even having an inquiry, and the kind of inquiry we’re going to have, shows just how dismissive the party has been on the issue of Islamophobia. A report by my colleague Simon Murphy, saying that 25 sitting and former Tory councillors have been exposed for posting Islamophobic and racist material on social media, has highlighted the extent to which this remains a problem for the Conservatives. Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Simon Murphy. Amongst all the campaigning today, there are two headline media events. 11am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, speak at an event to launch Labour’s £26bn “rescue plan” for the NHS. 4.30pm: Boris Johnson is giving a speech on Brexit in Warwickshire. And Jeremy Corbyn is campaigning in Scotland, where he has events organised in Glasgow (at 10.30am), in Hamilton (at 12.15pm) and in Coatbridge (at 2.30pm.) Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has refused to accept that no deal is effectively back on the table with a new Brexit deadline of the end of 2020 for a trade agreement. Gove’s friend and former colleague David Gauke, who is running as an independent after having the Tory whip removed as punishment for rebelling, warned earlier that “we will leave the implementation period without a deal with the European Union on WTO terms, in effect on no-deal terms”. (See 8.38am.) Gove told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: I’ve got a lot of respect and affection for David but I think in this one particular area he’s wrong because what we have is a Brexit deal that’s been negotiated, a withdrawal agreement which will make sure we safeguard the rights of UK citizens abroad and EU citizens in the UK and also a political declaration that spells out a future relationship based on free trade and friendly cooperation. Former Conservative minister David Gauke is not holding back this morning. He’s now told Sky’s Kay Burley the policy pursued by the prime minister is “reckless and irresponsible” and a majority Conservative government “would be detrimental to people’s jobs and livelihoods”. Urging people not to vote Tory, he adds: I think the Conservative party has fundamentally changed. There are a lot of traditional Conservative voters who feel politically homeless. Many of them will vote for the Lib Dems ... and they are right to. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, says the party’s pledge to fund the NHS with an extra £26bn a year will be “transformative”. Labour is today unveiling a “rescue plan” for the NHS in England with the extra funding paid for by higher taxes on companies and the wealthiest in society. Ashworth told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: We’ll use this extra funding to raise performance in our NHS. Remember, we’ve got around four and a half million people on the waiting lists. Many elderly people left languishing on trolleys in hospital corridors and we’re anticipating that to get particularly worse this winter. Challenged on whether the money will be genuinely transformative rather than just allowing the NHS to get back on top of waiting lists, Ashworth said: If I may say so, and I say this with utmost politeness, when you’ve got patients with glaucoma [a degenerative eye condition] at Southampton waiting so long for treatment that they go blind, including a pregnant mother who went blind and now has never seen the face of her daughter because of waits, I think putting more money in to turn around waiting lists is transformative. Ashworth was referring to a damning case first revealed by the Times which reported on how 15 hospital patients were left blind or with severe sight loss after staff shortages led to delays in their treatment. Bad news for Labour in Scotland as the party’s former minister Tom Harris, who was MP for Glasgow South, has revealed he is voting Tory – saying that Jeremy Corbyn is a threat to the UK. Harris condemned some Labour candidates who “continue to spout racist, antisemitic hatred”, reports the Scottish Daily Mail. Harris quit Labour last year after 34 years in the party. Ruth Davidson, former leader of the Scottish Conservative party, has tweeted the Scottish Daily Mail’s front page this morning: Here’s Conservative minister Michael Gove hitting back at his former colleague and “good friend” David Gauke’s criticism of the party, highlighting that there are “some very powerful voices from within Labour ... warning us of the dangers of Jeremy Corbyn”. David Gauke, one of 21 Tory MPs who had the whip removed after rebelling against the government, says a Conservative majority will veer the country to a “very hard Brexit” that would be “disastrous for the prosperity of this country”. The former Tory MP and justice secretary has opened up about his reasons for standing as an independent candidate in the general election, telling BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: The reason being, and this pains me to say it, but a Conservative majority after the next general election will take us in the direction of a very hard Brexit. And in all likelihood at the end of 2020 we will leave the implementation period without a deal with the European Union on WTO terms, in effect on no-deal terms. And that, I believe, would be disastrous for the prosperity of this country. Asked about his decision to run as an independent, unlike former chancellor Philip Hammond – who also had the whip removed for rebelling against the government in order to stop a no-deal Brexit – he said: Different individuals will reach different choices. I’ve got an enormous amount of respect for Philip. He is motivated by the national interest and that has run through his entire career. But I, in good faith, have reached a different conclusion. I believe I can influence events in this general election to some small extent. And I think the best way I can do that. He says he hopes the Liberal Democrats will stand aside in his seat in South West Hertfordshire but adds that “is a decision for them”. Gauke is also backing a second referendum on Johnson’s deal. Hello folks, Simon Murphy here, taking the helm of the liveblog to steer you through this morning’s politics news. Labour is to unveil a “rescue plan” for the NHS in England with an extra £26bn of funding a year paid for by higher taxes on companies and the wealthiest in society, as the party puts the health service at the heart of its election offer to voters. The party’s pledge would give the health service £5.5bn more a year by 2023-24 than the £20.5bn the Conservatives have promised and represent the biggest boost to health spending since Labour was last in power between 1997 and 2010. It puts pressure on Boris Johnson to increase the money he is committing to the NHS, which he has made one of his three “people’s priorities” and sought to make a Tory vote-winner. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, will say that “proper funding” is needed to maintain a world-class health service as he proposes a 4.3% annual rise in funding. Labour says the sums it is pledging would end the lengthening delays faced by patients for A&amp;E care, cancer treatment and planned operations, tackle the NHS’s worsening staffing crisis, restore bursaries for student nurses, improve mental healthcare, let hospitals buy scores of new CT and MRI scanners and pay for a new generation of hospitals, GP surgeries and mental health facilities. How the papers covered it The Guardian features a picture from the Australian bushfires but leads with election news and Labour’s “£26bn rescue plan for NHS”. The Mirror calls that “Labour’s 10-point plan to save the NHS”. The i’s angle is “Battle for the NHS” as the Tories also flash more cash for the health service. The Times and the Express focus on a 14-point lead for the Tories. YouGov for the Times has put the Tories on 42%, Labour on 28% and the Lib Dems on 15%. The Telegraph’s splash is “Brexit will start green revolution, pledges PM”, as Boris Johnson says that if re-elected his government will spearhead a drive to tackle climate change. We begin the day with some fighting words from Angela Rayner, who sat down with the Guardian’s Heather Stewart yesterday. The shadow education secretary claimed Boris Johnson is “in cahoots” with Nigel Farage after the announcement that Brexit party candidates would stand aside in Conservative-held seats to help deliver Johnson a majority. “Nigel Farage is working in cahoots with Boris Johnson, trying to hoodwink the public – and they are very friendly with Donald Trump,” Rayner told the Guardian. She warned voters, particularly in the Midlands and the north, to stick with Labour or risk “a hard-right nasty Tory government, that will privatise and deregulate our markets – and they will make Margaret Thatcher look like a pussycat”. Farage’s deal with the Conservatives seems to have everyone up in arms today. The Conservatives are unhappy with him after Nigel Farage refused calls from Conservatives for the Brexit party to stand down in Labour marginal seats, saying the request was “almost comical” and that the Brexit party needed to get MPs into parliament to hold Boris Johnson’s feet to the fire. On the other side of politics, there are ructions in the Liberal Democrats, after Tim Walker, the Lib Dem candidate for Canterbury, announced he would be stepping out of the race in order to give Rosie Duffield, the Labour candidate who took Canterbury from the Tories for the first time in 2017 by just 187 votes, the best chance of winning. Almost immediately afterwards, a party spokesman said Walker would be replaced “in due course”. But a local Lib Dem source said the party in Canterbury was vehemently opposed to replacing Walker and that all four members approved to stand as MPs had said they would not do so. And the former Tory minister David Gauke has announced he will stand as an independent candidate, saying he represents “ a form of liberal Conservatism” and had become increasingly uncomfortable with the direction the Conservative party had taken regarding Brexit, saying “the Conservative party has got it badly wrong”. Good morning and welcome to Politics live, as we bring you every tasty morsel of news during this election campaign. Johnson will relaunch the Conservatives’ election campaign today, with a speech at an electric vehicle plant in the West Midlands, the first big set-piece speech of the campaign. In it, he will offer the familiar roll-call of core policies, including a pledge to “end the groundhoggery of Brexit”, spend more on the NHS and cut crime. Johnson will also attack Jeremy Corbyn’s party, saying a Labour government would condemn the UK to the “intellectual cul-de-sac of far left Corbynism”. The entry of the prime minister to the full electoral fray after a relatively quiet start to his campaign comes after his starring turn in an election video that sought to portray Boris Johnson as a man of the people, but which some viewers thought made him look more like David Brent.

A string of cases have fuelled suspicions in the US and beyond that some Chinese firms will resort to any measures to obtain valuable intellectual property that could give them a technological leg-up. In 2010, former Boeing engineer Dongfan “Greg” Chung was jailed for 15 years and nine months for economic espionage after he was convicted of passing trade secrets to Beijing to assist the Chinese aviation industry. The engineer, who worked on Nasa’s space shuttle programme, had stored binders full of information about US military aircraft in his home, collecting data that he passed on to China over three decades. The documents included design manuals for the US Air Force’s B-1 bomber, the C-17 military cargo plane, the F-15 fighter jet, as well as Chinook helicopters. In letters to a Chinese state official, Chung said that he wanted to “make some contributions to the modernisations [sic] of the Motherland”. One letter from a Chinese official, found at Chung’s house and written in 1987, said: “It is your honour and China’s fortune that you are able to realise your wish of dedicating yourselves to the services of your country.” FBI agents began looking into Chung while investigating a separate case against Chinese-born naturalised US citizen Chi Mak. Mak was found guilty in 2007 of conspiring to export sensitive defence technology to China while working for defence contractor Paragon Power. He was caught when family members were searched at Los Angeles airport and found to have a CD full of classified information. The information Mak passed on allegedly helped China build its own version of Aegis, an American radar system built to protect military ships. He was sentenced to 24 years in prison for acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. More recently Chinese citizen Mo Hailong, commonly known as Robert Mo, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal agricultural trade secrets. In January Mo admitted digging up corn seeds from an Iowa farm to send back to China, breaching the intellectual property rights of agrochemicals conglomerate Monsanto and seed producer Du Pont Pioneer. He is yet to be convicted or sentenced, but conspiracy to steal trade secrets is a felony that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. The Justice Department (DoJ) said the theft was on behalf of “companies controlled by the government of the People’s Republic of China”. Repeated allegations of spying by state-sponsored hackers have also added to tensions between the west and China. In 2014, the DoJ indicted five Chinese military officers with stealing data from six US companies and unions in an eight-year espionage campaign that targeted firms including metals giant Alcoa and nuclear firm Westinghouse Electric. Oil giants BP, Shell and Exxon Mobil were among companies which had their systems infiltrated by hackers in China, uncovered by internet security firm McAfee in 2011. The attacks, part of a lengthy campaign nicknamed “Night Dragon”, targeted “project-financing information with regard to oil and gas fields and operations”, according to McAfee, including information about the location of potentially lucrative oil reserves. Google’s travails in China, where the search engine is banned, are well documented. In 2010, the US internet firm said a cyber-attack originating in China had targeted its intellectual property. Google said the attackers’ main aim was to infiltrate the email accounts of Chinese dissidents and human rights activists, but it also flagged up efforts to steal information from companies in industries including chemicals, technology and finance. In 2014, a Chinese hacker group called Putter Panda, thought to be based in the offices of the People’s Liberation Army, was said by security experts to have hacked satellite technology companies in the US and UK. A report by BT and KPMG warned earlier this year of the “industrialisation of cybercrime”. The report said today’s cybercriminals often work for complex operations akin to businesses, with human resources divisions and budgets for research and development. Some are so sophisticated that they are able to hijack senior executives’ email accounts and fake correspondence to convince junior company employees to approve transactions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2021/jun/23/australia-politics-live-scott-morrison-barnaby-joyce-nsw-victoria-covid-new-zealand","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-23T08:37:04Z","webTitle":"Sydney declared a hotspot by commonwealth – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2021/jun/23/australia-politics-live-scott-morrison-barnaby-joyce-nsw-victoria-covid-new-zealand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2021/jun/23/australia-politics-live-scott-morrison-barnaby-joyce-nsw-victoria-covid-new-zealand","fields":{"headline":"Sydney declared a hotspot by commonwealth – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s where we will wrap up the blog for this evening. Here’s what happened today: Health authorities in New South Wales announced 16 new cases associated with Sydney’s Covid cluster. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, announced a wave of new restrictions across greater Sydney, including movement limits for residents and workers in some local government areas, and in-home gathering limits. Meanwhile, states across Australia have introduced border restrictions for arrivals from Sydney, with some bans extending to travellers from anywhere in NSW. As a result, tens of thousands of Australians have been forced to abandon school holiday travel plans, with the tourism industry predicting losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The Morrison government has granted three members of the Murugappan family bridging visas amid mounting pressure for them to be released from community detention. The national pesticides regulator has refused a request from the NSW government to allow farmers to use a rodent poison described as “napalm for mice” around crops to battle the devastating mouse plague. Have a great evening, Amy will be back tomorrow morning. To everyone in Sydney, we’re hoping for the best. The retired Sydney nanny and the Chilean families still looking for answers. Ahead of an appeal in an Australian court, those who lost loved ones during the brutal regime of Augusto Pinochet say they need closure. My colleague Ben Doherty with an extraordinary read: Tens of thousands of Australians have been forced to abandon school holiday travel plans after states closed their borders in response to Sydney’s growing Covid outbreak, with the tourism industry predicting losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Sydneysiders who had been planning to go interstate or to regional New South Wales from the end of this week have had to cancel their holidays after all states and territories announced stricter border restrictions. The new restrictions, which include bans on entry from either certain local government areas in Sydney’s south-eastern suburbs or the entirety of NSW, come into effect alongside a NSW government directive for residents and workers in the hotspot council areas to avoid travelling outside metropolitan Sydney. Dean Long, Accommodation Association of Australia chief executive, said that in the hours after NSW announced 16 new cases and other states tightened their borders, there were “mass cancellations” reported, including one hotel in Sydney’s CBD that lost $40,000 worth of bookings in three hours on Wednesday afternoon. Read more: Tasmanian police have dropped weapons charges against a former state Liberal politician who is facing other criminal charges in Queensland, AAP reports. Adam Brooks was charged in April with incorrectly storing ammunition, which he denied, while running as a candidate in the state election. He went on to claim a seat after the 1 May poll but stood down a day after being declared elected with the premier, Peter Gutwein, revealing Brooks faced several charges in Queensland and was battling mental health problems. Tasmania police on Wednesday advised they had dropped firearms charges against Brooks after reviewing the case file. “Following the review, legal advice was that there was no reasonable prospect of conviction,” the force said in a statement. “The person in question has been formally notified of the outcome. There will be no further police action in relation to this matter.” Brooks is accused by Queensland police of unlawfully possessing a category H weapon, unauthorised possession of explosives and dealing with identity items. He has yet to enter a plea to the charges but has previously indicated he intends to fight them. The one-time Tasmanian mining minister, who served in the seat of Braddon from 2010-19, was also accused during the state election campaign of catfishing two women using a fake dating profile. He denied those allegations at the time. Gutwein stood by Brooks during the campaign, at one stage describing him as a “good-looking bloke” and saying someone could have stolen his identity. Brooks’ resignation triggered a recount in Braddon with his seat going to fellow Liberal Felix Ellis. The national pesticides regulator has refused a request from the New South Wales government to allow farmers to use a rodent poison described as “napalm for mice” around crops to battle the devastating mouse plague. Conservationists had warned the use of bromadiolone would have devastating affects on native species in the central west and put endangered birds at risk. The blood-thinning chemical – part of a class of poisons called second generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs) – is known to stay active for months and can pass through the food chain, causing secondary poisoning of animals that eat the dead and dying. Read more: One of the prominent issues in federal parliament today was a Victorian Nationals push to make changes to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. In short, the proposed amendments would ban the government from buying water from irrigators to return to the environment, and would also prevent any extra environmental water being allocated after the plan is completed in 2024. Importantly, the proposal would also block delivering 450 gigalitres of water, which most benefits South Australia, already earmarked for the environment. As we’ve reported earlier, the Morrison government will oppose the changes. Guardian Australia has obtained a joint letter the South Australian federal Liberals have sent to Scott Morrison, in which they outline the importance of the keeping the plan unchanged. The signatories include Simon Birmingham, Nicole Flint, Anne Ruston, Alex Antic, David Fawcett, Andrew McLachlan, Tony Pasin, Rowan Ramsey and James Stevens. The letter says: We remain resolute in our support for the implementation of the basin plan in full and on time. The certainty provided by the full implementation of the basin plan is crucial to not only ensuring we have a sustainable river system, but that we have sustainable and productive river communities, including the ongoing production of high-quality food and fibre that the economy of many river communities depends on. We appreciate your ongoing support for implementation of the basin plan as well as the constructive way in which the current minister for water, Keith Pitt, has engaged with river communities and other stakeholders on matters such as the creation of the inspector general of water compliance. Earlier today, Labor’s Penny Wong, together with other Labor, Greens and crossbench South Australian federal politicians, called for the Nationals to be stripped of the water portfolio after their push to make the changes. Fragments of Covid-19 have also been detected at the Cronulla sewage treatment plant and in the Bellambi sewage network. While NSW Health is aware of confirmed Covid cases who live within these catchments, they are urging people in the following suburbs to get tested immediately if they notice any cold-like symptoms.

You have Elias Visontay here bringing you the latest for the rest of the day. Earlier this morning, Amy mentioned the AFP’s canine team was heading into parliament today. We now have vision of home affairs minister Karen Andrews and coalition MPs Dave Sharma and Trevor Evans awkardly posing with the canine team. We have one more day of the parliament sitting before it has a one month break (the traditional winter break) so make sure you get plenty or rest for that. (The next break after that is a six-week break between September and October, which is why people aren’t ruling out an election this year – that’s a very convenient time to have it, if the government so wished.) The wonderful Elias Visontay is going to take you through the evening, so stick around so you stay up to date. It’s state of the nation tomorrow brought to you by Ceda, so there will be plenty of speeches and motherhood statements to look forward to. Plus, it’s more of the Barnaby show. And how many more times can the prime minister say ‘carping negativity’? All this, and more, awaits us. A very big thank you to everyone who commented and read along today – we adore each and everyone one of you. I’ll be back tomorrow morning – until then, take care of you . One of the unity tickets between the government and opposition in the Senate has been on limiting the number of motions those not in a major party can move in the senate – now it seems like there is a bit more curtailing: Commonwealth Bank customers cannot access online banking services right now, the bank has confirmed. The outage started around two hours ago, just after CBA reported issues with its merchant terminal services. The bank said those services had returned but confirmed customers “may be experiencing difficulty” logging into Netbank and the Commonwealth Bank app. It is the second outage in a week. Unlike last week’s outage, which brought down online banking services for several Australian banks, this issue appears to be limited to CBA. If you look at the vaccine allocation here, you’ll see that AstraZeneca will only be available ‘subject to request’ from October. That’s based on some heroic assumptions that people over 60 will have had their vaccine by then: Given the size of the Australian population over 60, it is assumed that demand for AstraZeneca doses will reduce in Horizon 2 and be met by Horizon 3. However, AZ doses will be available if demand continues through Horizon 2 and 3 You can find the whole roll out here Matt Canavan was also asked if he was guilty of “mansplaining” – that was a paraphrase of Hollie Hughes’ contribution to the party room meeting yesterday (as reported by Sarah Martin) – “Thank you, boys, for telling us how to best raise our children.” (Amusingly, the Tveeder transcription interpreted that question as ‘are you guilty of manslaughter’.) Canavan: I will let others judge that. Canavan says that is the first time he has been accused of mansplaining. I would like a fact check on that, but anyway. Patricia Karvelas asks Matt Canavan whether he believes childcare is ‘outsourcing childcare’: I don’t. My perspective here is that if we as a nation can afford to provide additional assistance to families on incomes of up to $350,000 and that is what the current legislation does, surely we can provide some additional support for those parents that make the choice to look after their own children, especially given the large inequity that exists in our tax system where single income families on just adequate, modest incomes, household incomes of 90 or $100,000 a year, which is average these days, they can be paying $10,000 more in their tax after childcare subsidies compared to the double income family. Now that is not particularly fair. So we help the families on $350,000, that is a lot of money. ... And I am not in principle against providing assistance to childcare. Usually it has to be affordable but that is my point here. If we can afford to help our families on $350,000 a year, surely we can afford to help those on much, much lower incomes facing much, much greater inequities. Would the Nationals support net zero by 2050 if agriculture was removed? (Which is the position Michael McCormack had floated months ago and David Littleproud repeated this morning.) Matt Canavan: That is just one industry. The people and NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, and others who propose net zero emissions, is effectively a slogan right now, not a policy. Three words, net zero emissions. It sounds good but there is not a lot of detail behind it. When New Zealand adopted their net zero emissions target, at least they did serious work, they did serious economic modelling at what the impact on their economy would be. That modelling showed that by New Zealand to reach net zero emissions by 2050, it would make their economy 10-20% smaller and would cost 2-4% of their labour force their job. In Australian terms that would be 400,000 people. That is not just agriculture. I gave an agriculture example. If we are looking at a policy that would put almost half a million Australians out of work, we might want to just do a little bit more thinking. Matt Canavan is on Afternoon Briefing (despite the bells ringing for a Senate division – obviously he has judged that he is not needed) and is asked why this week was the week for a leadership change: I think Barnaby provides a very loud and effective voice for the people we represent and that is what we are here for. As I have said many times this week, it is not about any position for me, I am very happy where I am, but I do want to make sure we have a very effective fight for those people. Michael showed his absolute class earlier in the week and he worked very hard, that was never in question, but I believe even the last few days Barnaby has shown how effective he is at capturing, securing, the national conversation in a direction that supports the people that feel like they are ignored in our country areas, not only in our country areas. And they got their voice back this week and I have gotten a lot of good feedback about that. Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, has declared greater Sydney a hotspot under the commonwealth definition (the seven LGAs which have been listed today) That is the nationally agreed definition. And it also means that if Sydney goes into lockdown, they are able to access federal funding assistance. The Greens have lost their bid to remove the government’s bill watering down responsible lending laws from the Senate notice paper. One Nation is opposed to the Coalition’s changes, so the Greens believed they could have the bill removed altogether. But the Senate vote was tied (27 to 27), meaning the Greens bid to remove it failed. Pauline Hanson explained that although One Nation is “100% opposed to the responsible lending law changes” it was still working on amendments to remove banks from the exemption to current laws. One Nation asked the Greens to defer its motion. Since it was still working on amendments, One Nation would not vote to remove the bill, Hanson said. The Western Australia hard border is starting to bite: There is still a wait until it’s all ramped up though: Larissa Waters has successfully moved a motion to have the government’s Beetaloo Basin oil and gas production plan referred to a Senate committee: That the following matter be referred to the Environment and Communications References Committee for inquiry and report by interim report by Tuesday 3 August 2021 with the final report due by the first sitting Tuesday of March 2022: Oil and gas exploration and production in the Beetaloo Basin, with particular reference to: the Industry Research and Development (Beetaloo Cooperative Drilling Program) Instrument 2021, which provides public money for oil and gas corporations; the social, economic and environmental consequences of oil and gas exploration and production; and any related matters The Greens won that 28 votes to 24 after Pauline Hanson’s One Nation came on board. It’s also worth pointing out, in light of the temporary decision by the Morrison government when it comes to the Murugappan family, the high court has ruled Australia can keep people in indefinite, administrative detention. The Refugee Action Coalition’s Ian Rintoul released a statement on that a little earlier today: In a sharply divided (4-3) decision, the high court has upheld the government’s appeal against a single judge federal court, ALJ20, that had released a Syrian refugee after finding his detention was unlawful because the government was neither processing a visa nor acting to remove him. The majority decision has found yet again, that indefinite, administrative detention of non-citizens (mostly asylum seekers and refugees) is lawful. The high court summary said: “The high court, by majority, held that ss 189(1) and 196(1) validly authorise and require the detention of an unlawful non-citizen until the actual event of, relevantly, their removal from Australia or grant of a visa.” The government had already pre-empted the high court decision by passing (with Labor support) the Migration Amendment (Clarifying International Obligations for Removal) Act 2021 (Migration Amendment Act) in May. The combination of the high court decision and the Clarifying International Obligations for Removal Act means many asylum seekers and refugees are essentially beyond the reach of the law, and can be held indefinitely at the discretion of the government – the government is essentially a law unto itself. “It makes a mockery of ‘the rule of law’ when there is one law for citizens and another applies to asylum seekers and refugees,” Rintoul said. “It is a joke that non-reviewable indefinite detention can be declared not to be punitive because it is ‘administrative’. Tell that to a refugee or an asylum seeker who has been held in detention for eight years. “It ignores the reality of many who are held in detention who cannot be returned to their home country, and who cannot be sent anywhere else. They will now face a life sentence in detention. “It is now clearer than ever that refugees cannot not rely on the courts for justice. It is protest action and people power that can free the refugees.” Last week the Greens senator Larissa Waters made several unsuccessful attempts to refer a bill about setting up an inquiry into Christian Porter to a Senate committee inquiry. Jacqui Lambie had some problems with the way Waters was going about it – and has proposed instead a referral to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee. The Senate just voted on the proposal: it was tied at 26-all, meaning the motion was negatived. Still, the Senate is now one vote away from setting up an inquiry of sorts. The Lambie motion said: That the following matter be referred to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee for inquiry and report by 10 August 2021: the extent to which the presumption of innocence conflicts with the prime minister’s responsibility to maintain public confidence in the executive, and how the prime minister should seek to resolve that conflict; whether a minister’s obligation to uphold high standards of personal integrity in their private conduct extends to conduct engaged in prior to their commission as a minister; the adequacy of the prime minister’s actions to assess whether minister Porter meets the requirements of the prime minister’s statement of ministerial standards of 30 August 2018, including paragraph 1.3(iv); and any related matters. It is not permanent – it is for three months. But for those three months, three members of the family (so only one adult) are not considered to be in community detention. However, one member of the family remains in community detention. And why now? Well, one reason is community expectations. But another one is pre-empting Barnaby Joyce/protecting Joyce, given he had begun to push for the family before he was returned to the Nationals leadership. Peter Dutton stopped him from having to answer a question on that yesterday, when he was asked on question time – almost before the question was finished. So operation pre-empt Joyce is up and running. Alex Hawke has sent out an update – three of the Murugappan family have been granted bridging visas (which means they can work and study): Yesterday at the request of the Sri Lankan family formerly resident in Christmas Island, I exercised my power under section 195A of the Migration Act, granting members of the family three-month bridging visas, providing work and study rights. Under section 195A a minister can intervene to grant a person a visa if it is in the public interest to do so. This decision allows three members of the family to reside in the Perth community on bridging visas while the youngest child’s medical care, and the family’s legal matters, are ongoing. The fourth family member’s visa status is unchanged. The family will continue to have access to health care, support services, housing and schooling in the Perth community. And Tasmania has as well. Via AAP: Tasmania is closing its border with seven local government areas in Sydney in response to a growing number of coronavirus cases in the NSW capital. The City of Sydney, Randwick, Inner West, Woollahra, Waverley, Canada Bay and Bayside will be considered high risk from 4pm on Wednesday. Anyone who has been in the regions on or since 11 June won’t be allowed to enter Tasmania unless given special permission by the deputy state controller. Tasmanians returning home who have been in any of the high-risk areas will be required to quarantine for 14 days at a suitable premises. Transit through high-risk areas directly to the airport is allowed under existing arrangements. NSW recorded 13 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday following a “super-spreader” event, prompting a raft of new restrictions for people in metropolitan Sydney. Tasmania’s public health director, Mark Veitch, has urged anyone in the state who has been in NSW since 11 June to monitor for symptoms and check the list of specific high-risk venues. Anyone in Tasmania who has been at the high-risk venues must immediately self-isolate and contact the public health hotline. In the middle of all those news bombs earlier today, South Australia also changed its restrictions to New South Wales. As AAP reports: South Australia has closed its border with NSW because of the “real risk” posed by the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Sydney. Premier Steven Marshall says the situation in NSW is deteriorating and immediate action has been taken to keep South Australians safe. The ban will not apply to essential workers, returning South Australians and other people granted exemptions. There will also a 100km buffer zone along the border to allow people living in close communities, including Broken Hill, to still travel into SA. “It’s unfortunate that this has to be done. We do recognise this causes a significant impact on people,” the police commissioner, Grant Stevens, said. “Clearly, the advice from SA Health has created an elevated level of concern.” Stevens said people already in transit to SA, by air or road, would be managed at the airport and on the border and either granted exemptions or turned around, depending on their individual circumstances. People allowed to stay may be required to quarantine for 14 days. The border closure follows more reported virus cases in Sydney on Wednesday, taking the current outbreak to 31. This was very quick: Pauline Hanson has turned her attention to the Nationals over net zero by 2050. Her office has released this statement: Climate change ideology continues to divide the Australian Government and put the lifestyle and livelihoods of farmers at risk. One Nation leader Senator Pauline Hanson said farmers needed a firm commitment from the Nationals on the prospect of net zero emissions by 2050 that protected their lifestyles and businesses. “Barnaby Joyce might say the Nationals view this through ‘different eyes’ but with his deputy saying ‘never say never’, farmers are understandably very concerned the Nationals are abandoning farmers to shore up their power in the Coalition,” Senator Hanson said. “As long as the Coalition, Labor and the Greens continue to pay lip service and waste billions of dollars to placate climate change zealots, Australia will continue to be held hostage by unaccountable climate change ideology. “This puts our farmers’ lifestyles and livelihoods at risk, along with Australia’s long term food security. The prospect of farmers being paid by taxpayers not to farm in order to meet some arbitrary emissions target decades in the future is appalling, and smacks of the anti-competitive farming subsidies employed by the European Union and the United States to disadvantage more efficient Australian producers. “One Nation is firmly committed against net zero emissions by 2050. We want farmers doing what they do best – producing the food and fibre which has cemented Australia’s reputation as a leader in agriculture, looking after the land like only they know how, and bringing much needed export dollars into our economy and into rural communities. We need to get out of their way, not tie their hands behind their backs and undermine our future food security. “The Nationals have failed farmers on water reform in the Murray-Darling Basin. They failed the dairy industry in its crisis. Farmers are looking for effective, decisive leadership and they’re not getting it from the Nationals. Farmers are looking for a firm commitment to protect their lifestyles and livelihoods and they’re not getting it from the Nationals. “Memories are short. In 2019, Queensland voters sent a clear message by rejecting climate change ideology in favour of jobs and energy security; without this support, the Coalition would not be in government today. The Nationals will ignore this rejection at their peril.” Mike Bowers made a visit to the Senate, where Penny Wong was all of us: Question time ends. There is one more of those before the winter break. Chris Bowen asks Barnaby Joyce whether or not the NSW removal of stamp duty for electric vehicles will help ‘kill the weekend’ and Joyce responds with a bunch of things that will kill the weekend for coal workers, so this is who we are now. The Tveeder transcriber is really struggling with Barnaby Joyce’s return to relevance. It’s like we need subtitles for the subtitles. The ACT has updated its travel advice for NSW: Due to the evolving Covid-19 situation in NSW, the ACT government is updating travel directions for people travelling to the ACT from affected areas of NSW. People should not be travelling between greater Sydney and the ACT at this time. From 4pm today, the ACT government will introduce a new ‘stay-at-home’ requirement for anyone who leaves the following seven local government areas (LGAs) of greater Sydney – City of Sydney, Waverley, Randwick, Canada Bay, Inner West, Bayside and Woollahra – and enters the ACT. In addition, anyone who has been in the broader greater Sydney, Central Coast, Nepean, Blue Mountains, Wollongong and Shellharbour regions of NSW (including the LGAs above) in the past 14 days, will need to complete an online declaration form on the Covid-19 website. This form will be available from 6pm tonight (23 June). This is to ensure we are able to contact people if travel directions need to be escalated in the coming days. At this time, these requirements will remain in place for at least one week, until 11.59pm Wednesday 30 June 2021. If you must travel for essential reasons, you must abide by all public health directions in place in NSW and the ACT. This includes changing travel plans and adhering to public health instructions upon your return. ACT Health is continuing to monitor the situation very closely and will put in place further directions if required in order to keep our community safe. We will provide regular updates on the evolving situation. Madeleine King to Barnaby Joyce: My question is to the deputy prime minister and minister for regional development and I refer to his answer about comments by the Western Australian Nationals leader about his ability to work with the women of regional Australia. How can the deputy prime minister do his job, as regional development minister, when so many regional women who know him well object to him holding high office? Joyce: Well, I thank the honourable member for her question and I suppose I return to my answers of yesterday. That I acknowledge that in a whole range of areas there are people who may dislike me and there are people who like me. That’s part of politics. I’m sure there are blokes who dislike me as well. And that is part of life. ... On reflection of – as we go through life, we always try to learn from our mistakes. And become a better person. In case you missed it, Phil Coorey from the AFR reported that Joyce’s partner (and Daily Telegraph columnist) Vikki Campion has been at question time tactic meetings. So there is that as well. Sussan Ley is still trying to explain how she was blindsided by the draft Unesco decision to declare the Great Barrier Reef as ‘in danger’ because even though climate change is the biggest threat to the reef, the Coalition government doesn’t think what Australia isn’t doing on climate change should count towards the reef’s future. Warren Entsch asked her the dixer and she says that the place would be a “very different place without him”, which is true – Entsch is going around again at the next election because his seat is not a natural Coalition seat – it is held by the strength of his personal popularity in the electorate. So yes, the parliament would look different without him, because there is every chance the Coalition would lose Leichhardt without him, which is not a seat it can afford to lose, given the numbers in the House. Catherine King doesn’t get this one in: This week Steph Ryan the deputy leader of the Nationals in Victoria said, ‘I have never made any secret of the fact that I think Barnaby Joyce’s previous actions didn’t really make him eligible for the top job.’ Why do so many regional women who know the deputy prime minister say he is unfit for the job. It is ruled out of order. Amanda Rishworth asks Barnaby Joyce: Is the government planning any policy changes to increase female workforce participation in regional Australia? Or does the deputy prime minister agree with one of his government colleagues who says women using childcare and I quote, ‘Are outsourcing parenting’. Joyce: Look, I do support childcare, I absolutely support childcare. In fact, I’m one of the beneficiaries of childcare and I live in a regional area. It is important that either parent that takes on a primary caring role and at times it’s the case that both have to go out to make the payments, to pay for the house, to pay for the car, and this is a vital component of how our society works, and we’re lucky we can do it, Mr Speaker, because we have to have these changes that are actually improving it are brought in by this side of the parliament. It’s this side of the parliament that has understood that concept and it’s this side of the parliament that is championing that those, whether they’re mothers at home or fathers at home, have to wait until we were on the Treasury benches for these issues to be dealt with. The interjections from Labor are “this is just weird”. But it gets weirder – Joyce doesn’t seem to know who the minister in charge of childcare is and says “now, I might ask the minister, if she wishes, to add to my comments”. (At least that is how it sounded on the broadcast.) Except it is Alan Tudge, who has not, as far as I know, changed his pronouns. Before that, it was Dan Tehan. I mean, this is the Coalition. It’s always safer to assume the minister will be a male, just in general. It is a much more subdued Barnaby Joyce today. He’s still Barnaby though, so subdued Barnaby is still more Barnaby than is ever needed. Terri Butler asks Barnaby Joyce about the Victorian Nationals’ attempts to blow up the Murray-Darling Basin Plan: He can’t really answer the ‘why now’ or even ‘why’ question, so there is a lot of ‘we are listening about jobs’ and it finishes with: So if you’re asking me why are the Nationals in the Senate making sure that these people understand that we hear them and respect their views, that is because that is what the Nationals’ job is. Australia’s top foreign affairs and trade official says she has not advised the government to strengthen its climate policies in order to reduce the risk of the country facing carbon border tariffs. Frances Adamson, who finishes up as head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade later this week before taking up the role of South Australian governor, implied carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAM) were an idea that would not go away. But she also suggested they were currently being used mainly as a “forcing mechanism” (presumably to push for higher climate ambition). The European Union, United Kingdom, United States and Japan are among those to have explored such proposals as a way to avoid “leakage” of emissions to less climate-ambitious jurisdictions. Adamson told the National Press Club: I think obviously, it’s something that’s being talked about. And you know, when something sort of breaks through as an acronym, a CBAM, you know that it’s not just an idea that’s going to be here today and gone tomorrow. My trade negotiator colleagues - and I do think we’ve got some of the world’s best - tell me that it’s not at all clear how this might work in technical terms in a way that is WTO-consistent. I think at the moment it is being used, if I might say so, as a sort of forcing mechanism - a potential forcing mechanism. How it might work in practice, I think, has yet to be seen. But Australia will certainly be engaged, including through our mission to the WTO, in discussions about what this might mean and whether in fact it will be consistent with the World Trade Organisation rules. We’ve got a big stake in ensuring that that organisation recovers its sense of purpose, particularly in order to talk about an economic recovery. When asked by Guardian Australia whether she had provided advice to the Australian government on reducing the risk that it faces by increasing its level of climate ambition, Adamson said: That’s a direct question. I’ll answer it with a direct [answer]: No. Out of all the ministers, it is Peter Dutton who really struggles with the rule of staying on topic and not just swinging around a verbal sledgehammer. Thoughts and prayers for Sgt Dutton as he goes through this difficult time. In the wise words of Pitbull though, when it comes to tough times ‘believe me, been there, done that. But every day above ground is a great day, remember that’. Tony Burke: This parliament has been used for 120 years to debate the issues of the day. If on the day, as new [Covid] cases are coming out, and borders are closing, the government won’t accept a debate in the middle of a global pandemic, how bad does a crisis have to be before the government will allow this parliament to be used as a parliament? Dutton: Well, Mr Speaker, I’ve been in this parliament for a few years now, and I have seen a few debates, I have seen a few governments in action. I can remember very clearly, Mr Speaker, when the Labor party was sitting on this side of the House. We were denied day after day, Mr Speaker... I’ll tell you what hasn’t been accepted by those opposite. What hasn’t been accepted by those opposite is that they and they lost the last election. Now they sit on that side without the numbers in this chamber so don’t whinge about it. Don’t whinge about it. It’s a result of your own failings. You went to the last election...promising taxes on every Australian. And you wonder why they voted you out. ...You went to the last election promising to restart boats and to surrender our sovereignty on borders. No wonder the Australian public rejected you. And I’ll tell you, Mr Speaker, as we move around the country now, and you speak to Australians from one corner of the country to the other, I’ll tell you what Australians are saying; thank God Bill Shorten’s not the Prime Minister of this country. That’s exactly what the people of Australia are saying. Anthony Albanese with a point of order: The minister is misleading parliament. People can’t move around this country. Tony Smith says that isn’t a point of order but adds he was just about to ask Dutton to be relevant to the question. I’d ask the Leader of the House to be relevant to the question. The question was a procedural one and he was asked that in his capacity as the Leader of the House. It wasn’t an opportunity for a wide-ranging critique or history lesson on elections past. Dutton: ...As we hear from the Australian public, to go to the very point raised in the question from the honourable member opposite, the Australian public has seen the government’s response to COVID and I tell you what, they look at what is happening around the world and Australians are grateful that we are living in the country that we are today. We made a decision, Mr Speaker, in the National Security Committee of cabinet over 12 months ago to lock our country down and to close our border with China, the greatest decision, Mr Speaker, during the period of COVID because it stopped that virus coming to our country. Mr Speaker, at the same time, the prime minister has demonstrated the leadership to stand up and to be with the premiers*, to make decisions in relation to the health system that has saved this country tens of thousands of deaths, Mr Speaker. He then decides he has concluded his answer. *This is not exactly how it happened. And the ‘stand up and to stand with the premiers’ didn’t happen until both the WA and Qld elections proved how electorally popular lockdowns were. Until then, it was game on. So, if we are getting a history lesson there, probably best not to continue to rewrite it. Before question time, a group of Nationals held a press conference to explain the party’s decision to try to amend government legislation for the Murray Darling Basin plan. Victorian senator Bridget McKenzie said Nationals MPs had agreed to the changes in Monday’s party room meeting, but they had not brought this to the attention of Tuesday’s joint party room meeting. Instead, the Nats chose to spring the proposal on their Liberal colleagues in the Senate this morning. McKenzie suggested the party would be pushing to have the position included in the new Coalition agreement if the Liberals blocked the move in the Senate. “We hope the Liberals do come on board with these amendments because they’re sensible, they’re actually what the community has been asking for,” McKenzie said. “They actually just articulate what is already existing government policy. So they shouldn’t be afraid of these amendments.” McKenzie said that if the party had attempted to negotiate amendments through government channels, the opportunity to amend the legislation would never have arisen. “If we had said four months ago, late last year, (that) if the Water Act and the Murray Darling Basin Plan Act ever come before the Senate we will be moving amendments to it, it would never have happened. Because we have very different views.” Damian Drum said it had been “difficult and tough” to get the legislation ready, and revealed the party had been planning the move for months. But Drum insisted the timing of the move was unrelated to the change of leader, nor a sign of the junior Coalition party being prepared to flex their muscle. “This has got nothing to do with Barnaby or Michael, we have been planning on this for months,” Drum said. Not surprisingly, Simon Birmingham has told the Senate the government will not be supporting the rogue Nationals amendments to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. “Yes, it is the case that when those amendments come to a vote, I and government will be voting against those amendments.” Birmingham goes on: We are proud as a government to have ensured that billions and billions, thousands of billions of litres of additional water entitlements have been secured to support environmental flows across the Murray-Darling Basin. The government stands resolute in its support for the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, as we have said, in full and on time.” The head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Frances Adamson, was asked during her address to the National Press Club in Canberra about the proposed designation of the Great Barrier Reef on the world heritage “in danger” list. Adamson said Australia would deal with the issue “as a technical issue, and work through the system ... the best way that we can”. She did not respond directly to vague accusations that China may have played some part in the recommendation, but offered the following broad observation: “Due process around these things is really important, and underscores the important value of the [rules-based] system that we’re talking about and investing in. So I read what’s said, I hear what’s said. From a diplomatic perspective, we’re working through it as a technical issue.” Josh Frydenberg is yelling about stuff. Again. The suspension motion fails. This is totally about farmers, and not at all about swinging eggplants around and causing problems because they can. Here were the ‘let’s blow up the Murray Darling plan, even though it is government legislation and has been signed off by our party room and the cabinet, and has been around for awhile, but we have just decided to do it now that Barnaby Joyce is leader, but that means nothing, Nats’ at their press conference a little earlier today: Sometimes, the angles just work While we wait for this latest suspension of standing orders to fail, NSW Health has updated its exposure site list: The motion: That the House, 1, notes, A, there is a global pandemic. B, there have been at least 25 Covid outbreaks from hotel quarantine. C, fewer than 3% of Australians are fully vaccinated. D, the prime minister had two jobs this year: to roll out vaccine and establish a safe national system of quarantine and he has bungled both jobs. E, the outbreak in Sydney is worsening by the hour. F, new restrictions are being imposed on businesses and households. G, borders are slamming shut as Australia heads into school holidays. H, the prime minister says the vaccine rollout is not a race. And, I, the NSW premier said today, “NSW has had a real sense of urgency in relation to the vaccine rollout. Until the vast majority of our population is vaccinated, these threats will be real and ongoing.” And, 2, therefore calls on the prime minister to urgently fix his bungled vaccine rollout and establish a safe, national system of quarantine. Anthony Albanese finishes it with “Mr Speaker, we needed more jabbings and less stabbings (he means backstabbings)“ but then he is gagged. Labor moves to suspend standing orders for the third day this week – it’s again on how terrible Labor thinks the government is. There are a lot of words, but that is the basics of the motion (as it is every motion Labor moves). Katharine Murphy tells me that Barnaby Joyce wandered up to the backbench to have a chat to Michael McCormack Speaking of carp, Barnaby Joyce gets up and shouts a lot of things about coal and mining jobs. There are less than 40,000 coal mining jobs in Australia. But they are apparently the most important jobs in the country, according to the Nationals leader. Really not sure “carping negativity” is having the impact the prime minister thinks it is – but he’s proud of it. That is at least the third or fourth reference in just three questions. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: “Premiers and chief ministers around the country have done the heavy lifting fighting the Covid virus. Labor and Liberal premiers are giving the prime minister clear warnings about the urgency of the vaccine rollout which stands at 3 per cent and the need for a safe national system of quarantine. What will it take for this prime minister to fix his bungled vaccine rollout and establish a safe national system of quarantine?” Morrison: The government has had two clear jobs through this pandemic. The first of those is to save lives. And the second is to save livelihoods. Our job has been to save lives and to save livelihoods, and we know that were it not for the actions of the government working together with governments around this country, our experience compared to those of like countries around the world more than 30,000 Australians would have perished during this crisis. That didn’t occur because of the actions taken on our watch. In addition to that we have saved livelihoods to ensure that Australia’s economy is stronger today than before the pandemic hit and in addition to that there are more Australians employed today than before the pandemic hit. There have been many measures we have put in place to secure those. Those have included an investment of more than $310 billion in health initiatives as well as economic supports to achieve those results. Now, Mr Speaker, reference is made to the actions of the state and I commend the actions of the state. In fact, Mr Speaker, as prime minister, I called the states together into the national cabinet to ensure that our actions were coordinated, and one of the first actions we took ... was to agree to put in place a system of hotel quarantine around this country that has been a key measures in ensuring that Australia has been able to have the success that it has. Breaches from any form of quarantine, Mr Speaker, in a global pandemic are inevitable and that is why the further rings of containment with contact tracing, social distancing and other measures are vital. The vaccination program, which I have indicated, has reached some 6.86 million people, two-thirds almost of Australians aged over 70 in the most populations having already received their first dose and more than a quarter of Australians aged over 16 having received their first dose. As the vaccination program continues to escalate, as we move from the AstraZeneca vaccine to the Pfizer vaccines, which were timed for their delivery because of international supply constraints in the second half of the year, that will continue to rollout. We have also invested half a billion (dollars) in the quarantine facilities in the Northern Territory, which was recommended by the Halton review. In addition to that, we are partnering with states, particularly Victoria right now, on the development of additional facilities to supplement the hotel quarantine program not to replace it. So, Mr Speaker, the actions that our government has taken have saved lives and have saved livelihoods. That has been our focus. The politics in this has and has been left to the opposition, who have sought only to undermine in carping negativity rather than engaging in the national project which this government has led to the great advantage of Australians. Tony Smith says it is particularly pointless for Labor MPs to heckle a screen. Anthony Albanese points out that is what usually happens with Sky After Dark. Ed Husic, who should probably stop yelling things if he doesn’t want to get booted out, heckles: “Why am I watching Sky News at night during QT!” To which I ask the good member – is he new here? Where does he think everyone practises their lines? The first dixer is just an excuse for Scott Morrison to continue his theme of ‘carping negativity’. He again looks like he is reading from an autocue – either that, or he doesn’t know where the lens of the camera is. This is a Labor party obsessed with carping negativity, opposing the government’s measures to keep our economy strong through the pandemic. What we’ve been able to achieve as a country has not been with the support of the opposition. Their approach has just been negativity and ideology. That is not going to get us to a low emissions future, it’s not going to get resource projects approved in our states and territories at a commonwealth level. The Labor party needs to saddle up with the economic improvement that we’re seeking to put in place to bring Australia out of the Covid-19 pandemic strongly. Instead, what we’re getting is negativity. Anthony Albanese decides to ask the prime minister a question: “The NSW Covid outbreak is worsening and borders are closing. The prime minister says it is not a race but the NSW premier said today there is a real sense of urgency, and until the vast majority of our population is vaccinated these threats will be real. How many outbreaks will it take before the government fixes the bungled vaccine rollout and creates a safe, national quarantine system? Scott Morrison (via the screen): Thank you, Mr Speaker. I spoke to the premier earlier today, and we spoke specifically about if there was any need for further vaccine doses to be distributed in NSW, and the premier advised me that she was pleased with the dosage distribution. That was her clear advice to me today, and that was advised to the national cabinet by the lieutenant general earlier in the week. I commend the NSW premier for the way she is handling the outbreak in NSW. The fact that she hasn’t gone to lock down Australia’s biggest city but has taken the positive decision to keep Sydney and NSW open for its residents and to continue to rely on what is Australia’s best contact tracing system in NSW. Mr Speaker, I can advise even at today, two-thirds, 66.27%, just under two-thirds of our population over the age of 70 has now been vaccinated ... In the last 24 hours some 140,819 doses have been administered. We are now at 6.86 million doses having been administered in Australia. Now, Mr Speaker, it might suit the politics of the leader of the opposition to run down Australia’s performance. It may suit the politics of the leader of the opposition to undermine Australia’s efforts as we lead the world when it comes to managing Covid in this country, Mr Speaker. ... The leader of the opposition needs to understand that carping negativity is not a substitute for policy positions, Mr Speaker. The opposition has been invited for more than a year to join the government in our efforts to combat the virus. But throughout the pandemic they have chosen time and again, Mr Speaker, to just pursue political point-scoring rather than joining and supporting the national effort. Now, 95%of Australians, Mr Speaker, we saw in the Lowy poll today, believe Australia has handled this pandemic well, and the evidence, when you look at the case numbers in Australia, the fatality rate in Australia, which could have been 30,000 more were it not for the steps taken by governments including our government to ensure that Australia has positioned itself as one of the best countries in the world as we move through this pandemic. The opposition seems to believe that when there is a global pandemic there can’t be transmission of a virus. That is a foolish position and a misleading position, Mr Speaker. We have taken a realistic approach, working with governments around the country to keep Australians safe, to protect lives and protect livelihoods. The opposition continues to focus on politics and point scoring ... rather than supporting a national effort. Small side point on the Victorian Nationals deciding to try to blow up the Murray Darling plan – given that it is government legislation they are trying to amend, that means it first went through the cabinet, then the Nationals party room and the joint party room. So once it has the sign-off from those three places (cabinet most importantly) it is locked in as government policy. So the rogue Nationals are now trying to amend it (led by their senate leader), which puts the other Nationals in a bind – because they will have to vote against Nationals and government policy. And if Nationals ministers now support this change, they are going against the cabinet. Which usually means you have to resign from cabinet, because that’s the rule – going against the cabinet position, once it has been signed off, is going against cabinet solidarity. Officially, that rule is: Members of the Cabinet must publicly support all Government decisions made in the Cabinet, even if they do not agree with them. Cabinet ministers cannot dissociate themselves from, or repudiate the decisions of their Cabinet colleagues unless they resign from the Cabinet. Barnaby Joyce is back in cabinet. Bridget McKenzie says Joyce supports it. But technically, he can’t, unless he wants to resign from cabinet again. Or the cabinet changes its position. The only other option is this is just sabre-rattling, because they can and Bridget McKenzie, who is going back into the ministry, just wants the water portfolio. And on the Labor side, they have their own problems. The Joyce-surection has caused waves everywhere If you’ve been with Amy all day you’ll know everyone in politics today is coming off the long run. The Nationals are using the opportunity of the Joycesurrection to stick their elbows out. The Nationals Senate leader Bridget McKenzie has just used the period of senators’ statements prior to question time to warn against signing up to net zero by 2050. McKenzie didn’t oppose the target outright but she said Australia “must be wary” of setting targets that will cost thousands of jobs. She added Australia should not “sleepwalk” into an international agreement that favours “rich developed countries” with a natural advantage (and what she means by that is countries with nuclear power plants). She says those countries are able to reduce emissions without upending their manufacturing sectors because nuclear is not intermittent. It is base load power. She said coal and gas would continue to underpin Australia’s prosperity for decades to come. She said Australia should continue to export high quality coal to the region. You could actually fact check every sentence in this contribution, but it’s nearly question time so I’ll keep it simple. Two points. 1. Australia is already a signatory to the Paris agreement which puts the world on the net zero path by mid-century. That’s already happened, and this government was the government that signed Australia up. McKenzie’s government. Tony Abbott took the decision, and Malcolm Turnbull presided over ratification. It’s done. 2. If we want nuclear energy, understand one thing. Nuclear energy is not economic in this country without a carbon price. That would be the carbon price that this government repealed back in 2013. The quickest way to incentivise nuclear (apart from the required regulatory change) is to legislate a carbon price. Question time will be on in less than 30 minutes. It will once again be the Barnaby show I’m really, really sorry Sydney. We’re all really hoping that authorities get on top of this outbreak really soon. Mark McGowan has updated the travel advice for NSW – and it goes a little further than Queensland and Victoria: Following updated health advice related to the Covid-19 outbreak in New South Wales, WA has strengthened its border controls to reduce the risk of the virus coming into the WA community. NSW has transitioned from ‘very low risk’ (with a test and quarantine regime) to ‘medium risk’ under our controlled interstate border, effective from 11am today (23 June). This returns us to hard border arrangements with New South Wales. Under the medium risk classification, travel from or through NSW is no longer permitted, except for exempt travellers. This also applies to anyone who may have been in NSW since 11 June and has not subsequently been in a ‘very low risk’ State or Territory for 14 days – this includes anyone travelling from the ACT who has travelled into NSW in that time. The exemption list is limited to: - certain senior Government officials; - certain active military personnel; - a member of the Commonwealth Parliament; - a person carrying out functions under a law of the Commonwealth; - a person responsible for transport freight or logistics; and - anyone who is given approval by State Emergency Coordinator or an authorised officer. The final category includes compassionate reasons – including those Western Australians that may have travelled to NSW recently and need to return to WA. These people will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by WA Police and arrivals will be required to complete 14 days of self-quarantine and be tested for COVID-19 on arrival and on day 11. Anyone who has previously arrived from NSW in the past two weeks should continue to monitor their symptoms and get tested immediately if any develop. In line with previous advice, anyone who has recently arrived from NSW and was at an exposure site are required to get tested and self-quarantine for 14 days from the date of exposure. Back to the press club and Frances Adamson says the so-called list of 14 grievances issued by the Chinese embassy last year was “a massive own-goal by China” because no Australian government would be able to move on the issues listed. “I couldn’t understand why they did it ... I think it has played very negatively for them.” She won’t say how long she thinks Australia will remain in the diplomatic freezer, but says the Chinese government is “immensely pragmatic” and Beijing will return to the table when it sees it as being in its interests to take a different approach. After days of discussions with the Victorian government, the A-League grand final will go ahead in Melbourne. Melbourne City were at high risk of being forced to play their home decider against Sydney FC in another state, but the Australian Professional Leagues on Wednesday announced the match will be staged on Sunday afternoon at AAMI Park, which will operate at 50% of its 29,500 capacity. Crowds will also return to AFL matches in Melbourne, capped at 25,000 fans at both the MCG and Marvel Stadium before a planned boost to 85% capacity next week. It is less than the 50% cap for which the AFL had lobbied, but means Friday night’s Richmond-St Kilda match at the MCG will be the first fixture played in front of spectators in the city since 23 May. The NRL has a bye week, given State of Origin game two is being played in Brisbane at the weekend. NSW Blues players have already left Sydney and are in camp just south of Queensland in Kingscliff, but will have to cross the border before tomorrow after Queensland closed its border to certain LGAs in Sydney from 1am Thursday. Those NRL players still left in Sydney are back in a bubble and unable to leave home except for essential activities and training. The ‘what the hell are you doing Victorian Nats’ avengers assembled for a press conference. It’s fairly rare to see this group together, if that gives you any indication of how annoyed they are at the Bridget McKenzie et al ‘intervention’. Bridget McKenzie is now making a statement on climate policy in the senate. It seems that McKenzie is just blowing up all the things today. In the midst of all of that, Victoria announced it was going to further ease restrictions come Friday morning. That’s after a week of having no more than one case a day (and several zeroes). James Merlino: On the advice of the Chief Health Officer, restrictions in regional Victoria and metropolitan Melbourne will ease from 11.59pm tomorrow night and in the interests of giving everyone some certainty and stability, these settings will be in place for the next two weeks. State-wide, a number of changes will apply. Public gatherings will be allowed with up to 50 people and gatherings in the home will be permitted with up to 15 visitors to a home per day, including dependants. This means for those spending time in accommodation, the rules will now permit the booking household, plus a further 15 people to go away together, in line with the new private gatherings numbers. Funerals and weddings can move to a cap of 300 people, subject to the density limits of the venue. The work from home recommendation will be removed and office caps increase to 75% or 30 people, whichever is greater, but a density number will still apply. Physical REC and community sporting venues will be able to have up to 300 people per indoor space. That is important for basketball stadiums and the like and 1,000 outdoors, subject to density limits. Seated entertainment venues will be able to increase capacity up to 75% and a maximum of 300 per space indoors and 1,000 people outdoors. There are some changes to visitor limits at hospital and care facilities, so that two visitors at a time, up to five visitors per day will be allowed. Although I note some facilities will have additional measures in place, above and beyond the CHO requirements. Mask requirements will remain the same. They are required indoors, except in your home and they are recommended when you can’t keep 1.5m away from other outdoors. Although the same caps apply state-wide in these settings, communities in regional Victoria will be able to use a density of one person per two square metres, provided a Covid check-in marshal is present to require people to check in. This includes physical recreation venues, community facilities, creative studios and places of worship. This requirement underscores just how important it is that we’re able to trace people in the event of an outbreak. Frances Adamson suggests that any hopes China may have of a fundamental policy rethink from the Australian government would ignore the “very real impact” of China’s behaviour on Australia, and bipartisanship in Canberra on the most fundamental policy settings. She cites the Lowy poll indicating Australians’ trust in the Chinese government has fallen to record lows. The outgoing Dfat chief and former ambassador to Beijing, Frances Adamson, cites “siege mentality” in China’s external engagement under Xi. Adamson is addressing the National Press Club. The parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security report into the review of the re-listing of Hizballah’s External Security Organisation as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code has been tabled. Things are completely normal in the Coalition. There are a lot of people asking this, so as one of the resident Queenslanders in the gallery, as I understand it, you can still transfer through the Sydney airport to Queensland even with the border closure to Sydney – as long as you don’t catch public transport (bus or train). So direct to the airport in private transport, or direct through the airport is fine. Mark Dreyfus responded to Nola Marino’s move to have the Victorian quarantine bill urgently put through the parliament (bypassing the committee): The Morrison government had two jobs and it has failed at them both. It had the job of getting quarantine right. It is a constitutional responsibility of the commonwealth, and the commonwealth has ducked that responsibility from the get-go in this pandemic. The other job that it has failed to get right is the vaccine rollout. But right here and now I’m going to speak about quarantine, because the exemption of this project from the ordinary requirements of this parliament and the ordinary requirements that it go before the Public Works Committee is only needed because the Morrison government failed to get onto this last year. We’ve known for 12 months that hotel quarantine is grossly inadequate, that hotel quarantine is a temporary fix, that hotel quarantine is not the perfect solution. Far from it – hotel quarantine is not even an adequate solution. We’ve had 24 outbreaks from hotel quarantine. Think about that: 24 outbreaks, each of them capable of giving rise to a massive spread of this deadly disease across our country. It’s only good luck, good management by state premiers and the immensely cooperative behaviour of Australians that has prevented those 24 outbreaks from the inadequate hotel quarantine arrangements that we have and has saved us from the recurrence of the deaths that we had across our country, particularly in aged care, in the middle of last year. The government commissioned a report from an eminent former secretary of the commonwealth health department to tell the commonwealth government what needed to be done for quarantine in Australia. And what did we get? We got a report from this eminent former secretary of the commonwealth department of health that told the commonwealth of Australia that they needed to build dedicated quarantine facilities. It’s not like this is a new idea for the commonwealth of Australia. Australians in every capital city are deeply familiar with the commonwealth-run facilities that are now museums. Think North Head in Sydney or Point Nepean in Victoria where the commonwealth used to have its own dedicated facilities for infectious diseases. It doesn’t now because we’ve resolved other arrangements to deal with infectious diseases, but this pandemic is presenting us with a challenge that the Morrison government has utterly failed to meet. It’s continuing to fail to meet this challenge. It thumbed its nose at Victoria’s proposals when they were first made. We still don’t have exactly clear what it is the commonwealth wants to do. It took months to get to the position that it’s announcing here today, and that is that it wants to go ahead with a joint venture with Victoria to build a dedicated quarantine facility in Victoria. It should have been doing this last October. We’ve known since last October, when the report that it commissioned was delivered to the commonwealth government, that a Howard Springs-style facility is what is required. There hasn’t been a single escape of this deadly virus from Howard Springs. There hasn’t been an outbreak from Howard Springs. There has been an outbreak from every part of the hotel quarantine system. Victoria had to go back into lockdown because of someone leaving hotel quarantine in South Australia and spreading the virus throughout Melbourne, which happily, again, we’ve managed to get on to. But it’s a disgrace. It is a disgrace that the Morrison government has squibbed its responsibilities, ducked its responsibilities, run away from its responsibilities. You’ve only got to think about the disgraceful performance of the prime minister going right back to the bushfires. ‘I don’t hold a hose, mate’. That is Scott Morrison. ‘I don’t hold a hose, mate,’ and he’s at it again. Hursty is at the Adamson address. He says the audience includes Marise Payne, Penny Wong, Simon Birmingham and ADF chief Angus Campbell*. *There are too many Angus’s in public life Outgoing Dfat boss Frances Adamson is addressing the National Press Club today. We will bring you those updates as well. Meanwhile, the Nationals’ ‘meet the team’ banner on their website’s homepage still has Michael McCormack’s photo. Might need a bit of an update. The Nationals leader in the Senate, Bridget McKenzie, has contributed to the Murray Darling debate in the Senate. McKenzie said that water buybacks during the millennial drought had “devastated families, communities and industries” that are only now recovering. She said it was “incredibly galling” that Nationals senators had been accused of not caring about the health of the river, because “we live there and we know it”. McKenzie said the 450GL of water was a “bald set of numbers that we know weren’t based in science”, arguing that you can’t demonstrate commitment to the environment “using the blunt instrument of numbers alone”. The 450GL was “never guaranteed” it was “always dependent on there being no socio-economic impacts”, she said. McKenzie: When we did a review ... [it found the] need to change this plan is pressing. That’s why we are here today. There is no point in piously drafting a private senator’s bill ... We’ve been waiting patiently, not for a change of leader – for the Water Act and Murray Darling Basin Plan Act to come before the Senate.” This is still happening in the Senate – Paul Karp is listening so you don’t have to. In case you missed them, here is the NSW health announcement on the new restrictions: Following updated health advice from the chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, about the growing risk to the community, the following restrictions will be introduced for Greater Sydney, the Central Coast, Blue Mountains, Wollongong and Shellharbour: Visitors to households will be limited to 5 guests – including children; Masks will be compulsory in all indoor non-residential settings, including workplaces, and at organised outdoor events; Drinking while standing at indoor venues will not be allowed; Singing by audiences at indoor shows or by congregants at indoor places of worship will not be allowed; Dancing will not be allowed at indoor hospitality venues or nightclubs however, dancing is allowed at weddings for the bridal party only (no more than 20 people); Dance and gym classes limited to 20 per class (masks must be worn); The one person per four square metre rule will be re-introduced for all indoor and outdoor settings, including weddings and funerals; Outdoor seated events will be limited to 50% seated capacity; Previous public transport capacity limits, represented by green dots, will be reintroduced; If you live or work in the City of Sydney, Waverley, Randwick, Canada Bay, Inner West, Bayside, and Woollahra local government areas, you cannot travel outside metropolitan Sydney for non-essential travel. Here is the breakdown of the new NSW numbers: Of the 10 locally reported cases to 8pm last night: Seven cases were already announced yesterday: A child who attends St Charles Catholic Primary School, Waverley. A man in his 60s from Wollongong. He is a household contact of a previously reported case and has been in isolation while infectious. Five family members who are household contacts of a previous case. They have been in isolation while infectious. Three further cases were reported to 8pm last night: A man in his 50s who works in Bondi Junction. A woman in her 40s from Wollongong. She is a close contact of a previously reported case and has been in isolation while infectious. A man in his 30s from South West Sydney. He is a close contact of a previously reported case. And the cases which came after 8pm: 13 locally acquired cases were notified overnight, after the 8pm reporting cut-off: 8 of these cases are linked to a birthday party in West Hoxton, attended by a previously reported case linked to the Bondi cluster. About 30 people attended this party and they have all been tested and are in isolation. A total of 10 people who attended the party have now tested positive for COVID-19, including a two-year-old child, who attended Little Zak’s childcare in Narellan Vale on 21 June. 1 of these cases is a close contact of a previously reported case linked to the Bondi cluster. 4 of the overnight cases are currently unlinked. Urgent investigations and contact tracing are underway. One of the cases took a flight (QF163) from Sydney to Wellington, New Zealand, departing Sydney at 7:05pm Friday 18 June and arriving in Wellington at 12:12am on Saturday 19 June. The person then returned on a flight (NZ247) from Wellington, New Zealand to Sydney on Monday 21 June 2021, departing Wellington at 10:13am and arriving in Sydney at 11:33am. Human rights lawyers have welcomed news that the privileges committee will examine whether federal court proceedings have breached parliamentary privilege by forcing pokies whistleblower Troy Stolz to hand over correspondence with Andrew Wilkie to the clubs lobby group ClubsNSW. Stolz, a former ClubsNSW employee, last year blew the whistle on the extent of money laundering through the state’s pokies. Stolz was in communication with Wilkie’s office before the independent MP tried unsuccessfully to table a document in parliament showing only 5-10% of the state’s clubs were complying with money laundering laws. ClubsNSW has since launched proceedings against Stolz in the federal court, alleging he breached a confidentiality agreement through his disclosures. The court last month ordered that Stolz hand over his communications with Wilkie to ClubsNSW. In some cases, correspondence between MPs and their constituents is protected by parliamentary privilege. On Tuesday, Wilkie successfully referred the matter to the powerful privileges committee. He has asked the committee to consider: “Whether the legal action in the Federal Court of Australia taken by the Registered Clubs Association of New South Wales against Mr Troy Stolz raises issues of parliamentary privilege or contempt such that the House should formally claim privilege and intervene in the court proceedings to assert the protection of parliamentary privilege.” Human Rights Law Centre senior lawyer Kieran Pender said the decision was a “positive step”. “Whistleblowers should be able to confidentially speak up about wrongdoing to their elected representatives without fear of those discussion being used against them in a court or elsewhere,” he said. “There are so few avenues for people to call out wrongdoing. If our ability to speak up to our elected representatives is weakened, there’ll be even fewer and our democracy will suffer as a result.” New Zealand is introducing new restrictions on gatherings after a Covid-infected Australian traveled to Wellington and visited a number of popular tourist locations. The Covid-19 response minister, Chris Hipkins, said on Wednesday that the Wellington region would move to alert level 2 from 6pm, and would remain there until Sunday. Under New Zealand’s alert level 2 conditions, gatherings are limited to under 100 people, social distancing must be observed in public places, and masks are compulsory on public transport. Hipkins said he also encouraged people to wear masks in any situation where they are interacting with people they do not know and could not observe social distancing. Hospitality venues can stay open if they are seated, with separate tables served by a single server. Hipkins said travel was not restricted, but asked anyone leaving the Wellington region to “take level 2 with them” and observe the same rules elsewhere in the country. “This is not a lockdown,” Hipkins said. He said if New Zealanders followed the precautionary measures outlined he hoped “we can break the potential chain of transmission”. Director-general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, said the infected person had likely contracted Covid-19 in Sydney before their travel to Wellington, and that they worked at a healthcare provider near Bondi Junction that an infected person had visited. Officials were still waiting for genomic testing to confirm that link. Bloomfield said there was “no information to suggest” that the person had breached trans-Tasman bubble rules. Labor’s Penny Wong has called on the Liberals to vote down Nationals amendments to gut the Murray Darling Basin Plan. Wong said that Barnaby Joyce is “allowing” the Senate Nationals, led by Bridget McKenzie, to “attack South Australia”. Wong told the Senate the issue is shaping up as a “test” for the Liberals, who she says are embarrassed by the amendments, and called on Liberal premier Stephen Marshall to pressure Morrison on the issue. Guardian Australia understands the Liberals will vote them down. But that is just round one – the next fight is whether and how hard Barnaby Joyce will raise the issue in negotiations with Scott Morrison. Wong said: Mr Morrison, this is a test for you. There are three things you need to do: strip the Nationals of the water portfolio; give a clear commitment that you as prime minister will deliver the plan in full; and give a public commitment there will be no change on water policy as part of the secret Coalition deal. That’s where these deals get done.” Nationals senator Perin Davey accused Labor and the Greens of being “only focused on one state – South Australia”. She said the amendments are “not about stealing water from South Australia”. The Senate has started debating the inspector-general of water compliance bill, which the Nationals have weaponised with amendments proposing to tear up some of the central tenets of the Murray Darling Basin Plan. In the Senate, Labor’s Glenn Sterle notes that one of the Nationals’ first acts after Joyce retook the leadership was to vote against a motion committing to implement the Murray Darling Basin Plan in full. The minister, Keith Pitt, has said the government supports the plan – but Sterle questions for how long this will remain its position. Guardian Australia has contacted the prime minister’s office to ask if the Nationals have made similar demands in negotiations between new Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, and Scott Morrison. No comment – and nothing ruled out at this stage. Sterle told the Senate the plan contains 450GL of additional water flow that is supposed to be delivered through efficiency, which secured South Australia’s participation in the plan. The water is supposed to be delivered by 2024. Sterle said just two of the 450GL have been delivered. He said: Joyce is back and suddenly the water for vulnerable ecosystems is under threat ... Bridget McKenzie made clear the Nationals believe the 450GL was never guaranteed, and science is pointing to a rethink of how we manage lower lakes.” Sterle quotes South Australian environment minister, David Speirs, who said he would be “extremely disappointed” if a change in federal Nationals leader changes the approach on the Murray Darling Basin Plan. And yet, that is what is happening. Greens senator, Sarah Hanson-Young, is up now accusing the Nationals of the same: taking too much water out of the river, harming the environment. She said: Nine years later we see Mr Barnaby Joyce as deputy prime minister and his supporters here in the Senate wanting to blow a whole in the plan, steal more water, thieve from the environment and leave downstream users and downstream states worse off. Back to parliament We have listed the restrictions for Sydney below – as soon as the health department releases them in detail, we will let you know. So there was a lot in that. NSW has been announcing case numbers in a confusing way (announcing the day’s numbers, plus ones which came after 8pm), but we know that there were an additional three cases from yesterday, plus another 13 positive tests that came in after 8pm. So that’s 16 new cases. Brad Hazzard is “as worried as he has been” since last January. Restrictions have been put in place in greater Sydney. If you live in greater Sydney you’re being asked not to travel. Masks will be mandatory in certain indoor places including workplaces and retail. Gym classes will be limited to 20 people but you have to wear a mask. There is no lockdown. But that doesn’t mean there won’t be – lockdowns aren’t being ruled out in the future. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, can’t explain why the driver who transported flight crews to quarantine wasn’t vaccinated. Everybody in the quarantine system should be vaccinated and an arrangement that is enforceable. But from time to time there are people coming in and out of the system and the human system, with a range of reasons why we might find that somebody is not vaccinated. It could be a health issue themselves so those are issues we need to look at and the police are investigating. I’m telling you that the police are investigating. ... So let’s concentrate on what we need to be doing, our serious issue, Delta variant, which could have happened at any point at any time and we have made that point for the last 12 months, 15 months but it is a human system. We have had almost 200,000 people come through our quarantine system and at any stage, there are human beings at every level working with those incoming passengers and we have to do, from time to time, expect there will be issues. ... That is all I’m prepared to say on that. Why is this outbreak different to the northern beaches outbreak? Dr Kerry Chant: Every cluster has a unique characteristic and what we saw with the northern beaches cluster was a superspreader event – that there were two different values that amplified the transmission and then we were able to get on top of it. We were not dealing with Delta at that time. What is particularly concerning is usually we would have seen a retail environment as low-risk settings. If you are shopping in the department store, they are generally not crowded places. When walking around, generally people do try to keep some distance. To see transmission occurring in the setting where the mode of transmission would have been captured on CCTV, and I don’t want to (suggest) this virus jumped across a room or anything. We saw close contact but it would be the inadvertent contact you would have in retail settings that we would not have suspected transmission could happen. We have also seen the speed at which transmission happens in households. When speaking Annastacia Palaszczuk’s request for a letter from NSW Health saying it is prepared to break the national standard for quarantine and let a couple travel to the Gold Coast to see a dying relative, Gladys Berejiklian can barely contain her frustration: At least a week ago our health minister spoke and New South Wales made it clear there was no impediment for them to make that journey. Can I be clear on that? ... [It] has been aired publicly for the last few days. Minister Hazzard will correct me but that was already made clear that we did everything we could to facilitate that. What about the impact on regional NSW tourism, given it is school holidays and Sydney has been locked out of Queensland and Victoria? Gladys Berejiklian: We are being proportionate to the risk and saying at this stage if you live or work in those seven LGAs and let’s face it, that is quite a certificate proportion of Sydney, many people work or live in those LGAs which covers a huge proportion of Sydneysiders anyway. We are being realistic and proportionate to the risk there. If you are living or working in those seven LGAs, please don’t travel outside Sydney. We don’t want to contaminate or spread this variant into the regions. We are being proportionate to the rest but it is an evolving situation. Dr Chant and her experts give us a rise in the next week or following the next week. We will ultimately follow that advice but what we have done in NSW is balance the risk, make sure we aren’t imposing restrictions over and above what we need to but when we need to act quickly, to act decisively, we have done and will. I would be prepared to make any decision or announcement if the health advice recommended that in the next few days but at this stage, this is the best advice we have and the best response we have. And I ask our citizens to do what they have done during the entire journey – to trust us, because we have listened to them, because if we need to do further, we will. We appreciate the time of year but we also appreciate the risk and that is why the response we have provided today we believe is a good response, proportionate response to the risk. Gladys Berejiklian also says the state’s hands are tied when it comes to the vaccine rollout, because they can’t get more Pfizer supplies from the federal government: We can’t increase it. The federal government is in charge. What applies to New South Wales applies to all of Australia so we aren’t special. In national cabinet, we were advised of the doses we will receive soon based on population and New South Wales will get its fair share. Given the majority of vulnerable people (they’re talking over 75s) have been vaccinated in NSW, are the restrictions necessary? Gladys Berejiklian: Firstly, we don’t have sufficient vaccination to distinguish between those that have been vaccinated and those that haven’t. This particular strand is extremely contagious and we don’t have enough of the population vaccinated to make those distinctions. If we had a higher proportion of the population vaccinated, we could have considered it but we don’t know any of that. Having said that, this strain is contagious and rather random as to how you are impacted. You could be younger and suffer very serious health consequences or death. It is random, not just older unavoidable people that may be susceptible to very serious consequences or lifelong [health problems]. That is why it is really important for all of us to protect those around us, people we work with, people who are our closest family and friends and unfortunately, we have to consider random members of the public, brushing somebody alongside, that can transfer the virus and that is how contagious it is. If everyone is so worried, why no lockdown? Gladys Berejiklian: We have always said we have considered all the options, but we have always said we will not burden our citizens unless we absolutely have to do. We know basically where the super-spreading events have been, we know where the virus is circulating, and we don’t want to take any further action than what we have now. But this relies on all of us reining in our behaviour, all of us following the health orders that are coming into place from 4pm. I am not ruling out any further action, but I am also confident that if we adhere to the health orders today, we will have a good chance of getting on top of this outbreak. I am not going to rule out further action, I am not going to rule out what happens beyond a week, because we don’t know. We certainly didn’t expect this situation a few days ago. But that is what it means, responding to a pandemic means you look at the facts, you look at the response, you look at where spread is or isn’t occurring and you are accordingly. We have had the response in New South Wales not to burden our citizens unless we absolutely have to do. We have listened to the health advice, we have listened to what has occurred and what is occurring and based on that advice is what we are announcing today. If we need to take further action within the week or after the week, we are open to that. But we just don’t know yet because the situation is evolving. If you live in the Blue Mountains or elsewhere and work in the city, what do you do? Gladys Berejiklian: That’s why we have said to assess your own situation. We don’t want people who are living or working in those LGAs to spread or move around. If you happen to work in a regional community but travel to those LGA is, we recommend you consider working from home or else living in the LGA where you work. But for essential purposes, people can still conduct their business. Just be extra cautious. If it is for an essential reason, you are able to move around. But what we are saying is if you live or work in those LGA is, we don’t want you moving outside of metropolitan Sydney. If you work in one LGA area and live in another, can you travel for work? Gladys Berejiklian: If you live or work in any of those impacted LGA is we don’t want you moving outside of metropolitan Sydney unless four essential purposes. Obviously work, visiting and ill relative are essential purposes. Can I please make this important point. I think people get the general message when we say, if you live or work within those LGAs, we don’t want you travelling outside of Sydney. If you happen to come outside of city into those LGA is, we recommend you don’t in the next week. So this comes down to health orders but also exercising common sense. We know the virus is circulating in particular around those LGA is, the unlinked cases all those cases that are under investigation are all from that geographic proximity, so this is important and proportionate action at that we are taking to prevent further spread. Having said that we are not [limiting] people’s behaviour within metropolitan city. The risks are there, we’re not saying you can’t leave the home for any reasons but when you leave your home there are bills you have to adhere to. We’re not saying you cannot leave your home for any reason in metropolitan Sydney, you can. We are not putting any objections on you leaving the home for any purpose, but if you happen to live or work in those seven LGA is, we don’t want you moving outside of Sydney. We don’t want spreading to our regions. We don’t want spreading to holiday destinations within New South Wales, at regional New South Wales in particular. And I think the vast majority of the public understand that. Brad Hazzard is really talking up QR codes and says he is as worried as he was in January last year: I know from my experience and from others’ experience, that there is a degree of tiredness and a degree of apathy about the response to the virus. But in a sense, this is a new and more dangerous version of the virus and that apathy has to be swept away. We have to actually take it seriously. The QR codes should be used whenever you are entering any of the various places where there will be QR codes. And you should make sure that if you don’t happen to have a QR code, if you have an older-style phone, and I know there are a lot of older citizens in New South Wales who don’t have data on their phones, what I would say is to the various hospitality providers, shopkeepers and others, make sure you have alternative methods of knowing who has been in your shop. It may make a difference to all of us to know that one person who came in and left and with this particular Delta variant. So every retail, every hospitality centre, every opportunity where one of our citizens is going to be entering into your premises, make sure you have the QR code visible, make sure you are checking as far as humanly possible to make sure everyone signs in on the QR code, if they haven’t, if they don’t have a data phone, make sure there is written capacity, paper and pen it is that simple. Make sure that you have that ready and available. And again, we are all in this together. It is quite serious, I have to say as New South Wales health minister I am as worried now as I have been any time since January last year, so we need to make sure that we are all looking after each other. Health minister Brad Hazzard is up next: Last Saturday I indicated what we knew about this Delta virus and the transmission at Westfield Bondi Junction could be described as a near and present danger when we were in the vicinity of the virus. I think now what we have seen in just the last week or so is the numbers have gone from our first case to more than 30 cases very quickly and obviously we have just heard that we have had the 13 cases cases since 8pm last night. What I would say to our community is we have gone from that near and present danger to a very real and present danger not just in a shopping centre but right across Sydney. We need all take this seriously. We each have the future of our fellow New South Wales residents and Sydney residents in our hands. NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant gives an update: I’ll take you through a recap of the cases over the last day and describes the issues causing us concern. There were 10 locally acquired cases to 8pm last night. There were three new cases. The vast majority, yesterday were pleasingly in isolation for the full infectious period. However, we have had two cases yesterday that were not certain that was the nine-year-old child that attends the Saint Charles Catholic primary school and we have also had a gentleman in his 30s and he attended the birthday party. In terms of the cases today, we had 13 locally acquired cases recorded after the 8pm cut off last night. Eight of these cases were linked to the birthday party in West Hoxton, identify the previously reported case, the worker at Bondi Junction. I’ll describe the sequence of events, so you understand how quickly transmission is occurring, that party and gathering occurred, there were about 30 people there, in a house and the person was infectious at the time, unknowingly, didn’t have symptoms, was unaware, hadn’t attended venues, in that evening, then waited and get tested, when they developed symptoms next day, and we got the result on the Monday. Immediately, people are asked to isolate and we got the test coming and associated with that. What you see is that those test results indicate how rapidly the virus was transmitted in the circumstances with 10 cases from that party and that is on day two after the exposure so the event happened on Monday and those individuals were tested on Tuesday, and remember, there is a period where they would not have been infectious. On the Sunday all those individuals would have unknowingly had the infection or periods of Monday. Gladys Berejiklian says contact tracing is holding up, but the variant is more contagious than anything they have dealt with previously (as Victoria also stated): On this occasion, our contact tracing has been better than I’ve ever seen what we haven’t seen one before as the contagiousness of this variant. It is extremely contagious and the 30 exchanges not even physical touching means people have transferred it The changes are immediate – compliance will be enforced from 4pm. Gladys Berejiklian continues: If there is a major outdoor event like a sporting event or other organised event, we will recommend only 50% capacity so if there is a stadium where there is a major event on over the weekend or in the next week, we recommend only 50% capacity and that will be in the health orders. We want to ensure there is more widespread mask wearing. We will extend mask wearing to indoor settings like workplaces and we already had them in place for a number of venues we announced yesterday. If you are going to an organised event, an outdoor sporting event or outdoor concert or some type of other event, in addition to 50% capacity, we want you to wear a mask at those events. If you’re going to a sporting event, there is likely to be cheering and shouting and whatever else, given how contagious the virus is, we want you to wear a mask at those events. The exception is if you are eating or drinking and that is applied throughout. Gym classes will be limited to 20 but you have to wear a mask. Some people might choose not to attend those gym classes. We don’t want it to be a bigger impact than we need to, but gym classes are 20 with masks. Public transport is back to the green dots. The green dots are still there. We kept them in place. Wear a mask on public transport and where those green dots. Importantly, if you live or work in the seven LGA places we described earlier in the week – I don’t live in those LGAs work in those seven LGAs, but I work in those LGAs – if you live or work in those seven LGAs you cannot travel outside Sydney unless you are visiting a relative in care or have to go to work. So unless it is essential travel, you should not be going outside metropolitan Sydney for the next week and we apologise in advance for the impact on some people’s ability to travel during the school holidays. Those seven local government areas are City of Sydney, Woollahra, Bayside, Canada Bay, Inner West, Randwick and Waverley. New restrictions are being outlined for NSW hotspots: Gladys Berejiklian: We know it is a difficult time given school holidays and I should also say at the outset that these restrictions announced in today will be in place from 4pm today for an additional week. We had said the mask-wearing restrictions had to be in place for another week until Wednesday met night. This will apply to these restrictions I announce today. No more than five visitors per household including children, at hospitality venues, no vertical consumption. All people must be seated at any setting. We don’t want mingling. [It increases the means] of transferring the virus so these are make sure all consumption at hospitality venues or otherwise or events has to be seated and with good social distancing. No singing or dancing at any venue except weddings which we will allow 20 people on the dance floor at any given time but no dancing or singing whether a place of worship, a nightclub, anywhere else but for weddings. No more than 20 people on the dance floor at a wedding. We will revert to the one per four square metre rule during this time and we know that will have an impact on family gatherings like funerals or weddings but these are measures we have to take charge of now so we don’t have to do anything more severe down the track. But we are putting in place now is in a bid prevent us having to take further action. Here are the numbers. Gladys Berejiklian is giving the update: As of 8pm last night, there were 10 cases of community transmission in New South Wales. [Seven] of those we had already been made aware yesterday. The 10th is an additional person that attended the party where the worker from Bondi Junction also attended. They are the 10 cases to 8pm last night. Unfortunately, since 8pm last night, New South Wales has recorded an additional 13 cases of community transmission. Eight of which were at that same party. Yesterday we mentioned a party that was attended by a worker from Bondi Junction. That party had an additional case to 8pm last night and eight additional cases from 8pm until now. The ninth person out of the 13 was a patient in the waiting room of the case we mentioned yesterday and there are four cases under investigation but all are in close proximity to the south-east Sydney cluster and Dr Chant will provide further detail of those. This is an evolving situation that we would have preferred not occur but what has occurred. Our government will take action today to limit the spread of what is a very contagious variant of Covid. We should hear from the NSW authorities very soon. The NSW Nationals MP Trevor Khan has confirmed that he and three of his parliamentary colleagues are in self-isolation after attending a restaurant at the same time as a Covid-positive case. Along with Ben Franklin, Steph Cooke and Adam Marshall, Khan ate at Christo’s Five Way Pizzeria – a Paddington restaurant popular with the Nationals – on Monday night. The group received a text message from NSW Health at about midnight last night. Khan has been tested and is waiting for the results. He said he could be in isolation until 5 July “subject to what NSW Health tells me”. “I have absolutely no symptoms but I’m in self-isolation because of the message I received from NSW Health,” he said. “The one thing I can say is very clearly the QR codes work. It is pretty impressive how quickly they have contacted us. I’ve been pretty religious in using them so it is good to see the system is working.” In the meantime, Khan is stuck in the unit waiting to receive the results of his Covid test. “I don’t have many books ... usually it’s just the unit I sleep in when I’m in Sydney working,” he said. Michael McGowan will have an update on the NSW Nationals’ possible Covid exposure for you very soon. We will receive the NSW numbers very soon, but there are unconfirmed reports four members of the NSW Nationals party are in self-isolation after potential exposure at a factional dinner earlier in the week. New Zealand officials have released a growing list of locations visited by a Covid-infected Australian on a trip to Wellington. The ministry of health has so far released 14 places of interest that the person visited over the weekend, including a supermarket, museum, and several downtown cafes and eateries. The full list is still being updated, and is available here, along with instructions for testing and self-isolating to those who have visited those locations. Covid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins said he understood the person had had one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. This would mean that while they are not fully vaccinated, they may be less infectious to others than if they had not had any doses. Hipkins said the situation in Wellington was considered “low risk but not no risk”. The Covid-positive person was traveling with their partner, and Hipkins said he did not yet know the vaccination status of that person. A further update from New Zealand officials is expected at 1pm. The government has said it is not ruling out a lockdown for the city, or other restrictions on movement and gathering. Never let it be said that Joel Fitzgibbon will let an opportunity to drag back attention to him and his personal causes go by. Everyone focused on what the government is doing? Must be time for Fitzgibbon to pop his head up! Labor MP Joel Fitzgibbon has bucketed his own party for voting to prevent Arena investing in fossil-fuel related technologies such as carbon capture and storage. Fitzgibbon told 2GB it was “regrettable” that Labor was opposing $1.2bn of investments in a move he called “ideological craziness”. Fitzgibbon also blamed Pauline Hanson for abstaining from the vote. “We should not have won – Pauline not turning up gave us the victory I didn’t want,” he said. Fitzgibbon noted the new investment rules, now junked, would have allowed investment in carbon capture and storage – and argued that if you’re “serious” about getting emissions down, you should support CCS. Oh good. This just turned up on the government notice paper very suddenly: NEW QUARANTINE FACILITY IN VICTORIA—APPROVAL OF WORK Mrs [Nola] Marino (Assistant Minister for Regional Development and Territories), for Mr [Ben] Morton (Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister and Cabinet), pursuant to notice, moved – That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, and by reason of the urgent nature of the works, it is expedient that the following work be carried out without having been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works: New quarantine facility in Victoria. (Thanks to the friends of the blog for all their extra eyes) Over in the Senate and the Nationals seem to be blowing up the Murray-Darling Basin plan. Bridget McKenzie’s office has sent out a statement. Here is part of it: Today the National Party in the Senate will put forward amendments to the Basin Plan. Last year, National Party basin MPs Anne Webster and Damian Drum put forward water amendments in an attempt to address basin communities’ concerns about water availability during the drought. Since then, we have been looking for an opportunity to amend both the Water Act and the Basin Plan Act. The Inspector General legislation provides the rare opportunity to achieve what our basin communities have sort for so long. The National Party are proposing four key amendments to the Water Act (2007) and Basin Plan Act (2012). Remove 450GL up water Remove buybacks Enable new offset projects No further water to be taken when the Basin Plan concludes in 2024 The amendments will see the removal of the controversial 450 gigalitres (GL) that Federal Labor hastily added to the Plan in 2012 to get South Australia to sign up, but the 450GL was never guaranteed. The Nationals believe the next major step required to protect the environment is delivering environmental complementary measure projects rather than destroying rural communities by taking more water. The Nationals are proposing to legislate to rule out water buybacks. Buybacks have devastated farming towns with less water available to grow food, increased water prices and stranded irrigation assets – this cannot be allowed to continue. To date the Basin Plan has recovered over 2100GL for the environment with the Plan having a target of 2750GL. The remainder of the 2750GL is well underway with Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment Mechanism (SDLAM) Projects - there are 36 projects in total. A handful of projects are unlikely to be achieved and flexibility is required. The Nationals are proposing to amend the legislation to allow for new SDLAM projects. We have made these policies but our people want more certainty so we need to legislate. We are still waiting on the official word from NSW Health, but a Narellan Vale childcare centre in Sydney has announced it is closed for cleaning after a positive Covid case: Little Zak’s Academy is taking additional precautionary measures to ensure all rooms and play areas are thoroughly sanitised. The child who has tested positive and her family are in home quarantine and “doing well”. A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry has responded to the claims that China is to blame for the Unesco draft decision to declare the Great Barrier Reef as “in danger”. (Thanks to Daniel Hurst for pointing it out) Q: A UN committee has recommended that Australia’s Great Barrier Reef be added to a list of “in danger” world heritage sites. It’s a move that has angered Australia and the Australian government who believe it was influenced by political interference. A government source told Reuters reporter in Australia that the Canberra believes China is behind the move as China is currently chairing the committee. Do you have any comment on this? Zhao Lijian: Some people in Australia have been spreading China-related rumours and disinformation out of ideological bias. In the same vein, what you just mentioned is totally groundless smear and slander. Let’s all just take a moment to let it sink in that it was One Nation that tanked the Arena changes. (There were also questions over whether or not it was legal and it would have ended up in the courts if allowed to stand, but still.) We’ve reached out to Senator Pauline Hanson to ask why she abstained from the disallowance motion to prevent the Australian Renewable Energy Agency investing in carbon capture and storage and other fossil-fuel related technologies. It was Hanson’s absence for the vote last night that allowed Labor, the Greens, Rex Patrick, Stirling Griff and Jacqui Lambie to pass the disallowance. She split from Malcolm Roberts, who voted with the government. The explanation given to Guardian Australia by crossbench sources and other interested stakeholders is that Hanson didn’t like the fact that gas companies who pay no tax but pay dividends to foreign shareholders stood to benefit from Arena’s expanded investment remit. Viewed not as a pro-renewable energy move but an anti-government subsidies for undeserving companies move, that makes sense. It will be interesting to see if this has a bearing on future votes on the Beetaloo Basin and the gas-fired recovery generally. As I understand it, you can still transfer through Sydney airport under these restrictions, but keep an eye on it. Why is the defence force leading the public health vaccine roll out? No one can really say. Something, something logistics is the best we can get. Mike Bowers was out and about early this morning. Apparently Barnaby Joyce wasn’t in the greatest of moods, at least with the photographers. A function was held last night celebrating his return to the Nationals’ leadership. Perhaps the game was just a bit too early for him this morning. I didn’t ask who won, because I don’t care. Virgin Australia will hand out millions of frequent flier points as an incentive for Australians to get vaccinated for Covid-19. The airline’s initiative comes as the Morrison government is yet to release its public ad campaign to encourage vaccination that health experts have been pleading for. A Virgin spokesperson said “what the latest lockdown in Melbourne and the evolving situation in Sydney has taught us is the sooner we can all get vaccinated, the sooner we can get on with our lives, without the constant fear and uncertainty that come with lockdowns, restrictions and closed borders”. Free business class flights and millions of points for its Velocity frequent flier program will be of offer to any Australian resident – regardless of whether they have previously flown with the airline – who gets vaccinated and registers for the competition. Among the rewards, one vaccinated Australian will receive 1 million frequent flier points – which Virgin says is enough to fly around Australia seven times between each capital city, or to Europe and back multiple times (once borders open). Australians will only be able to apply for the frequent flier points once Australia’s vaccine program has progressed to the point that all adults are eligible for vaccination, a sign that even private business incentives for vaccination are ultimately limited by the speed of the government’s rollout. Annastacia Palaszczuk turns to the Great Barrier Reef and says: The greatest risk at the moment is the National party in Canberra. Why? They are the ones that are proposing a coalmine right on the Great Barrier Reef. And coal is going to be needed across the globe for many years to come, including gas, including renewables, and that is why we have a 50% renewable target by 2030, and my government in the last budget invested $2bn in renewable energy. Building a brand new coal-fired power station adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef by the National party, yes. These plans are already under way. As usual, NSW will give its Covid update at 11am. I think that is the sixth hotel quarantine breach in the last month. Dr Jeannette Young: We’re contacting all of the 30 people on that floor 5 and anyone who left quarantine during the period that I’m concerned about. So they’re all being contacted. And the people on floor 5, their stay has been extended until we’ve been able to confirm that there’s been no additional transmission. I mean, it’s reassuring that it is one room to the room next door, and we’ve seen, unfortunately, that happen across the country in our hotels. We now, of course, have all of our staff fully vaccinated and all of our staff working in these get tested every single day. We’ll retest all of the staff again whether or not they’re at work or on leave, so we’ll go back to all of our staff and see if there’s any positive cases there. But so far, with all of that daily testing, there hasn’t been any. On the hotel quarantine leak, Dr Jeannette Young says: So a few days ago, we did have some cases that were reported as hotel assessed and found in hotel quarantine. But now that we’ve got the genome sequencing back, we know that there’s been transmission from one room to another room. So this is on floor 5 of the Brisbane airport Novotel hotel and we had two people in one room, and one person in the room adjacent. And that person in the room adjacent tested positive first and then, two days later, the couple, or the two people in the adjacent room, tested positive. And at the time we thought it was just overseas acquired. But now that I’ve got the genome sequencing back, it’s clear that the first person has given it to the other two people. Why the sudden change to lock out those Sydney areas? Dr Jeannette Young: The 21 cases that we’ve seen and just the large number of exposure venues. There’s well over 120 exposure venues and, unfortunately, with the Delta variant, we’re seeing very fleeting contact leading to transmission. If you remember at the start of this pandemic, I spoke about 15 minutes of close contact being a concern. Now, it looks like it’s five to 10 seconds that’s a concern. So it’s just the risk is so much higher now than it was only a year ago. Queensland chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, gives her update: We have one new case in hotel quarantine who recently returned from Zambia and we already have the genome sequence on that case and it is the Delta variant. And that’s the major variant we’re now seeing in people returning from all parts of the world. So we’re not seeing that Delta variant only coming from India now. It’s widespread and that is to be expected when you get a variant that is more transmissible, it then becomes the dominant variant. And we’ve now seen, of course, this rapid spread in Sydney of the Delta variant and it’s now at 21 cases, so we’ve had to make that decision here. So I’ve advised the premier and she has followed through that we will be requiring anyone who has been in those seven LGAs in Sydney from 1am tomorrow and I’m not backdating it, but anyone who arrives after 1am tomorrow who has been in those areas will need to go into hotel quarantine for 14 days. And we’ll keep a close eye on whether there’s further spread to more LGAs in Sydney. So it is very important that people in Queensland reconsider their need to travel anywhere in Greater Sydney or Wollongong. There is some good news, though, for the Sydney couple who are vaccinated and want to come to Queensland to see the man’s dying father before it is too late. Annastacia Palaszczuk says an agreement with NSW Health is possible: I’m pleased to have an update. Dr Young and I had a lengthy discussion this morning and what we would like to see from the New South Wales government, and this is a matter for the NSW government, if they want to break the 14-day mandatory quarantine for this couple, and if can provide Dr Young with how they will safely be transferred from Sydney to the Gold Coast, we, of course, will do everything we can to facilitate the reunion with his father at the earliest convenience. I am so, so sorry Sydney. Queensland is following Victoria and closing its borders to much of greater Sydney. Annastacia Palaszczuk: So we already closed to the Waverley council area, but from 1am tomorrow, in line with the restrictions announced by Victoria, Queensland will close to the following local government areas. They are: the City of Sydney, Woollahra, Bayside, Canada Bay, Inner West and Randwick. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk confirms Queensland has had a hotel quarantine leak: Now, the other thing we’ve detected overnight as well is that we had some spread of the Delta variant in a hotel. It’s the Novotel hotel so we’re making sure that we look at that floor closely and, once again, we just think that it is a case of people opening the doors. Victoria completes a week with either zero or one case: The AFP canine team is headed to Parliament House this morning for a bit of soft PR. They might be cute, but they’re still narcs. Is Labor divided on climate policy? Jim Chalmers: We agree 100% that this country needs to get to net-zero emissions by mid-century. We’ve said that for some time now. As have all the states and territories, the peak business groups, a lot of the countries with which we compare ourselves. We don’t want to see action on climate change and the jobs which will flow from cheaper and cleaner energy held hostage to more political games between the Nationals and the Liberals. We are still waiting on the NSW numbers to be released – that should be very soon. In the meantime, in case you missed it, here are the new venues of concern Over on the Nine Network, David Littleproud was pretending everything was fine: Q: Did you manage to wash the blood off your hands before parliament yesterday? Littleproud: Look, it was a traumatic day but democracy has made its call. Now we have to just get on with the job and win the next election under Barnaby. Q: Who’d you vote for? Littleproud: Look, I’ve been consistent. I don’t get into these games or finger-pointing exercises after the event. My comments – my public comments – have been very consistent and my actions align with that. Q: OK. How’d you manage to hold on to that job then? Littleproud: Well, anyone can contest me. Host: [Laughs] Littleproud: But obviously they didn’t feel they had the numbers. Host: [Laughs] Littleproud: The only, the first rule of politics is if you’ve got the numbers, you use them. So, I was happy to be contested. If that was what the party room decided, then that can happen at any point. Josh Burns was sent out with Labor’s lines this morning. Asked how he thought the Coalition was going, he said: I think they are a mess to be honest. I can’t remember a government being as shambolic as they are. They spent, in the middle of a national crisis, in the middle of New South Wales dealing with this really infectious strain of virus, the only thing that this government’s done is stabbed the deputy prime minister in the back. It’s shambolic, Australians deserve better, and instead of dealing with the issues that face Australians this government is leaving us increasingly isolated, and they want to drag us back to the 1950s. It shouldn’t come as any surprise – to anyone. This has been on the cards (officially) since 2012. There have been multiple warnings. Promises have been broken, commitments have not been kept. The Great Barrier Reef is not getting better. And in that same decade, Australia has not done anything on climate. There has been no concrete policy for a decade. Despite the spin, not a lot is going to happen on emissions unless there is actual action. I was a journalist in Queensland for years, and covered when the Queensland government and Coalition federal government co-operated to travel to France and stop the reef from being listed as ‘in danger’ during the Paris climate talks in 2016. In the years since, NOTHING has changed. There is no way anyone could have been ‘blindsided’ by this. Unless, of course, you have been wilfully blind. But then that is something else entirely, isn’t it. Graham Readfearn has spoken to Dr Fanny Douvere, of Unesco’s World Heritage Centre in Paris, about the draft decision to list the reef as “in danger”. The “in danger” recommendation was made on science-based reports from Australia, including from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and official government reports on water quality, the senior Unesco official said. “This decision is not a surprise to anyone. We have been working constructively [with Australia] for a decade. There has been bleaching in 2016, 2017 and 2020. “All the information points in the same direction, that the reef is deteriorating and the outlook has gone from poor to very poor.” Our New Zealand correspondent, Tess McClure, has an update on the NZ Covid situation. New Zealand is racing to track the in-country movements of a tourist with Covid-19 who tested positive on their return to Australia, with the possibility of a lockdown of the capital, Wellington, not ruled out. The traveller spent a weekend visiting Wellington from Sydney, and visited a number of sites around the city, including popular tourism spot Te Papa, the national museum. At this stage, it is assumed they caught coronavirus in Sydney before travelling. Four close contacts have already been identified and are isolating, the ministry of health said. New Zealand officials have released an initial list of six locations of interest in Wellington, and those who have visited them at the listed times are being told to get tested and self-isolate. So far they include a pub, a pharmacy, a hotel, and the museum, all in the inner city. David Littleproud also told ABC radio RN: We shouldn’t close our minds to the technologies that can reduce emissions, that can keep coalmines going here in Australia and around the world, and continue to invest in that technology. This is one of the biggest furphies the government is pushing – because no one is saying that we should ignore the technology – it’s that, in many cases, the technology doesn’t exist. And it is the market which is making the decision on coalmines. It’s pulling out. All over the world. Banks and investment firms aren’t turning away from coal from the goodness of their hearts or because they have developed a social conscience – it’s because it doesn’t make financial sense. David Littleproud: If there is to be any move towards it then farmers should be part of the solution and they shouldn’t be penalised like they have been in the past where they have footed the bill for the country’s social conscience and we just simply say that it’s time to square the ledger. This ignores that the agriculture industry is already doing things. A lot of work actually. And has supported net zero for some time. The problem for the Nationals is that the leadership change was essentially on net zero 2050 – there are enough Nats in the party room who don’t want it, didn’t think Michael McCormack was pushing back enough, and Barnaby Joyce seized his chance. But that only matters before the election (all of this is about the election). After the election, it won’t be as much of an issue (that’s my prediction anyway). The issue for the government (and the country), though, is the Glasgow climate conference is in November. Which, on current indications, is before the election. And where the world is expecting Australia to do something. And if we don’t, well, that could mean other issues like tariffs. So this has some way to play out, but the lines are being very strongly drawn. Nationals deputy leader David Littleproud is on ABC radio RN trying to explain how things are being done on climate change, while also explaining why agriculture needs to be excluded (which is not a new position). But that is still not enough to get the Nats across the line. So we are at a stalemate. Happy Wednesday, everyone. We’ve made it halfway through the last sitting week before the winter break. It’ll be another Barnaby day in the parliament as Labor continues to sideline the prime minister from question time and everything else the opposition can manage. Late last night, Labor and the Greens took advantage of a no-show by Pauline Hanson to disallow changes to the Arena renewable energy fund that would have opened it up to funding fossil fuel projects (like gas). It’s a blow to the government’s “energy plan’ and won’t help ongoing tensions between the Nationals and the Liberals over climate and energy, including net zero by 2050. The whole reason Joyce is back is because the Nats didn’t believe Michael McCormack was bolshie enough on the topic, so Joyce has come out all guns blazing. Asked about jobs in question time yesterday, the deputy prime minister mainly spoke about coalmining jobs. That’s a very, very small percentage of the Australian workforce, but they’ve become among the most important jobs in the country. Just for political reasons. Meanwhile, the pandemic continues, with Victoria declaring large parts of NSW “red zones” and effectively shutting the border, while New Zealand has temporarily shut down the travel bubble after a person with Covid flew from Sydney to Wellington. There is no “normal” with this. Lives are being disrupted and the inability to plan, or the constant dread that comes with those still making plans, is leaving a lot of people on edge. Australia’s vaccination schedule can’t increase until it gets more mRNA vaccines and that’s not happening until at least the spring. The head of the roll-out has admitted that concerns over supply is the reason there is no vaccination campaign.

Sadly, the UK has been rowing in the opposite direction by rigging the market in favour of shale gas. We can only hope that George Osborne’s irrational hostility towards renewables will now be abandoned by the new “green team” of Greg Clark, Jo Johnson and Nick Hurd at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). As a matter of urgency, they need to scrap HS2 and use the money on a European supergrid in order to iron out fluctuations from different sources of renewable energy. We need not only a new green deal, but huge investment in local microgeneration projects. And, if the government insists on going down the nuclear route, it should develop small modular reactors and locate them on ships not land, as shipping contributes 4.5% of carbon emissions world-wide and this is set to increase 30% by 2020. Robin Russell-Jones Chair, Help Rescue the Planet • Greg Clark’s decision to review the Hinkley project looks sensible, since it has become abundantly clear there are many alternatives to produce reliable low-carbon electricity cheaper and earlier. Until its demise, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) ignored reports showing that solar, wind, storage and backup gas can produce the same output as Hinkley Point a decade earlier and at least 25% cheaper, saving consumers £720m a year for 35 years. Decc repeated its (factually wrong) mantra that only nuclear can provide reliable low-carbon electricity power. Waxing lyrical about jobs created falls flat when you realise that only 900 new permanent jobs will be created, each at a cost to consumers of £800,000 per year. We must hope that BEIS looks at the facts and does not commit to overspending hundreds of millions a year for 35 years while risking that the lights go out if Hinkley Point does not produce electricity before the last coal plant will have shut by 2025. If BEIS continues Decc’s track record of fact-free decision making, this surely invites a judicial review. Niels Kroninger Managing director, Green Hedge Energy UK Limited • EDF said before the referendum that a Brexit vote would not affect its plans to build Hinkley C. The value of the pound has fallen since then and as they are contracted to build the station for a fixed price in pounds, then obviously the pensions of the French workers and profit for EDF owners will be diminished with that lower value. Why are they still keen on the deal? Was it 12% overpriced before that devaluation? The plant is now predicted to cost £24bn and will power 6m homes, providing electricity for 30 years at an extortionate fixed price. For the same price we could put solar hot water and PV with battery storage on the same 6m homes and thus taking a quarter of British homes out of fuel poverty for ever. We already have over a million solar roofs in Britain on the homes of people who want to decouple their futures from the greed of energy utilities. Tens of millions have been invested in UK solar energy research and already £2.5bn has been invested in moving some dirt and laying some concrete at Hinkley Point. Who paid for that? Not the French or Chinese. This nuclear gamble is madness and the fundamental question that needs answering is why? Professor Sue Roaf Edinburgh • Thirty or so years ago I led an internal study for a leading consultancy firm on the viability of a Severn barrage generating tidal electricity. We were able to show that, at the time, it could supply 10% of the country’s electrical needs. With improvements in generating equipment and a site further downstream, it must be possible to generate at least as much as the proposed Hinkley Point nuclear power station. It would be quicker to build, use proven technology, be safer now and in the future, would generate no radioactive waste and very likely be much cheaper. How does the nuclear lobby do it? Michael McLoughlin Wallington, Surrey • If Rolls-Royce can build the pressurised water reactors for our nuclear submarines, why can’t they be engaged to build civil reactors for the UK? It is beyond the pale that the country that built the world’s first nuclear power station at Calder Hall, Cumbria, in 1956 now lacks the skills, investment and self-belief to build anything. I’ve always thought that if we had factories full of people making the goods that people and countries wanted, then we wouldn’t have the divided, angry nation we have now. Alan Quinn Manchester • Hinkley Point C is intended to satisfy 7% of our electrical needs. Is it not possible instead to reduce those needs by the same amount? For example, I am constantly seeing the lights on in shops, offices and other public places unnecessarily.

Two industry sources close to the process said Toshiba had privately decided to quit the consortium behind the planned Moorside plant, echoing sources who told Reuters and the Wall Street Journal that the Japanese company was withdrawing from new nuclear projects in the UK. Toshiba said last month it was reviewing all its nuclear business abroad after suffering a multibillion-dollar writedown on its US business. It has promised to provide more details about its intentions when it publishes results on 14 February. The French energy firm Engie, which is Toshiba’s partner in the NuGen consortium, has long been seen as wanting to get out of the project. Its chief executive said last year the future did not lie in nuclear power. The company said that, along with Toshiba, it was seeking new investors to finance the Moorside plant, which are reported to include Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco). Senior figures in the industry urged the government to start discussions with the South Koreans immediately to safeguard the power station if Toshiba left NuGen. “Any potential investor in that project is going to need to have very direct reassurance from the government; even if they are just starting an exploratory period, they are welcomed,” said Tim Yeo, the chairman of the pro-nuclear group New Nuclear Watch Europe. The former Conservative MP said ministers should even consider taking a direct stake in the Moorside plant. Such an interventionist approach would have been anathema in recent years but appears more credible after recent leaks revealed the government was considering taking a stake in another new nuclear plant, at Wylfa in Wales. Unions also called for the government to step in with funding to save the plant if Toshiba pulled out. “It looks increasingly like bad business investments may have busted Toshiba’s role in a new nuclear facility at Moorside in Cumbria,” said Justin Bowden, the GMB’s national secretary for energy. Moorside, near Sellafield, is a key part of the government’s hopes for a new fleet of power stations to fill the UK’s energy gap in the next decade as coal plants and ageing atomic plants close. The only one to be approved so far is EDF’s £18bn Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset, which was made financially possible through subsidies to be levied on household bills. The government hopes new plants will be built at Wylffa, Sizewell, Bradwell and Oldbury. Of Moorside’s three mooted reactors, Paul Dorfman, from the Energy Institute at University College London said: “These are really big pieces of kit. If and when plans for Moorside fail, this leaves an existential gap in UK energy policy.” Toshiba’s chief executive, Satoshi Tsunakawa, signalled last week that new nuclear projects would be reviewed in response to the anticipated multibillion-dollar writedown related to the purchase of a nuclear construction and services business by its US subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric. No official decision has been made on NuGen. “At this moment, we can only say that we are reviewing the future of our nuclear power business outside Japan, but nothing has been decided at this time,” the company told the Guardian. A spokesman for Engie said the company “continues to evaluate the site and design of the NuGen Moorside facility”. Theresa May told parliament earlier this week that the government was committed to new nuclear plants. A spokesman for the government said it was “working closely with a number of developers”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/may/27/hinkley-point-c-french-union-opposition-casts-fresh-doubt-on-project","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-27T08:09:09Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C: French union opposition casts fresh doubt on project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/27/hinkley-point-c-french-union-opposition-casts-fresh-doubt-on-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/may/27/hinkley-point-c-french-union-opposition-casts-fresh-doubt-on-project","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C: French union opposition casts fresh doubt on project","bodyText":"Opposition from French unions has cast fresh doubt over the future of the planned Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset. Key French workers’ unions continue to oppose the £18bn project despite repeated attempts by EDF, which would build the reactors, to win their backing. The French state-owned company has delayed the decision on whether to go ahead until the summer while it consults the unions. Union representatives hold six of the 18 seats on its board. Hinkley Point C is a key plank of the UK’s energy policy and would provide 7% of Britain’s electricity. It was meant to open next year, but has been delayed to 2025. EDF is seeking support from a committee of workplace representatives after a package of measures from the French government to shore up the company’s financial future had been put in place. But the committee raised serious concerns over cost and demanded more information. Jean-Luc Magnaval, secretary of the central works committee, told BBC Newsnight that staff feared the high cost of Hinkley Point could cripple EDF, which is heavily indebted and recently had its credit rating cut by Moody’s. Other nuclear plants being built by EDF in France and Finland are years behind schedule and billions over budget. Magnaval said: “We have reservations about several aspects of the project: organisation, supply chain, installation and procurement. The trade unions are unlikely to give their blessing to the project in its current state. “We are not reassured by the documents we have received. We have been given a marketing folder, not the full information we require. We got the documents on 9 May – we are sending EDF a request for more explanations.” Earlier this week, the French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, wrote to MPs on Westminster’s energy and climate change committee (pdf) to reassure them of the French government’s commitment to the project. He added, however: “It is also necessary, in the interests of all, that EDF follows due process before committing itself to an investment of this magnitude. The consultation of the central works committee brings legal robustness on the decision.” EDF’s chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz, told MPs that he did not know when a final decision on Hinkley Point would be made. Once the unions had been consulted, the board would decide on Hinkley, he said, but stressed the opinion of the trade unions would be “advisory”. The Hinkley project has been criticised for “colossal” costs by the French energy minister, who suggested it should be delayed by several years, and EDF’s finance director resigned over the issue, but president François Hollande has fully backed the project."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/feb/28/after-the-sunrush-what-comes-next-for-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-02-28T06:00:11Z","webTitle":"After the 'sunrush': what comes next for solar power?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/28/after-the-sunrush-what-comes-next-for-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/feb/28/after-the-sunrush-what-comes-next-for-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"After the 'sunrush': what comes next for solar power?","bodyText":"Some people call it the “sunrush”: a 25-year period in which solar power has grown exponentially, transforming the technology from rarefied oddity to the world’s fastest-growing energy source. This surge, which saw 100MW of capacity in 1992 rocket to more than 300GW in 2016, has been largely driven by falling costs, which plunged 86% between 2009 and 2017. China, the world leader in building and installing solar panels, added a record-breaking amount of capacity last year. The technology is even setting records in the grey UK: at one point last summer even providing more power than the nation’s nuclear power stations. But with some experts asking whether the cost reduction curve of solar is drawing to an end, there are questions over whether stratospheric growth can be maintained. And while more energy from the sun hits the Earth’s surface in an hour than humanity uses each year, can today’s silicon-based solar meet our long-term power needs? To meet these challenges, researchers around the world are racing to explore new materials which can eke out more energy from the sun’s photons and be used more flexibly than today’s panels. The most abundant mineral on Earth has become the frontrunner, promising more efficient and lighter solar panels, which could even be made semi-transparent for use as windows. “Perovskite currently has taken the lead among emerging photovoltaic (PV) technologies,” says Varun Sivaram, fellow for science and technology at the Council on Foreign Relations. His upcoming book on solar says the crystal has made a meteoric ascent in academic circles, describing it as: “a material that could enable manufacture of cheap, highly efficient solar coatings that could be unspooled from a printer much as newspaper is printed.” One firm born in Oxford, England, is at the vanguard of the race to develop and scale up perovskite for commercial use. Founded in 2010, Oxford PV initially spent years exploring an alternative, dye-sensitive cells. But Henry Snaith, the firm’s co-founder, changed tack in 2012. “I discovered perovskite could be extremely efficient in PV cells. We realised this was where the real opportunity lay.” The British- and German-based company’s big idea is to piggyback on the success of silicon, which Chinese manufacturing scale and efficiency has made so cheap. Perovskite captures energy from a different part of sunlight’s wavelength than silicon, so Oxford PV’s plan is to layer it atop silicon, to maximise electricity generation. “We find ourselves in a position that we are not fighting a $35bn industry [silicon], we are enhancing it. The idea is use the existing assets. If you do something completely different it will fail. This can complement the existing cell,” said Frank Averdung, the company’s CEO. Working with a major but unnamed solar panel manufacturer, the firm hopes to have a product ready for market by 2019. While the price of silicon-based solar panels has fallen from more than $350 per megawatt hour for a largescale farm in 2009 to more than $50 in 2017, some in the sector think such dramatic reductions have come to an end. Artur Kupczunas, co-founder of Poland-based perovskite firm Saule Technologies, said the cost cuts had bottomed out: “We saw a very rapid fall of the prices. [But] there are technology obstacles [for it] to go down as rapidly as it did since 2013.” Saule, which is in talks with Japan’s space agency, is developing inkjet printing for its perovksite-based solar modules. Today it can only print them at A4 size, but the company’s 25-strong team hopes to expand that to one square metre by the year’s end. Kupczunas is most excited about the prospect of incorporating the solar panels in fabric of new buildings, both in the walls and - because it can be made semi-transparent - as windows. “You can use it in the whole building,” he said, noting silicon was too heavy for such applications. Perovskite is what as known as a third generation solar cell. Silicon is first generation, while a group of other rivals including thin film are the second. Compared to silicon, which needs to heated at more than 1,000C during manufacture for solar cells, perovskite does not need to be processed at high temperatures. That means it is less energy-intensive and is less costly to make. A typical silicon-based solar cell converts around 21-22% of sunlight into energy, and the material’s limit is 29%. Oxford PV thinks that its approach of perovskite-on-silicon can get that efficiency up to around 25%. “What it means is out of same cell, you get 20% more power. That is significant,” said Averdung. Paul Coxon, a physicist in materials science at Cambridge University, thinks that combining silicon and perovskite could be a good way to commercialise the new technology and overcome the limits of the older one. “No matter how cheap they [silicon-based cells] become that limit [of 29% efficiency] will still apply. As humanity’s need for electricity grows, continuing with this single technology this limit might pose a tricky hurdle to overcome,” he said. Coxon said the potential for perovskite is huge, and research is growing fast, as evidenced by nearly 4,000 scientific papers being published on it last year alone. However, he expects silicon will continue to dominate in large, utility-scale solar farms, with the new technology used in smaller, constrained spaces. “I think we may see perovskite cells used in solar tiles in domestic and smaller scales and maybe even in space-based PV arrays,” he said. Some might question the need for more efficient solar cells, when China has made silicon-based ones so cheap. But experts believe there are still good reasons to ramp up efficiency through materials like perovskite. Michael McGehee, professor of materials science at Stanford University, said: “As the cost of solar panels has come down over the last 10 years, the situation has arisen where a little more than half of the cost of putting in a collection of panels is the installation itself. “For that reason, it is highly desirable to improve the efficiency of the panels so that the number of panels that needs to be installed is reduced. Indirectly that lowers the installation costs. That is why continuing to improve the efficiency is still very important.” Of course, there is no guarantee perovskite will succeed as solar’s new wonder material. Academics and companies repeatedly emphasised to the Guardian that development is at very early stages, and Oxford PV and Saule both have technical and production challenges to overcome. Other third generation materials are competing too. “Although perovskite is the lab leader, it does have potential drawbacks, and it isn’t the only promising solar material out there. Other approaches - including organic and quantum dot solar cells - come with their own unique advantages,” said Sivaram. But the biggest obstacles are likely to be financial ones, such as skittish investors who were burned by previous boom-and-bust cycles in clean technology. Sivaram said: “As long as investors and the solar industry continue to ignore academia, perovskite and other new solar technologies could well remain lab-bench novelties.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Staff at Nippybus said they were out of pocket and desperately searching for new jobs to pay their bills, while hundreds of passengers, from children to pensioners, were left trying to find a way to get to school, work and the shops and to keep medical appointments. Campaigners said the Nippybus situation highlighted problems faced by under-pressure bus services, especially in very rural areas, across the UK. In an internal memo to staff, Sydney Hardy, 57, explained in no uncertain terms he was “getting off” after 13 years in charge of Nippybus, which is based in the village of Martock, near Yeovil. He wrote: “There is a difference between giving up and knowing when you have had enough. I have had enough and realise I cannot work with you, the people I employ, a moment longer. “There comes a time in any relationship when you just have to say ‘Fuck it’, say goodbye and move on. This is my time! I am quitting to pursue my dream of not having to work here.” Hardy added: “The gates are now closed and will not open so you can stay in your scratchers and have a lie in.” The gates were indeed closed on Wednesday and Hardy was not available for further comment. A security guard was posted at the fence and fetched possessions for employees who arrived from time to time. Some were also handed payslips – though they said no money had gone into their banks. Driver Terry Lehmann said he was “gobsmacked” when he went on the company’s site to check the rota and came across Hardy’s note. “How can a human being do that to his colleagues? It’s disgusting,” he said. Another driver, Steve Atkins, said staff were “in total shock”, adding: “Everybody’s got mortgages and bills to pay. I’ve had to ring up and cancel all my direct debits. There’s no way I can cover them.” Dave English, who was a driver at Nippybus for almost nine years, claimed the company was struggling because it had been losing drivers. “Everyone was doing long shifts, but he [Hardy] just expected us to do them. The memo makes out that it’s the drivers’ fault this has happened, but without us he would never have had his company.” The county council has been working hard to find replacement buses for the routes, including school runs, that were covered by Nippybus. Martock councillor Neil Bloomfield said many people in the area relied heavily on the buses to get to work and to the shops. “We have a high proportion of people who don’t have cars. They are very isolated without buses.” Bloomfield said there was a shortage of drivers in Somerset partly because many were working on the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant project. “It is a worry for people here,” he said. Lianna Etkind, public transport campaigner at the Campaign for Better Transport, said: “Buses are the lifeblood of local communities and economies, and play a major part in reducing road congestion and air pollution as well. Unfortunately, we are hearing more and more of small bus companies ceasing operations without any warning, leaving staff without jobs and passengers without a means to get to work or school.” People from Martock shared their tales of misery caused by the demise of Nippybus. Marie Bennett, who works at Claire’s cafe next to the bus yard, said her 16-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn, was forced to go to college on the back of a motorbike. “I wasn’t so happy with that,” she said. Her boss, Claire Lambert, said the loss of the company would have a knock-on effect on other businesses in the village. A temporary bus service has been running between Yeovil and the village. Jon Tucker, who has relied on the buses since losing a leg in a road accident, said he and his family would struggle without a regular, reliable service. “I go to the gym in Yeovil three times a week to help improve my mobility and take the children into town to the cinema and bowling at the weekend. We need a good service.” Retired power company worker Barry Fry said many elderly people would be lost without buses. “There are lots of vulnerable people who rely on that bus. “We don’t know what is going on at the moment, which is very concerning. It’s disgraceful that the company has acted like this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2017/mar/20/un-asks-uk-suspend-work--hinkley-point-c","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-20T10:00:22Z","webTitle":"UN asks UK to suspend work on Hinkley Point","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/20/un-asks-uk-suspend-work--hinkley-point-c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2017/mar/20/un-asks-uk-suspend-work--hinkley-point-c","fields":{"headline":"UN asks UK to suspend work on Hinkley Point","bodyText":"A United Nations committee has asked the UK to suspend work on the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset because of the government’s failure to consult with European countries over the project. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) said last year that the UK had failed to meet its obligations to discuss the possible impact of an incident at Hinkley on neighbouring countries. The UNECE has now gone a step further and said the UK should consider refraining from further works on the site of the new reactors. The body said the government should wait until it has heard back from countries including Germany, Norway and the Netherlands on whether it would be helpful for them to be formally notified under a treaty on transboundary environmental impacts. The UN request is an embarrassment for the government, which has faced several delays over the UK’s first atomic power station for a generation. But it is unlikely to derail the earthworks and building of a jetty at Hinkley, which is Europe’s biggest construction site. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “Opposition to Hinkley started with knowledgeable energy specialists and environmentalists. It grew to involve a wide array of businesses and media commentators. Now it includes neighbouring countries and a UN body. This letter from a UN body shows the UK still has a mindset of doing what we like without listening to the widespread concerns.” A spokesman for EDF, the French state-owned company building Hinkley, said: “We have carried out all the environmental impact assessments (EIA) required for Hinkley Point C, including assessing any likely significant transboundary impacts. In considering the EIA the UK Planning Inspectorate concluded there was no likelihood of significant transboundary effects. “The UK supreme court has already rejected a challenge from An Taisce which claimed that the government should have consulted other member states before making its decision on the development.” A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “The Environment Agency and Office for Nuclear Regulation have independently assessed the station design of Hinkley Point C for safety, security and environmental impact before granting approval. The project will continue to be subject to robust regulation from these bodies and it will have no significant adverse effect on the environment of any other country.” Hinkley is just one of a fleet of new nuclear power stations that the government hopes will be built over the next 15 years, to keep the lights on and cut carbon emissions. But a cloud has been cast over one of the biggest projects, at Moorside in Cumbria, because one of its key backers, Toshiba, has suffered financial problems and promised to review future overseas nuclear projects as a result. Although the UN reprimanded the government for its failures to follow protocol on Hinkley, it welcomed commitments it had received from the UK to notify nearby countries for other future new build nuclear plants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/oct/09/greens-still-have-potential-to-change-politics-says-co-leader","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-09T15:14:30Z","webTitle":"Greens still have potential to change politics, says co-leader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/09/greens-still-have-potential-to-change-politics-says-co-leader","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/oct/09/greens-still-have-potential-to-change-politics-says-co-leader","fields":{"headline":"Greens still have potential to change politics, says co-leader","bodyText":"The Greens are hurting after losing half their votes at the general election but have the potential to become the most influential party in 21st-century politics, Jonathan Bartley, the party’s co-leader, has claimed. Bartley, who shares his job with MP Caroline Lucas, said the Greens had suffered from a return of two-party politics after the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, successfully wooed many of its voters and its candidates stood aside in 22 areas to help other parties beat the Conservatives. Defending the party’s strategy, Bartley said the decision for candidates to stand aside had been “brave” and argued that “if the other parties had been willing to work with us, Theresa May wouldn’t be sitting in No 10 today”. Speaking at the Green party’s annual conference in Harrogate, Yorkshire, he said: “It hurt. And I know many of us still feel that hurt. I do. But conference let’s not forget what we achieved together. Our ideas and policies are now common currency. Part of the mainstream. We achieved the party’s second best general election result. And we helped deny Theresa May her majority and her mandate.” The party gained 1.6% of the vote in the June poll, compared with 3.8% in 2015, and made no inroads in target seats such as Bristol West and Norwich South, where the incumbent Labour MPs increased their majorities. But Bartley gave his party credit for the policies adopted by Corbyn’s Labour party, which appeared to be popular with the electorate. “Where we lead, others follow. Our London assembly members forced a living wage. Our MEPs stood up for refugees when others stood back. And in parliament, we have consistently kept climate change on the agenda,” he said. “And you know what? I believe we will be the most influential party in 21st-century politics.” He went on to attack the Conservatives as a party “led by a zombie prime minister” and “rotten to its core”. But he saved his biggest attack for the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, whom he described as a “poison” at the core of the Conservative movement. “In many ways he is a joke. But then you listen to what he’s actually saying. Let’s not pretend that Boris Johnson’s comments about dead bodies in Libya was an aberration. It wasn’t,” Bartley said. “This is the man who calls Barack Obama ‘part Kenyan’ with ‘ancestral dislike’ of the UK. Who describes people from the Congo as having ‘watermelon smiles’. Calls Commonwealth citizens ‘flag-waving piccaninnies’.” Referring to when Johnson was editor of the Spectator and the magazine suggested Liverpudlians were wallowing in their “victim status” after the Hillsborough tragedy, he said: “This is not new bigotry. It’s old. It’s unacceptable. And it’s time the Conservative party took collective responsibility for this human wrecking ball and kicked him out of the cabinet.” The party’s four-day conference has not approved many major new policies, but Bartley highlighted a vote by delegates in favour of a new bank holiday for Windrush Day on 22 June to mark the contribution of migrants to the UK. Other sessions at the conference are focused on the decision to step aside for Labour and Lib Dem candidates, which hit Green votes. Speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Bartley defended the move, saying it was “a very bold thing to do”. He said: “We’ve seen a profound change in British politics as a result of what happened. “Many commentators suggest that if we hadn’t stood aside, if local parties hadn’t made those decisions, we wouldn’t have the hung parliament now, we wouldn’t have seen the change of agenda that we’re seeing from the government. A profound impact – I think it was worth it.” But he said there was “a whole lot of difference between us and Labour” on policy, citing the Greens’ opposition to new nuclear power stations, Trident, and support for free movement of people, a shorter working week and a universal basic income. “There is a huge agenda which Labour are not taking on board,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/may/10/challenge-conservatives-energy-priorities-cuts-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-10T05:30:11Z","webTitle":"Challenge Conservatives on energy priorities and cuts to renewables","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/10/challenge-conservatives-energy-priorities-cuts-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/may/10/challenge-conservatives-energy-priorities-cuts-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Challenge Conservatives on energy priorities and cuts to renewables","bodyText":"Renewable power expanded exponentially under the Tory-Lib Dem coalition elected in 2010 and by 2015 the renewable industries had a turnover of £14.9bn and had reduced wholesale electricity prices. If this expansion had continued under the next government, an all-renewable UK electricity supply was achievable by 2025. Though the 2015 Tory manifesto claimed onshore wind farms “often fail to win public support”, the government’s own surveys demonstrate widespread approval. Support remains high even for a large-scale local wind farm. Onshore wind has far higher public approval than the Conservative party’s top priorities for energy: nuclear and fracking. These have higher carbon footprints and enjoy higher subsidies than renewables. Their low popularity would doubtless fall further if the surveys asked about local reactors or fracking. The Tory manifesto mentioned cuts only to onshore wind, but all renewables have suffered since May 2015. At least six incentives to highly popular solar photovoltaic (PV) power have been cut. According to the Solar Trade Association, 32% of jobs were lost by last summer. In November 2015, government scenarios for future electricity generation all showed renewable power, which had expanded 10 times in the nine years to 2015, hardly expanding at all over the next two decades. Most of the small renewable expansion permitted in the 2020s is expected to be offshore wind. Apparently the government intends there to be no new PV or onshore wind after 2020. Why cull such popular and successful industries? The UK has more than 32 gigawatts of renewable power, 10 times the power the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant may achieve in 2030. Hinkley’s power is not only almost irrelevant; its inflexible nature will make it redundant. Once operating, a nuclear reactor should run with constant output, 24/7, month to month, but power that complements wind and PV has to vary in less than one hour. China, where wind and PV are booming, already has too many nuclear reactors. Its government wants nuclear output varied day to night – an inherently unsafe procedure. The operators at Chernobyl were trying to vary output when the reactor exploded. Renewable expansion has reduced the wholesale price of UK electricity. The rate of fall is consistent with the lower prices in Germany, which has more renewable power. All the government scenarios assume the wholesale electricity price will increase in the 2020s. This is because they hope the electricity price will rise close to the ridiculously high value guaranteed for nuclear power. If it falls, the nuclear levy on household electricity bills will rise dramatically. Despite the cuts, it is possible the renewables will expand faster than the government hopes and the wholesale electricity price could continue to fall. A calculation that assumes the renewables merely expand with their worst year’s performance in the past decade, suggests that, when the first new nuclear reactor starts in 2025, the UK could have about as much renewable power as Germany has now. This calculation predicts UK bill-payers could be funding 7p of the 9.25p per kilowatt-hour guaranteed nuclear price. By 2030, when the government hopes for large amounts of nuclear power, their scenarios show all natural gas electricity generators providing power only a quarter of the year. This will make natural gas electricity even more expensive. One low-carbon renewable technology already provides flexible power to the electricity grid: the anaerobic digestion (AD) of farm and food waste to bio-methane. AD provides extremely low-carbon electricity because it avoids greenhouse gas emission from waste rotting on farms or in landfill. AD will be able to provide flexible electric power more cheaply than natural gas because at times when the electricity is not needed, the bio-methane production can be sold to the gas grid. If access for AD to both electricity and gas grids is improved, and incentives introduced to encourage farmers and the food industry to recycle waste, bio-methane is likely to be cheaper than fracked gas, the cost of which is still unknown. The party that restores renewable subsidies (paid from taxation rather than levies), cancels Hinkley Point C and fracking subsidies while incentivising bio-methane will get my vote and, the graphic above suggests, such policies could win them a lot more votes.

Labour does because it offers hope, 3 June) was well argued. However, one word was conspicuous by its absence: Trident. That may be understandable if you want to avoid pointing to divisions within Labour. But it should not be avoided. Trident’s cheerleaders should be confronted, head-on, with confidence. The planned new Trident nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile system is estimated to cost more than £200bn over 30 years, a figure not contested by the Ministry of Defence, which declines to estimate its total cost. Jeremy Corbyn is bombarded with attacks on the BBC’s Question Time on the grounds that he refuses to say whether he would ever order the firing of a British nuclear weapon. No rational person would. Trident is not a credible deterrent. It is irrelevant in combating what political leaders and the security and intelligence agencies have said for years is by far the biggest threat to Britain’s security and will continue to be so for decades to come, a threat we have been reminded of so brutally over the last few weeks – namely, terrorism. Cyber “warfare” is the other main future threat. The huge amounts of money wasted on Trident could be spent on Britain’s badly squeezed conventional forces, including aircraft and surface ships, on the security and intelligence agencies and the police, as well as on health, education, and social care.

We’re ending our liveblog here , but not our commitment to covering the climate crisis. Read our roundup of the historic day of action: A moment of appreciation for the doggos These puppers want action on climate change right now. And maybe also a treat, please? Thousands of tech employees walked out of their workplaces to join the climate strike Workers from Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter staged walkouts in what may be the largest coordinated worker action in the history of the tech industry. At the demonstration in Seattle, more than 3,000 tech workers walked out of their workplaces on Friday and thousands more joined actions across the country, according to Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, a group calling for Amazon to make more effort to address climate change. Globally, more than 1,800 Amazon employees walked out across 25 cities and 14 countries on Friday to protest the company’s failure to take more action to address the climate crisis. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s CEO, has made some efforts to address climate concerns, including an announcement on Thursday that the company expects to be carbon neutral by 2040 and a February announcement of a goal, known as Shipment Zero, to be carbon neutral on 50% of shipments by 2030. But workers are asking for more: zero emissions by 2030, increasing the number of electric vehicles in its fleet, and refusing to set contracts with companies that damage the climate. “Amazon still has a long way to go,” said Danilo Quilaton, product designer at Amazon in San Francisco. “What kind of climate leader can we be if we’re still partnering with fossil fuel companies, selling our AI technologies to extract oil faster?” Other tech companies were present at marches in San Francisco and beyond. Twitter workers walked out, marching alongside workers from tech payment firm Square in San Francisco. Facebook workers walked out of offices around the country, including employees who left the headquarters in San Jose. More than 1,800 workers at Google signed a pledge supporting climate action from the company, including zero emissions by 2030, eliminating contracts with oil and gas companies, and promising zero harm to climate refugees. Hundreds walked out of Google offices across the US, including in New York City and at the headquarters in San Jose. “As individuals, we may feel alone in facing climate change,” the Google petition said. “But if we act together – if we act now – we can build a better future.” Amazon workers join the climate strike Hundreds of Amazon workers left their desks Friday to join a thousands-strong climate strike march in Seattle. Workers rallied in front of Amazon’s focal point – the Amazon Spheres, geodesic glass terrariums marking the company’s center of gravity in downtown Seattle – before marching to city hall. The mood was light, their march well ordered and rife with signage playing on Amazon slogans, including “Customer Obsessed = Climate Obsessed”. Those gathered joked that they were skipping a lunch at their desks to join the noontime protest. The grim realities of the climate crisis were mentioned, particularly the challenges facing Amazon warehouse workers in southern California, but the 2,000-or-so workers and throngs of supporters were prepared to celebrate. They’d won, after all, Amazon’s first broad pledge to contain its carbon footprint. EVAN: Bobbing along with a stream of colleagues, Evan Pulgino was awestruck. Pulgino, a software engineer from Pittsburgh who arrived in Seattle three years ago to work at Amazon, was a face in the crowd of several thousand Amazon and Google employees and their supporters. Badges colored to mark seniority, standard at Amazon, hung from lanyards and fobs. Having set out from the Amazon Spheres in downtown Seattle, the tech crowd merged with throngs of high schoolers arriving on Fifth Avenue to join the march on Seattle’s City Hall. Pulgino described the disparate mass of humanity – Amazon’s orderly herd of 20s and 30-somethings mixing with exuberant teens – as “incredible”. Pulgino, who has been active on climate issues since October, said he was cheered by the commitment made Thursday by Amazon to attain zero net carbon emissions by 2040. It was a start, he said, and a heartening one. Pulgino objected to Amazon’s continued financial support for climate change-denying thinktanks and politicians, and to Amazon Web Services’ contracts with fossil fuel companies. “It was important to be part of the fight,” said Pulgino, carrying a sign that read “Stop funding climate denial, start leading for zero emissions”. “Tech drives so much change,” the 38-year-old continued. “If Amazon leads the way, other companies will follow.” ROSHNI: Roshni Naidu, a five-year Amazon veteran, expected something out of Finding Nemo when last year she traveled to Australia to take in the Great Barrier Reef. Naidu, 28, was shocked to find a graying, vacant space. “It was nothing at all like what I expected,” said Naidu, a senior technical product manager. Returning to Seattle shaken by witnessing the degradation of the planet, Naidu got to work at her work. She began agitating with other Amazon employees for the company to get it right on climate change. Amazon, she said, can lead on climate. She described herself as “cautiously celebratory” after company leaders announced a suite of climate change-related reforms aimed at eliminating Amazon’s carbon footprint by 2040. “It’s a sign that collective action works,” Naidu said. Friday’s march, she added, “puts even more pressure on Amazon to do more.” It’s great, she said, to be able to say she’s “saving the world”. NICK: Milling among his climate activist colleagues, Nick Andrews, a program manager now in his sixth year at Amazon, was ready to scream. Which, as a chant leader, was his job for the afternoon. Andrews, 32, had been active for months pushing Amazon to reduce its climate footprint and cut ties to the fossil fuel industry. Like several of his colleagues, he struck a tone more disappointed than angry. Amazon workers tend to believe their company can do anything, including save the planet. At the outset, Andrews said, pushing the sometimes autocratic company seemed like it would be nerve-racking work. It didn’t turn out that way. “Everyone came in with trepidation,” Andrews said. “But it’s really received a company-wide embrace.” It helps, he said, that he and other Amazonians turn out – unsurprisingly to those who’ve watched the company come to dominate the retail economy and cloud computing – to be “very good organizers”. He celebrated on Thursday when Amazon leaders announced a series of steps designed to eliminate Amazon’s net carbon footprint. He looks forward to Amazon doing more, though. “We pride ourselves on being a bar-pushing company,” Andrews said. “This is a good start, but I think we can do better.” The Guardian has partnered with Friends of the Earth to highlight the climate crisis and raise funds for the charity, which is doing so much to address the damage that has been done and continues to be done to the planet. Scenes from Richmond, California – a town under Chevron’s shadow The main climate strike action in the Bay Area today was in the center of San Francisco, always a magnet for regional progressive activism. But across the bay, Richmond, population 110,000, more than held its own. The small crowd at the city’s civic center peaked at about 100 before a short youth-led march. Speakers took turns addressing the group from atop a park bench, rallying with call-and-response chants and songs, and impromptu speeches about factory farming, a Green New Deal and geoengineering. But while this may have been a small branch of a global day of action, the main thrust here was local issues, as residents shared updates on local organizing efforts to stop the climate pollution happening in their own town. Richmond is actually younger than the 117-year-old, 2,900 acre Chevron oil refinery that occupies much of the city’s scenic bayside hillscape, and the fossil fuel giant has long exerted outsized influence not just over the city’s environment, but also its politics. Richmond also feels the impact of over a million tons of coal and petroleum byproducts exported from its bayside terminal each year – the city’s asthma rates are far above those of other Bay Area communities. Urgency on the global climate crisis won the day worldwide, but in Richmond and other front-line cities, the impacts of the fossil fuel industry and issues of environmental justice feel even more immediately dire. ‘It is like they are burning our soul’: Brazil’s indigenous people call for international help At the third Rio de Janeiro demonstration of the day, Tereza Arapiun, a chief from the Arapiun tribe from the Amazon state of Pará, called for international help for Brazil’s indigenous people. “We are surrounded by destruction, loggers and mining,” she said. “We need help.” Amazon deforestation, fires and land invasions worsened under Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro, she said. “He encourages it. Before, there was protection. He destroyed it.” Arapiun welled up as she told how a friend described hearing the screams of dying animals as fires raged recently near Alter do Chão, a renowned beauty spot in the same state. “It is very painful. It is like they are burning our soul,” she said. “We need help – and help won’t come from Brazil.” Colombian demonstrators demand a world “without plastic and without war” Demonstrators have begun to gather at parks and squares across Colombia now. Here in Bogotá – the capital – the historic Plaza de Bolívar in front of the congress building is slowly drawing crowds despite the rain. “Colombia, our land,” one group of students chanted as they arrived. “Without plastic and without war!” Near the statue of the country’s independence hero Simón Bolívar, demonstrators banged drums and burnt incense, waving signs that read “Rebel or burn out”. “When the problem is as urgent as climate change, it’s only by coming together that we can make a difference,” said Alejandra Moreno, a student from Bogotá. Unlike many similar events around the world, this one was not preceded by a major strike and schools were open as normal. This could be because events got little publicity in local media. The two main dailies, El Espectador and El Tiempo, ran agency-written stories online on worldwide strikes that did not once mention Colombia. Instead, the mantle to promote today’s march was picked up by an opposition political party, Colombia Humana, and local environmental activists. Both used social media extensively. “Why in London are people so willing to move to pressure their government and the world for drastic measures to attack the climate crisis and not in Colombia, if the problem is the same?” the senator Gustavo Petro – the leader of Colombia Humana and a former presidential candidate – tweeted this morning. “Because of something called asymmetrical information: in Colombia the danger is ignored.” Colombia has made efforts to position itself as a regional leader on environmental issues, recently hosting a summit in its Amazonian city Leticia, where Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru agreed on measures to tackle the nearby raging rainforest fires. However, local activists say it is just window-dressing given that Colombia remains one of the most dangerous countries for environmentalists. Twenty-four environmental activists were murdered here in 2018, second only to the Philippines, according to the watchdog Global Witness. “Colombia is living through constant threats of damage to ecosystems and deforestation, and our cities are heating up,” said Isabel Cristina Zuleta, an environmental activist with the Rios Vivos movement, who has received many death threats for her work. She was attending a march in Medellín, Colombia’s second largest city. “In Colombia, to protest and to march is to put yourself at risk,” Zuleta said. “That’s why today it is so important to see people in the streets.” Protesters in Miami Beach wrap it up, head to “End of the World” after party The climate strike has wrapped up in Miami Beach after a “historic” day that saw thousands of schoolchildren, college students and workers gather at two events at city hall. But organizers say this is just the start of something much bigger. “You saw how many people were here, it was incredible,” said youth climate activist John Paul Mejia, who spoke at the morning school strike and evening rally for those who couldn’t take time off during the day. “Now we need to keep the conversation going, to build on this historic day and get things done.” The Miami protestors were heading for an after-strike party with live music at a bar in nearby Overtown arranged by 350southflorida, an environmental group. The relaxation will be short, however. Next week’s planned protest activities include a sit-in at Miami Beach’s sustainability committee meeting and a strike in downtown Miami at Chase Bank, which 350southflorida says is the world’s biggest funder of fossil fuels. The “week of action” wraps up with an End of the World party on the second Global Climate Strike day next Friday. Young activists in Brazil: less CO2, more vida There were small demonstrations across Brazil on Friday. In the morning, dozens of school and university students occupied the steps of Rio de Janeiro’s state legislature in hot sun. They sang, waved placards and called for the removal of business-friendly environment minister Ricardo Salles. Striking high school student Maria Hardman, 15, was angry over far-right president Jair Bolsonaro’s failure to protect the Amazon. “He does not value the environment,” she said. “Bolsonaro is an imbecile. He does not represent me.” Brazilians have yet to grasp the scale of the climate emergency, said Mariana Império, 30, a masters student at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Thalita Alves, 20, a trainee teacher at the Federal Fluminense University, said people began waking up when fires in the Bolivian Amazon caused São Paulo skies to darken. “Brazilians who voted for Bolsonaro … faithfully believe what he says,” she said. Later another demonstration marched from Ibama, the environmental agency, to the city centre. High school students formed a human mosaic reading: “Save the Amazon” in Recife and held up placards with data on Amazon fires in Salvador. Students marched in the town of Novo Friburgo and in the capital Brasília, an SOS Amazon banner was hung on the walls of the environment ministry. In the Amazon city of Belém, hundreds gathered beside the Marajó Bay. “Coming from the Amazon, I feel it’s a duty to fight,” said Lidia Seabra, 24, studying a masters in biology at the Federal University of Pará. “We are united here to defend the Amazon,” said engineering student Devyison de Jesus, 21. In São Paulo, a few thousand blocked Paulista Avenue after cheering speeches from children such as Cora Ramos, 10, who held up a placard she had made that read “there is no planet B”. “If we destroy this one, there won’t be another,” she said. Brazilian activists were also present at marches abroad. Alessandra Munduruku, an indigenous activist from the Munduruku tribe of Pará state, made a short, powerful speech to an enormous crowd in Berlin. “My people are grateful to have good people fighting and defending the Amazon,” she said through a translator to deafening cheers. “I saw many children, many young people, parents, old people, I thought that demonstration was very beautiful,” she told the Guardian. “I had goosebumps.” Mexico City protestors to AMLO: “We want a future, not hydrocarbons!” Climate protests started early outside the National Palace in central Mexico City, where President Andrés Manuel López Obrador usually holds a daily press conference. The president – commonly called AMLO – was instead in the state of Yuctán on Friday and didn’t speak of the climate issue. But he boasted, “The fall in [Mexican] petroleum production has stopped and we’re starting to produce more petroleum. ... We’re now producing more petrol in Mexico’s refineries.” AMLO has bet big on boosting Mexico’s petroleum output and promised to lower the price of gasoline. He’s also pushed ahead with plans to build an $8bn refinery in the state of Tabasco – even starting construction prior to completing the environmental permits. AMLO also cancelled an electricity auction, which would have allowed more renewable energy into the market, and the Federal Electricity Commission (CRE) has announced plans to instead burn more coal. “There a campaign that renewables are cheaper and it’s a lie,” CFE director Manuel Bartlett said earlier this year. The government’s focus on fossil fuels has put in question the country’s commitment to generate 35% of its energy with renewables by 2024, according to climate change analysts. Marchers in Mexico City targeted AMLO, chanting, “We want a future, not hydrocarbons!” Greta Thunberg: “Change is coming whether they like it or not.” The crowd in Battery Park roared in anticipation of Greta Thunberg, who was introduced by Alexandria Villaseñor, Thunberg’s NYC equivalent who her spends her Fridays protesting outside the UN headquarters in New York City. “Greta! Greta! Greta!” the crowd chanted as Thunberg got on the stage. The 16-year-old started her speech off by marking the number of people who participated in the strike around the world. In New York City, 250,000 people marched. Worldwide, more than 4m demonstrated. Thunberg’s directed her speech to the hundreds of students in the crowd, though she acknowledged that adults also skipped worked to strike. “We will do everything in our power to stop this crisis from getting worse, even if it means skipping school or work, because this is more important,” Thunberg said. “Why should we study for a future that is being taken away from us?” Thunberg had to pause her speech twice to point out that people in the crowd needed medical attention. Many people had been in the sun all afternoon waiting for Thunberg to speak. The crowd patiently waited for Thunberg to start speaking again, each time cheering when she continued. Thunberg elicited laughter when she described all the politicians she had met who asked for selfies and “tell us they really, really admire what we do” yet have done nothing to address the climate crisis. “We demand a safe future. Is that really to much to ask?” “No!” the crowd shouted back. At the end of her speech, Thunberg emphasized that the strikes around the world are just the start of change. “If you belong to that small group of people who feel threatened by us, we have some very bad news for you, because this is only the beginning,” Thunberg said. “Change is coming whether they like it or not.” Students in the crowd said they felt moved seeing Thunberg speak in person. “I started crying. I just found it powerful and empowering,” said Juliana Rubiano, 16. “She represents a lot of people, and that’s us, that’s the youth.” Californians are no strangers to the climate crisis fight – and now they’re taking on the federal government California is not a place that requires convincing that the climate is changing. The people here don’t even need to see the science — they’re feeling the impacts firsthand, as the state teeters between an eroding coastline and growing wildland fires. Perhaps because of its many vulnerabilities, California has taken arguably the strongest stance of any US state in fighting the climate crisis, at times also fighting with the federal government in the process. When the Trump administration moved to undo California’s strict vehicle emissions standards this month, the state vowed to fight. Governor Gavin Newsom hit back with, of course, a tweet: “We will prevail. See you in court.” Earlier this week, the University of California pledged to divest over $80bn in endowment and pension funds from fossil fuel companies, citing the “financial risk” posed by the industry, compared to renewable energy. Climate advocates called it the biggest single commitment by any university, and perhaps the beginning of a new divesting trend. California cities, including Berkeley and San Jose, are leading the country with a wave of local laws to phase out natural gas hook-ups in new construction, despite strong and well-funded opposition from the gas industry. Natural gas is the greatest source of carbon emissions from buildings, while fully electrifying homes and businesses could allow them to run on clean, renewable energy instead. California’s municipalities have also taken direct aim at the industry responsible for so much of the climate crisis. Eight cities and counties in the state have filed civil lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, alleging public nuisance and in some cases negligence. The suits seek billions of dollars in damages to help mitigate climate impacts. Maanvi Singh, here — taking up the Guardian’s live climate strike coverage from the West Coast. Coming up, West Coast environment correspondent Susie Cagle will be sharing sketches and scenes from the demonstration in Richmond, California, across the bay from San Francisco. A Chevron refinery older than the town itself looms over it, and the area is home to some of the boldest climate-minded activism in California. Technology reporter Kari Paul will be following up on climate walkouts at Amazon, Twitter, Facebook and Google. And Los Angeles correspondent Sam Levin will bring us dispatches from the protests in southern California. Mexico City protests: thousands take to the streets Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of Mexico City to join the global climate strike this afternoon. “Se ve, se siente, la tierra está caliente,” the crowds shouted as they processed down the city’s main avenue, Reforma towards its presidential palace. “You see it, you feel it. The earth is getting hotter.” Protesters - many of them school children and teenagers - carried homemade banners reading: “There’s no money in a dead earth” and “Action now!” One placard urged demonstrators to make love, not CO2. There were reports of other demonstrations, big and small, across Mexico in cities including Acapulco, Irapuato, Guadalajara and Tijuana. Unlike in Brazil, where far-right president Jair Bolsonaro has ignored today’s movement, the protests received the blessing of the Mexican government which tweeted its support. In a Twitter video Victor Toledo, Mexico’s environment secretary, urged the country to reflect on the environment “insurgency” taking place around the world and to take action where possible. ‘There is no Planet B’ Best friends Amaya Mejia, 10, and Scarlett Harrison, 11, skipped school together to join the Miami Beach youth climate strike, after staying up late the night before to craft their placards. Amaya opted for a globe with the simple message: “There is no Planet B”. “You need to listen to us, it’s the only planet we’ve got and we need to protect it,” said Amaya, who attends the Gulliver private school in Coral Gables. Messages on banners ranged from simple and effective like Amaya’s, to the deeply political and often comical. “The government can regulate my uterus but not single-use plastics?” read one. Another student held aloft a sign informing the crowd: “I’m not showing up for school because adults aren’t showing up for children,” while another said: “You’ll die of old age, I’ll die of climate change.” More locally-themed placards, referencing the threat of sea level rise to Miami Beach, a hugely popular tourism destination, included one that read: “Take a stand before our city is all sand.” My favorite, however, was perhaps the most understated message of the day. “I’m very upset,” it read. Covering Climate Now Covering the climate crisis is absolutely core to the Guardian’s editorial mission. And all this week, we have been a lead partner in Covering Climate Now, an initiative founded earlier this year with the Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation. This has led to more than 250 newsrooms representing 32 countries – with a combined monthly reach of more than a billion people – signing on to amplify and share content on climate change. There has been a burst of coverage this week on the Guardian and beyond ahead of the UN climate summit next week on Monday 23 September. Check out some of our pieces this week including: The silenced: meet the climate whistleblowers muzzled by Trump The sinking class: the New Yorkers left to fight the climate crisis alone How TV weathercasters became the unsung heroes of the climate crisis ‘Like a sunburn on your lungs’: how does the climate crisis impact health? Thousands of people are striking in Boston, Massachusetts Organizers expected some 10,000 people to rally at City Hall Plaza for the Boston Climate Strike organized by youth climate activists. Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu and former Environmental Protection Agency head Gina McCarthy were among scheduled speakers, according to NBC10 Boston. Miami striker: ‘Does it matter if we’re under 15 feet of water or 50 feet?’ Dan Gelber, the mayor of Miami Beach, received a warmer reception than any politician might have expected when he emerged to address the hundreds of student climate campaigners making a racket right outside his office window. Perhaps it’s the $500m dollars his city is investing over the next five years to combat the effects of sea level rise, which already leaves neighborhoods under water during higher than usual tides. Scientists predict up to a three feet sea level rise by 2050. Gelber pointed out the strides already taken to improve things on this island city barely seven by one miles in size: an aggressive program of elevating roads and laying larger capacity drainage pipes, along with investing in modern pump equipment and technology to faster shift the rising flood waters. It’s little wonder the environmentally-conscious city’s slogan is Rising Above. And today the Miami Herald reported on what could become the city’s most ambitious project yet, a proposal to turn the city-owned golf course into a 115-acre wetland park, which the newspaper says is certain to test the boundaries of what the public will accept in the name of resilience. “Change is never easy,” Miami Beach commissioner Ricky Arriola said. “If we’re truly serious about dealing with climate change then everything is on the table, including the golf course. If we’re not willing to even talk about it then we’re just paying lip service.” Gabriella Marchesani, 17, organizer of the Miami Beach youth climate strike, praises the city’s efforts but says more needs to be done to address the causes of the climate crisis as well as dealing with its effects. “Miami Beach has spent a lot of money on adaptation, it can be the leading city and we hope other cities in Florida will follow,” she said. “But this cannot be done slowly, and we need climate policy. Does it matter if we’re under 15 feet of water or 50 feet?” Thousands converge on Battery Park, New York Most New York strikers have now made it down to Battery Park where a stage has been set up close to the water. Hundreds of people are packed around the stage, Greta is slated to speak, and many more are camped out sitting on the grass in the park. Young speakers took the stage giving personal testimonies of how the climate crisis is affecting them, denouncing politicians on both sides, saying just believing the facts isn’t enough without action. When Jaden Smith took the stage, people started running the stage. In between two songs he reminded the crowd: “We gotta show people we care about this.” Climate meme power Dorian victims convinced of link to climate change Reporting from the hurricane-hit Bahamas last week, I met David Dean, a sous chef at one of its holiday resorts. “My wife and kids had me as ‘dead’ on Facebook because they couldn’t find me,” he said. “When I called them, there was a lot of crying.” Like many in these Caribbean islands, Dean is convinced that the climate crisis in making hurricanes such as Dorian more likely and more intense. “It was very hot,” the 38-year-old said. “That’s why the hurricane was coming to us. Heat brings the hurricane and makes it worse.” Some 52 people are confirmed dead in the Bahamas, a figure expected to rise, and more than 1,300 are still missing. The scale of destruction was astonishing, as if a giant with a child’s temperament had run amok, flipping over cars and buses like toys. As so often, the underclass suffers the most. The science is complex but this Guardian article explains how global heating made Dorian bigger, wetter and deadlier. Many in the Bahamas are determined to stay the course, not least because tourism is so crucial to the economy. The owners of the hard hit Treasure Cay beach, marine and golf resort declared their intention to rebuild. But some residents also expressed concern that such efforts could be undone by the next hurricane, and the one after that. For now the Bahamas is dealing with scars, mental and physical. Dean told me: “Now, if I feel a little rain, it might be drive me crazy. I’m traumatised. I don’t ever want to go through that again.” This video is great at capturing some of the scale of the New York action. Which countries contribute most to the climate crisis? How much is the US to blame? China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US, the European Union, India and Russia. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China’s carbon footprint. What has happened to the US Environmental Protection Agency with climate change? The EPA has begun efforts to eliminate climate rules for power plants, cars and the methane leaked from oil and gas facilities. Has the US already pulled out of the Paris accord? What if Democrats win next election? The US has not yet exited the international accord, in which every other nation on earth agreed to voluntarily begin to curb emissions. The deal was meant to prevent global average temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. Technically, the US cannot leave the agreement until the day after the November 2020 election, when Trump will still be president regardless of the outcome. A Democrat president could rejoin the deal. Is Donald Trump making climate change worse with his rollbacks? The US is falling far short of its commitments to curb heat-trapping pollution, in part because Trump has gutted efforts made by his predecessor, Barack Obama. The country is on track to cut emissions 13% to 16% below 2005 levels by 2020, according to the analysis firm Rhodium Group. That’s short of the 17% reduction the US promised in the Copenhagen Accord. “Looking ahead to 2025, the US is on track to achieve reductions anywhere from 12% to 19% below 2005 levels absent major policy changes—a far cry from its Paris Agreement pledge to reduce emissions 26% to 28%,” Rhodium Group explains. The US, however, represents 15% of world emissions. Is Donald Trump a climate change denier? What is his record? Before becoming president, Trump called climate change a Chinese hoax. In an interview with Piers Morgan, he deflected questions about how his policies promote continued climate-change causing emissions. He said the US has “the cleanest climates” and “China, India, Russia, many other nations, they have not very good air, not very good water.” Trump’s White House has downplayed the dangers of the climate crisis, including disagreeing with a federal report showing it threatens the US economy. Many of the president’s appointees have denied climate change, and government scientists say their work on the crisis has been silenced. It is, of course, worth keeping in mind today the specific demands that climate groups have for meaningful action. The Youth Climate Strike Coalition in the US, has issued a set of policy demands which includes: Transform our economy to 100% clean, renewable energy by 2030 and phase out all fossil fuel extraction through a just and equitable transition, creating millions of good jobs A halt to all leasing and permitting for fossil fuel extraction, processing and infrastructure projects immediately Respect of Indigenous Land and Sovereignty and Environmental Justice Protection and restoration of 50% of the world’s lands and oceans including a halt to all deforestation by 2030 Investment in farmers and regenerative agriculture and an end to subsidies for industrial agriculture Downtown New York City is packed with sign-bearing people of all ages, though the crowd noticeably skews young. Students from all over NYC have come to the march. Many young children are accompanied by their parents while middle and high school students are here with their friends. Almost all groups have posters in hand. On the way down to the march, I caught up with students from Professional Performing Arts School, who caught the subway to attend the strike together. They met up at school and decided to go to the march in a group. “I just want the world to exist the way I knew it was growing up,” said Nyla Robothan, a 15-year-old student at the school, on why she’s striking. Many say this isn’t their first march, having participating in other climate marches or the March For Our Lives protest in 2018. They say that they feel like their future feels uncertain because of the climate crisis, yet no one is listening to their generation. “Our planet is dying, and no one’s going to be doing anything except for us right now,” said Arlene Guevara, 17, a student at Beacon High School in Manhattan. The march is slowly making its way down to Battery Park at the southern tip of Manhattan, where speakers, including Greta Thunberg, are slated to speak in the afternoon. We are expecting hundreds of Amazon workers to strike later in their HQ city of Seattle, Washington. Levi Pulkkinen is there to report on this for us and ahead of the strikes there, sent us this explainer of how some of the giant firm’s workers are taking action and Thursday’s move by Jeff Bezos pledging to improve Amazon’s environmental impact: After months agitating for climate accountability from their employer, Amazon.com workers celebrated Thursday as the Seattle-based retail and cloud computing giant pledged to zero out carbon emissions by 2040. The announcement from CEO Jeff Bezos came as about 1,500 Amazon workers prepared to walkout Friday as part of the global strike for climate change. The disruption would mark the first time white-collar Amazon workers have walked off the job. Asserting that Bezos’ pledge “proves that collective action and employee pressure works,” organizers of the stoppage reiterated demands that Amazon Web Services stop doing business with fossil fuel companies, and that the company cut ties with lobbyists, politicians and researchers hostile to climate science. Those calls were left unaddressed by the company, which did announce plans to acquire 100,000 electric delivery vans manufactured by an Amazon-funded company and an $100m commitment to an environmental restoration fund managed by The Nature Conservancy. In a statement, Bezos described the initiatives as evidencing a shift within Amazon. “We’re done being in the middle of the herd on this issue — we’ve decided to use our size and scale to make a difference,” Bezos said. “If a company with as much physical infrastructure as Amazon — which delivers more than 10 billion items a year — can meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early, then any company can.” Amazon, making good on a promise offered earlier in the year, also for the first time released an accounting of its carbon footprint. The assessment, audited by Paris-based certification agency Bureau Veritas, showed Amazon’s direct and indirect CO2 emissions amounted to 44.4 million metric tons in 2018, a year that saw 37.1 billion metric tons of the greenhouse gas released globally. The Guardian’s Latin American correspondent Tom Phillips has spotted a striking banner in Guadalajara, Mexico. Here’s some footage from climate strikes around the world today: Miami student Greta Rodriguez feels exactly the same way as the famous teenage climate activist who shares her first name, and had a similar message as she joined dozens of classmates to protest in Miami Beach: We’ve just had enough. The 15-year-old was among a party of 50 students from the Cushman private school in Key Biscayne who wanted to make their voices heard in this low-lying coastal city that is recognized as ground zero for sea level rise. “We’ve had enough of big business and their trash, burning fossil fuels, depleting the earth,” she said. “It has to change.” Chaperoned by biology teacher Jen Russell, the Cushman kids were among the loudest at the Miami Beach strike. “They wanted to be here and the student government association organized the whole thing,” Russell said. “It was important to them. We can talk to them as adults but it’s the children who have the voice, it’s their future.” The Miami Beach strike drew hundreds of students from schools, colleges and universities across South Florida. A similar, simultaneous event outside the Broward school district headquarters in Fort Lauderdale attracted another large crowd. While private schools such as Cushman turned up with numbers, local public school leaders proved less amenable to students walking out of classes, however. Elijah Ruby, 17, a senior at South Broward high school, was banned from his prom for handing out flyers for the Fort Lauderdale event, according to the Miami Herald, and both the Broward and Miami-Dade school districts announced that absences for the strike would be recorded as unexcused. At the New York event are Zariah, age seven, and Lori Sapphire, who says: “We’re here to save the planet. So no packaging. It’s an easy solution. Focus on solar energy. No more cars burning oil. Stop taking every mineral from the earth. Go back to the simple ways. “There’s enough for everyone. Stop burning the forests because we want to eat meat and soybeans. Use hemp for everything. It almost a joke that everything were doing is being so selfishly and unconsciously. It like we’re not from the planet, otherwise we’d care.” The crowds in New York are massive but everyone is slowly making their way down to Battery Park. Earlier at the breakfast meeting for indigenous people from the Amazon and Indonesia, 19 year old Artemisa Barbosa Ribeiro, a climate activist known as Artemisa Xakriabá, told the Guardian she is thankful for all the young people who are joining the movement. “ I can see a future where we can make a difference but for that we must be listened to and respected,” she said, describing how her people, the Xakriabá peoples, a group of approximately 12 thousand people who live on the left bank of the São Francisco River, in the municipality of São João das Missões, in the state of Minas Gerais, have watched as mining companies have denied them access to the river and its water. “The scarcity of water in the territory is noticeable” she says. “ We need the river and the water for our living and for our spiritual health, our connection to the earth. So access to the river is a big issue for us.” Ribeiro, who was recently in Washington DC to demand action from members of the US congress alongside Greta Thunberg, said she felt that Jaire Bolsnaro’s government have a plan for all indigenous people. “I believe they want to assassinate us,” she said frankly. “It’s got much worse in the last eight months. We need support from outside the country because from the inside we have no support. “The main thing you can do in the west to help is to stop importing hard wood because that is causing deforestation and exploitation. That is the best way you can help,” Ribeiro added. Here is a message from Greta Thunberg, who will be making a speech at the New York event later in Battery Park: There are many, many hundreds of protesters in DC. Blocks and blocks of a roughly 6-lane street filled and more coming and marching toward the US Capitol. I can’t see the end. This gives you a sense of how big the gathering in New York is - so many people want to participate. Delaney Reynolds has addressed the general assembly of the United Nations on the climate crisis. She has appeared in a prime time National Geographic special, written books, won awards, launched a non-profit battling sea rise, shared a stage with Al Gore and changed laws in almost a decade as an environmental activist and entrepreneur. She is also still only 20. “The youth voice is extremely powerful,” says Reynolds, a speaker at this morning’s youth climate strike in Miami Beach. “I hope our elected leaders realise that current young voters and soon-to-be voters care passionately about this issue and very much want to see something done about it.” Reynolds is not afraid to play hardball to tackle the climate emergency. She is the lead plaintiff of eight young Floridians currently suing their state and its governor for “violating their fundamental rights to a stable climate system” through their reliance on fossil fuels. But she knows collaboration can work just as well as confrontation. As a teenager she was instrumental in getting the city of South Miami to adopt Florida’s first law requiring solar panels on newly-built homes. “We also spoke at a Miami-Dade budget hearing and the same day after hearing the children speak the county created the post of chief resilience officer,” she said. “The young generation is starting to realise our voice matters. Our leaders are going to have to pay attention if a bunch of kids stop going to school and start standing on their steps at city hall. They may not have a vote but they do have a voice.” The climate strike is being held the same day as the two-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico and left nearly 3,000 people dead. In recognition of that event, the climate strike is happening in concert with a Puerto Rico Day of Action to highlight the struggles the island still faces in its effort to rebuild, while remaining vulnerable to the impact of climate change. Marisol Rivera, a 13-year-old Puerto Rican student in Brooklyn, has been speaking on Friday about Maria and how it impacted her family, She will connect the issues there to the climate crisis. Other Puerto Rican activists will also speak at the event, including Gustavo Rivera, a New York state senator (he is unrelated to Marisol). Puerto Rico is still recovering from the hurricane, which affected all of the 3.5 million Americans who lived on the island. Its power grid was knocked out completely by the storm and families reported having no electricity nearly a year after the hurricane. Here are some photographs of people gathering in New York’s Foley Square. Donald Trump is set to attend the United Nations headquarters during Monday’s key summit on the climate crisis – but will be there to take part in a meeting on religious freedom instead. A senior UN official confirmed to the Guardian that the White House has booked one of the large conference rooms in the New York headquarters on Monday so that the president can address a gathering on religious freedom. The move is likely to be seen as a blatant snub to the UN climate summit, to be held in the same building on the same day. Leaders from around the world, including the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson; France’s president, Emmanuel Macron; and India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, are expected at the summit as part of a major UN push to heighten the response to the escalating climate crisis. UN sources said the booking of the room was relatively last minute and will cause some logistical issues given the major security operation that accompanies the US president wherever he goes. But a senior UN official said they were “not panicked” given the large organizational capacity of the UN general assembly. “No one was really expecting the president to come to the climate summit,” the official said. It’s understood that senior UN staff have realistic expectations of Trump and do not expect him to engage on the climate crisis, even for a summit held in his hometown. Trump has vowed the US will withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement. Many folks have come to New York from all over the world to attend today’s strike, planning their trips months in advance. Our Village, a coalition made of indigenous groups and communities of color, spoke to reporters this morning, in a studio space in New York City where they were making signs and distributing T-shirts in anticipation of the march. Dinaman Tuxá, traveled from Bahia, Brazil with a delegation of six Brazillians from all over the country to speak out against the injustices against indigenous communities in Brazil. “We’re going through a process of genoicde. … President Bolsonaro, he’s spreading hate against the indigenous populations of Brazil,” Tuxá said through a translator. “Us, the indigenous people, we are the guardians of the forest. … We need the world to recognize our contributions and help us protect our territories.” Tuxá said that he traveled to New York because Brazillians aren’t listening to the cry of indigenous communities in their country, so they’re making an international cry in anticipation of the UN climate summit. The United Nations headquarters in New York will play host tonight to an immersive art installation by artist Joseph Michael that features images of an iceberg and six young advocates, including Greta Thunberg, addressing hopes and fears around the climate crisis. We have some pictures from last night’s final rehearsal: We will be live through the rest of the day here in the US with Oliver Milman, Lauren Aratani and Ed Helmore reporting on the big rally in New York city. Emily Holden, meanwhile, is out with activists in Washington DC while Richard Luscombe is at the strikes in Miami Beach. Later on, Levi Pulkkinen in Seattle will be with more than 1,500 corporate Amazon workers expected to strike to highlight criticisms of the company’s climate policies. CEO Jeff Bozos said on Thursday that Amazon would do more and pledged the firm would be carbon neutral by 2040. Susie Cagle, meanwhile, will be reporting on the strikes from the city of Richmond, California, and we’ll also have a dispatch from Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro. All week, the Guardian has been part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate emergency. Welcome from the Guardian’s office in New York, where we are now anchoring live coverage of these calls for climate action, which have drawn huge crowds around the world. We expect the US will be staging its largest ever climate strike, with actions planned in more than 1,000 locations, including major rallies in New York, Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Miami. Here at the Guardian’s New York office, members of our team in midtown Manhattan walked out at midday local time to participate in the strike. Further downtown, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg will be leading a big strike rally which she is expected to speak at later in the day, ahead of addressing the UN’s Climate Action Summit next week. Activists are gathering in Foley Square, near City Hall, and will start marching south on Broadway at 1pm ET to rally in Battery park. There have already been significant protests across the world today with millions joining the climate strike to urge politicians and businesses to take action to avert the climate crisis. With parts of the US just waking up and others still asleep it’s far from over so I’m handing over to my colleague Mark Oliver, who is taking over the blog and will keep you abreast of all the latest developments in the US and elsewhere. Back in the UK, the police monitoring group Netpol says that officers are restricting protesters in London by kettling them (for those unfamiliar with the British vernacular it means confining demonstrators in a small area) on the southside of Westminster Bridge. New York is standing up! The Rolling Stones legend Keith Richards has endorsed the climate strike, realising that Time is not actually On Our Side (sorry). The Guardian has partnered with Friends of the Earth to highlight the climate crisis and raise funds for the charity, which is doing so much to address the damage that has been done and continues to be done to the planet. Here is a country I’m not sure we’ve featured on the blog so far today. With the US protests beginning, it feels like a good time to highlight this article on the huge impact climate change could have on the nation if it is not arrested. The US is waking up (in more ways than one) and already there are sizeable crowds reported. Here is a useful reminder about the impact of flying. You can also calculate the impact of your next trip. Anuna De Wever, 18, a cofounder of Belgium’s school strike movement, which has organised 20 nationwide strike days since January, said today’s protest in Brussels made her feel hopeful. It was amazing, we had 20,000 across the streets. I am really happy about this strike because I feel like after coming on the streets after 20 weeks, this is our season two. There are so many people ready and it just makes me feel very hopeful. But she added: Belgium is doing really badly on the climate crisis. There is not any ambition from any of our politicians. So we are really asking them to take responsibility because right now we don’t have a climate policy and they really need to take responsibility. While Belgium has signed the Paris Agreement, the three Belgian regions (Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia) have so far been unable to agree on the distribution of emissions cuts. De Wever thinks the school strike movement is helping to bridge these old political divides. There are some arguments, especially in politics but we don’t care about that and we want to unite everyone to fight with us. I think it’s beautiful that no one is thinking about this, are they from the Walloon side or are they from the Flemish side. The Brussels protest finished close to the headquarters of the European commission and European council - not an accidental choice as the EU debates decarbonising its economy by 2050. Earlier in the day, De Wever and other activists met the European commission vice president, Frans Timmermans, who has been tasked with drawing up a Green New Deal to allow the EU to move away from fossil fuel and meet its climate pledges. The bulk of those still taking part in the climate strike in London reached the entrance to Trafalgar Square a little earlier, where police blocked it off at Northumberland Avenue, to chants of “let them through”. Many people are on their way home now. I was speaking at the back of the crowd to two new mothers, Chloe Reeves and Lauren Slattery, who had brought along their children, Leo (five months) and Phoenix (seven months). While deeply concerned about the climate crisis – to the extent that they have discussed jointly purchasing land on higher ground for children as a reaction to rising sea levels - they’ve been drawing some encouragement from the international focus of the strikes. “To be honest as a new mother I’ve been putting all my energy into the basic job of keeping baby alive and looking after him and I’ve purposefully not thought about climate change because it has freaked me out so much, but now my mother instincts have allowed me to shift a bit of emphasis on to things like this and the action that we need to take,” said Chloe. Lauren added: “Actions like today have really been inspiring. We recycle and do as much as we can in our personal daily lives but you really realise that so much more needs to done, and we really are on a tight schedule.” Nearly two-thirds (64%) of Generation Z Americans want to work for employers committed to tackling climate change, according to research released today from international non-profit organisation the Climate Group. It surveyed more than 1,000 16- to 24-year-olds across the US to find out their views on climate change and how it will affect their future choices. Three in four young people (77%) feel climate change is an important issue that needs to be solved, with almost identical results for Democratic and Republican states (80% v 76%). With the US federal government actively rolling back pro-climate policies, for most young people the bulk of responsibility to solve the climate crisis rests on the shoulders of big US businesses and state governments alike (60% for big businesses v 69% for state governments). Four out of five (80%) support US companies adopting renewable energy in place of fossil fuels, with two in five (40%) believing they should be using 100% clean energy already. Two-fifths think the switch needs to be made by 2030 at the latest. Within the transport sector, two-thirds (66%) of young people would support the replacement of short-haul flights with cleaner alternatives, such as high-speed rail. Helen Clarkson, CEO of the Climate Group, which annually hosts Climate Week NYC, said: We need wholescale changes to economies and infrastructure to make pro-climate choices the new normal. It is in the interests of every business and government to sit up and listen to the next generation of workers and voters. We know through our initiatives for business on renewables, electric vehicles, and smart efficient energy and work with state and regional governments that good progress is being made in the US, but more needs to be done at a greater pace and scale. Demonstrations, marches, even open-air classes on environmental policy are planned in more than 40 Brazilian cities on Friday. And while numbers are likely to range widely – from 186 people who signed up for the Facebook event of a protest at 5pm in the southern city of Florianópolis to 12,000 promising to attend another at 4pm on São Paulo’s landmark Paulista Avenue, activists said the geographical spread of cities taking part shows how non-party, environmental activism is growing here. “We are talking to churches, unions, social movements,” said Yumi Kawamura, 45, a sociologist helping organise the São Paulo event, “looking to unite organisations with different agendas and find a common way forward.” In Rio de Janeiro, a protest at 10am outside the state legislature is aimed at children and young people. Another is scheduled for 2.30pm. Then at 4pm demonstrators hold an open-air class outside the headquarters of beleaguered environment agency Ibama - under attack from far-right president Jair Bolsonaro and his business-friendly environment minister, Ricardo Salles – before marching to the city centre. Events are being staged by the Rio Climate Coalition (Coalizão Pelo Clima Rio), an umbrella group of collectives. “It is very plural, it is horizontal, it is collective. It is aligned with the movement that Greta (Thunberg) started in Europe,” said Hanna Cordeiro, 31, an advertising executive and climate activist from the coalition. Brazil is one of the world’s deadliest countries for environmental defenders – one reason, Cordeiro said, why environmental demonstrations in Brazil are usually smaller here. Another is that pressing problems with poverty, crime, unemployment and a lack of basic sanitation obscure environmental issues for many Brazilians. “In Brazil it is jobs and housing. The environmental agenda is seen as more subjective. In Europe it is much stronger,” said José Oeiras, 57, a climate organiser for the leftist Workers’ party helping stage a demonstration at 4pm in the Amazon city of Belém. When the Amazon fires crisis exploded, Bolsonaro’s supporters flooded social media and WhatsApp with fake news – a report by the Publica journalism agency showed how automated Twitter accounts led attacks. The propaganda deluge echoed Bolsonaro’s unproven arguments that the blazes were started by foreign NGOs and foreign interest constituted an attack on Brazilian sovereignty. Such nationalist rhetoric has long resounded in the Amazon. “This is an old argument,” Oeiras said. “It’s a contradiction we need to overcome.” Fatima Zara Alarakha, 20, a campaigner for Islamic Relief UK and an arts student, marching on Millbank beside the Houses of Parliament in central London, said fighting climate change was imperative, given her beliefs: I’m here today because it is my duty as Muslim and a human. Allah entrusted us to look after the earth and it is our responsibility to do so. I’m striking today to represent my family in Pakistan whose houses are being flooded as a result of our overconsumption in the west. I’m also here to represent the future generations whose lives will be affected by the decisions we make. I want to bring children up in a world where they don’t have to suffer from majorly polluted air, decrepit housing and the health problems and poverty brought on by the climate crisis. Manisha Jeevan, 16, isn’t sure she is ready for her music exam tomorrow. But she decided to skip school because climate change is more important, she says. “If there is no earth then how will we live?” She is protesting near Lodhi gardens, Delhi, with her friend, Kushi, also 16. They worry about pollution in Delhi, about the failure to manage waste properly and about the increasingly hot weather. “It’s September. Our parents used to get winter in this month but we have not got winter. We are losing our seasons,” says Kushi. Rishika Singh, 18, a college student, worries about the damage that Delhi’s pollution is doing to her lungs. She says: I even bought a mask, but it’s not so easy to wear every day. The pollution that we see here, and the water here which has a lot of chlorine in it - it’s not good. It’s the poorest who suffer the most.The rich are better off - they make the use of air conditioning and private cars for comfort. It’s evening now in Delhi and, after an afternoon of chanting and banging drums, protesters have gone home. Nimrat Singh, 21, a law student, says people want action, not words, from their leaders. “We want the system to actually recognise climate change,” she says. New York City is anticipated to see one of the largest climate strikes today. Thousands of people are expected at the protest, which is being co-hosted by over two dozen local and national groups. Protesters plan to gather at a park outside New York’s City Hall and march a mile down to Battery Park, where Greta Thunberg is scheduled to speak in the afternoon along with other performers and speakers. In anticipation of the strikes, NYC’s Department of Education announced the absences of students in the district, the largest school district in the nation, will be excused on Friday with parental permission. In other words, 1.1 million students have been given the green light to attend the strikes if they want to. Many students have spent the last few weeks painting signs and banners in preparation. Before the march’s official start at noon local time (5pm BST), a rally honoring the two-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria will take place in downtown Manhattan. The central London rally, outside parliament, has heard speeches from Jeremy Corbyn and Caroline Lucas, with the Labour leader calling for tougher global environmental standards to prevent the import of products made overseas using harmful processes. From an open-top double-decker bus being used a stage, Corbyn told the crowd: So when we measure the effects of climate change emissions, let’s measure those emissions at the source, where they are created, and not put ourselves in some comfort zone, that we’re doing OK at the expense of somebody else. Corbyn also called for what Labour term a “green industrial revolution” – a version of the green new deal – to invest heavily in areas such as sustainable energy. That green industrial revolution can bring about, I believe, 400,000 decent, high-quality jobs. And with that we also have cleaner air, we have better quality of life, and we deal with many of the health inequalities that exist in this country. Beforehand, Lucas began by noting that in May parliament had passed a motion declaring a climate emergency. “So don’t ever let anyone tell you that you are not making a difference,” the Green MP told the crowd. “You are making history.” Calling it “the biggest social justice issue of our time”, Lucas said the government needed to make more urgent plans than the commitment of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. She said: The truth is that a climate target of net zero by 2050 is not climate leadership. When your house is on fire you don’t call 999 and ask for a fire engine in 30 years’ time. You want urgent action now. This is a striking picture, no pun intended, from Berlin. The translation of the sign held by “Merkel” reads: “Mother (Merkel) has failed, now it’s the turn of young people.” The Bishop of Wolverhampton, Clive Gregory, has asked all clergy members and lay employees within the Dioceses of Lichfield to set aside their usual duties today to focus instead on Climate Action activities. Gregory led a special service at Lichfield Cathedral to raise awareness about the climate crisis. Around 550 pupils and teachers from five West Midlands primary schools attended. Children from St Michael’s CE primary school in Lichfield arrived holding handmade signs and chanting “save our world”. My colleague, Ben Quinn, is in Westminster where climate strikers are heading towards Downing Street, but there is also a counter-demonstration by Jeremy Corbyn’s brother, and famed climate change denier, Piers. The German government today announced a new climate protection package costing €50bn, which was immediately criticised as lacking ambition by Fridays for Future protesters. At a press conference in central Berlin, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said that as a scientist she had been impressed by Greta Thunberg’s motto “unite behind the science”. Following a marathon negotiation session, Merkel’s conservatives and her Social Democrat coalition partner detailed plans for increased purchase premiers for electric cars, and new taxes for traditional cars with emissions over 115mg. The measures include a ban on installing oil-fired heating in buildings from 2025, with a subsidy for householders prepared to switch to more climate-friendly alternatives. A price for emissions of carbon dioxide has also been agreed that will take effect via trading in emissions certificates. The package also includes new investment in rail networks, and promises of reduced fares. In a tweet, Fridays for Future criticised the plans: Dear government: if you spend years doing nothing for climate protection and then, after months of massive public pressure, discuss measures that have nothing to do with [the plan to halt global warming at] 1.5C, then that’s not a ‘breakthrough’ but a scandal. You can see some of the best pictures of the day here: Thanks for the excellent questions, which have ranged from science and politics to a plea from a deskbound worker – hang in there! – and thanks to you all for taking part in the debate over climate issues and solutions. Today’s climate strikes have sent a message round the world that will be heard in the highest echelons of politics and business, but which have also helped to spur public engagement with the solutions to the crisis that will be needed if we are to make the vast changes we must to avoid the worst ravages of climate chaos. On a personal note, today is almost exactly 15 years since I started writing full-time about the climate crisis, and related environmental issues, and although progress in that time has been grindingly slow in many ways, it has also been marked by sudden leaps forward. Improving public understanding and engagement is at the heart of making a better future. The messages from today are clear. This is not somebody else’s problem: it is ours. This is not a problem for the future: it is now. This is not an inevitable catastrophe: we can still make things much better. A noisy and good natured protest is being held in Bedford, with a few hundred protesters, including one dressed as a giant dinosaur, marching along the High Street at lunchtime shouting “what do we want, climate justice”, “no planet B” and “this is what democracy looks like”. The protest is being led by children from local schools, clearly drawing their inspiration from climate activist Greta Thunberg. Earlier, Bedford’s MP, Mohammad Yasin, addressed the crowd, saying he was sorry that politicians had let people down and pledging his support. One young protester addressing the crowd said: “We may only be 14 or 15 years old but we’re a force to be reckoned with.” Later, a die-in was held in Harpur Square in Bedford town centre. Indy Willaert, Liza, Fran Demeyer and Jana Bameils, all aged 13, have taken half a day off school to attend the climate march in Brussels. Not all their teachers are in favour. “Some of them are alright with it, but some of them would rather have us in class,” says Fran, who has already taken part in several school strikes. “That climate is more important ... You can always do [your work] after school,” adds Indy. Liza wants politicians to help make green choices easier, including reducing plastic waste. “We can only buy plastic because everything is in plastic. We want them to help us” They all agree with Jana that politicians are not doing enough. The four schoolgirls arrived from their home city of Ghent to join the climate march in Brussels, which started from the city’s North Station and will finish around the headquarters of the European Union. Along the route there was music, drum beating and chanting. Young people jumped up and down to the slogan: “Plus chaud, plus chaud, plus chaud que le climat” (Hotter, hotter, hotter than the climate). Stijn, a 28-year-old engineer, was missing work to join the protest. His employers “were not very happy about it but they couldn’t really make a fuss about it either,” he said. “Like the other side of my sign says there are no jobs on a dead planet so it is important to be here today.” His friend, Deniz Malat, 27, a recent plant biology graduate, feels people are being ignored by the government. “We want change and we are being ignored by the government - the politicians. We want to come together to show we are serious and they should consider what we are saying here.” People are also out in force in Poland. Ten-year-old Nellie Jacobs and her mother, Helen, had never protested before their hometown of Whaley Bridge made national headlines earlier this month. Nellie and her Dad were choosing books in the library of their quiet Derbyshire town when Helen called them in a panic to say its dam had burst and the whole neighbourhood could go under. Carrying a homemade placard saying “School strike for climate”, Nellie was allowed to take the day off school at Whaley Bridge primary to join the global strike in Manchester. She said: Everyone had to be evacuated and we raced for high ground. I was quite scared because we weren’t expecting it. We occasionally get police cars coming through Whaley for something that’s not in Whaley but we’ve not had crises in Whaley. I’m worried it might happen again. We weren’t used to that much rain so it made me worry and it made me think all this rain, we don’t get it usually so I thought that it was climate change that caused the rain. Her mother Helen Jacobs said she had never protested in her life but felt infuriated by the inaction of global leaders. She said: It’s kind of getting the politicians to realise that they’ve made a mistake in saying that it’s really nothing when it’s a really big problem and we need to act on it now. I thought if I got out here and did something then it might happen. It’s been building up a lot in my mind. The climate is under threat and it has been for a long time but the action doesn’t seem to have fit the imperative. We feel like we need to wake the government up, we need to wake world leaders up and make them realise that we need systematic massive change. We’re here and ready for change to bring the temperature down. We feel like we need to shake them by the collar to make them realise. The scientists are there telling them and still President Trump is denying climate change exists! Other leaders need to grab him, shake him, and get him on board. The whole world needs to get on this. In Aviemore, a town in the Cairngorms National Park, in the Scottish Highlands, strikes are taking place. We were sent another photograph of activity there today from Iain Gibson. Nick from Norwich asked: How can I join in the strike in a non-unionised office where no one cares about climate change without getting the sack? That is a tough one. Most companies will be affected by climate chaos in some way, however: extreme weather events are already costing billions a year and those costs are not coming down soon. Foresighted companies will audit the risks they face and act to deal with them. If you work for a publicly listed company, you could try buying some shares and turning up at the AGM to ask questions about how they are dealing with climate risk. If you don’t, more of your co-workers may be interested in the climate than you think: polls show a great majority of people in most countries are concerned about the climate crisis. Dan from Tunbridge Wells asked: How will we make our nuclear power plants safe if this civilisation collapses? How does the hydrological cycle fit in? Can regenerative agriculture help? Regenerative agriculture can help, and sustainable agriculture can reduce emissions, aid carbon storage and feed the world more healthily, as recent reports by the Lancet and WRI, among others, have shown. As for hydrology, the effects of climate chaos are likely to be the wet areas of the world getting wetter and the dry areas getting drier, which is problematic. And as for nuclear power, some people - including the Guardian’s George Monbiot - see it as an uncomfortable but perhaps necessary way out of the climate crisis, but the very long-term storage of nuclear waste is a problem still to be solved. Kee from London asked: How much impact do long-haul flights have? How does the impact compare with, say, driving a car, or using electrical household appliances every day? My colleague Niko Kommenda recently published an excellent calculator showing what impact flights have. Whether you can offset the emissions from such flights by cutting carbon in other aspects depends on how many flights you take and where to. Niko from Germany asked: What is your estimate on how much renewables capacity Europe needs to build to meet its climate targets? My rough guess is between 30-40 GW per year, that would equal about 600 wind turbines per month, that’s quite a challenge (other forms of renewables are of course available). The International Energy Agency and the European Environment Agency are the best sources. Stephen from Cheshire asked: Whatever happened to the plant a tree in ‘73 campaigns I grew up with in the 1970s? Surely now is a good time to kickstart this again with planting in every public space and private garden. Fruit trees also feed us and wildlife. I have planted hundreds of trees over the years. Ultimately, however, the planet is simply overcrowded. My wife and I chose to be child free so we’ve done our bit... I love the plant a tree in 73 campaign as I used to have some of the stickers! Planting trees is part of the UK government response but so far targets have been missed. Today my colleague Rowena Mason reports on an NHS tree planting campaign. Thousands of French youngsters skipped school to march through Paris. Claude Guyon, a cinema decorator and sculptor, was dressed as a Brazilian tribal leader and carried a “sacred rattle”. He said: I’m here to represent the guardians of the Earth from north and South America. The tribal leader, who is a woman, gave me this headdress so I could be here today as an ambassador for her. Primary school headteacher Scott McFarlane took the morning off work to attend the Middlesborough climate strike with his wife, who is also a teacher, and his nine-year-old son, who is a pupil at his school. During the strike, dozens of protesters staged a “die in” in the North Yorkshire town’s Centre Square – lying on the pavement for seven minutes to illustrate the rate at which it is believed species are becoming extinct. McFarlane allowed other children at Stokesley primary academy to take part in the strikes if they wished, giving them an “education other than at school” mark on the register. While not many took up the offer, he said the fact that so many young people seemed to be engaged with environmental activism had given him hope. “I think Greta Thunberg’s an absolute idol. We’ve got kids at school who last year were coming dressed as Ariana Grande, but have now changed their hairstyles to look like Greta,” said McFarlane. McFarlane, who is a member of Extinction Rebellion Teesside, said he and his son would be striking from the school next month for XR’s October Rebellion in London. “I am genuinely scared for the future of the human race. Not in the distant future but soon. We have to act,” he said. “If there’s any further action like today, I will always let children have the day off. Not everybody agrees and I’m not asking them to, really. But I hope our example is one that people are starting to take on board.” Of all the venues globally that will host climate strike protests today, none can surpass Miami Beach for poignancy. Florida’s poster-city for sea level rise will sink under seven feet of water by the end of the century, if scientists’ predictions are realised, and already it takes only a high tide and a rainy day to send floodwaters surging inland. These dark clouds are why student climate activists from all over South Florida will gather at Miami Beach city hall this morning to reinforce their message that more needs to be done. At the most recent youth strike in May, barely four dozen waved placards and called for action - but today students will walk out of their South Florida schools and assemble there in their hundreds to highlight the urgency of the moment. Gabriella Marchesani, a Miami high school senior and an organiser of today’s rally: We’re told by the adults, ‘what you’re doing is a good thing, keep up the great work’. But it shouldn’t be just ‘oh, keep doing what you’re doing’, it should be ‘let me see what I can do to help you. How can I be a climate voter? How can I switch my lifestyle to be more sustainable? How can I lower my carbon footprint?’ She adds: We want this to be that historic moment that we look back on and say that was the day we got it changed. That was the day we were able to make people hear us, and create legislation and address this crisis. Andreu from Valencia, Spain asked: According to scientists, the “natural evolution” of the sun will lead to major climate change here on the Earth. So, what role, if any, does solar activity (solar winds, solar flares, sunspots) play in climate change right now? Are we missing something, have we miscalculated or does the sun have nothing to do with climate change at this point? Changes in the sun’s activity are not causing the climate change and global heating we are currently experiencing. They are caused by human actions, chiefly burning fossil fuels and changing land use, as successive reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have conclusively shown. Alex from Warwickshire asked: The electrification of small vehicles is seen as an achievable near-term step towards cutting emissions, but to replace a significant fraction of the current fossil-fuelled fleet would presumably require a drastic increase in the global extraction and use of ‘rare-earth’ metals for battery manufacture. How well do we currently understand the environmental impact of such a change and are there more sustainable battery technologies on the horizon? In the long term, availability of rare earths will be an important issue but it is equally important to note that there are no serious current supply problems as the manufacturing rates show. Batteries are one of the biggest areas of research and there are multiple avenues being explored, from nanotechnology to graphene and even aluminium, a common metal, as an alternative. Hydrogen fuel cells are another possibility. Tracey from Ross-on-Wye asked: Guy McPherson, an environmental scientist, argues that, due to the protection from the sun’s heat attributable to global dimming, if we cut carbon emissions the Earth will heat faster, and the planet will be uninhabitable for any species within a decade. Why is this theory not spoken about or even mentioned by any other leading environmental voices? Because it is wrong. The dimming of light from the sun owing to aerosols does have a small effect, but as you seem to be pointing out, many of the aerosols are soot, or black carbon. Black carbon actually adds to warming, especially when it falls on snow. Removing black carbon and other short-lived climate pollutants could reduce temperatures by as much as 0.5C as work by Durwood Zaelke and others has clearly shown. You can share your questions now via our form here, or in the comments below but please @Fiona so that they’ll be easier for us to find. Lyra Harris, six, from Islington, London, protesting outside 10 Downing Street, said: Stop this nonsense. Our Earth is getting too hot. We have to act now for everyone. It’s not just for humans, climate change harms the animals too. Over in Greece it is pupils who have been leading protests with hundreds pouring into Athens’ main plaza, Syntaga square. Ariadni, 15, holding a hand-drawn placard of a weeping planet under a halo of heat said: I am here to raise awareness. There’s not much time left. This is global. People need to be informed and they need to act now. Maria Makarem, the 16-year-old who had helped organise the strike said the protesters had ended up in front of the parliament to ram home the message that urgent times call for urgent measures. “They have to understand, all the politicians in there, that we are the new generation and we want change,” she said, her own placard proclaiming: “Our world, our future, our choice.” Yiannis Marangakis and Foivos Anastadiades, both aged 10 and both taken out of class by their mothers Daniella and Myrtia to attend the protest, had an even simpler message: “The earth is very important to us. We have to save it.” This shows the scale of the march in Edinburgh: Ian Mantgani, 36, is striking in London today. He says: We have to put pressure on our employers, MPs and friends. We need a new power grid and electric cars on the road or we’re toast. Keep pressuring those in power for concrete change and keep pressuring them when they give you mealy mouthed answers. I believe that’s the best way forward for change.” Chris from South Africa asked: Why are we not seeing a rise in sea levels? Could it perhaps partly be due to the fact that rainfall across the SAHEL region that is rapidly greening is 40m olympic swimming pools up on a few years ago? We are seeing a rise in sea levels. And sea levels alone are not the biggest problem: storm and tidal surges are much worse when sea levels are even slightly higher, with the power to overtop our sea defences. Desertification is increasing in many parts of Africa, with climate change one of the reasons but not the only one (overgrazing and land use changes also play a major role). Artur from Crewe asked: Are we prepared to do real things to tackle climate change? We can say do this or do that but our use of social media takes significant resources. The cheap food, cheap technology, new mobiles released every year is driven by customers not the other way around so how many are actually genuinely prepared to change their way of life? People are increasingly understanding that lifestyle changes are necessary, from veganism and flexitarian diets to changing our travel habits. Renewable energy such as wind and solar is already cheaper or on a par with fossil fuels in many areas, and its deployment is increasing fast. A Guardian reader from London who wanted to remain anonymous asked: How democratic is it that a secondary school threatens their pupils with being expelled if they participate in today’s strike? How are we teaching ‘British values’ to our kids if in their school are not allowed to protest for something that fully impacts their future? What will it be next? Forbid them to participate in any human rights support act? Schools will make their own judgment, but engaging children with a subject of huge importance in scientific, political and historical terms might strike many teachers as a great opportunity. The climate emergency relates to chemistry, physics, biology, geography, history, social studies – you could probably even fit it into a load of other lessons too. Why not see this as an opportunity to engage pupils rather than turn them off? Derek from West Sussex asked: The UK has a good record of deploying offshore wind generation. What I don’t understand is why we aren’t deploying wave power and tidal power generation? We have the most coastline per head of any major European country. Wave power never stops, unlike wind, it is more energy dense than wind, and it could have other benefits like reducing coastal erosion. Tidal power solutions likewise are always available and energy dense. There is an ecological cost in habitats but a balance is needed here. Do we really think that the ecological cost of a tidal barrier is worse than a nuclear power station? There is an ecological cost to farmland too, but we need to eat, so we cut down all the forests we had in medieval times to make room for agriculture. We just need to make some room for power generation too. The UK is a world leader on offshore wind, as the latest green power auctions show. Wave and tidal power have proved more difficult, in the latter case partly owing to the changes that would be required to landscape a tidal lagoon. But as public subsidy is less needed for wind and solar as prices have come down, it might become possible to spend more of it on wave and tidal power – they may prove cheaper than the high costs agreed to by the government for nuclear energy. The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, received a warm applause at the city’s climate protest when he gave a speech pledging that “fracking is the past, it is not the future” – but by far the biggest cheers went to a 10-year-old girl called Lillia who took to the stage next. The local schoolgirl, with a high-pitched Mancunian accent and fluorescent ear-defenders tied to her backpack, gave a rousing speech taking aim at politicians for their “lies” – before turning directly to Burnham. Lies, when you don’t count the airport in the emission figures! Lies, when we have 1,200 air pollution related deaths in Manchester just last year – but they plan to build a huge car park right next door to a school in Ancoats. Lies when the pension funds of Manchester are still investing £1.4bn in fossil fuel companies … Lies, in April the mayor Andy Burnham, when I asked if he would support us. I asked for more than publicity stunt pictures. Where’s the action? To huge cheers, she continued: Today I woke up to the images around the world of a million people striking and my heart lifted because I knew we weren’t alone in our fight. Thank you for coming out to support us. Thank you for having the courage to fight for our future! To adults I say, you have the power to vote you need to keep amplifying our voices. We the youth cannot wait until we are old enough - we need action now. Numbers at Berlin‘s Klimastreik have reached 100,000, it has just been announced. Carola Rackete, the SeaWatch Captain who was arrested in Italy several weeks ago addressed Berlin’s Klimastreik, to huge applause. She told them: We adults are responsible for the fact that the Earth is dying ... we should not be under the illusion that our individual actions can ... turn the situation around. She paid tribute to “the children and young people who have campaigned tirelessly for over a year ... and managed to get this issue to the top of the political agenda”. She said temperatures could be expected to rise by 4-6C by the end of the century. Extinction Rebellion, to which she belongs, was telling the truth when it predicted the collapse of human civilisation as a result. We can no longer stop global heating, she said, “it’s too late”, but we can “reduce greenhouse gases with immediate effect”. Sarah from Cardiff asked: What are the advantages people will see and experience through the changes we need to make due to climate change? For example, I believe cycling rather than driving will make people healthier, shopping locally rather than online increases daily interactions. Do you envisage the activists and media managing to put this side of the crisis across? Cleaning up greenhouse gases has myriad beneficial side effects, including cleaner air as diesel and petrol cars are taken off the roads in favour of electric vehicles, public transport and walking or cycling. Our knowledge of the harms of air pollution has expanded dramatically in the past few years: we now know air pollutants can be found in all human organs, and it is linked not only to respiratory problems and heart disease but also dementia, developmental problems and miscarriage. In some ways, the cleaning up of air pollution is easier to explain than climate chaos because people can see and feel air pollution more clearly than the link between invisible carbon dioxide and extreme weather, and increasingly air pollution campaigners are making the link with climate benefits from moving away from coal and diesel in particular. Louis from London asked: Today is wonderful to see - the energy and passion - but how can you be sure we haven’t left it too late ? There is a climate doomosphere - I’m thinking Paul Beckwith, Peter Wadhams and others who suggest overwhelming events in the next decade or two. Can they be dismissed as fringe cranks? Climate change is a problem for today, not the distant future, and the effects are already being seen, as we have extensively reported. But there is still time to stave off the worst effects if we take action on emissions now. The IPCC has said emissions must be effectively zero by around mid-century to hold the world to no more than 1.5C of warning, and every effort to bring down emissions helps towards that goal. But there are scary things we know less about: tipping points, which could cause runaway heating to take hold. These include Arctic sea ice melt, which reveals dark sea instead of reflective ice, creating more warming, and the melting permafrost that releases methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, in a vicious circle. Some have suggested we turn our efforts to adapting to climate change instead of cutting emissions. But adapting without cutting emissions is like trying to mop up an overflowing sink with the taps still running. The truth is we need to do both, and urgently. You can share your questions now via our form here, or in the comments below but please @Fiona so that they’ll be easier for us to find. Just to stand back from the breathless enthusiasm of the protests for a moment, our environment editor, Damian Carrington, has been pulling out a series of charts that highlight the scale of the challenge - and the beginnings of some solutions. Perhaps the most important one is this: the planet’s average temperature started a steady climb two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population has risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense. We have also tried to capture this alarming rise in temperatures in a startling piece of music. Alas, it is not a banger, so is unlikely to become a global anthem for the Friday strikes movement. But it’s not all gloom and doom. The three charts below show the progress we have made, in renewable energy generation, electric vehicle production, and battery development. Today’s climate strikes highlight a crucial fact: that our actions in the next few years will decide the world’s future, and whether we can avoid the worst ravages of global heating or succumb to climate chaos. We must effectively eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, and nurture the natural world enough to absorb the remainder, by mid-century to avoid a future of catastrophic and irreversible climate chaos. Extreme weather is already driving 2 million people a week to seek humanitarian aid, and that is set to rise to 150 million in the next decade alone.

The US is set to stage its largest ever day of protest over the climate crisis, with tens of thousands of students set to be joined by adults in abandoning schools and workplaces for a wave of strikes across the country. Climate strikes will take place in more than 1,000 locations, with major rallies in New York, Washington DC, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Miami. The young strikers’ totemic figure, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, will take part in the New York walkout and will speak to massed protesters in Manhattan. Authorities in New York City have announced that its student population of 1.1 million is allowed to skip school in order to attend the strikes. Dozens of companies, including Patagonia and Ben and Jerry’s, will support striking staff, with major unions also backing the walkouts. Dulce Belen Ceballos Arias, an 18-year-old from San Francisco, said she will be striking because “I want children of my own and I want them to have a better life than me. I don’t want that to be taken away by climate change.” Students in Boston will also be excused school, with a crowd of 10,000 expected to assemble. “We are excited to disrupt business as usual, to demand a Green New Deal,” said Audrey Maurine Xin Lin, an 18-year-old organizer in Boston, in reference to the resolution put forward by progressive Democrats to enact a second world war-style mobilization to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. A big difference on today’s march in London is the presence of trade union activists alongside young people and their parents, writes Guardian environment correspondent Matthew Taylor, Graham Petersen, from the UCU lecturers’ union and member of the green jobs alliance, said unions had to take a lead in the climate fight. This is going to be the defining issue for future generations and if we are not involved now how are we going to be relevant to the young people here today when they go into work. Trade unions around the world are backing today’s protests and Petersen said it was “about time” they engaged in the climate crisis. In the UK it is difficult because people have their hands full with austerity and precarious jobs but unions are starting to realise that if we get the climate justice policies right we can tackle not just the climate but also a wider social justice issues. Lois Borny has been speaking to young people on the London march, including student Noemie, who told her: It’s depressing knowing you’re waking up to not such a bright future. The climate crisis has always been in the back of my mind, but I always used to be a bit of a pessimist ... now that the movement has gained traction you get the feeling that you can change something. When asked what she thinks about the fact children are leading the movement she says: It almost seems like a game for them [the politicians]. They aren’t taking it seriously. This isn’t for fun or just for the sake of it. It’s real and urgent. It is Nazreen’s first day in London, having arrived from Malaysia yesterday. The 22-year-old, who is studying political philosophy, said: I’m happy this is happening because at home we have a big haze problem, because of forests being burned in Borneo. Nazreen says that if we were in Borneo, from where we are standing (by the stage) the Houses of Parliament would be unrecognisable from the haze. Borneo is burning. It has one of the oldest rainforest in the world and half of it is gone. We are really proud of our rainforests, but what is there to be proud of when it is gone? He says that it is good children are leading the movement, because it is allowing them to see “what is happening in the real world”. A small but noisy crowd gathered in the financial district of Sandton in Johannesburg, outside the offices of Sasol, a huge South African energy and chemical company. Natalie Kapsosideris, 16, said: We don’t really have a way out of this. The future looks really dismal at this point. There’s not going to be a lot of food available, there will be droughts, floods, natural disasters. The fact that Sasol gets away with stealing our future from us ... and it’s all because they want to make money. Tariro Banganayi, 18, a student at Sacred Heart college, said: It’s important that I lend my voice to this cause ... a lot of people who aren’t as privileged as I am don’t have the opportunity to speak out against these sorts of issues, who live where the air is unbreathable, where toxic waste is dumped in rivers, those people don’t have a voice to speak out ... Also I am here to educate people about these issues and to get as much information from as many different places as I can ... I am going to try to diversify the way that I raise awareness ... I am going to use my social media a lot more effectively, I am going to centre my conversations with my friends, I am going to bring it up at the dinner table with my family ... because if every person tells one person then we can tell everybody. Crowds of students in Delhi are blocking the road near to Lodhi Gardens, chanting: “What do we want? Climate justice.” “You can’t run away from climate change,” reads one sign. Delhi is one of 21 cities predicted to run out of groundwater by 2020, according to the Indian government’s policy thinktank, Niti Aayog. It is also one of the most polluted cities in the world.“The lungs of an 11 year old have black spots on them,” Shivam, a law student, says. “This is why we have to change things now.” In Exeter, the protest is in full swing. Leon Hayton-Twigg, 11, (pictured below with his brother Lucas and his friend Ossian Finn, 10) says: “We have come here to show the people there’s a problem and we want it to stop.” More of the protest signs from the Exeter strikes ... Archie Graham, 15, and his friends were supposed to be in school today but felt compelled to join Manchester’s climate strike, while still rocking their school ties. He said: What’s the point in going to school if we can’t use that knowledge in the future because there won’t be a future for us. His friend, Sam Pembroke, added: It’s really important because there’s no second chance - this is the only chance we have. If this carries on it’s just going to end. Their friend, Santana Daza, 15, said they might get in trouble for bunking off school but it was worth it: I think it definitely does make a difference. They encourage us to learn about it but we all know about climate change - we don’t need to be educated about it, it’s more about taking action. Herding a group of six placard-carrying children, Kitty Rostron, 40, said her seven-year-old daughter Margot watches Greta Thunberg on YouTube and asks: Why is this happening? Why is Boris Johnson not doing anything? Why do people not make good decisions about climate change? Her friend Karine Joshua, 39, said it was important to bring children along so they understand what is happening to the environment: There’s a real crisis right now, not in 10, 20 years time. Action is needed now so we’re trying to teach them if we come together and show our support hopefully we can make a change. Here is a selection of images from other climate strikers: Hello, this is Haroon Siddique taking over from Sarah. The video below shows a small proportion of the staff who walked out at the Guardian. If you want to get in touch, please tweet me @Haroon_Siddique The Guardian live blog will be closing from noon (12:00 BST) until 12.30 BST as we are participating in a solidarity strike. When it resumes, my colleague Haroon Siddique will be taking over. In an email to staff explaining why we are walking out for 30 minutes, Guardian editor in chief, Katharine Viner, said: We fully support this global campaign, and we want colleagues to feel able to show solidarity with campaigners - so we are happy to support this activity across the organisation. Sadiq Khan is not the only mayor who has come out strongly behind today’s strikes. The leaders of Paris, New York City, Los Angeles and Copenhagen released a strongly worded joint statement overnight. Our shared planet is facing a climate emergency. The science is clear that, without urgent action, sea levels will rise further, extreme temperatures will become the norm and climate-related disasters will inflict even greater damage. We are making historic investments to prepare and adapt our cities to the inevitable consequences of emissions already released into the atmosphere. When your house is on fire, somebody needs to sound the alarm. Young people in our cities, displaying incredible maturity and dignity are doing just that. School children are taking to the streets, drawing attention to the terrifying threat that climate breakdown poses to their future. Young people recognise just how unfair climate change is. Those who have generated the least greenhouse gas emissions, including the poorest, most disadvantaged and youngest in society, will suffer the worst effects of a rapidly changing global climate. They are right to sound the alarm, and they are right to demand action that tackles climate change and inequality simultaneously. On September 20, these inspiring young leaders have called for adults to join them for a Global Climate Strike. We have an opportunity to show, not only that we hear their message, but that they have inspired us to act even faster. As mayors, our greatest responsibility is to protect the lives and wellbeing of those that live in our cities. As adults, our obligation is to leave the world in a better state for our children than we inherited it. Fortunately, the evidence is increasingly clear that transforming our cities to prevent the climate crisis will also make them healthier, more equitable, safer and ultimately better places to live. The cities of the future will enjoy affordable and reliable public transport; the air will be free from poisonous toxins; buildings will generate zero emissions thanks to ultra-high efficient heating, cooling and insulation; waste will be recycled or reused, and all of this will be powered by abundant renewable energy. We have a unique opportunity to bestow a bright and hopeful legacy to the next generation. This is the future we want. That is why we are supporting the Global Climate Strikes. Mayors around the world, working through C40 Cities, are committed to deliver on the Paris Agreement and taking action to peak their emissions as our cities already have and bring them down sharply by 2030. Many businesses, investors, labour groups, faith leaders and local communities share our urgency. But we cannot tackle the climate crisis alone. We need science-based action from every sector of the economy, and we expect greater leadership from nation states. Young people are telling us that the climate emergency demands an emergency response. We couldn’t agree more. It was signed by the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, as well as the mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, and the lord mayor of Copenhagen, Frank Jensen. Lovely thread by Mary Hamilton on what to do if you cannot make the strikes today but still want to make an effort to reduce your waste. Ruby, 10, and Dougie, 7, (pictured below), were the first to start striking outside the Scottish parliament, back on a cold dark 11 January. Back then it was just them and the police. Seeing how big the movement has become, Ruby says she feels “happy and proud”. “Amazing,” says Dougie. Staff at the Guardian will be striking today at noon, so there will be no posts on the live blog between 12:00 BST and 12:30 BST. The fashion industry is a fossil-fuel-guzzling operation, as many of our clothes are made from petroleum-based textiles such as polyester. Even natural fibres such as cotton have a huge carbon footprint and require a large portion of the world’s pesticides. In a bid to solve this disastrous environmental equation, scientists and designers are creating completely new textiles from fast-growing, carbon-sucking organisms such as micro- and macro-algae, mycelium (elements of fungus), bacteria and fermented yeast. These new biotechnologies efficiently convert sunlight and CO2 into mass raw materials, suck carbon out of the atmosphere and pave the way to a carbon-negative wardrobe. Tens of thousands of young people and adults are already streaming into the streets around Westminster in central London, and organisers say the protest, which was formally due to start at 11am, already dwarfs previous school strike demonstrations. Among those gathered in the sunshine were a group of medics. Isobel Braithwaite, a public health doctor from London, said they were there because the climate crisis was also a health crisis: “From heatwaves to floods; food shortages to devastating storms, these things are having a huge impact on health now and it is going to get worse.” She said it was time adults listened to young people who had taken the lead in addressing this crisis. “We need urgent widespread action and it must happen quickly... we are running out of time.” Glorious scenes in Edinburgh as thousands of children, parents, students and musicians gather at the Meadows for the Climate Strike. “This is our Earth and our future. We need to take care of it,” said 11-year-old Leila Koita, pictured here with friends Eilidh Tedesco, Norah Turner, Tilly Torrie, Megan Berger and Nan Zhang. Norah’s mum, Jo Spencely, says she hasn’t been on a demo for decades but she is here to show support. “I’m massively concerned about their future. I almost can’t bear to read about the climate. It’s so scary.” The march sets off at 11:30am and will pass through Edinburgh city centre and end with a rally in front of the Scottish parliament. As in London, police have imposed restrictions, in this case by refusing permission for the marchers to walk down Princes Street. As elsewhere, this is just the start of a week of climate action. On Saturday, activists will stage a “die in”, Monday will be a “day of disruption”, musicians will join a “Love the Planet festival” on Wednesday, and there’ll be another rally outside parliament the following day. Even Emmeline Pankhurst has joined in the protests in Manchester. A statue of the suffragette hero has donned a bright orange lifejacket and has a placard that asks: “Ready for rising sea levels to reach this height?” The stunt was the idea of Katie Bradshaw and Ryan Griffiths, both 31, who described themselves as first-protesters who felt the need to act today. “Emmeline still carries that Mancunian spirit of standing up for what she believes in and great causes,” said Griffiths. “Climate change is so important and we think it’s an issue she would be at the forefront of if she were around today.” Bradshaw added: “We’ve got to do our bit, even if it’s just putting some signs up and making people realise we need to look after our planet. If she was around today she’d be supporting it.” Friends of the Earth, an international network of environmental organisations in 74 countries, is calling on people across Britain to join young people in striking against climate change. Muna Suleiman, a Friends of the Earth campaigner, said: Most of us want to fix the climate crisis. And it can be done. But we need our politicians to act. Climate breakdown is already hurting people around the world, with many of those who have contributed least to the crisis being subjected to the harshest impacts. “And right when we need our leaders to step up, they continue to let us down. From filling the skies with more planes, to backing fracking in the UK and funding oil and gas projects abroad. “That’s why we’re standing shoulder to shoulder with young people to call on our politicians to deliver emergency climate action now. And we’re asking everyone to join us.” Bob Dylan’s Blowin’ in the Wind kicks off Berlin’s “Klimastreik” to huge cheers from the thousands gathered, although no official estimates of the numbers attending are available yet. Contender for banner of the day is: ‘Grandpa what is a snowman?’ Hundreds of people are streaming through the portals of the Brandenburg Gate, through the Tiergarten Park and from every direction onto Platz des 18. März. Lots of Berlin’s young are here with the blessing of their parents and teachers, though many have defied their schools to be here. At 1pm, the student strikers are planning to let off alarm clocks across the UK, and are encouraging businesses to set off their fire alarms at the same time in support. Jake Woodier, the campaign co-ordinator at UK Student Climate Network, said: “Young people across the world have taken the lead in highlighting the need for urgent climate action over the past year. “They are calling for adults to join them for the global climate strike, just three days before the UN climate action summit to pressure our governments to act to tackle the climate crisis. “Raise the Alarm will help draw attention to the climate emergency in workplaces across the breadth of the UK,” Woodier said. Students at Torquay Girls’ Grammar school have made a video about climate change. What’s the carbon footprint of my trip? The square outside Manchester’s grand central library has been taken over by a sea of people carrying homemade placards and chanting. Hundreds of those gathered sang “Whose planet? Our planet!” with scores of children among the protesters. Nellie Jacobs, 10, and her mother Helen said they were motivated to take part in the global climate strike after their hometown Whaley Bridge was evacuated earlier this month when it was deluged with months-worth of rain in a short period, causing a dam to burst and dozens of properties to flood. Nice cartoon just in from reader Jesse Leonard. You get the picture, literally. Possibly the first time the climate crisis has been likened to a purple piano, but why not? If there are any other artists out there with climate emergency sketches/drawings/cartoons, send them in via this link. The Kichwa tribe in the Sarayaku region of the Amazon in Ecuador believe in the “living forest”, where humans, animals and plants live in harmony. They are fighting oil companies who want to exploit their ancestral land. A delegation of indigenous people are at the Paris COP21 climate conference to make sure their voices are heard. Can they win their battle? Tweeting a photo from a climate strike, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: Kate Connolly, the Guardian and Observer’s Berlin correspondent, has been out this morning in the German capital. Strikes are planned for at least seven Nigerian cities, such as Lagos, which is clogged by mountains of toxic waste including thousands of tons of e-waste from the EU, particularly the UK and Germany. There will be a protest in Port Harcourt, capital of the country’s oil-producing region, whose residents and their possessions have been covered in soot for the past few years, believed to be the result of destroying illegal oil refineries. There will also be two protests against a proposed coal plant in San Pedro in Ivory Coast, while in Ghana, a group called Young Reporters for the Environment is leading a march from the city hall of the capital, Accra. Next Friday, there will be a demonstration in Kumasi, the capital of Ghana’s Ashanti region. Ghana is losing its rainforests faster than any other country, with a 60% increase in primary forest loss from 2017 to 2018. In Senegal, there are marches in Rufisque and Thies this Friday, a climate camp in Kaolack on Sunday, followed by a demonstration against a new coal plant in Bargny, and a march in the capital, Dakar on the 27th. Air pollution in Dakar is causing more and more respiratory problems, in large part because of “dirty”, sulphur-laden diesel. Environmental activists Greta Thunberg and George Monbiot have helped produce a short film highlighting the need to protect, restore and use nature to tackle the climate crisis. Berlin’s main transport line, the S-Bahn, has virtually ground to a halt this morning due to a major engineering breakdown leaving many protesters stranded and unable to reach the protest. Participants are being encouraged to take their bikes instead. Many have pointed out the irony. Meanwhile, at the Brandenburg Gate, scene of the main protest in Berlin that is due to kick off just before noon, protesters have been organised into neat blocks. Apart from the huge crowds of protesters, the other uplifting piece of climate news today is that onshore wind has just became the cheapest source of energy in the UK. Industry analysts can’t believe how quickly the price has fallen. This shows the transition away from fossil fuels is much more affordable than people dared hope five years ago. On the business side of things, also encouraging to note efforts by companies with a green reputation, who seem to be competing to do more by selling less. The Patagonia outdoor clothing store will close all its European outlets today and next Friday so staff can join the protests. Ben &amp; Jerry’s and Lush also shutting today. Burton, the winter sports chain, is giving workers a paid day off to join the strike and have halted online sales for 24 hours. The company’s webpage today reads “Closed for business. Open for action. Let’s protect our playground.” In London, where big crowds are expected to gather near Westminster from 11am, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has thrown his weight behind today’s strikes. He told the Guardian this morning he fully supports schools across the city who are “working with pupils and allowing them time, without sanction, to peacefully and lawfully join the strikes today”. “It is unbelievable that we need strike action for the future of our planet to be taken seriously by government’s around the world,” he said. “I fully support the thousands of young people peacefully and lawfully protesting around the country today who feel so strongly about the climate change emergency and I share their frustration. The stark reality is we are running out of time for meaningful change. The climate crisis is one of the very biggest challenges we face – I have declared a climate emergency in London – and governments around the world are failing to take the action we need.” Berlin has kicked off its Fridays For Future this morning with road blockades, cycle rallies and a demonstration in front of the cuboid chancellery of Angela Merkel, where about 40 young people have unfurled a banner asking: “Return of the climate chancellor?” It’s an appeal to Merkel, once environment minister, to live up to the reputation she is seen to have squandered over everything from her support of the car industry to her refusal to back a phase-out of brown coal mining. They are keen to pressurise her coalition government ahead of the launch of its much-awaited package of climate emergency measures which the cabinet has spent the night negotiating and is due to launch early this afternoon. The protesters are chanting: ”Wir sind hier, wir sind laut, weil Ihr uns die Zukunft raubt.“ –“We are here and we are loud, because you’re stealing our future”. The main protest at the Brandenburg Gate is due to start just before noon. When there is protest in Berlin, there is usually also techno, and from 3pm a “Rave Rebellion” march will depart from Potsdamer Platz square, under the motto “No Future No Dancefloor”. Extinction Rebellion has announced plans to block traffic at strategic points “where it will hurt drivers” around the capital. Elsewhere, 400 protests have been announced across the country, which will likely attracts adults as well as children. An umbrella organisation that includes organisations such as “Psychologists for Future”, “Entrepreneurs for Future” and “Grandparents for Future” has called for people to join in, as has the services union Verdi and the German Protestant Church. “We stand side by side with Fridays for Future”, said Annette Kurschus, the president of the Protestant Church of Westphalia, “Planet Earth does not belong to us, it has only been entrusted in our care”. Germany has two faces when it comes to the environment: the country that prides itself in its high recycling rates, phasing out nuclear power and pioneering renewable energies is still the world’s sixth biggest pollutant, with 865m tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2018. Borne out of this realisation, much of the recent debate in the country has focused on the phase-out of the country’s approximately 130 smoke-belching coal plants. The government wants to close them down by 2038 – too soon for many unions, especially in the coal-rich east, and too late for climate activists galvanised by Fridays for Future. In Europe’s “car nation”, air pollution through exhaust fumes is another contentious issue, with some cities having introduced driving bans for diesel cars last year. The Fridays for Future protests have had a tangible effect on the political climate, with several polls earlier this year showing the Green party emerging as the strongest political force in the country. Many other parties have tried to copy its message, with even the arch-conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union calling for a coal phase-out by 2030, bans on plastic bags and new wind farms. Angela Merkel’s coalition government is expected to announce a plan for tackling climate change, rumoured to involve €75bn of investment by 2030, just in time for Friday’s climate strike. The planet’s average temperature started a steady climb two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population has risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense. Heatwaves, droughts and floods are likely in the future if urgent action isn’t taken to stop climate change, experts warn. It comes as strikes take place across the world on Friday, calling on governments to take immediate action on climate change. The demonstrates have been planned ahead of the landmark UN climate action summit in New York on 23 September World leaders will discuss how they can reduce their carbon emissions with the aim of stopping global temperature rise from exceeding 1.5°C under the Paris agreement. Prof Nigel Arnell, professor of climate system science at the University of Reading: This week, the United Nations general assembly will be discussing how to encourage countries to be more ambitious in their targets to reduce future emissions of greenhouse gases. It’s clear that increased effort is needed if we are to avoid significant climate change impacts. We’re probably already seeing some of the consequences of climate change – heatwaves, wildfires, unusually slow and intense hurricanes – and things will get much worse if we continue on our current path of increasing emissions. We recently published a study showing the number of people exposed to major heatwaves would increase from 330 million per year now to up to 8 billion per year in 2050 – just 30 years away - the number people exposed to drought would increase from 400 million per year to up to 1 billion per year, and the number of people affected by flooding from major rivers would increase from 15 million per year now to up to 100 million per year. Reducing emissions now will reduce these impacts, but at the same time we also need to increase efforts to enhance resilience to the impacts that are inevitable following our emissions so far.” Keith Shine, regius professor of meteorology and climate science at the University of Reading: We are coming to the end of another decade. Each of the past four decades has, when averaged over the whole planet, been 0.1 to 0.2 degrees celsius warmer than the decade before; carbon dioxide levels have continued their relentless rise; and methane levels have grown much more rapidly than in the previous decade. Unless things start to change markedly over the coming decade, it is going to get harder and harder to meet the goals of the UN’s Paris agreement on climate change.” Protests taking place in Johannesburg, South Africa’s biggest city and capital of Gauteng province. The Guardian environment journalist Fiona Harvey will be on hand to answer any questions you have about the climate crisis between 1.30 and 2.30pm BST. You can share your questions now via our form here, or in the comments below but please @Fiona so that they’ll be easier for us to find. With hundreds of thousands of children joining the global youth strike in cities around the globe, Extinction Rebellion UK said it stands in solidarity with all those striking. Caspar Hughes, 48, a Extinction Rebellion activist and father of school striker Max, 12, said: “Parents have left their children to clear up the climate and ecological crisis they have created. The youth should be out partying rather than protesting.” Extinction Rebellion activists will join the strikes in London and are holding their own actions and performances. At 2.30pm, a concert will take place in Victoria Tower Gardens, London. Jonathan Watts, the Guardian’s global environment editor, has written about young activists calling for north-south solidarity to the tackle climate emergency. He writes: While previous generations failed to notice the slowly shifting baselines, today’s young will watch the sixth great wave of extinction accelerate before their eyes. Due to warming seas and acid bleaching, coral reef systems will flicker out one by one. Species that existed for millions of years will tip into the abyss. Among those closest to the edge are the black rhino, the Chinese giant salamander, the Siberian crane, the Western gorilla, the Ganges dolphin, Bactrian camels, Pygmi sloths and Attenborough’s long-beaked echidna. Thousands of species of insects, plants and amphibians may go extinct before they are discovered. For many young people today, their only chance of seeing unspoiled beaches, savannahs, reefs and forests will be on old documentaries, 3D interactives or their grandparents’ holiday videos. Picturesque landscapes that defined communities and nations will be transformed. Read the full article here. The climate change strikes have spread far and wide, including the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific. By William Yang in Taipei In Taiwan, dozens of representatives from primary schools, high schools, and universities gathered in the capital, Taipei, to launch a petition called “Fridays for the future”. The aim of it is to press candidates in the upcoming presidential election to lay out concrete policies to mitigate climate change risks that Taiwan faces. Some held signs that said: “It’s getting hot in here” and “Don’t drop it like it’s hot”, after popular song lyrics. Student activists spoke on stage, sharing their personal reasons for joining the global campaign to fight climate change. Wei Hung-zhan, aged nine, said: “Our future has been sacrificed by the older generation.” He asked: “Why hasn’t the older generation remembered to share earth’s resources with the next generation?” Students said that they planned to mail their petitions to each presidential candidate’s office and ask politicians to provide complete responses to their demands through online live-broadcasts in a month. The event’s organiser Chang Li-Wen said: “The only candidate who cares about Taiwan’s future is the person who proposes a complete set of climate change policies.” Over the next week, a series of climate change events are scheduled across Taiwan, including major rallies in Taipei and Kaohsiung on 27 September. People are taking to the streets in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, in southern Asia. Climate change in Bangladesh is a pressing issue. According to National Geographic, Bangladesh is one the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change. Millions are marching across the globe in what could be the largest climate protest in history. The first of the worldwide protests took place in Australia, where an estimated 300,000 people gathered at more than 100 rallies calling for action to guard against climate change. Other demonstrations were held across parts of Asia. In the UK, children and young people across the country will walk out of lessons and lectures They will be joined by hundreds of thousands of workers. The school strikes movement was sparked by the teenage activist Greta Thunberg who demonstrated at the Swedish parliament. The first large-scale protests of Friday’s “global climate strike” took place in Sydney and Canberra, with demonstrators calling on leaders in Australia, the world’s largest exporter of coal and liquid natural gas, to take more drastic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Similar rallies are planned for around the world, with 800 events set to take place in the US and 400 in Germany. The protests come ahead of a climate summit at the UN next week convened by the secretary general, António Guterres, to urge countries to up their climate efforts. Much stronger measures are needed across the globe to prevent temperature rises of more than 1.5C (2.7F) or 2C (3.6F) to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: “It is unbelievable that we should need global strike action for the future of our planet to be taken seriously. The stark reality is that our climate is changing rapidly and we are running out of time to address it. “I hope governments around the world who are failing to take action hear the voices of millions of people, young and old, unified in their call for action to save our planet. Our future depends on it.” The level of CO2 has been rising since the industrial revolution and is at its highest for about 4 million years. The rate of the rise is even more striking – the fastest for 66m years – with scientists saying we are in “uncharted territory”. Strikes are also taking place in Uganda, east Africa. They are also under way in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital. Events in Italy will be held throughout the coming week, culminating with demonstrations in more than 100 cities on Friday 27 September. “Italian schools only went back last week and we needed some time to plan and mobilise, so we voted to hold the major demonstrations on the 27th,” said David Wicker, a representative of the Turin branch of Fridays for Future Italia. More than 470,000 people took part in the first global climate strike in Italy on 15 March and a similar number is expected to join next week’s demonstrations. Though Italy’s greenhouse gas emissions have been decreasing over the past decade, the country was criticised this year by the European Climate Foundation for failing to provide an adequate plan to further reduce emissions and dependency on fossil fuels. Activists are hoping Italy’s new left-leaning coalition will take concrete action and fulfil its pledge of making environmental issues a priority. “They need to entirely cut the subsidies and investments going to the fossil fuel industry,” said Wicker, aged 14. “And we need to start immediate investment in green energy to help society have an ecological transition.” Young activists for Fridays for Future in Turin, one of the most polluted cities in Europe, have been holding the local authority to account over its environmental policies. “The town hall gives us feedback every two months and we give this information to scientists, who will say whether anything is really being done or not,” said Wicker. Emmanuel Macron’s government has set the object of making France carbon-neutral by 2050. However, greenhouse gas emissions have risen in the country since 2015, and in 2017 were said to be 7% above official targets. Climate change activists say Macron has gone back on promises. Sceptics doubt claims the government would renovate 500,000 buildings a year to use less energy and are angry at what is seen as bowing to the powerful agriculture lobby over pesticides. Meanwhile, it is the mainstream centre-right that has proven most resistant to Greta Thunberg’s appeals. The announcement that the Swedish teenager was to address the French assemblée nationale in July provoked outbursts of indignation and insults from opposition MPs. “Don’t expect me to be applauding a prophet in short trousers,” tweeted one. Others appealed for a boycott of her address. Le Monde pointed out French climate change sceptics were no longer attacking the message but the messenger and pointed to a “smear campaign” against Thunberg. After a slow start – an action that involved only 150 protesters in February in Nantes, reports suggest 56 organisations, ecology associations and social rights groups in France plan to demonstrate on Friday and Saturday. Youth for Climate France has organised a number of marches across France, and youngsters cave called on adults to join their action. They urged citizens: “Strike for the climate, which means above all leave your home, your office, your farm or your factory. Smashing the status quo requires the involvement of everyone: sportsmen and women, actors, teachers, food industry workers, psychologists, delivery people, it doesn’t matter. Whatever our position, we can all bring our stone to the building by refusing to accept the status quo.” In Paris, a march will begin at Place de la Nation and finish with a gathering at Parc de Bercy with workshops, conferences and “citizens’ meetings”. Several French unions including the powerful CFDT and CGT have issued calls for joint mobilisation. The action group Libérons le Louvre (Liberate the Louvre) is planning an action at the museum in protest at its long-standing partnership with the petrol group Total. Last year, black-clad members of the ecology association 350.org lay down in one of the Louvre’s galleries in protest at Total’s financial support of the museum, which dates back more than 20 years and which Louvre officials say has funded “exhibitions, renovations, educational and cultural activities and social actions”. Among the specific demands of French climate activists is that the French national education system introduces the teaching of the “environmental situation” and that France and the European Union officially declare a state of “climate, environmental and social” emergency. In France, a second day of protests on Saturday is planned to mark World CleanUp Day. A government minister said he cannot endorse children leaving school to take part in the climate strikes. Minister for business, energy and clean growth Kwasi Kwarteng told BBC Breakfast on Friday that he supported the “energy and creativity” of students but said time spent in school was “incredibly important”. When asked if the government was listening to the young protesters, he said: “Their voices are being heard ... What I do support is their energy, their creativity, and the fact that they have completely mastered these issues and take them very seriously. “I am not going to endorse people leaving school because I think education, time spent in school is incredibly important.” Here are the final exclusive Twitter figures for the climate strike in Australia. And this is what the school strike conversation has looked like on Twitter in the past three days leading up to today’s demonstrations: There is a lot planned for South Africa today, with demonstrations in Johannesburg, the commercial capital, on the south-eastern coast in Durban, in Pretoria, and in Cape Town, where there’ll be a march on parliament. Ayakha Melithafa, 17, said she would be joining the global strike in Cape Town.The march won’t start until early afternoon to allow students to finish most of the school day. “We’ll be marching to parliament to demand that the government take this issue seriously. It needs to declare a climate emergency here in South Africa, and a moratorium on coal, gas and oil mining licences. They have just ignored the problem so far,” Melithafa said. South Africa is one of the continent’s most developed economies and relies heavily on coal powered energy generation. It is building new and very big coal-fired power stations. “We have arranged with our teachers to leave early. it is up to us. We are the leaders of today. We don’t just want the system to change. We want a brand new system which will help us live sustainably with a bright new future,” Melithafa said. A roundup of what is happening around Europe on Friday: France Youth for Climate France has organised a number of marches across the country, and youngsters cave called on adults to join their action. In Paris, a march will begin at Place de la Nation and finish with a gathering at Parc de Bercy with workshops, conferences and “citizens’ meetings”. A second day of protests on Saturday are planned to mark World CleanUp Day. Italy More than 470,000 people took part in the first global climate strike in Italy on 15 March and a similar number is expected to join next Friday’s demonstrations. Germany Nearly 500 climate change demonstrations are planned across Germany on Friday. In Berlin, several demonstrations will take place throughout the day. The Fridays for Future gathering starts at noon at the Brandenburg Gate under the motto: “Everyone for the climate.” Organisers expect 10,000 people. Why is this week important? The strikes take place ahead of the UN general assembly and the climate action summit on 23 September. The summit will bring together governments, the private sector, civil society, local authorities and other international organisations to develop ambitious solutions. The world’s leaders will converge on New York for the assembly, where each is given an (unenforced) time limit of 15 minutes to speak in front of the green marble podium. Leaders occupy positions in the hall in alphabetical order by country name, usually with a different nation occupying the first seat each year. General assembly week usually makes news in the first day or two, when the US president and other powerful heads of state tend to have their moment, and then attention tends to tail off. For that reason, there is always some horse trading before the general assembly week, with prime ministers from big countries trying to swap speaking slots with presidents of small countries.

Activists on bicycles block traffic at Ernst-Reuter-Platz square in Berlin, Germany, as they take part in the global climate strike today. There will be a “special takeover” of Channel 4’s usual evening weather report today, as the network joins the world’s largest climate strike. The channel’s social media accounts will also join the walkout, bosses said, and will be going on strike between 9.30am and 5.30pm. Additionally, continuity announcers will share facts drawn from World Meteorological Organisation research throughout the day on Channel 4. No details were given on the nature of the weather forecast’s “special takeover”. Across Britain, thousands will take part in a march. Worldwide, campaigners say there are more than 3,400 events planned in 120 countries, with numbers taking part expected to surpass the estimated 1.6 million people who took part in the global strike in March. The outdoor apparel brand Patagonia is closing every store worldwide to encourage employees and customers to join the climate strike. Demonstrators from more than 150 countries are expected to put pressure on governments and decision-makers to do more about climate issues. The strikes come ahead of the United Nations climate change summit, which begins on 23 September. While in the UK and many other countries the strike is taking place today, in some countries such as Italy and the Netherlands the strike is happening next Friday, 27 September. Explaining the decision to close stores, Ryan Gellert, the general manager, EMEA, Patagonia, said: “The climate crisis is a human issue – affecting all of us ... As a global business, we will be closing our stores on 20 and 27 September, striking with the youth activists and calling for governments around the world to take action.” The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will today thank young people for educating the world about the climate crisis. Speaking at the youth climate strike, Corbyn will also criticise the prime minister, Boris Johnson, for calling global warming a “primitive fear”. He is expected to say: To the young people leading by example today here and across the world, I want to say thank you: thank you for educating us about the climate crisis and the emergency of species extinction and biodiversity loss. I know the situation can look bleak. We have a prime minister that has called global warming a ‘primitive fear without foundation’. The US president is a full-blown climate denier, putting our planet in danger by pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. And the Amazon is on fire, looted by big corporations with a Brazilian president watching on who doesn’t care. But when we see young people demanding urgent action, it’s an inspiration. When I see this movement growing – and it’s growing every day – I know we can tackle the climate emergency. The next Labour government will welcome your pressure and hear your demands for change. We will kick-start a green Industrial revolution and protect our planet, so it’s there to give life and joy to generations to come.” I will be picking up the live blog from the Guardian’s London offices. Please share any photographs or comments from where you are with me: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com I’ll be handing over the blog now to my colleague Sarah Marsh. There are still hundreds of places, thousands of students and hours of protest to come. Stay with us as the strikes sweep across Asia, Africa and Europe, and into the Americas. There will also be plenty more Australian news and analysis to come. To recap what we’ve seen across Asia and the Pacific today: At least 300,000 people have taken part in the largest climate strike across Australia yet. Melbourne’s event drew 100-150,000 people, and Sydney’s 80-100,000. Hobart’s 22,000 attendees made it Tasmania’s biggest ever strike action. Hundreds of regional centres joined in – from Alice Springs, Byron Bay and Katherine. As part of Guardian Australia’s coverage, the federal energy minister, the opposition energy spokesman and two of the country’s biggest energy companies took questions from students. In Vanuatu, the deputy prime minister spoke directly to the US, Canada, Australia, Japan and New Zealand as countries “to blame for this threat to our survival”. Protests also unfolded in the Solomon Islands, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, India, Pakistan and more. As our Australian coverage wraps up, here’s a great round-table discussion from some Brisbane students. They’ve finally started marching in Melbourne. And here’s our video wrap of the thousands on the streets today. More from Lisa Cox in Melbourne Edie Shepherd, a Wiradjuri and Noongar woman, spoke to the crowd earlier. She said she’d recently visited communities in the Lake Woods region in the NT, an area that gas companies are proposing to frack. “While Lake Woods usually flows with water, this time it ran dry,” she said. As well as students, unions are here today. Sam Davis is a member of the National Union of Workers and was here with his young family. “We want to show that climate justice is very important to workers as well. A lot of our workers are going to be impacted by climate change in the near future too,” he says. “The values we have as unionists are why I’ve brought my kids.” They’ve started in Mumbai: In Pakistan: While in Melbourne, the crowd is so big it’s going to take a few more hours: If you’re waking up in Europe and the UK, then here is where you can find a protest near you: And here’s First Dog’s last cartoon for today: The organisers of the School Strike For Climate have estimated more than 300,000 people took to the streets across Australia today. More than double the number of Australians who rallied at climate strikes in March came out today, with an estimated 100,000 in Melbourne, 80,000 in Sydney, 30,000 in Brisbane, 20,000 in Hobart, 15,000 in Canberra, 10,000 in Perth and 10,000 in Adelaide, not to mention the other more than 100 events in non-capital cities and towns. Organisations striking included 33 Australian unions, 2,500 businesses including Atlassian, Canva, Domain and Intrepid, and faith institutions including the Anglican Church &amp; Uniting Church, they said. There are well over 100,000 people here in Melbourne and organisers are talking about 150,000. Niamh, 17, from Castlemaine told the crowd: “I fight for climate justice because everyone deserves a safe future. The government is not supporting it yet, but together we will change that.” Freya, 16, from Melbourne said: “The climate crisis is a human and global issue, and we need to act now.” The students spoke about recent natural disasters around the world, including massive wildfires in the Amazon and the early bushfires that have caused devastation in Queensland and NSW. “This is predicted to get a lot worse if we don’t act now,” Niamh said. The students then spoke about the demands of young people striking today, which include the complete phase-out of fossil fuels. The students have gone to great lengths to talk about the need to secure the futures of workers in fossil fuel-intensive industries, whose livelihoods will be affected as economies become carbon-neutral. Freya said: “We understand the role fossil fuels have played in putting food on the table for families. It’s vital we all work together, not against one another. It’s not about jobs v the environment.” Tens if not hundreds of thousands packed out Sydney’s Domain park in the CBD. Moemoana, 18, has come from Wollongong to the protest, and her homeland is Samoa. She’s here with members of the Matavai Pacific cultural centre. “I’ve come to fight for the Pacific. The Pacific Islands are [only] metres above sea level because of climate change and it’s a scary future for our islands. We want to urge people to take some action. “Seas are rising [in] Pacific Islands, especially Tuvalu and Kiribati, it’s a real threat, and Australia needs to know that Pacifika are neighbours and Australia really needs to help out. 17-year-old protest organiser Daisy spoke of the third demand of the campaign: funding a just transition and job creation for all fossil-fuel workers and communities. “We need solutions that care for people and our planet,” she said. “Climate justice is not about jobs versus the environment. Just as climate change hurts people, unemployment hurts people.” She said too many people were already suffering and would suffer if governments did not find solutions. “If our government cares about all of us then they need to get on with the job of stopping any new coal, oil and gas projects, powering Australia with 100% renewable energy by no later than 2030, and doing all this while funding just transition and jobs for all fossil fuel workers and their communities so that no one is left behind.” Marlie Thomas, a Kamilaroi teenager from Gunnedah, said she was attending the rally on the authority of her elders, not the Department of Education. “I’ve had to help collect bottled water for our family in Walgett,” she said. Former federal MP and City of Sydney councillor Kerryn Phelps told Guardian Australia cities “need to play their part when it comes planning for the future and mitigating climate change”. “That includes our own operations, working with businesses and residents, providing incentives to people to reduce their carbon footprint, to encourage active public transport, to encourage renewable sources of energy. “And because of the sheer size of the population, not only do they contribute so much to climate change risk but they also have the most, I think, to offer. Obviously we’ve got the agriculture sector, which needs to play its part, the transport sector, but individuals also can do so much themselves.” With the Australian strikes not even half over in many places, here’s what has happened so far: Hundreds of thousands have participated in the largest climate strike across Australia yet: more than 100 locations, from capital cities to regional centres such as Alice Springs, Byron Bay and Katherine. In Sydney and Melbourne crowds were estimated at 80,000 to 150,000 respectively, making them the biggest demonstrations since the Iraq war. In Tasmania 22,000 marchers made it the biggest strike action the state had ever seen. As part of Guardian Australia’s coverage, the federal energy minister, the opposition energy spokesman and two of the country’s biggest energy companies took questions from students. In Vanuatu, the deputy prime minister spoke directly to the US, Canada, Australia, Japan and New Zealand as countries “to blame for this threat to our survival”. Protests in the Solomon Islands, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong and many more also continued throughout the day. They’re marching in the Philippines, too. Justin McCurry in Japan writes: Japan has suffered unseasonable, powerful and fatal storms in recent years that have also inflicted serious damage on its infrastructure. Last week’s typhoon was unusually strong, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power. The country has also been hit by record-breaking heatwaves – one last summer killed 65 people in a single week. Japan’s government had planned to expand nuclear power in an effort to tackle carbon dioxide emissions, but the Fukushima disaster changed all that. Pressure is building to invest more in renewables as the government expands coal-fired power stations and imports of gas and oil to fill the energy gap left by the post-Fukushima closure of dozens of nuclear reactors. Japan’s involvement in the climate strike has been low key. This Friday adults and children belonging to the Fridays for Future Tokyo movement will gather outside the United Nations University in central Tokyo at 5pm, make speeches and then march through the streets of the capital. Just over 100 people turned up in March; students at Japanese state schools were noticeably absent and I think that will be the case this Friday. A few protests have begun in Japan, and one is scheduled for Tokyo at 5pm local time. I cannot stress enough that my favourite thing from today is students on the ground interviewing their fellow strikers. Here is Oscar Lander-McBride, 10, interviewing Zac, 13. And from earlier, Esther Plummer, 13, interviewing Jasper, 15. There are more than 100,000 people in Melbourne, according to organisers. An aerial view of Melbourne, only 30 minutes in. And here’s the march crossing Brisbane’s Victoria bridge: In Bali: In Singapore: And in Brisbane who better to give a crowd estimate than Haemish Lander-McBride, 13, who has been to the past two strikes. “It’s massive in comparison to the other ones ... People aren’t just going to the first one – people are really coming again and again and again.” And big crowds in Adelaide: An estimated 10,000 in Perth: Mike Bowers in Canberra: It’s just past 2pm, which is the official start time in Melbourne. But as we saw in Sydney, crowds are so huge there are lines to get in. It’ll take a while to get into full swing. Early crowd numbers out of Sydney: 50,000 to 80,000 people at least. More from First Dog: Over on 2GB in Sydney and 4BC in Brisbane this morning Alan Jones was keeping a sceptical eye on the climate strike. “If you ask some of these people what it was about they wouldn’t have a clue,” Jones said without actually asking any of the strikers that question. An elderly caller suggested the children’s minds were being manipulated just like those of the Hitler Youth in Germany decades ago. Warming to the theme, Jones had a Goebbels quote on hand: “I will remind our listeners that his minister of propaganda ,Joseph Goebbels, also said it would not be impossible to prove with sufficient repetition and the psychological understanding of the people concerned that a square is in fact a circle. They are mere words and words can be moulded until they clothe ideas in disguise. This is what’s going on here isn’t it? Immensely disturbing I have to say. Immensely disturbing.” Former Queensland Greens senator Andrew Bartlett has this estimate: Similar thoughts in Sydney: The Brisbane rally keeps growing. People are still streaming in 30 minutes after the posted start time and police have had to shut roads on two sides of Queens Park. Hard to guess at a crowd figure, but comfortably over 10,000 at this point. This is not, of course, an anti-government rally, but there’s certainly no love for the coal embrace of the Queensland government. And notably, there are at least a half dozen left-wing unions here. The Electrical Trades Union has just taken a swipe, officials complaining the government has let the private sector do the heavy lifting on renewables, and giving a strong endorsement of climate action. Rebecca Ratcliffe in Delhi writes: Students protesters in India have a long list of demands for their political leaders. The air in many of its cities is infamously toxic, poor waste management is putting lives at risk and water shortages have reached crisis levels. Last year India was ranked among the bottom five countries on the environmental performance index produced by Yale and Columbia universities and the World Economic Forum. “We are in September now and we would be usually subjected to monsoon rains at this time but the rainfall is so erratic,” said Jacintha Thota, 14, who lives in Hyderabad. On Friday 200 students from her school and some of their teachers are expected to march together. Hyderabad is one of tens of locations, including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru, where protests are expected to take place. The Fridays for Future movement is much smaller than other more established environmental campaigns in India, but students say it is growing in popularity, thanks partly to social media. In Delhi protesters are planning seven days of action, which includes marching to the ministry of urban affairs and housing on Friday. On Sunday protesters will meet at Bhalswa landfill, the second biggest dump yard in the city, while next week they will protest at other key political buildings. Bhavreen Kandhari, an environmental activist from Fridays For Future India will take part. “We have beautiful laws on the paper but none of it is being executed,” she said. Five years ago, when her daughters had an X-ray, she discovered the impact of Delhi’s pollution. “Their lungs were black in colour; they should be pink. For a child who is born and brought up in Delhi for 10 years this is the damage that they suffer,” she said. Her twin daughters, 15, will also be attending the march in Delhi. “The rich think ‘Oh I’ll put a mask on my child’, ‘I’ll get an air purifier’, and the poorest they can barely make two meals [a day].” Big turnout in Thailand – and a reminder that many of the protests in Asia will be kicking into gear soon as well. Wait no, maybe this one: Calling the winner now Meanwhile the Brisbane protest has broken its banks and people are streaming down the streets. There’s already a crowd at Treasury Gardens for the Melbourne school strike which kicks off at 2pm. Thea Hamilton, 16, is one of the organisers. “I’m really excited and hopefully we’ll be able to get some really good action out of this and get more people involved in climate action and climate justice,” she says. She says young people “are looking for a space to be heard and to really feel represented by this global movement so we can call for climate action at the UN global climate summit on the 23rd”. Continuing our series. EnergyAustralia has agreed to take a question from a climate striker. Along with Queensland’s Stanwell Corporation, it is the other one of Australia’s top 10 carbon emitters to agree to take a question. Josh O’Callaghan, 15, from Adelaide asks: What are the future initiatives that your company plans to put in place to have 100% renewable energy production? Mark Collette, the head of EnergyAustralia’s customer business: Thanks Josh. Designing and building a 100% renewable energy system is a huge challenge for Australia. I think Australians are up for the challenge. Your home state of South Australia has solar and wind already providing over half of the electricity supplied to South Australians. In planning for 100% renewables, the first 50% is easier than the second 50%. Solar and wind generation follow the sun and the wind, so when it is not sunny and windy we can’t produce power for customers. I reckon that above about 50% renewables for Australia we need to find ways to move the power from the sun and the wind to dark and still times, or use it immediately. One way we do this is storage. Already we have two of the largest batteries in the country in Victoria, and we are working on two large pumped hydro projects – one of which is in your state of South Australia. Another way we are exploring is helping customers use power when it is available from the sun and the wind. We can time pool pumps and hot water systems to run just through these times. There’s a long way to go but we like tackling tough problems, like the second 50%.” In Sydney Daisy, 17, tells the crowd their frustration has never been about people working in the fossil-fuel industry. Their demand is “about acting to halt this crisis while creating safe and meaningful work for all of us”. And let’s not forget the regions. More photos from Lismore from Frewoini Baume: And these beautiful pictures from Katherine in the NT: And here’s Albury: The crowd in Sydney is getting so big you can really only see it from the air. Perth and Canberra aren’t too shabby either: This is the third nationwide climate strike in Australia – after November 2018 and March 2019. They get bigger every time. Amelia Neylon, 16, is on the ground and tells Guardian Australia: The crowd is reportedly over 22,000. Bob Brown at this count has said it is larger then the Franklin River rally. Making this the largest rally in Tasmania held to date. It’s all happening. Another must-watch, exclusive to Guardian Australia: Meanwhile Australia’s strikes are making waves around the world: If you are Gen X or above, then you can laugh at the latest from First Dog on the Moon instead*: *This is a joke – First Dog is funny for all ages. I’m a millennial / Gen Z so I understand these signs. If you don’t, rest assured they are very funny. In Brisbane, here’s Parker with his message to the government – and a great poem. The award for best sign is getting more competitive every minute. Here is Matilda (3). Sydney’s strikes have started but aren’t even at full swing, Melbourne’s starts in 1.5 hours, and preparations have begun in Perth. Earlier today we saw huge turnouts in regional areas, including Alice Springs and Byron Bay. Angus Taylor has also agreed to take a question. From Josh O’Callaghan, 15, from Adelaide: It is said that ‘if those who believe in climate change are wrong, we will have needlessly created a cleaner world, but if those who don’t believe in climate change are wrong, we will die’. Do you agree? If so, how should we act on this? Angus Taylor : The federal government is taking strong action to reduce global emissions and respond to the serious challenge of climate change. The government’s $3.5bn climate solutions package sets out how we will meet our 2030 Paris target, down to the last tonne. People are free to have their views, but my personal opinion is that students should be at school during school hours.” Reporter Helen Davidson is on the ground in Sydney: Our first dispatches from Amelia Neylon in Hobart: Meanwhile crowds build in Sydney. There is a LONG line to get in. Esther in Byron Bay has interviewed her fellow strikers. Must-watch. First images in from Hobart: Sydney’s strike is scheduled to start at noon. Huge crowds are still making their way to the city. This could take some time and is looking immense. Some footage from Thailand: Continuing our Q&amp;A series is Labor’s spokesman on climate change and energy, Mark Butler. Frewoini Baume, 18, from Lismore asks: Permanent destruction for temporary economic gain is not a sustainable or stable economy. Why are you supporting the coal industry when it has been scientifically proven to be unsustainable? Yes, the economy may temporarily suffer but the longer you wait the more severe the impact. So why not act now? Mark Butler: The Labor party remains deeply committed to taking climate action to make sure that we comply with the commitments to future generations in the Paris agreement – to keep global warming way below 2 degrees and to pursue efforts around 1.5 degrees to make sure that we are at net zero emissions by the middle of the century. There is no denying that Australia needs to drastically reduce its carbon emissions, but after coming down by more than 10% when Labor was last in office, emissions have been rising ever since the election of Tony Abbott, and the government’s own data shows they will keep rising all the way to 2030. Australia doesn’t have a national climate policy. That is why we need to keep pressuring the Liberal government to take serious climate action.” Some more charts, this time Australia-specific from our data editor, Nick Evershed: This first shows warming in Australia, measuring how different the temperature is in a given year against the long-term average. Put simply, it demonstrates how things are getting hotter, and 2018 was the third-hottest year: This second shows Australia’s quarterly emissions over time. The bars need to be under the two lines (assuming a linear rate of reduction to meet the target) if we are going to meet various emissions targets. The pink line shows the trajectory to a 28% reduction in emissions, based on 2005 levels, by 2030. This is the more ambitious of Australia’s possible reduction targets under the Paris agreement. The purple line is the trajectory proposed by the Climate Change Authority based on the best available science to ensure Australia makes a meaningful contribution towards keeping global temperature increases under 2C. Ideally the bars should be below both lines. And some early data from Twitter: #ClimateStrike is trending #1 in Australia and has been for the past two hours #schoolstrike4climate is at #2 and #friday4future is at #5 Australian cities where #climatestrike is trending: Adelaide #2 Darwin #1 Melbourne #1 Perth #1 Sydney #1 An on-the-ground sketch from First Dog on the Moon You may have noticed the arresting temperature chart at the top of our site this morning – I know I did. Our colleagues internationally have also compiled more charts that explain the climate crisis. And some slightly better news: In Lismore Frewoini Baume has interviewed Suhani Sheppeard, 16. FB: “Why are you striking?” SS: “I’m striking because I believe it takes one person to change the world. Having that opportunity to be that person is incredibly inspiring and I want to be the one voice to inspire others. “It feels incredibly empowering to be a part of the community in our global strike, and inspires me to always fight for climate justice.” Jotham Napat, Vanuatu’s deputy prime minister, delivered his speech in English “because the people who need to hear this, the ones who are causing the problems, are not here”. According to the Vanuatu Posts’ Dan McGarry, Napat named the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan and New Zealand as the ones who are “to blame for this threat to our survival”. Earlier Vanuatu’s foreign affairs minister, Ralph Regenvanu, also spoke and criticised Australia. He characterised the discussions at the recent Pacific Islands forum in Tuvalu as a “fight” between Australia and the rest of the Pacific. Regenvanu, an outspoken Pacific leader, has also promised to take his country’s climate grievance to the International Court of Justice to seek legal redress. During the Pacific Islands forum Regenvanu told the Guardian that critical talks almost collapsed twice amid “fierce” clashes between Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, and other Pacific leaders. “Australia is out there – they’re not with us,” Regenvanu said at the time. Today students in Vanuatu partnered with the Vanuatu climate action network to stage a silent strike. Students wearing traditional dress and holding banners with messages about the climate crisis stood around the capital, Port Vila, as politicians walked around the city viewing the messages, finishing up at the seafront of the city where there were art exhibitions, poetry performances and speeches. In Albury the march will head to the office of the environment minister, Sussan Ley. Our first Q&amp;A is in. The Stanwell Corporation is one of Australia’s biggest energy companies. EnergyAustralia and Stanwell were the only members of Australia’s top 10 carbon emitters who agreed to take a question for our live blog today. Narii Hamill-Salmon, 15, from the Gold Coast asks: The Stanwell Corporation was named as the nation’s third largest carbon emitter in 2017-18 [by the Clean Energy Regulator] thus making the company a significant contributor to the climate crisis. Mr Van Breda, if you could say one thing to the future generations of this planet, the ones who are going to experience the most devastating impacts of climate change, what would you tell them?” Richard Van Breda, chief executive: Thanks for your question, Narii. I think a lot about that, and here’s what I would tell future generations about the work we do at Stanwell. The electricity industry is at a tricky time in its transition to lower carbon technologies. The proportion of low carbon energy and storage in Australia is increasing quickly, but those technologies are not yet at a point where they can function without support from fossil fuel generation. As a company that operates coal-fired power stations, it’s Stanwell’s job to provide the electricity that people need, as the industry moves to a lower carbon future. That change can’t happen immediately and needs to be planned and done carefully. We ramp generation from our coal-fired power stations up and down every day to support solar generation in the middle of the day, and still provide the electricity people need in the evenings. We are also exploring new generation and storage technology that will help reduce emissions. I’m really proud of the work Stanwell people are doing in all those areas.” And Frewoini Baume, 18, has sent through the first few images of the Lismore strikes. If people want a last minute sign for the climate strike First Dog on the Moon says you can print this out on vegan paper and wave it about. More dispatches from Esther in Byron: There are big contingents and great photos coming in from all across the Pacific – especially Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands right now. And in Castlemaine, Victoria, where this all began (in Australia at least), there are no signs of slowing. Early signs from University of Sydney: And nearby, stores all along King Street have closed for the day in solidarity. In Gloucester New South Wales we have an early contender for best costume today (the sunflower). In a landmark decision earlier this year, a court blocked a new coalmine in the region because of the “dire consequences” of increasing emissions. Absolutely huge turnout in Geelong where they’re singing and chanting. And more from Townsville: It’s not even 11am yet on the east coast and it’s already obvious today’s protests are going to be bigger than ever before. First Barnesy now The Oils: In Vanuatu: The Knitting Nannas are already down in Lismore. Our first student on the ground Esther Plummer (13) has sent pictures from Byron Bay. Earlier we said 1,000 businesses are supporting the strike. That number is now 2,600, with the latest figures from Not Business As Usual. And here is music legend (and all-round legend) Jimmy Barnes, with his message of support to the strikers. In New Caledonia: Big turnout in Townsville. The event there started at 9am and they will be marching at 10am. Protesters are staging a die-in in the centre of Alice Springs. Traditional owners have stressed the importance of putting Indigenous perspectives at the centre of these protests. Yesterday Sammy Wilson, a custodian of Uluru and chair of the Central Land Council, announced that the council will join the strike across the Northern Territory. “Aboriginal people want to be part of the solution,” he said. “We want to have access to clean technologies such as solar power so that our children have the chance to keep living on our traditional country. “I support their right to take this action [and] I call on them to spare a thought for Aboriginal people out bush who may not be able to travel to the strikes but who are already suffering most during our hotter, longer and drier summers.” After the NT’s hottest summer on record, delegates at the council meeting last month said climate change and water security were their top policy priorities. Kate Lamb in Jakarta writes: In Indonesia the climate strikes come as the country faces an escalating environmental emergency – tens of thousands of hectares of rainforest are burning in Sumatra and Kalimantan, home to some of the largest swathes of virgin forest in the world. This year the annual fires – a result of “slash and burn” practices to clear land mostly for palm oil plantations – have been exacerbated by the El Nino phenomenon and severe droughts. Thick haze has blanketed cities in Indonesia and neighbouring Singapore and Malaysia, and also forced schools to be closed and increased the risk of respiratory-related illnesses. Also on the minds of young Indonesian activists is how to curb the country’s plastic addiction. Home to more than 250 million people, Indonesia is the second largest contributor to ocean plastics after China. But in recent years environmental awareness around plastics has gained momentum, largely driven by inspiring Indonesian students, artists, musicians and activists. On Friday hundreds are expected to take to the streets of Jakarta and 12 cities across the archipelago, on the islands of Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan and Bali. Expect colourful costumes, live performances from local indie bands, and talk of an “energy revolution”. From here in the steamy tropics, the focus of that discussion will be on the future of solar energy. More from the Pacific from Kate Lyons Climate strike events kicked off in Tonga yesterday (which held its main event – a community clean-up on Thursday because of the significant number of Seventh Day Adventists in the country who observe the Sabbath on Fridays). Pacific countries, many of which are bearing the brunt of the effects of the climate crisis, are holding events today, though most are not holding strikes or traditional protests, instead focusing on community events such as clean-ups, barbecues and poetry performances. Things are already well under way in Alice Springs. Up to 60 local businesses have also shut their doors for today. Meanwhile preparations continue around the country. Eleanor Ainge Roy writes from Dunedin New Zealand is pushing back its participation in the strikes to Friday 27 September so high school students can sit national exams this week. Large strikes are planned nationwide. Sea level rise is a real and increasingly urgent threat to New Zealand. Most of New Zealand’s nearly 5 million people live on the coast. Sea walls to protect vulnerable communities are being constructed – from the former gold-mining town of Hokitika on the west coast to vulnerable beachside huts in the isolated far north. Sea level rise is also a pressing issue for the country’s Indigenous people, with their tribal marae [meeting houses] mostly on low-lying coastal land. Jacinda Ardern’s Labour coalition government has vowed to tackle climate change head on, committing to making the country carbon neutral by 2050 and planting 1bn trees. The first climate strike in New Zealand was interrupted by the Christchurch mosque attacks, with children in central Christchurch shepherded into lockdown for hours. It was initially thought, incorrectly, that the striking children may have been a target. Amnesty International Aotearoa New Zealand’s policy manager, Annaliese Johnston, says New Zealand youth climate groups have been instrumental in increasing awareness in the Pacific region. “The youth of today in New Zealand ... have woken us all up to the urgent call to action to protect our common home and future.” Greta Thunberg, the 16-year old Swedish student who inspired this movement, has recorded a short film for today’s strike. In it, she and Guardian columnist George Monbiot talk about the importance of natural solutions – low-cost, effective initiatives such as rowing trees. And for a bit of a blast from the past you can read Thunberg’s opinion piece from November 2018 – written specifically for Australia – when we became one of the first countries to hold nationwide student strikes. “In the Pacific we don’t go on strike, but we do other things,” says Patricia Mallam, a Fijian climate activist from 350.org. Over the course of the day children and students from Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Tonga, New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea will take part in poetry performances, silent protests, sporting events, barbecues and intergenerational discussions about the effects of climate change in the region. These events rather than traditional protests and street marches make more sense for the Pacific, says Mallam, because it is such a community-driven region “and we all know that the problem is not within the community”. “For instance, you don’t have any coalmines in the Pacific, so we can’t have people striking outside coalmines. The problems are not being caused here. But in countries where there are coalmines or banks financing the fossil-fuel industry, it makes sense for people to go on strike, so they’re voicing their distaste for what’s going on to keep their economies afloat,” she says over the phone from Fiji. “We all know that the problem is not being caused here in the Pacific, but we’re facing the full brunt of the climate crisis.” The Pacific is estimated to contribute just 0.03% of global emissions despite making up 0.12% of the world’s population, but is at the frontline of the climate emergency, with countries facing rising sea levels, coastal erosion, the destruction of crucial reefs, inundations and warming seas that lead to more frequent and more severe cyclones. “It is a day, especially for the polluters, they need to quickly understand what’s going on,” says Mallam. “But at the same time, in the Pacific we feel that because we’re at the frontline of the impacts, it’s important for us to speak up and have other nations hear what’s happening.” Preparations are under way in the Solomon Islands already. And Kate Lyons spoke to some of the activists across the Pacific ahead of today’s big day. Here’s everything you need to know about today’s strikes as collated by my colleague Lisa Cox. There are more than 100 locations, and the strikes have support from 30 unions, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and more than 1,000 businesses including Atlassian, Future Super and KeepCup. And in news from this morning, more than 250 academics have also signed on in support. Morning everyone. Today the global climate strikes start in Australia and the Pacific. The Guardian Australia team will follow it all. We have a huge day of coverage planned. The Australian strikes will be in full swing from 11am or noon (local time) and before that in New Zealand and the Pacific. Our correspondents are standing by, and cartoonist First Dog on the Moon is on duty – they’ll be sketching throughout the day. And because today is really about the students, we’ve organised to receive on-the-ground updates from participants. Here they are in a (non-exhaustive) list: Narii-Hamill Salmon, 15, Gold Coast Qld Frewoini Baume, 18, Lismore NSW Josh O’Callaghan, 15, Adelaide SA Amelia Neylon, 16, Hobart Tas Esther Plummer, 13, Byron Bay NSW Iestyn (13) and Owynn (11) Harries, Brisbane Qld Dakota Barret-Perry, 15, Melbourne Vic They have also been given the opportunity to ask a question directly of federal politicians and prominent business leaders – from the energy minister to EnergyAustralia. We’ll publish the questions and their answers throughout the day. Stay with us. For the next 24 hours, the Guardian will be reporting in real time on the wave of climate strikes as they ripple around the world, starting in the Asia-Pacific region and continuing through Europe and Africa before culminating in the Americas. Millions of young people are expected to turn out in more than 3,000 events worldwide in this latest edition of the Fridays For Future strikes. On this occasion, adults have been invited to join in and companies, organisations, trade unions, even churches are expected to join the fray. Our correspondents on the ground will be feeding in with live updates from the world’s major metropolises, and we’ll be pausing for breath every now and then to consider the bigger picture, the state we’re in, the scale of the challenge. The strike kicks off a big week for environmental activism with a major climate action summit at the UN next week and another round of Friday strikes on the 27th. The Guardian will be at these events too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/mar/17/japanese-government-liable-negligence-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-03-17T10:25:02Z","webTitle":"Japanese government held liable for first time for negligence in Fukushima","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/17/japanese-government-liable-negligence-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/mar/17/japanese-government-liable-negligence-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Japanese government held liable for first time for negligence in Fukushima","bodyText":"A court in Japan has ruled that negligence by the state contributed to the triple meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011 and awarded significant damages to evacuees. Although courts have awarded damages arising from the disaster in other cases, Friday’s ruling is the first time the government has been held liable. The Maebashi district court near Tokyo awarded ¥38.55m (£270,000) to 137 people who were forced to evacuate their homes in the days after three of Fukushima Daiichi’s six reactors suffered a catastrophic meltdown, the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. Despite official claims that the size and destructive power of the quake and tsunami were impossible to foresee, the court said the nuclear meltdown could have been prevented. The ruling said the government should have used its regulatory powers to force the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), who were also held liable, to take adequate preventive measures. The plaintiffs – comprising forced and “voluntary” evacuees – claimed the government and Tepco could have predicted a tsunami more than 10 metres in height would one day hit the plant. They based their claim on a 2002 report in which government experts estimated there was a one in five chance of a magnitude-8 earthquake occurring and triggering a powerful tsunami within the next 30 years. At the time of the disaster, Japan’s nuclear regulator was severely criticised for its collusive ties with the nuclear industry, resulting in the formation of a new watchdog that has imposed stricter criteria for the restart of nuclear reactors that were shut down in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. Tepco, which faces a ¥21.5tn bill for decommissioning the plant and compensating evacuees, said it would respond after studying the ruling. The 137 plaintiffs, who are now living in several regions outside of Fukushima, were seeking a total of ¥1.5bn as compensation for emotional distress. They said the meltdown and resulting evacuation had ruined their livelihoods and caused disruption to their families’ lives, adding that state compensation they had already received was insufficient. Friday’s ruling is the first of 30 lawsuits to be brought by Fukushima evacuees. Six years after the disaster, tens of thousands of people are still living in nuclear limbo, and many say they will never be able to return home. A small number have moved back to communities where the government has lifted evacuation orders. The ruling echoed the conclusion reached by an independent parliamentary investigation, which described the Fukushima Daiichi meltdown as a “man-made” disaster caused by poor regulation and collusion between the government, Tepco and the industry’s then watchdog, the nuclear and industrial safety agency. The report, published in 2012, accused Tepco and the agency of failing to take adequate safety measures, despite evidence that the north-east coast of Japan was susceptible to powerful earthquakes and tsunamis. “The Fukushima nuclear power plant accident was the result of collusion between the government, the regulators and Tepco, and the lack of governance by said parties,” the report said. “They effectively betrayed the nation’s right to be safe from nuclear accidents. Therefore, we conclude that the accident was clearly ‘man-made’.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/aug/09/planned-hinkley-point-nuclear-power-station-energy-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-09T19:16:04Z","webTitle":"Planned Hinkley Point nuclear power station under fire from energy industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/09/planned-hinkley-point-nuclear-power-station-energy-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/aug/09/planned-hinkley-point-nuclear-power-station-energy-industry","fields":{"headline":"Planned Hinkley Point nuclear power station under fire from energy industry","bodyText":"Hinkley Point, the planned £24.5bn nuclear power station in Somerset, is under intensifying criticism from the energy industry and the City, even as the government prepares to give the final go-ahead for the heavily subsidised project. The plant, due to open in 2023, will cost as much as the combined bill for Crossrail, the London 2012 Olympics and the revamped Terminal 2 at Heathrow, calculated Peter Atherton, energy analyst at investment bank Jefferies. He said that, for the same price as Hinkley Point C, which will provide 3,200MW of capacity, almost 50,000MW of gas-fired power capacity could be built. “This level of new gas build would effectively replace the entire thermal generation fleet in the UK – much of which is old and inefficient – with brand new, highly efficient, low carbon, gas generation,” said Atherton. Doubts about Hinkley Point have deepened after a detailed report by HSBC’s energy analysts described eight key challenges to the project, which will be built by the state-backed French firm EDF and be part-financed by investment from China. These challenges include: declining demand for power in the UK, currently falling at 1% a year as energy-saving measures take effect; a three-fold jump in the UK’s interconnection capacity with continental Europe by 2022, massively increasing the country’s ability to import cheaper supplies; and “a litany of setbacks” in Finland, France and China for EdF’s European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) model, the same type as planned for Hinkley Point. HSBC’s analysts described the EPR model as too big, too costly and still unproven, saying its future was bleak. They also pointed out that wholesale power prices have fallen by 16% since November 2011 when the government agreed a “strike price” for Hinkley Point’s output – effectively a guaranteed price of £92.50 per megawatt hour, inflation-linked for 35 years and funded through household bills. “With the problems encountered by France’s EPR model and a strike price likely to be double the UK wholesale price at the scheduled 2023 time of opening of the proposed Hinkley C EPR, we see ample reason for the UK government to delay or cancel the project,” they said. Paul Massara, chief executive of RWE NPower, one of the UK’s big power generators, used the study to step up his criticisms of Hinkley Point’s economics. “We will look back and think that nuclear was a expensive mistake,” he told the Sunday Times. “It’s one of those deal where my children, and my children’s children, are going to be thinking ‘was that a good deal?’ These big central planning bets are likely to be the wrong answer.” There is no sign of the government wavering in its commitment to Hinkley Point. David Cameron is expected to sign a final deal in October during Chinese president Xi Jinping’s visit to the UK. The Department for Energy and Climate Change said: “The UK government and EDF are continuing to work together to finalise the project. The deal must represent value for money and is subject to approval by ministers.” Despite the City’s scepticism, the department has argued that new nuclear energy will be competitive with future gas prices and the building programme will save UK households £74 a year in today’s prices by 2026-30. EDF gave a staunch defence of the project, emphasising nuclear’s role in supplying secure baseload supplies at a time when wind and solar capacity have increased. “Suggesting we should rely on importing more energy doesn’t solve our need for energy security,” said the company. “Nuclear power is still the choice that gives reliable baseload power at the same time as helping Britain meet its carbon emissions targets. When the cost of extra back-up needed for intermittent renewables is included, the cost of nuclear remains competitive with any other technology. “This is before we count the enormous benefit of a multibillion-pound investment in Britain, with the impact on jobs, skills and our global industrial competitiveness. Hinkley Point C will provide 25,000 job opportunities during construction and supply 7% of the UK’s electricity demand.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/aug/18/china-moves-curb-overseas-acquisitions-firms-debt-levels-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-08-18T17:32:17Z","webTitle":"China moves to curb overseas acquisitions as firms' debt levels rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/18/china-moves-curb-overseas-acquisitions-firms-debt-levels-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/aug/18/china-moves-curb-overseas-acquisitions-firms-debt-levels-rise","fields":{"headline":"China moves to curb overseas acquisitions as firms' debt levels rise","bodyText":"The Chinese government has served notice on the country’s foreign investment spree in football clubs, skyscrapers and Hollywood as it moves to curb rising levels of debt among domestic companies. The announcement of restrictions in a range of sectors follows a buying spree around the globe during which Chinese firms and business tycoons have taken control of assets including Legendary Entertainment, the US film producer behind Jurassic World and Warcraft, buildings such as the Cheesegrater in London, and English football clubs including Southampton and Aston Villa. The curbs were announced in a document released on Friday by the state council, China’s cabinet, in the latest move to halt a string of foreign acquisitions. This week the International Monetary Fund described China’s credit-fuelled economic strategy as dangerous, in a strongly worded statement warning that the country’s approach risks financial turmoil. Raising concerns that some of the companies involved may be taking on too much debt, the council said: “There are great opportunities for our nation’s companies to embark on foreign investment, but they also face numerous risks and challenges.” It added that through the new guidance, the government hopes to promote the “rational, orderly and healthy development of foreign investment while effectively guarding against risks”. The document limits overseas investments in areas such as hotels, cinemas, the entertainment industry, real estate and sports clubs. It also bans outright investments in enterprises related to gambling and the sex industry. The Chinese government had already flagged hotels as an area of concern, having reportedly asked the insurance group Anbang to sell the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York. One of China’s biggest conglomerates, Wanda Group, also bowed to pressure from the government when it abandoned the $1bn (£780m) purchase of the entertainment company Dick Clark Productions earlier this year. In 2016 Wanda bought Legendary Entertainment for $3.5bn, having become the world’s biggest cinema operator in 2012 with its purchase of a majority stake in US chain AMC for $2.6bn. At the same time, the document encourages companies to plough money into projects related to the “Belt and Road” project, President Xi Jinping’s signature foreign policy initiative that seeks to link China with other parts of Asia and eastern Europe through multibillion-dollar investments in ports, highways, railways, power plants and other infrastructure. The Chinese government has pledged to double the size of the country’s economy between 2010 and 2020, leading to rapid growth in non-financial sector debt to help achieve its aim. Total debt has quadrupled since the financial crisis to $28tn at the end of last year. As part of his drive for stronger government leadership over the economy, Xi has been moving to reassert control over top state enterprises while reining in sprawling conglomerates such as Wanda, Anbang, Fosun International and HNA Group, which have expanded rapidly via debt-fuelled foreign acquisitions. China’s state planner, the national development and reform commission, said on Friday it would provide better guidance on risks to companies investing overseas in order to prevent “vicious” competition and corruption. It also cited unspecified security risks for Chinese companies investing abroad, but did not give any further details about how it planned to strengthen rules or why it was concerned about corruption and unhealthy competition between companies. The UK government approved Chinese state-backed investment in the construction of the £18bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in September, after Theresa May unexpectedly placed the controversial scheme in Somerset under review, causing tensions with Beijing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2016/jun/06/lonely-struggle-india-anti-nuclear-protesters-tamil-nadu-kudankulam-idinthakarai","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-06T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"Lonely struggle of India's anti-nuclear protesters | Vidhi Doshi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/06/lonely-struggle-india-anti-nuclear-protesters-tamil-nadu-kudankulam-idinthakarai","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2016/jun/06/lonely-struggle-india-anti-nuclear-protesters-tamil-nadu-kudankulam-idinthakarai","fields":{"headline":"The lonely struggle of India's anti-nuclear protesters","bodyText":"Behind the Lourdes Matha church in Idinthakarai, a fishing village at the southern tip of India, five women have abandoned their chores to protest at the Kudankulam nuclear power plant. Today is day 1,754 of their relay hunger strike, which began when the plant was fuelled in 2011. Celine, 73, is among the five protestors, who take it in turns to go without food. “Not a single government, not a single political party is willing to take up our cause,” she says. “Only Mother Mary can save us now.” The villagers of Idinthakarai, in Tamil Nadu state, have been protesting against the plant since the late 1980s, when it was proposed. But theirs is a lonely struggle. Few people in India have even heard of their village, let alone support their protest. In the next few months, a second unit of the plant will be fuelled. “What’s the point of starting a second unit when there are so many problems with the first?” Celine says, referring to intermittent technical faults at the plant. As India develops, its energy needs are growing rapidly. More than 300 million Indians are still without electricity, a statistic Narendra Modi, the prime minister, has vowed to cut through an ambitious electrification programme. The promise of cheap labour and utilities has drawn major manufacturers to the country in the past two decades. India consumes a whopping 872m tonnes of oil equivalent for power; only China and the US use more. Its annual energy import bill is $120bn (£83bn), which will grow to $1tn by 2040, according to a World Energy Output report. Pressure to adopt cleaner forms of energy has been mounting from foreign governments. The Indian government presents nuclear energy as part of the solution to its looming energy crisis. The Nuclear Power Corporation of India was set up, according to its mission statement, to “produce nuclear power as a safe, environmentally benign and economically viable source of electrical energy to meet the increasing electricity needs of the country”. “People ask us, why are you against science? Why don’t you want India to develop?” says Sundari, an anti-nuclear activist from Idinthakarai village. “We want to tell them – we’re not against electricity … We’re against nuclear power.” Despite India’s billions of dollars of investment in nuclear power, the latest figures from the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), obtained by the Guardian, suggest nuclear plants produced 37,456m units of electricity, about 2% of the country’s annual consumption. SP Udayakumar, an anti-nuclear activist from the nearby town of Nagercoil, ran in May’s state elections as a single-issue candidate. “If India was getting half or a third of its energy from nuclear plants, then maybe there would be an argument for it,” he says. “But after all this, after years of crushing the peoples’ protest at Idinthakarai, is it really worth it?” Udayakumar sees the nuclear programme as a costly prestige exercise that endangers the lives of millions. Plus, he points out, villagers are still living in the dark, since most of India’s energy is used by the industrial sector. “Who really benefits from the nuclear plants in the end, except the foreign companies that are building these plants in India?” he says. In 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev, Soviet leader at the time, made his first state visit to India. Two years later, he and Rajiv Gandhi, the incumbent prime minister, signed an agreement for two nuclear plants at Kudankulam. Protests began a month later. The 1986 Chernobyl accident and the 1982 Bhopal gas disaster were of concern to the local fishing communities. How could the governments that had shown such catastrophic negligence be trusted to build a nuclear plant in their neighbourhood? The end of the Soviet Union in 1989 and the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 derailed the Kudankulam plans until 1997, when Indian’s HD Deve Gowda and Russia’s Boris Yeltsin renewed the agreement. Construction of the plant began in 2002. Many countries have taken a slice of India’s budding nuclear energy market: the UK, Canada, the US, Australia and Japan have all offered expertise and resources, and nuclear plants, backed by foreign governments, are dotted around India’s coasts and in central states. Yet foreign governments have shirked responsibility. When President Barack Obama visited India last year, he signed a deal limiting the US’s legal liability in the event of an accident at a nuclear plant. At Kudankulam, a joint project with Russia, four more units are planned. The resolve of the five protestors remains unshaken, but many of the villagers who supported them initially have realised the futility of resisting. The village chief’s husband, Sagayaraj, speaks on behalf of his wife. “The protests have destroyed our village,” he says. “I supported the protests at first, but now I’ve realised that we just need to take what we can get. This is not just about Idinthakarai or Kudankulam – it is an international issue. If they close the plant here, there will be protests to close nuclear plants all around the country. Now people realise the scale of what we’re trying to do. It’s like we’re protesting against Russia – against all the foreign governments. How can our small village take on international powers?” When the plant was planned, the government promised windmills, running water, schools, colleges, hospitals, a harbour and more. So far, none of these have been delivered, partly because the villagers refuse to cooperate. The protests in Idinthakarai were reinvigorated after the Fukushima disaster triggered by the tsunami in Japan. The accident alarmed people in tsunami-prone coastal villages, and hundreds came to Lourdes Matha church, which became the focal point of resistance. Police were dispatched to Idinthakarai to keep the protests in check. They used tear gas and fired into the crowd, killing five people. Many of the residents, including the village chief, have been arrested on sedition charges. Passports have been seized and bank accounts of protest leaders scrutinised. “The government is treating us like terrorists,” says Sundari. The Guardian tried many times to contact the local police and visited the Kudankulam police station, but no one was available to comment. A spokesperson from the DAE, speaking about the protests at Idinthakarai, said: “All the matters are being addressed amicably.” The spokesperson said the National Disaster Management Authority has “put in place all the measures in the event of nuclear and radiological emergencies”. None of the villagers interviewed, including the chief, had ever seen the government’s disaster plans or heard of any evacuation exercises in the village. The government has given out mixed messages on nuclear power. Minister of power Piyush Goyal spoke against it at the India economic summit in 2014, saying Europe and America had stopped building their own nuclear capacity. “This government would like to be cautious so that we are not saddled with something only under the garb of clean energy or alternate energy,” he said. Yet Modi has signed deals and held talks with countries including the UK and Japan in the past two years. The deals are in line with Modi’s predecessors’ ambitions for nuclear expansion. India has signed nuclear energy deals with at least 10 countries, including Namibia and Kazakhstan. A spokesperson from the DAE said: “Nuclear power is a clean and green source of energy [that] does not contribute to increases in carbon emissions in the environment. Right at the design stage itself, necessary safety features are incorporated for safe operation of the plant. Post-Fukushima these safety features have been augmented and strengthened to address any beyond design basis incidents.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/jun/28/leave-vote-makes-uks-transition-to-clean-energy-harder-say-experts","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-28T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"Leave vote makes UK's transition to clean energy harder, say experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/28/leave-vote-makes-uks-transition-to-clean-energy-harder-say-experts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jun/28/leave-vote-makes-uks-transition-to-clean-energy-harder-say-experts","fields":{"headline":"Leave vote makes UK's transition to clean energy harder, say experts","bodyText":"The UK’s challenge to build a clean, secure and affordable energy system has become significantly harder amid the political and economic turmoil following the nation’s vote to leave the European Union. Higher customer bills and delayed or cancelled projects are expected by experts, the most pessimistic of whom warn of the lights going out. The optimists argue that the global rush towards clean energy and strong domestic UK climate change targets can keep the transition to clean, green energy moving forward. However, the leading Brexiters, such as climate change doubter and likely next prime minister Boris Johnson, will play a critical role. If the deal they negotiate with the EU means close ties - and crucially access, like Norway, to Europe’s internal energy market (IEM) - the long-term dent to the UK’s energy prospects may be reduced. But a more decisive break with the world’s biggest single market would leave the UK out in the cold. With ageing, dirty power plants closing down, the UK needs to invest about £20bn a year between now and 2020, according to the National Infrastructure Commission, making up 60% of all infrastructure spending. Energy really matters, powering the economy both literally and financially. But the political risks have spiked after the Brexit vote, as have the financial risks and uncertainty about access to markets. National Grid has issued a warning that energy bills would rise and energy security would fall if, like Switzerland, the UK was excluded from Europe’s IEM. “It is vital the UK retains access to the IEM, which provides stability for energy companies and helps keep household bills down,” said a spokeswoman. “UK energy security depends on gas and electricity from the IEM and it is essential therefore that we take no risks with that. The issue of energy needs to be treated with the highest importance by the government as the negotiations on Britain’s exit begin.” SSE, one of the UK’s big six energy companies, agreed. “The UK government should be mindful of the importance the harmonisation of the [UK] energy market with the countries in Europe can have on efforts to deliver clean, secure and affordable energy. Collaboration with other European countries on energy matters is important for UK consumers,” it said in a statement. The costs of reduced collaboration could be high, according to research by Vivid Economics, published ahead of the vote: “The potential impacts resulting from exclusion from the IEM could be up to £500m per year by the early 2020s.” The analysts said further costs would come from investors demanding higher returns as the risks to projects rise. “Given the scale of planned investment, even a moderate change of [0.5%] to the cost of financing, sustained for multiple years, would raise costs significantly, possibly in the order of hundreds of millions of pounds,” the research stated. “Further upwards pressure on costs would result from the likely devaluation of the pound, given the role imported goods and services play in UK energy supply.” Before the referendum, energy and climate change secretary Amber Rudd warned of an “electric shock” from Brexit, citing the Vivid report. The boss of Centrica, which owns British Gas, agreed: “The probability is that our customers in the UK will see higher energy costs [with an exit].” The political uncertainty now present is starkly illustrated by the diametrically opposed views of Rudd’s deputy minister, Andrea Leadsom. Brexit was a “superb result” for the UK, she said. Leadsom said freedom from EU laws on state aid would benefit UK bill payers, though how looser rules on subsidies would achieve that is unclear. Michael Gove, another leading Brexiter, said the 5% VAT charged on energy could be cut. However, virtually all energy industry observers have a negative outlook for the UK’s post-EU energy system. Prof Paul Younger, at the University of Glasgow, said the vote to leave “blasts a hole” in the embryonic EU energy union, which would provide a huge market for the UK’s large offshore wind and tidal resources, as well as smooth out the intermittency of rising renewable energy. “That will inevitably damage investor confidence [and] at very least result in delays and project cost inflation, and in many cases could lead to cancellation of mooted developments,” he said. “We’ve introduced a severe new source of turbulence and confusion just when … we were already fearing severe problems of grid control in coming winters. As a friend quipped: at least there will be no need to ask the last person to leave the UK to switch the lights out – that will already have happened.” Nina Skorupska, at the Renewable Energy Association, said: “The result raises serious questions. Energy policy must be a priority for the government now, with industry needing reassurance and clarity on priorities. The first must be confirmation of the 5th carbon budget, which will hopefully give some confidence in the long-term direction of UK energy policy.” Under UK law, the government has until Thursday to accept or reject the latest carbon-cutting proposals from its own climate advisers. The chancellor George Osborne warned on Monday that the impact of the Brexit vote was already being felt: “It is already evident that some firms are continuing to pause their decisions to invest.” A survey of its members by the business group the Institute of Directors found one in five were considering moving some UK operations abroad. The flight risk is particularly high for the energy sector, in which many major players are foreign companies. The most high-profile is French company EDF, which wants to build a huge, heavily subsidised and highly controversial nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The plant is an important part of the UK government’s plan to keep the lights on and emissions down, but is at high risk from a change of leadership, said energy analyst Nick Butler: “Osborne has been a powerful supporter of new nuclear. He has tolerated both a sharp rise in costs, even at a time when the price of every other form of energy has been falling, and successive delays that leave the project years behind schedule and billions of pounds over budget. On the assumption that he joins David Cameron in retiring in three months time, his successor may take a tougher line and pursue different options.” Jonathan Grant, director at consultants PwC, said: “Many supporters of Brexit [are] also opposed to climate policies such as carbon taxes and efficiency standards.” EDF claims Brexit does not affect their plans, but other big clean energy players have expressed worries. “We still want to grow in the UK, particularly in wind power, but clearly a significant change like an exit from the EU introduces more risk to the sector for an unforeseen period of time,” said a spokesman for Vattenfall. SSE said political risk had risen. “Business really hates uncertainty,” said Nick Molho, at the Aldersgate Group. But he said the global surge in clean energy and action on climate change provided very strong reasons for the UK follow suit, even from outside the EU. “In 2015, the international market for low-carbon goods and services was already worth $5.5tn and this has continued to grow since the successful climate change summit in Paris in December,” he said. “It is in the UK’s interest to continue growing its low-carbon economy, a sector that was worth over £46bn in 2014 and was already employing over 238,000 people directly. The low-carbon economy may fare better [than others] if the government commits to its own targets - the UK is a pretty big market.” Jonathan Gaventa, from thinktank E3G, said that legal EU targets for renewable energy for 2020 had been a major catalyst for investment, but that the bloc’s 2030 target is not nationally binding: “So current UK renewable energy investment is driven by the underlying need for clean energy in the UK. This need does not change.” Prof Rob Gross, at Imperial College London, said one thing was certain: “What seems incontrovertible is that in the energy arena, as in so many parts of the economy which are exposed to external trade, victory for Leave creates uncertainty, risks instability, weakens the UK’s negotiating position and, at least in the short term, discourages investment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2017/oct/17/romney-hythe-dymchurch-railway-family-day-trips-uk-coast","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2017-10-17T10:07:22Z","webTitle":"Take the kids to … Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/oct/17/romney-hythe-dymchurch-railway-family-day-trips-uk-coast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2017/oct/17/romney-hythe-dymchurch-railway-family-day-trips-uk-coast","fields":{"headline":"Take the kids to … Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway","bodyText":"In a nutshell A 90-year-old narrow (15in) gauge steam and diesel railway stretching 14 miles from Hythe to Dungeness on the Channel coast.

You may find some of that joy flattens out a bit after 20 minutes of trundling round the back of bungalows but you should enjoy peering into the shingly gardens with their bright blooms and the odd gnome. But great things await those who make it to the end of the line … Fun fact Comic geniuses Laurel and Hardy were on hand to celebrate the line’s 21st birthday in 1947 amid much hilarity, inserting some trademark slapstick humour into the formalities including the inevitable attempt to squash the stout Oliver Hardy into one of the little carriages. Best thing about it Reaching Dungeness. Its swathes of shingle studded with exotic plant species, lighthouses, old shacks, boat hulks, birdlife and just sheer weirdness make this one of the UK’s most singular railway termini. Oh, and there’s an enormous nuclear power station, too. The older lighthouse is open to visitors and is a superb vantage point (admission £4 adults, £2.50 children) for the area. The one-third-size trains themselves are marvels and you don’t need any engineering expertise to enjoy watching the engines, with their drivers looking comically outsized. Before the shingle kicks in there are long, clean and lovely stretches of sandy beach from Dymchurch – where’s there’s also a permanent funfair of vintage rides – to St Mary’s. What about lunch? The sands of Dymchurch and shingle ridges at Dungeness make for one giant picnic opportunity but the substantial fish and chips at the latter’s station cafe is good value at £9 including a cup of tea. And there can’t be many cafes at which you can sit outside enjoying views of such eclectic buildings, Victorian-era machinery, and a desert (technically speaking). Of the six permanent stations, hot food is also available at Hythe, where a coffee shop and vintage tea room (luxury cream tea £7.45, panini from £3) operate side by side, and at New Romney, which serves all-day fry-ups, and sandwiches from £2.40. At Dungeness there’s a pub, the Britannia also serving revered fish and chips and other home-cooked delights. Exit through the gift shop New Romney is the operation’s HQ, largest and busiest station, and the only one where your offspring can pile on serious pressure to buy stuff. There’s a large range of Thomas the Tank Engine goodies, plus Bigjigs wooden railway packs and, away from the train theme, there are also secondhand books and locally produced toys. Best of all, a large, historic model railway captures children’s imagination and attention for at least the time it takes the adults to slurp a cup of tea down in the cafe and peruse the small but interesting 1940s museum room. Getting there The railway doesn’t link up with Southeastern, although Sandling (two miles from Hythe) and Folkestone West (five miles) mainline stations are close enough to Hythe station for a short bus ride (10A from Sandling, or 30-min woodland walk, various buses from Folkestone) or cheapish taxi ride. By car, leave the M20 at junction 11. The nearest major towns are Ashford and Folkestone. East Sussex’s popular B&amp;B weekend hangout Rye is about 40 minutes’ drive from Dungeness. Hythe, Dymchurch, Dungeness and New Romney stations all have free car parks. The trains are wheelchair accessible with ramps and special compartments, and you can take a bicycle on (extra £2) if you want to go one way and cycle back. Opening hours Various timetables operate at different times of the year but on most days during school holidays trains run between around 9am and 6pm. On quieter non-holiday weekdays the “yellow timetable” operates, which sees only four trains a day depart Hythe, starting at 10.30am. At October half-term there will be special events, such as a Halloween train, and in the run up to Christmas a Santa Express will run at weekends, then every day from 19-24 December. Value for money An all-day adult rover ticket is £18 (£9 for children); and returns between, say, New Romney and Dungeness are £10, so it’s not exactly cheap but few could expect it to be considering all that engineering, line upkeep and coal costs. Verdict 9/10. A memorable day out to an area within reach of London but with a unique atmosphere and identity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/apr/04/pipelines-spectra-energy-keystone-xl-new-york","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-04T11:00:01Z","webTitle":"A pipeline's being expanded 400 ft from my home – wouldn't you be worried? | Courtney M Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/04/pipelines-spectra-energy-keystone-xl-new-york","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/04/pipelines-spectra-energy-keystone-xl-new-york","fields":{"headline":"A pipeline's being expanded 400ft from my home – wouldn't you be worried?","bodyText":"The Keystone XL pipeline was vetoed by President Obama last year as being antithetical to the nation’s climate goals. Yet fights against pipelines continue to rage across the country – including 400 feet from my home in New York state, where a proposed pipeline next to the troubled Indian Point nuclear plant has spurred fears of a Fukushima-like scenario, with New York City lying squarely in an evacuation zone. Spectra Energy, a Texas-based gas company, owns a 9,000-plus-mile pipeline network that stretches from Texas across the midwest and through the north-east, all the way to Canada and the coast. The company is in the process of expanding the north-east section from a 26in pipeline to a 42in high-pressure pipeline in a project called the Algonquin Incremental Market (Aim) Expansion. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Ferc) has approved this pipeline project – and all other ones that have come before them since 1986. Commissioners even allowed Spectra to segment its massive expansion project into three sections, with Aim being only the first of three phases that will stretch from New York to Boston. This practice of segmentation, which allowed Ferc to green-light parts of projects without assessing overall environmental impact, has been the source of successful lawsuits against the agency in the past. As a cancer researcher with a PhD in molecular biology raising a family beside the pipeline route, I am deeply concerned about the threats it poses to health and safety. Expanded compressor stations, needed to repressurize and vent gas along the route, will emit more benzene, volatile organic compounds and methane, all linked to health problems, from cancer to asthma and heart disease. New York state banned high-volume hydraulic fracturing because of the health risks it poses, but it can’t ban infrastructure that will carry fracked gas through the state. Westchester County already has an F in air quality from the American Lung Association; we don’t need even more pollution in our backyards. The Aim proposal is even more dangerous than the average carcinogen-spewing pipeline, though – it’s being built within 105ft of critical safety infrastructure at Indian Point nuclear power plant, less than 35 miles north of New York City. A pipeline accident there that damaged plant infrastructure could, in a worst-case scenario, cause a full-scale meltdown akin to Fukushima. Ferc and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) agree with plant operator, Entergy, that the new 42in pipeline poses no increased risk. But nuclear and pipeline safety experts, as well as elected officials, cite evidence to the contrary. Congresswoman Nita Lowey questioned the NRC chairman at a House appropriations subcommittee hearing last month about the analysis, and documents obtained by a Freedom of Information Act request show the entire safety assessment was based on an unsupported assertion by Spectra Energy that they could shut off the flow of gas in the pipeline within three minutes in an emergency. It’s an estimate that neither Entergy nor the NRC bothered to verify, and which pipeline expert Richard Kuprewicz says is unrealistic. Indian Point is already plagued with safety problems, including an ongoing radioactive leak into the surrounding groundwater, a recent fire and subsequent oil spill into the Hudson river. A disaster at this plant could necessitate the evacuation of New York City. The problem is that there is no evacuation plan for New York City; it’s impossible. We are tempting fate. This isn’t excessive alarmism. There were 318 significant pipeline incidents in 2015 alone; that averages out to six incidents a week. Two former safety inspectors for the Aim pipeline have come forward to blow the whistle on Spectra’s safety practices. They say that pipe parts and welds that were supposed to be x-rayed before installation were buried before required safety checks were completed. That means America’s largest city lies in the evacuation zone of a nuclear plant next to a gas pipeline for which installation safety protocols may have been neglected. (A Spectra spokesperson told Al Jazeera America that the company follows all laws and regulations in addition to having strict internal standards.) Many concerned citizens along the pipeline expansion route – and our elected politicians – have raised the lack of safety precautions with national oversight bodies. Last summer, New York state assembly members David Buchwald and Sandy Galef told Ferc that regulators had approved the pipeline without properly assessing the risks. The Union of Concerned Scientists asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to permit them to conduct an assessment and was ignored. The US just signed an international agreement to limit global climate change, yet we are continuing to build pipelines that spew methane, a gas far more dangerous than carbon dioxide. We need energy efficiency. We need clean, renewable energy that is safe and affordable. And we need federal checks and balances that actually work to prevent unsafe and toxic infrastructure from being built. The health and safety of my – and everyone else’s – family is on the line."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"}]}}
