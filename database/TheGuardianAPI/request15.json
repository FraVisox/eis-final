On closer examination, it turns out that the National Grid has been calmly explaining that a “notification of inadequate system margin” (NISM) is not a last resort. It’s simply part of the standard toolkit for balancing supply and demand, issued this time because of multiple breakdowns at some large power stations. Given that almost all the UK’s coal-fired power stations are over 40 years old, it’s not terribly clear why anyone would expect them to be particularly reliable in the first place. But even if, behind the hysteria, we didn’t come that close to an outage, this episode should nevertheless serve as a wake-up call to a government beset by short-term, last-century thinking on energy. Experts are warning that incidents like this could be a sign of an energy system under increased pressure. Old coal-fired stations are finally shutting down, and the risk is that we don’t have the modern infrastructure in place to ensure a stable supply of the electricity needed to run our homes, offices and industries. There’s certainly no shortage of ministerial hot air about investing in affordable, reliable sources of heat and power. Sometimes low carbon even gets a mention. But plans to build gas-fired power stations and outrageously expensive nuclear plants will fail to solve the systemic problems we face as a result of an energy system that is inefficient and deeply centralised. One big myth exposed by the National Grid’s request for extra generation is about the role of baseload power – the more or less constant power generation currently provided by coal and nuclear power stations. The government has slashed support for renewables while condemning us to decades of higher energy bills to subsidise new nuclear power. This is justified on the basis that we need a constant, reliable source of electricity. Yet the National Grid’s issue of a NISM is about something else entirely – meeting peak demand, as it explained: “We are most likely to issue a NISM for … the half an hour period when families start to get home and cook dinner, but offices and factories are still open.” Indeed, Steve Holliday, the outgoing chief executive of National Grid, said recently that “the idea of large power stations for baseload is outdated”, and noted that “from a consumer’s point of view, the solar on the rooftop is going to be the baseload”. Another myth is that building new power stations is the only way to meet the challenge of peak demand. One alternative – woefully underused in the UK – is energy efficiency and demand-side response: that is, looking to reduce and change demand rather than increasing supply. The UK’s capacity market – set up to ensure enough capacity exists to meet peak demand – allows 1.5% of the total for this type of solution, whereas in the US it’s more like 10%. Smart meters, home and grid-scale batteries that store and release excess renewable power, and other modern solutions would be cheaper and more efficient than building new power stations to meet extra demand during relatively short periods. Moreover, they’re much less polluting and more climate-friendly. The third big myth is that renewable energy is anything but a good thing if your objective is to improve energy security and reduce costs. Germany has more wind and solar but has lower bills for industry – the high level of renewables is actually leading to a reduction in the wholesale price of electricity. This was backed up by a UK study last month. Progress has already been made on decentralising power production – even if the UK is lagging behind. According to the National Grid’s energy scenarios, by 2020 small-scale, distributed generation will represent a third of total capacity in the UK. But the government is now actively undermining progress. Beneath a layer of green spin, ministers are demolishing the UK’s renewable energy and energy-saving policies. Cuts to solar subsidies have already forced firms to shut down – and risk thousands more jobs. Only this week we’ve caught sight of plans to grant hundreds of millions of pounds to highly polluting diesel generation over the next 15 years – running counter to the kind of smart, clean and affordable energy system we need for the 21st century. Another energy future is possible, but it takes political will to make the changes needed to revolutionise the way we power our communities. A system where every household and business generates its own energy from solar panels or other clean power is within close reach. With smart grids and the increasingly sophisticated energy storage solutions available, the UK should be avoiding energy shortages in the future and leading the way in putting power in the hands of local people."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2015/sep/29/nuclear-industry-to-push-for-australia-to-adopt-clean-affordable-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-29T05:50:00Z","webTitle":"Nuclear industry to push for Australia to adopt 'clean, affordable power'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/29/nuclear-industry-to-push-for-australia-to-adopt-clean-affordable-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/sep/29/nuclear-industry-to-push-for-australia-to-adopt-clean-affordable-power","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear industry to push for Australia to adopt 'clean, affordable power'","bodyText":"The nuclear industry will lobby for nuclear energy in Australia, saying the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, should embrace the technology as a way to slash greenhouse gas emissions. The Australian Nuclear Association (ANA) will accompany Danny Roderick, chief executive of the leading US nuclear technology firm Westinghouse, to talk to government ministers and business leaders in Canberra and Sydney next week. Roderick said nuclear power could help produce “clean, reliable, affordable electricity for more people”. “We’d like to help Australia explore ways to create jobs and economic opportunity that are also good for the environment,” he said. The ANA is optimistic that the change in Australia’s prime ministership will mean nuclear will be looked at “on its merits”. The move is the latest attempt to overturn legal obstacles to nuclear energy generation in Australia. Federal environmental law bans building nuclear reactors, and an attempt by the Family First senator, Bob Day, to scrap a separate law that blocks building reactors and uranium enrichment plants was halted in August by the Tony Abbott government. Australia has nearly a third of the world’s known uranium supplies but there has long been bipartisan political opposition to creating a nuclear industry, although South Australia is exploring it. The problem of disposing of nuclear waste in Australia has also proved highly controversial. The ANA says nuclear is a better option to cut emissions from electricity than renewable sources such as solar and wind. “My concern is that renewables won’t get us across the line in terms of emissions reduction,” said Rob Parker, the president of the ANA. “Nuclear is more reliable and it has a smaller resources footprint than renewables. “Until we approach the issue of carbon abatement honestly, we won’t replace coal because it is the cheapest fuel we have. Nuclear is dead until we acknowledge carbon abatement is the main issue. We already pay a premium for renewables but we need to go further or we’ll just keep burning coal.” Parker denied that nuclear was prohibitively expensive, estimating that Australia could build 29 reactors for $160bn with companies such as Westinghouse “lining up” to invest. He also claimed “strong community support” for nuclear despite the Fukishima disaster in Japan, which prompted the German government to phase out its nuclear energy supply. The first target of the lobbying push is to overturn an Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act ban on the nuclear development process. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, said there was no plan to change government policy. However, he was not “philosophically opposed” to nuclear energy. Research conducted by the University of New South Wales last year found that it was feasible to transition to 100% renewable energy without the need for nuclear power. Separate analysis conducted by the federal government in 2013 put the cost of 100% renewable energy to be between $219bn and $332bn by 2050. Jim Green, an anti-nuclear campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said it was unlikely that nuclear would ever be feasible in Australia. “Nuclear is expensive and it’s getting more expensive as time goes on,” he said. “The start-up costs would be spectacular. Once you involve the employment of thousands of specialist scientists and technicians, land acquisition and a new regulatory system you’d almost certainly need government subsidies. “There is no reality to this. There’s no technology that is vaguely acceptable to Australia available at a cost of $5.5bn a reactor. “We don’t need a bridge from fossil fuels to renewables, we just need renewables. It’s viable and affordable. There is a lot of rhetoric around a nuclear renaissance, but not much else.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2016/aug/07/china-huwaei-cell-uk-national-security-cyber-surveillance-hacking","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-07T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"The Chinese firm taking threats to UK national security very seriously","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/07/china-huwaei-cell-uk-national-security-cyber-surveillance-hacking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2016/aug/07/china-huwaei-cell-uk-national-security-cyber-surveillance-hacking","fields":{"headline":"The Chinese firm taking threats to UK national security very seriously","bodyText":"Welcome to the Cell. All visitors must surrender their phones at the door. No cameras or filming equipment allowed. In a deceptively humdrum office block on the outskirts of Banbury, Oxfordshire, a team of cybersecurity experts is working to combat the risk of surveillance and hacking attacks from China. The Cell’s technicians have the highest level of security clearance, with their personal and financial histories combed by investigating officers. Their work is overseen by a board that includes directors from GCHQ, the Cabinet Office and the Home Office. But the Cell’s staff are not on the British government payroll. They are employed by Huawei, one of China’s largest technology companies. A maker of broadband and mobile network equipment, its kit is installed all over the UK. In Banbury, the task is to check Huawei hardware and software for faults and bugs that could be exploited for nefarious purposes. Circuit boards are dismantled, and millions of lines of software code are analysed. The centre was created as a compromise – between the security concerns of intelligence agencies and the private sector’s desire for cheap imported technology. With George Osborne’s ejection from the Treasury, China has lost its main cheerleader in government. The new prime minister, Theresa May, is taking a more cautious approach. A decision on allowing the Beijing-backed Hinkley Point power station project to go ahead has been delayed at her request. In a climate of cooling economic relations, could the Cell provide a model for managing the potential risks of Chinese involvement in critical national infrastructure? Perhaps. Up and running for five years now, the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre, to use its official name, is regarded as a success by the board of government officials which oversees its work. In their second annual report, published this spring, they found the arrangements to ensure the Cell was independent from Huawei were operating “robustly and effectively”, and that any potential threats to national security “have been sufficiently mitigated”. But in 2013, the Banbury operation was heavily criticised by parliament’s intelligence and security committee, then chaired by the former defence secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind. MPs had decided to review its work after a US senate report raised the alarm, urging American firms not to use the company’s equipment. Attempts by Huawei to take over US technology companies had been blocked. In Australia, it was barred from bidding for the country’s multibillion-pound project to connect every home to a superfast broadband service. Rifkind’s committee concluded that the Cell’s staff should not be Huawei employees. His report warned this amounted to Huawei “effectively policing themselves”. He recommended Banbury be staffed by GCHQ, and failing that, subject to much greater scrutiny by government officials. And so, in 2014, security experts from the highest echelons of the civil service were brought together, along with representatives of Vodafone, Huawei and BT, to create the Cell’s oversight board. It is currently chaired by Ciaran Martin, director general for cybersecurity at GCHQ. Concerns persist. Ernst &amp; Young, hired to evaluate whether the Cell is truly independent from Huawei headquarters, concluded that the ability of the company to set the bonus of the Cell’s managing director, David Pollington, hired from Microsoft last year, “provides a vector by which performance ... could be influenced”. Ernst &amp; Young argued that “by withholding or awarding the bonus (irrespective of performance), which constitutes a significant element of the reward package, the bonus could be used as a tool to motivate certain behaviours from the MD”. The risk was reconsidered, but “accepted as reasonable”, according to the 2016 annual report. A spokesman for the company points out that the Huawei and Hinkley scenarios are not quite comparable. The technology firm sells its equipment to other companies which then own and manage it. At Hinkley, the proposal is to sell a stake to the Chinese state, and in return for the investment, allow it to build Chinese-designed reactors at a new nuclear power station in Bradwell, Essex. So what kind of risk does Huawei’s equipment present? The company makes everything from the routers and switches that steer traffic across the internet, to BT’s green street cabinets, to the transmission equipment used in mobile phone masts. Sending an email from your home computer, making a mobile phone call from a street corner, or using the tablet to order a weekly shop – wherever you are in the UK, the chances are your private communications will be carried over Huawei equipment. With customers in Europe, the Americas, Africa and of course China, it claims to connect a third of the world’s population. Founded by a former Red Army officer, Ren Zhengfei, the firm has no public list of shareholders, but it claims to be privately owned and independent from the state. Its biggest UK customers are Vodafone and BT. Until recently the only British-owned mobile network, Vodafone has carved out a niche as the largest supplier to government ministries and major corporations. The phone calls made by the prime minister and her cabinet run over its network. BT’s broadband grid stretches from Whitehall to remote rural areas and is still the largest in the UK, supplying much of the infrastructure used by rivals including TalkTalk and Sky to connect their customers. The concern is that so-called “back doors”, hidden in the Huawei software, could be used to eavesdrop on sensitive government, military and business communications. They could even be used to disrupt or shut down mobile networks in the event of a conflict. “Bugs can be hidden in sloppy code,” says Graeme Batsman, a data security consultant and blogger at datasecurityexpert.co.uk. “China and others are known for spying. But I don’t think China is a terrorist state which would make these devices explode one day. The UK and US are probably just as bad anyway.” Indeed, the papers leaked from America’s National Security Agency by Edward Snowden revealed that it had hacked into Huawei’s headquarters, obtaining technical information and monitoring the communications of its top executives. One of the reported aims was to try and uncover vulnerabilities in the products to use them for US surveillance operations. The Cell has identified multiple vulnerabilities in Huawei products. The latest annual report warns: “Code quality has shown signs of improvement, but remains below industry good practice.” More than 100 concerns had been raised with Huawei’s research and development arm in China, the 2015 report stated. Three issues identified that year resulted in interventions having to be made in equipment already deployed in telecoms networks. On the plus side, using company staff to identify faults means they are more likely to be fixed quickly. And the cooperation has brought cash into the UK. In 2012, Ren met with David Cameron to promise £1.3bn of procurement and investment. The following year, after Rifkind’s inquiry, he confirmed the deal when Osborne visited Shenzhen. For Huawei, the monitoring arrangement not only improves its products, but makes good business sense. Cooperating with the UK advertises its trustworthiness to other foreign governments. Reassuring the prime minister is another matter. Vince Cable has revealed that while he was in government, May was “never completely satisfied about Huawei”. The Cell’s recent efforts may have quelled those fears. For now, it is business as usual in Banbury."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/aug/08/britain-trading-relationship-china-hinkley-point","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-08T05:59:24Z","webTitle":"Britain has struck out for a special relationship with China.

If only we knew the way","bodyText":"Less than a year ago, George Osborne boasted of a “golden decade” in ties with China. It was grand rhetoric for a cobbled together package of red carpet visits, a problematic nuclear energy project and deals like the £45m agreement to export the UK’s finest pig semen. But even the cynics didn’t expect the shine to come off quite so quickly. Britain has just blindsided Beijing twice: through its shock announcement that the centrepiece nuclear project is on hold, pending a fresh review, and by voting to leave the European Union. The swift reversal on Hinkley Point C epitomises the dilemma posed by China’s ascendance. Other countries dutifully talk about partnership and win-win pacts, and there has been real progress on areas such as climate change. But for the most part, they have found themselves torn between the lure of the world’s second largest economy and their alarm at its might – its increasing influence and assertiveness, its authoritarian leadership, nationalism and hefty military investments, and its desire to reset the rules, as rising powers usually do. Tony Abbott said privately while he was Australia’s prime minister that his country’s China policy was driven by “fear and greed”. He could have spoken for many of his counterparts. When Osborne took charge of China policy, ushering through the deal for investment in the French-built nuclear plant, greed took the lead. Some of the steps were sensible and even admirable – seeking cooperation on a space programme; leading support for Beijing’s new development bank in the face of churlish US opposition. But Britain’s hushed response in a string of cases showed that despite the lip service to human rights they were “not one of our top priorities … the prosperity agenda is further up the list”, as a top official conceded of foreign policy in general. Though Theresa May’s spokesman says the UK will still seek a strong relationship – China National Nuclear Corporation was yesterday revealed to be on a government list of those deemed eligible to develop small modular reactors – the prime minister’s instincts appear fearful. She reportedly expressed “severe reservations” about getting too close, and her joint chief-of-staff has previously raised concerns that the Chinese could build weaknesses into nuclear projects allowing them to shut down energy production. There is a more obvious reason to ditch the plant: its questionable technology and excessive price tag. Analysts suggest that should relations deteriorate to a point where China might contemplate turning the lights out, we would probably have bigger problems to deal with anyway. Still, the US, for example, has been much more cautious, mindful perhaps that China has a variable safety record and a culture of cover-up. On Hinkley Point, says Nigel Inkster of the International Institute for Strategic Studies and formerly of MI6, the risks “are ultimately manageable if you are prepared to acknowledge they exist”. Though Beijing’s response so far has been muted, it will not have appreciated the embarrassingly last-minute nature of the Hinkley rethink, and the airing of suspicions about Chinese intentions. If the nuclear project is ditched for good, it is likely to be much more vocal. Four years ago, it punished us in retaliation for David Cameron’s meeting with the Dalai Lama. High-level visits halted and state media trolled the UK as “merely a country of old Europe suitable only for tourism and overseas students, with a few decent football teams”. But trade still went up and Beijing still approached London to initiate projects. It knew we had our uses. Osborne understood the importance of China’s power better than most. But he wasted our own, albeit waning, influence. Britain is still boosted by the legacy of our empire, such as our permanent seat on the security council. Until recently, we offered China a gateway to Europe and a voice inside it, lobbying against anti-dumping rules, for example. China’s own economic woes mean that entrepreneurs are looking outwards, and Beijing wants to diversify its foreign holdings away from dollars. Britain still looks like a fairly safe bet if you want a decent return on investment; that’s why Chinese companies own Weetabix, a slice of Thames Water and, as of Friday, West Bromwich Albion FC. More may come in search of post-Brexit bargains. Our soft power is born not just of Jane Austen, James Watt and Benedict Cumberbatch, but also our political, legal and economic culture, for all its flaws. China has tried and failed to buy its way to soft power. The Hinkley Point project was in large part about borrowing our reputation – showing that we trusted the China General Nuclear Power Corporation not only to cooperate on the EDF plant, but more importantly to design and build its own reactors at Bradwell in Essex, with a view to further overseas deals. For the leadership, the Hinkley delay and the manner of its announcement will reinforce the conviction that democracy is not only a threat to their power, but also a bad, unpredictable, even irresponsible way of running a country. It is perhaps even more dismayed by Brexit. We have lost a large part of our value to it; and at the same time lost the strength in numbers we enjoyed in dealing with it. The prospect of a bilateral trade agreement compensating for Brexit-induced economic woes seems slim, even putting aside the years it would take to thrash out a deal, with experienced negotiators in short supply. We need China more than ever, and have less to offer them; especially since other advantages – the City of London, world-class universities – have to deal with the impact of Brexit too. The price for Osborne’s unabashed embrace of China has been our credibility, at a time when we need it most. The relegation of human rights told Beijing that we would cave if pressed hard enough on an issue. It undermined Chinese activists and lawyers, made it tougher for other countries to tackle the issueand bolstered the argument that western concerns for rights are selective (which is often true) and another way of attacking it (which is not). That is a practical issue for the UK as well as a moral one. While Hinkley Point was dominating front pages, news from China garnered less attention: the trials of human rights lawyers, part of a sweeping crackdown on civil society and dissenting voices. Zhou Shifeng, jailed for seven years for subversion, had represented families hit by the scandal of melamine-tainted milk powder which killed six infants and sickened 300,000, partly because of a cover-up by the firm and local officials, and self-censorship by journalists who feared retaliation. It is Zhou, and people like him, who have sought to promote the rule of law and accountability: things we should also wish to see prioritised there. Osborne and co pleased China’s leadership when they rowed back on human rights, but they sold its citizens short – and Britain too. They pursued their strategy without sufficient thought, adequate consideration of the repercussions or a deep enough understanding of our potential partners – at a time when Beijing has displayed increasing hostility to western ideas and a tougher approach to western businesses. The prime minister should learn from Osborne’s focus on China, without adopting his unalloyed enthusiasm, but her job has been made much harder by his compromises."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2015/oct/21/david-cameron-xi-jinping-talks-day-two-state-visit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-20T23:01:04Z","webTitle":"David Cameron and Xi Jinping to talk business on day two of state visit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/21/david-cameron-xi-jinping-talks-day-two-state-visit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/oct/21/david-cameron-xi-jinping-talks-day-two-state-visit","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron and Xi Jinping to talk business on day two of state visit","bodyText":"David Cameron’s charm offensive towards China’s president, Xi Jinping, will intensify on Wednesday when he will offer cheap visas for Chinese tourists and welcome billions of pounds in business deals with Beijing, including in nuclear power. The second day of Xi’s state visit will be taken up with trade summits and a bilateral meeting in Downing Street, with the two countries heralding £30bn of new business deals between them. The biggest of these is likely to be an investment by China’s state nuclear power companies in two new plants being built by the French firm EDF at Hinkley Point in Somerset, rumoured to be worth in the region of £8bn per plant. EDF will give an update on its new site as it prepares to make a final investment decision. Its chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz, said the proposal would boost employment and lead the “revitalisation of the new nuclear programme”. George Osborne, the chancellor, has been seeking money from the Chinese for the HS2 rail line, advertising £11.8bn of contracts on his recent trip to the country, and for the so-called “Northern powerhouse”, an array of developments in the north of England. While Xi is expected to bring promises of cash for UK infrastructure, Cameron will unveil a new visa regime giving Chinese tourists cheaper access for multiple visits than travellers from other countries. He will cut the price of a two-year multiple-entry visa from £384 to £84, the current price of a six-month visa. The government is also looking at reducing the cost of a 10-year multiple-entry visa down to the same level, and extending mobile finger-printing services for visa applications from nine to 50 Chinese cities. Downing Street said the special treatment for Chinese tourists was a sign that the UK was prioritising them as visitors. The scheme risks antagonising other countries, whose citizens will not be afforded the same privileges, but No 10 said it could be extended to travellers from other nations if successful. The prime minister’s spokeswoman said reciprocal arrangements for UK travellers to China were under discussion but had not yet been agreed. The deal is intended to capitalise on Chinese tourists’ high spending, on average worth £2,680 per visit. The scheme will be unveiled when Xi attends an event at Lancaster House with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to celebrate the creative industries, where displays will include items related to James Bond, Wallace and Gromit, the BBC’s Poldark adaptation and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. The president will visit Imperial College London with Osborne and the Duke of York, where closer research ties between the two countries will be announced. Xi will then have a face-to-face meeting with Cameron, flanked by ministers, on issues from global security to poverty and climate change. Cameron will also engage Xi on the threat of terrorism and extremism, potentially seeking to persuade China to stop joining Russia in vetoing UN resolutions on Syria. Cameron has promised to raise the plight of the UK steel industry, which is cutting thousands of jobs and mothballing plants, The cuts have been blamed on China dumping cut-price steel on the market. Under pressure from Labour, the trade unions and industry, Cameron said he would mention the issue, but his spokeswoman would not reveal how strongly he was prepared to object to China’s behaviour. She would only say he would raise the matter and discuss how the actions of one country can impact on another. Asked whether Cameron accepted that the Chinese were dumping steel, she said: “There are a number of challenges – competitive pricing from China is one of them.” Following his meeting in Downing Street, Xi will attend a UK-China business summit at Mansion House, where the bulk of trade deals are expected to be announced. Later he will visit offices of the Chinese technology company Huawei and give a speech at a banquet held in his honour by the lord mayor of London at the Guildhall. Before Xi’s trip, Cameron was repeatedly accused of being over-accommodating towards the Chinese for commercial reasons, while playing down human rights and security issues. YouGov research for the Free Tibet group found 69% of those surveyed believe the Dalai Lama was right to say Cameron’s approach towards China was: “Money, money, money. That’s what this is about.

After months of debate about safety, Japan will begin producing nuclear energy for the first time in almost two years close to the town of Satsumasendai as early as Tuesday. Restarting one of the Sendai nuclear plant’s two 30-year-old reactors represents a victory for the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who insists that without nuclear energy the Japanese economy will buckle beneath the weight of expensive oil and gas imports. But his call for Japan to confront its Fukushima demons has been greeted with scepticism by most voters, whose opposition to nuclear restarts remains firm, even in the face of rising electricity bills. Just over four years since Fukushima Daiichi had a triple meltdown, triggering the world’s worst nuclear crisis for 25 years, Japan remains deeply divided over its future energy mix. The 2011 disaster forced the evacuation of 160,000 people and the closure of all the country’s 48 working reactors for safety checks. Opinions among the 100,000 residents of Satsumasendai range from anxiety to relief. Local campaigners say the plant operators – Kyushu Electric – and local authorities have yet to explain how they would quickly evacuate tens of thousands of residents in the event of a Fukushima-style meltdown. “There are schools and hospitals near the plant, but no one has told us how children and the elderly would be evacuated,” said Yoshitaka Mukohara, a representative of a group opposing the Sendai restart. “Naturally there will be gridlock caused by the sheer number of vehicles, landslides, and damaged roads and bridges.” A survey by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper found that only two of 85 medical institutes and 15 of 159 nursing and other care facilities within a 30 km radius of the Sendai plant had proper evacuation plans. About 220,000 people live within a 30km radius – the size of the Fukushima no-go zone – of the Sendai plant; a 50km radius would draw in Kagoshima city and raise the number of affected people to 900,000. “I can’t begin to imagine how chaotic that would be,” Mukohara said. Massive earthquakes of the kind that sparked the Fukushima meltdown are not the only potential hazard. The Sendai facility is surrounded by a group of five calderas, and Sakurajima, one of Japan’s most active volcanoes, is just 50km away, leaving the plant exposed to volcanic ash fallout, and, in the most extreme scenario, lava flows. There are doubts, too, about the reliability of an ageing reactor that has not been used since it was shut down for safety checks in 2011. “You wouldn’t have much faith in a car that’s been on the road for more than 30 years,” said Mukohara. “So why are we so willing to trust a nuclear reactor?” Shaun Burnie, a nuclear specialist at Greenpeace Germany, accused Japan’s government and nuclear industry of cutting corners in its desperation to put reactors back online. “They are disregarding fundamental principles of nuclear safety and public health protection,” Burnie said. “The same players in the ‘nuclear village’ that delivered Japan the Fukushima Daiichi tragedy in 2011 are attempting to kick-start nuclear power again.” Sendai reactor No 1 is one of 25 reactors being targeted for possible restarts. “We’ve finally come this far to restart the first reactor,” the trade and industry minister, Yoichi Miyazawa, told reporters recently. The plant’s second reactor is expected to go back into operation in October. Last autumn, the Sendai reactors became the first to clear safety hurdles imposed by a revamped nuclear regulation authority. The restart was approved by 19 of the 26 assembly members in Satsumasendai, located 1,000km south-west of Tokyo, and by the pro-nuclear governor of Kagoshima prefecture, Yuichiro Ito. With national polls showing that most Japanese oppose nuclear restarts, the town’s council is reluctant to gauge local opinion, said Ryoko Torihara, a Satsumasendai resident who is campaigning to the keep the reactors idle. “They won’t conduct a poll of local people because they’re scared of the result,” she said. “They’re aware that Japan has fared perfectly well without nuclear power for almost two years.” A nationwide Kyodo News poll last October found that 60% of respondents opposed an immediate return to nuclear energy, while 31% were in favour. But supporters of the restarts say the long hiatus in nuclear energy production has taken its toll on Satsumasendai’s population. When in operation, the plant contributes up to 3bn yen (£16m) a year to the local economy, according to the local chamber of industry and commerce, much of it via 3,000 workers who descend on the town twice a year to conduct lengthy safety checks. Satsumasendai continues to receive more than 1bn yen in annual government subsidies for hosting the reactors, but some residents complain keeping the plant shuttered for so long has sucked the life out of local commerce, with hotels, restaurants and other service industries reporting a dramatic drop in trade. “This is my hometown and I don’t like to see its economy in trouble,” said Tetsuro Setoguchi, a 27-year-old builder. “We receive lots of subsidies for hosting the nuclear plant, and if they dry up it will be difficult for the town to function. “Lots of jobs depend on the plant, especially in the construction industry. I’m sure that every single builder here wants the reactors to be restarted.” Kyushu Electric, which last August received a 100bn yen bailout from a state-owned bank to survive, estimates that putting one reactor back online would help it reduce costs from burning fossil fuels by about 7.4bn yen a month. The utility is reeling from four straight years of losses, and nuclear operators across Japan say they have incurred tens of billions of dollars in losses as a result of Fukushima-enforced plant closures. Before Fukushima, nuclear provided 30% of Japan’s energy needs, and there were plans to increase its share to around 50%. Post-Fukushima, the Abe administration has set nuclear an ambitious target of a 20-22% share of the total energy mix by 2030. As it prepares to lead Japan into a new, uncertain age of nuclear power generation, the Sendai plant is a fortress protected by high perimeter fences and patrolled by security guards. At a tent village set up on a windswept beach just along the coast, anti-nuclear activists refuse to accept that Japan’s imminent nuclear reboot is inevitable. “We will do all we can to stop it,” said Yoshiharu Ogawa, who has travelled from his home near Tokyo. “The local authorities may have approved the restart, but they are completely out of touch with public opinion.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/jul/06/brexit-britain-property-bubble","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-06T19:53:55Z","webTitle":"Ignore the prophets of doom.

Brexit will be good for Britain","bodyText":"“We have had no end of a lesson: it will do us no end of good!” So said Rudyard Kipling of the Boer war, and he might well say the same today. David Cameron’s wild European gamble has failed. He and the British establishment took democracy for granted. They lined up all the toffs and boffins, the chief executives, tycoons and clever-clogs in the (south of the) land, and asked the nation to pat them on the back. The invitation to a punch in the face was too good to miss. Now, with blood barely dry on their lips, project fear has mutated into project stupid-idiots. I find it staggering that the remain minority can accuse the Brexit majority of not knowing truth from lies – unlike in all elections? – and could not have meant its vote. It should therefore be asked to vote a second time, and show due respect to its elders and betters. What planet are these people on? I would guess the leavers in a second vote would soar to 60%, out of sheer fury. Brexit is starting to deliver. British politics was constipated and has now overdosed on laxative. It is experiencing a great evacuation. It has got rid of a prime minister and is about to get rid of a leader of the opposition. It will soon be rid of a chancellor of the exchequer and a lord chancellor. It is also rid of two, if not four, Tory heirs apparent. Across the spectrum the left is on the brink of upheaval and perhaps historic realignment, if only the Liberal Democrats have the guts to engineer it. The Greens and Ukip have both lost their leaders. An entire political class is on the way out. As Oscar Wilde said of the death of Little Nell, it would take a heart of stone not to laugh. During the referendum I was persuaded neither by project fear nor by Brexit’s projected sunny uplands. I thought, and still think, time and compromise will eventually stabilise Britain’s relations with the EU as not so different from today. Whether the stabiliser is joining the European Economic Area (within the letter, if not the spirit, of Brexit) or some other arrangement – who knows? I voted remain because I felt Europe’s future to be so precarious as desperately to need Britain’s more forceful presence. I feel that more strongly after the news that the European parliament leader, Martin Schulz, wants to move the EU swiftly to a “one government” federal constitution. Meanwhile, as the air clears, Cameron’s government suddenly seems old and tired, stuck in a morass of failing policies, special interests and vanity projects. Reforms to health, housing and welfare are defunct. Schools and universities are slithering into blind targetry. Planning is riddled with corruption. No one dares challenge the chancellor on his high-speed trains, nuclear power stations and London runways. For all the talk of a widening gulf between rich and poor, the favour shown to banks and foreign money is astonishing. The referendum has shone an overdue spotlight on the divide between London and the provinces, between country and town, and between the more and the less educated. While I reject the liberal consensus, that Brexiters are working-class racists too stupid to know a tax from a tariff, the social division revealed by the vote was glaring. It is also ingrained. Boris Johnson rightly derided the London media for behaving as if mourning a “national” disaster. No one reported the celebrations and street parties that greeted Brexit up north. Never were two Englands more apart. Now we have the backtracking on project fear. Of course there is uncertainty and an initial lack of confidence. It would be amazing if the pound did not “take a knock” this week or if bank shares and house prices did not plummet, poor things. Remain’s ludicrous prophecies of doom cannot have helped, any more than can Whitehall’s failure to prepare for a Brexit outcome. Will there be a Chilcot report into the lack of contingency planning? It appears that, after all, there is to be no emergency Brexit budget, no tax rise, no enhanced austerity. Indeed, the Treasury, for which the referendum has been an all-time low, promises not higher income tax, but lower corporation tax. The Bank of England will pump more money into the economy, or at least into the banks. There will be lower interest rates and a relaxation in reserve ratios. The speculative fever that has fuelled the London property bubble will end. The capital’s demented skyline is already ruined, but may win some respite. It will stand as an enduring monument to the Cameron-Johnson era: one of ugly, uncontrolled greed. I cannot see that as bad news. George Osborne’s patchy attempt to rebalance the geography of growth has far to go. But a stark referendum lesson is that those who live by centralising power and wealth in the capital can easily die by it. London is big enough and rich enough to prosper in some new relationship with the EU – witness this week’s merger of the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges. But a bit of post-traumatic stress disorder on London’s part is good. So too would be some indication from the Tory candidates of how they intend seriously to devolve wealth from Kensington to Consett. All governments, democratic as well as authoritarian, tend in time towards the Augean stables. They need regular cleaning out. But the cleaning is rarely at moments of their choosing, and the effort can be Herculean. Britain suffered in the fuel crisis of 1973, in the austerity of 1979-81, and in the miners’ strike of 1984-85. All were painful, as now will be Brexit. But all were salutary. Disruption may be a fad of hipster economics. But as Chesterton’s Napoleon of Notting Hill reflected in the heat of battle, there is nothing like being hit over the head “with six feet of pole with six pounds of steel” to cause you to “re-examine philosophies and religions”. Social democracy and capitalism both need hitting over the head from time to time. It detoxifies them of bureaucracy, monopoly and cronyism. Britain is experiencing such a time. It should do us no end of good."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/sep/22/guardian-view-on-george-osborne-economic-strategy-china","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-22T17:43:52Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on George Osborne’s new economic strategy: it needs to be made explicit and debated | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/22/guardian-view-on-george-osborne-economic-strategy-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/22/guardian-view-on-george-osborne-economic-strategy-china","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on George Osborne’s new economic strategy: it needs to be made explicit and debated","bodyText":"George Osborne’s visit to China this week is an event of genuine significance. But what is principally significant is not the sight of a chancellor of the exchequer auditioning for the post of prime minister, interesting though that is. What matters much more is that Mr Osborne seems to be using the visit to set out – though without quite admitting it – the essential economic statecraft strategy of the current Conservative government. That strategy, given added immediacy by the higher-than-expected borrowing figures announced today, is to make Britain increasingly dependent upon inward investment by rich, often authoritarian, nations in order to help finance UK economic growth while maintaining a low-tax regime at home. There are broad echoes of the Gordon Brown era in this. Mr Brown had to face the conundrum of how to supply the Scandinavian levels of public spending the public would like to see while maintaining the American levels of taxation that the public appears willing to pay. His stealthy strategy was to give the UK financial sector its head in return for taxation which he would direct into extra spending on the NHS, the working poor and the elderly. It was a more socially ambitious plan than anything Mr Osborne has admitted to, but both men took as read the political unpopularity that would follow the use of higher direct taxation to finance public goods. Like Mr Osborne, Mr Brown never quite levelled with the public about what he was doing. The strategy was never put to the electorate in a general election. As now, the strategy only became apparent in retrospect, through the chancellor’s actions. Mr Osborne’s equally stealthy strategic bet is that inward investment, by China and others, will fund large, necessary UK infrastructure projects from which British companies, and hence British workers, will benefit. Other European countries have been equally keen to engage with China for years. But the UK faces dangers that Germany, for example, does not. Germany has a trade surplus with China (though the VW scandal may dent that a little) and a banking surplus too. Britain, by contrast, is running a trade deficit and will now become even more of a debtor country as a result of deals like the one for new UK nuclear power plants that Mr Osborne announced this week. The reluctance to be explicit about the strategy carries big political and democratic costs. It means that Britain does not discuss the proper limits of Chinese penetration of UK infrastructure, including national energy needs. It means that the British economy is placed in a more dependent relationship with China, at a time when China’s growth is stalling and its stock market faltering. It means that Britain, its foreign policy increasingly in the hands of the Treasury rather than the Foreign Office, has an interest in not challenging Beijing on issues such as human rights. None of these strategies have been seriously debated outside the corridors of Whitehall. They should be, even though the horse has bolted and the stable door is wide open. And the terms of the nuclear power deal should be made public too. There is something particularly weird about this. In one part of the Tory forest, issues of sovereignty and national destiny are all-consuming. Every twist and turn of the relationship with the EU, including the issue of migration in today’s ministerial meeting, is dominated by the Conservative insistence on the UK’s sovereign right to stand apart. Yet in Mr Osborne’s part of the forest, sovereignty is an almost meaningless concept. China, Russia and the Gulf states can buy up British national assets with the active encouragement of a government that anxiously oils the deals with obliging conditions. In Whitehall, it is hard to know whether there is any such concept as a key national asset. But you can bet your bottom yuan that there is no uncertainty about the concept in Beijing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2016/sep/04/theresa-may-refuses-to-guarantee-brexit-pledges-on-immigration-and-nhs","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-05T08:07:26Z","webTitle":"Theresa May refuses to commit to Brexit pledges on immigration and NHS","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/04/theresa-may-refuses-to-guarantee-brexit-pledges-on-immigration-and-nhs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/sep/04/theresa-may-refuses-to-guarantee-brexit-pledges-on-immigration-and-nhs","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May refuses to commit to Brexit pledges on immigration and NHS","bodyText":"Theresa May has cast doubt on whether Brexit will lead either to a points-based immigration system or an extra £100m a week for the NHS – two central promises made by the successful campaign to leave the European Union. The prime minister declined to endorse pledges made by the official Vote Leave group as she headed to China for the G20 summit, where Japan and the US have issued strong warnings about the consequences of exiting the EU. In an unprecedented set of demands over the terms of Britain’s exit, Tokyo said Japanese firms could move to other parts of Europe unless many of the current privileges of membership were maintained. Speaking from her prime ministerial plane, May questioned whether the type of system that admits migrants based on their skills was effective, and did not rule out retaining preferential access arrangements for EU citizens. “One of the issues is whether or not points-based systems do work,” she said, stressing that there was “no single silver bullet” on reducing immigration. May also refused to commit to working towards the promises made by Vote Leave of an extra £100m a week to the NHS, scrapping VAT on fuel bills or ending contributions to the EU budget. She would only say: “I’m going to work for what I just said I’m going to work for: the best possible deal for the UK in terms of the relationship that we would have with the EU, following us leaving.” Her decision not to endorse the key planks of the Vote Leave manifesto may anger some of the electorate who thought they were voting for firm pledges made by politicians now senior in May’s government, such as Boris Johnson. On becoming prime minister, May satisfied many Tory leave campaigners with a pledge that “Brexit means Brexit”, but she has not set out what this means, beyond a pledge to move away from the current system of free movement of EU citizens. The prime minister has repeatedly said she intends to make a success of leaving the EU but admitted this weekend that there were difficult times ahead for the economy, even though it is currently doing better than many predicted before the 23 June referendum. She backed the position of the former chancellor George Osborne that there were no plans for more welfare cuts, but left the door open for this to shift if the economy deteriorated. “We are continuing the plans we have as a government,” she said. “Obviously we have to look and see what happens in the economy, and how the economy does start to move ... We’ve got the plans that are there at the moment. And obviously anyone would be looking at how the economy pans out.” May’s comments on the way to Hangzhou in China were made before what turned out to be a trying start to the international summit. She had been hoping to pitch the UK as a global leader in free trade during her first major outing on the world stage. However, she was immediately confronted with warnings about the consequences of leaving the EU, as well as diplomatic tensions with the Chinese over their proposed investment in UK nuclear power. After her first bilateral meeting with President Obama, May was told that the US wanted to focus on trade negotiations with the EU and a bloc of Pacific nations before considering a deal with the UK. The message from Japan to the UK subsequently emerged, warning of a series of corporate exits from the UK unless some of the privileges that come with access to the single market are maintained. The document from Tokyo lists the possible consequences of Brexit and a series of specific requests from significant Japanese investors. “Japanese businesses with their European headquarters in the UK may decide to transfer their head-office function to continental Europe if EU laws cease to be applicable in the UK after its withdrawal,” the report concludes. Earlier, Obama had promised to work hard to stop “adverse effects” of Brexit and said a very special relationship between the two nations still existed. But he also made clear that it would not make sense to prioritise a UK trade deal above existing negotiations with EU and Pacific countries. “We are going to do everything we can to make sure the consequences of the decision don’t end up unravelling what is already a very strong and robust economic relationship,” he said. “But first things first. The first task is figuring out what Brexit means with respect to Europe. And our first task is making sure we go forward on TTIP [Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership] negotiations in which we have already invested a lot of time and effort.” May received better news from Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian prime minister, on Monday as he predicted an early trade deal between the two nations and offered all help and assistance to the UK after the vote for Brexit. At the start of his meeting with May in Hangzhou, Turnbull told her: “Britain’s made a very momentous and historic choice to leave the European Union and we have already been engaged in discussions with you about what the free trade arrangements may look like after that. “Australia is determined to provide Britain with all the support and assistance that we can.” May told him that in the post-Brexit era the UK wanted to be “even more outward-looking” and “obviously, Australia, with our long-standing ties and our close relationship, will be one of the first countries we will be looking to”. It is understood that David Davis, May’s new secretary of state for exiting the EU, will update parliament on Monday about the government’s work towards Brexit, as MPs return after the summer recess. May is likely to come under pressure from MPs on both sides of the debate, as well as companies, to be more specific about her Brexit vision in the coming weeks. Vote Leave, led by May’s cabinet ministers Johnson, Andrea Leadsom and Priti Patel, had promised the electorate before the EU referendum that voting out would mean a “genuine Australian-style, points-based immigration system” by the time of the next election. The campaign group said those seeking to move to Britain should be admitted on the basis of their skills, without discrimination on the grounds of nationality, making clear EU citizens should not be given any preferential access to the UK. Asked about bringing in a points-based immigration system, May said: “A lot of people talk about points-based systems always being the answer in immigration. There is no single silver bullet that is the answer in terms of dealing with immigration.” When pressed on whether failing to bring in such a system would not respect the reasons people voted for Brexit, May said: “People voted, I think, for control. What they wanted to see was control of the freedom of movement of the European Union countries into the United Kingdom.” During the referendum campaign, in which she backed remain, May had appeared to be negative about the idea of a points-based system but this is her first steer on the subject since the vote. She was also asked about whether she would hand more money to the NHS, and scrap VAT on energy bills using funds saved by leaving the EU. These were two more promises made by Vote Leave, whose senior politicians toured the country in a bus saying £350m a week sent to the EU could help fund the NHS instead. Shortly before the vote, this was refined by Vote Leave to a promise of £100m a week more for the NHS out of money saved from ending contributions. Asked whether she would work towards these goals, May would not commit to either pledge. She also would not rule out giving any contributions to the EU budget or retaining full access to the single market, which many Eurosceptic Conservative MPs and Ukip figures would find unacceptable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/apr/25/work-easier-than-love-monday","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-25T09:08:33Z","webTitle":"Why work is much easier than love | Alain de Botton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/25/work-easier-than-love-monday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/25/work-easier-than-love-monday","fields":{"headline":"Why work is much easier than love","bodyText":"As a culture we are highly attuned to what is beautiful and moving about love; we know its high points and celebrate its ecstasies in films and songs. By comparison, work is the dull, tedious bit – the thing we have to do to pay the bills. And yet what’s striking is how often work, despite its lack of glamour, in fact turns out to be the easier, more enjoyable and ultimately more humane part of life. There are a number of reasons for this. 1 You have to be professional Work demands that all who walk through the office door must behave “professionally”. What behaving professionally essentially means is that when you are in situations where deep inside you’re tempted to explode, insult, curse and weep, you actually have to handle yourself with stoic calm and reserve. At work, you can’t really be yourself and nor can others around you – which could sound a little fake and therefore inauthentic. But this lack of honesty may in fact be an extremely welcome development compared to a home life where everyone feels a duty to be an utterly frank, uncensored correspondent of their every inner mood and qualms. 2 You get trained The assumption of most jobs is that people who begin them don’t have the first clue about what’s going on. You’re not expected to know the machinery or the protocol by intuition alone. Therefore you’re sent on training programmes and given extensive manuals to read. It might be two years before you’re supposed to understand very much at all. There is no such luxury for lovers, who are meant to “get” one another by immediate instinct and take this speedy comprehension to be a proof of the sincerity of their love. Sometimes lovers will even say they knew they were meant to be together because they could communicate “without needing to speak”. But outside the early days of romance, such aspirations are a pure catastrophe, which can lead lovers to a bias against ever explaining themselves and their desires with appropriate patience and thoroughness. Fatefully for our chances of happiness, in the romantic ideology, love is understood to be an enthusiasm, rather than what it really is: a skill that needs to be learned. 3 Feedback is more sensitive Everyone hates reviews at work, but what deeply kind phenomena they actually are compared with what goes on at home. Reviews are steeped in a culture of tact. One rather tough remark has to be wrapped in at least seven compliments. Work culture knows that people don’t improve and can’t take new ideas on board if they are feeling threatened and humiliated. Home life finds us able to be far less competent teachers. We’re so panicked and frightened by the thought that the other person can’t do what we want them to (even if we haven’t actually ever explained it), we take to trying to teach them by slamming doors and calling them idiots or worse. Sadly, no one has ever learned very much under conditions of hysteria. Furthermore, we’re likely to feel that being taught anything by a lover contravenes the rules of love: we think we need to be loved just for being who we are. Though we are all very flawed, we imagine that love has nothing to do with education, and that the lover who tries to point something out to us is therefore always just being nasty. Rather than doing what all people in a relationship should actually do, which is to do their utmost to improve those they care for through their love. 4 You depend on a job less We rely on work of course, but we’d survive, somehow, if it came to an end. That’s not the feeling we often get around love, especially when there are a couple of kids and a mortgage in common. And the more we depend on someone, the more alarmed we get by any disappointment at their hands. We aren’t nastier around love per se; we’re just a whole lot more dependent – which can end up looking like the same thing. 5. Work is just easier Running a nuclear power station or landing large jets is hardly simple but still very much easier than trying to be happy around another human being in a sexual relationship over many decades. There is simply nothing harder in this world, so complicated are we, so high are our expectations and so very poor is our romantic culture at helping us to raise the quality of our levels of patience, our insights, our feedback sessions and our training manuals. No wonder we’re often really quite happy when it’s finally Monday morning again and we can leave the house and do something properly simple with our lives once more. • Alain de Botton launches his new novel The Course of Love at The School of Life on Wednesday 4 May.

One Thursday evening in October 2015, David Cameron strode into a Buckinghamshire pub with another of the world’s most powerful men to toast the beginning of a golden era of relations between the UK and China. Addressing Britain’s parliament the previous day, President Xi Jinping of China had gushed over the “great new age” of friendship between London and Beijing. “As the Chinese saying goes: a mountain can never be too high or an ocean too deep,” Xi declared. Yet scarcely nine months after their hop-scented embrace in the Plough at Cadsden, the love affair between Cameron and Xi appears to be on the rocks following Britain’s decision to leave the EU and the prime minister’s resignation. “If George Osborne doesn’t get the foreign secretaryship I think the golden [relationship] is beginning to come to a glorious end,” said Steve Tsang, a China expert from the University of Nottingham. “It’s the beginning of the end.” The premature interment will be mourned in both Downing Street and in Zhongnanhai, China’s Kremlin. “I think their initial reaction [to Brexit] was: ‘Fuck!’” said one longstanding observer of the political scene in China’s capital. For Beijing, cosying up to Britain guaranteed it an enthusiastic cheerleader within the EU and a gateway to the bloc, as well as a means of projecting Chinese power, influence and technology around the globe. Bolstered by Xi’s state visit to Britain that October, plans were afoot for Chinese nuclear power stations, a high-speed rail link and even a joint space research programme, as well as making London an offshore trading hub for China’s currency, the renminbi. Wagering that Britain would vote to remain, Beijing also hoped its newly forged allegiance would boost China’s chances of securing market economy status from the EU, making it easier to export to the bloc’s 28 members. Critics accused Cameron of performing an “epic kowtow” in order to curry favour with the Communist party. The US hit out at Britain’s “constant accommodation” of China following its decision in 2015 to become a founder member of the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Downing Street countered that becoming China’s best friend in the west would help secure billions of pounds of investment and foster a decade of economic growth for Britain. “I fundamentally don’t see a contradiction between wanting to increase economic prosperity and raising legitimate issues that people have with human rights,” Osborne told the Guardian during a trip to China’s far west in September 2015, rejecting charges Britain was holding its tongue for fear of upsetting Beijing. Parroting a phrase often deployed by Chinese diplomats, Osborne declared the relationship a “win-win for Britain and China”. With the “golden relationship” seemingly on life support, critics of the policy hope Cameron’s successor will step back from what they describe as an unquestioning courtship of the Communist party. Benedict Rogers, the deputy chair of the Conservative party human rights commission, urged the next prime minister to rethink whether it was right to remain silent on China’s deteriorating human rights situation so as not to jeopardise the partnership. Rogers said the intensifying affair with Beijing had brought about “quite a reversal” from Cameron who had previously met the Dalai Lama and spoken out against political repression during a 2007 trip to China. “It seems as if around about 2012-2013 – more or less coinciding with when Xi Jinping took power – we began to completely change policy and adopt this silence,” Rogers said. “And I think it has been very, very noticeable, particularly in contrast with the approach that Germany has taken.” Rogers admitted, however, that Brexit might enhance rather than end the relationship. “There is a concern that obviously having left the EU the UK will be looking to strengthen new trading relations with other parts of the world and therefore presumably we will want to be looking at doing even more with China.” Tsang said it was possible that if Osborne – the golden era’s main architect – managed to become foreign secretary under Boris Johnson or Theresa May he would “redouble efforts” to woo Beijing and could adopt an “even more craven approach to China”. More likely though was that the Foreign Office, which has deep misgivings about the flirtation, would now seek to reassert its control over China policy and cool relations with the world’s second-largest economy. Nick Bisley, an international relations expert from La Trobe University, said he also believed Britain’s next leader was likely to row back from the friendship, “particularly if you’ve got an America that is trying to be tougher on China and is going to be looking for friends to put pressure on China about the South China Sea and a range of [other] issues”. Publicly, China has lamented Britain’s decision to walk out on the EU. “A lose-lose situation is already emerging,” the Global Times, a Communist party controlled tabloid, argued after last Thursday’s vote. But Tsang said there was a definite silver lining for Xi’s increasingly authoritarian China, “[and] it won’t have taken them more than 30 seconds to realise”. “The referendum shows that democracy really sucks – that democracy does not deliver stability, prosperity [or] responsible government,” Tsang said. “The first priority of the Communist party and of Xi Jinping is the perpetuation of the Communist party’s rule in China. They are fundamentally anti-democratic … And what better illustration of how democracy doesn’t work than to have the oldest, most respected democracy – through a democratic process – get itself into arguably, potentially the biggest mess that the UK has self-generated since the second world war? It is a gift.” The British embassy in Beijing said it was unable to immediately comment on the status of the relationship with China post-Brexit. Hong Lei, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, when asked whether Cameron’s fall meant the era toasted with a pint by Xi and Cameron was over, said: “China-UK relations enjoy a sound momentum for growth. We are willing to work in tandem with the UK to preserve and develop the bilateral relationship.” Tsang said that in the intensely pragmatic world of international diplomacy, neither Beijing nor London could be surprised that after a steamy eight-month fling they were now puckering up for a parting kiss. “This kind of romance is always short,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2016/aug/01/markets-await-uk-and-european-manufacturing-data-as-china-disappoints-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-01T14:10:44Z","webTitle":"UK manufacturing data worse than expected, with mixed US and European results - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/aug/01/markets-await-uk-and-european-manufacturing-data-as-china-disappoints-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2016/aug/01/markets-await-uk-and-european-manufacturing-data-as-china-disappoints-business-live","fields":{"headline":"UK manufacturing data worse than expected, with mixed US and European results - as it happened","bodyText":"Following a positive Markit manufacturing survey, the latest report from the Institute for Supply Managment has come in below expectations. The ISM manufacturing activity index fell to 52.6 in July, down from 53.2 the previous month and lower than the forecast 53. And here, from the report, are some of the views expressed by manufacturers: On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. US manufacturing grew more strongly in July, according to the latest Markit data. Its manufacturing PMI came in at 52.9, up from 51.3 in June and in line with the initial estimates. This is the highest level since October, with the employment index at its best since July 2015, which bodes well for Friday’s non-farm payroll numbers. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said: The stronger manufacturing PMI survey data for July fuel hopes that the sector will act as less of drag on the economy in the third quarter after a disappointing first half of the year. Having signalled the sector’s worst performance for over six years in the second quarter, contributing to a sluggishness in the economy that was later seen in the soft GDP numbers, the improvement in July suggests that manufacturers and exporters will have helped lift the economy at the start of the third quarter. Job creation has also picked up, hopefully in a sign that producers are seeing a brighter picture, coping with a strong dollar and having put the worst of the energy sector’s restructuring behind them. Ahead of the two US manufacturing reports due shortly - first Markit, then the Institute for Supply Management - US markets are edging lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 28 points while the S&amp;P 500 has opened marginally lower. The two surveys tend to be out of sync, but this time both are expected to show slight improvements. There could be more bad economic news for the UK ahead of the Bank of England’s rate decision on Thursday: And on Wednesday comes the UK service sector PMI which is forecast to be flat on June’s figure. Decisive policy action is needed after the poor UK manufacturing figures, writes our economics editor Larry Elliott: So much for the idea that the post-Brexit hit to UK manufacturing was a knee-jerk reaction to the referendum and that the mood would improve as time wore on. The final figures for how industry fared in July are now in, and they were even worse than the flash estimate released 10 days ago. Some analysts had expressed guarded confidence that Theresa May’s arrival in Downing Street might have made companies less gloomy. While it is still possible that there has been an overreaction to the shock Brexit result, the idea that business will ride things out after a month or two of turbulence now looks fanciful. Policy action – and decisive policy action at that – is going to be needed, starting with the Bank of England later this week. More here: Another vote for the Bank of England to not only cut interest rates on Thursday, but also take other measures to help boost the UK economy: A quick comparison of some of the day’s eurozone PMIs: Here’s our story on the poor UK manufacturing figures: Britain’s manufacturing sector shrank at the steepest pace for more than three years in the wake of the vote to leave the EU, forcing factories to cut jobs as they grappled with higher costs and lower demand. News that the decline in manufacturing activity in July was steeper than first thought cemented a view that the Bank of England will cut interest rates this week in a bid to shore up business and consumer spending. The closely watched Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI survey, which polls more than 600 companies monthly, suggested domestic demand for manufacturers’ goods had been hit by uncertainty both before and after the UK’s referendum on EU membership on 23 June. That overshadowed a boost to export orders from a weaker pound, which makes UK goods cheaper. The headline index was the worst since early 2013 and weaker than a “flash” estimate published in July. The new reading, which takes in responses from a greater number of firms, stood at 48.2, down from the flash estimate of 49.1 and lower than 52.4 in June. A reading above 50 denotes expansion while a reading below suggests activity contracted. Responses were collected between 12 and 26 July. The full story is here Elsewhere, and there is some fallout from the unexpected decision last week by the UK government to delay plans for the Hinckley Point C nuclear power station: China has warned Britain that it cannot risk driving away Chinese investors as the country’s official news agency questioned the UK government’s postponement of approval for the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant. Theresa May, the prime minister, is understood to be concerned about the security implications of a planned Chinese investment in Hinkley and has delayed giving the £18bn project the green light. Xinhua news agency said China understood and respected Britain’s requirement for more time to think about the deal. “However, what China cannot understand is the ‘suspicious approach’ that comes from nowhere to Chinese investment in making the postponement,” it said. More here: Could the UK now go into recession? Here’s Barclays: The disappointing UK manufacturing data and the mixed picture from Europe have taken the edge off stock markets. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Coming in even worse than the initial glimpse revealed a few weeks ago the UK managed a paltry July manufacturing PMI of 48.2, the lowest reading for around 3 years. The effects of this contraction territory figure on the FTSE (which is teetering on the edge of a loss thanks largely to the banking sector) were somewhat mitigated by the fact that it only increases the change of action from the Bank of England on Thursday, the situation now perhaps requiring not only a rate cut but something a bit more substantial. Thanks to this line of thought the pound was the one that suffered following the PMI-reveal, slipping 0.4% against the dollar and 0.3% against the euro. The Eurozone had similar, if not quite as severe, issues this Monday. Both Spain and Italy underperformed expectations, while France remained in contraction territory for the 5th consecutive month; only Germany beat estimates at 53.8 against the 53.7 forecast, helping the region-wide figure crawl up to 52.0 from the 51.9 forecast. This couldn’t prevent the DAX from seeing its earlier gains being cut by two thirds, though the German index is still the best performer this morning with a 0.4% rise. Looking ahead to the US open and the focus will remain on the manufacturing sector. The Markit reading is forecast to be confirmed at an improved 52.9 (against 51.3 the month previous), while the ISM figure is set to slip to 53.1 from 53.2. Nothing of this has the Dow Jones too bothered at the moment, the futures suggesting a 35 point rise after the bell. Meanwhile banking shares have turned negative in the wake of the latest European stress test results released late on Friday. Barclays is down nearly 3% and Royal Bank of Scotland is 2.5% lower while Italian banks have fallen sharply: The Bank of England might do more than cut rates on Thursday after the poor UK manufacturing data, suggests David Morrison, senior market strategist at SpreadCo: This latest reading provides the Bank’s MPC with further evidence of a post-Brexit slowdown and makes a rate cut at Thursday’s meeting pretty much inevitable. The only question now is whether they back up a 25 basis point cut with an increase to the Asset Purchase Facility as well. Sterling has fallen back after the disappointing UK manufacturing data, on the basis that an interest rate cut this week is all but nailed on. Against the dollar the pound has dropped 0.11% to $1.3212 and is down marginally against the euro at €1.183. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has lost most of its early gains and is now up just 7 points or 0.1%. Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays, said: These disappointing figures would indicate that the uncertainty deterring manufacturers from making vital investment decisions prior to the EU referendum has taken a stranglehold since the vote and we can expect to see businesses continuing to protect cash and guard investment. Such caution is of course understandable and encouragingly the expected rise in exports, given the weaker state of sterling, is materialising but with growth in the sector being very hard-earned, manufacturers will want clarity on what post-Brexit means for their industry sooner rather than later. The UK manufacturing sector shrank at its fastest pace in more than three years, with the new orders index showing its biggest monthly drop in 18 years. Input prices rose to their highest level in five years. The disappointing result, worse than the initial estimate, is another sign that the Brexit vote on 23 June is hitting the country’s economic growth. The figures will put more pressure on the Bank of England to live up to expectations and cut interest rates on Thursday. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: The pace of contraction was the fastest since early-2013 amid increasingly widespread reports that business activity has been adversely affected by the EU referendum. The drops in output, new orders and employment were all steeper than flash estimates... The weakening order book trend and upswing in cost inflation point to further near-term pain for manufacturers. On that score, the weak numbers provide powerful arguments for swift policy action to avert the downturn becoming more embedded and help to hopefully play a part in restoring confidence and driving a swift recovery. UK manfacturing fell by more than initially expected in July. The Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 48.2, down from 52.4 in June and lower than the already disappointing inital reading of 49.1. Manufacturing growth across the eurozone slipped back in July, with the sector mainly supported by a strong performance from Germany. Markit’s eurozone manufacturing PMI fell to 52 in July from 52.8, just above the initial estimate of 51.9. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: The problem is that growth is looking increasingly lop-sided, which will worry policymakers and add to calls for further stimulus from the European Central Bank. Dig deeper beyond the headline numbers and more worrying pictures appear. Expansions in output and employment are clearly being driven to a larger extent by surging growth in German, while growth has almost stalled in both Italy and Spain, and contractions are being seen in France and Greece. And Greece, back in contraction: Over in Germany the manufacturing picture is brighter. The Markit manufacturing PMI came in at 53.8 in July, down slightly from June’s figure of 54.5 but just ahead of forecasts and still well in expansion territory. Markit’s Oliver Kolodseike said: Today’s survey results highlight ongoing steady growth in Germany’s goods-producing sector at the start of the third quarter. Although the headline PMI dropped slightly since June, the underlying growth fundamentals remain strong. The European Central Bank will be pleased to see that input costs rose for the first time in a year during July and selling prices stabilised, thereby adding to hopes that consumer price inflation will edge up in coming months. France’s manufacturing sector improved slightly in July but still contracted for the fifth month in a row. The Markit purchasing managers index edged up from 48.3 in June to 48.6, in line with expectations. Jack Kenedy, a Markit economist, said: July’s PMI data signalled a further modest contraction of the French manufacturing sector, amid continuing fragility in incoming new orders. And here’s the Italian manufacturing PMI, also weaker than expected: Markets are being supported by the expectation that the Bank of England will cut UK interest rates this week, and that the US Federal Reserve will refrain from raising them. The mixed picture so far from the manufacturing data, not to mention Friday’s poor US GDP figures, seems to make this more likely Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said: After a positive July for equity investors, August has also started strongly as investors place their bets on accommodative central bank policy from Japan, the US and the UK. While opinions about when the Federal Reserve will eventually raise rates remain divided, the market is all but certain that Mark Carney will cut rates this week to stimulate the UK economy. The only unknown is what additional measures he (or indeed the new Chancellor, Philip Hammond) might take to deliver the required stimulus to boost confidence and avoid a protracted recession. Spain’s manufacturing has come in below expectations: While we await the manufacturing data from Italy, France, Germany and the UK, here are some snapshots from elsewhere, including Russia showing a contraction: Markets have, as expected, opened higher with the FTSE 100 up 26 points or 0.4%. Germany’s Dax is up 0.9%, Spain’s Ibex has risen 1%, while France’s Cac and Italy’s FTSE MIB are both 0.7% better. In the wake of the banking stress tests released late on Friday, the Stoxx 600 banking index is up 0.9%. Meanwhile, despite the Brexit vote and worries about an economic slowdown, markets recovered some lost ground in July: Developments in Greece with signs of normality returning to the country’s banking system. Helena Smith reports: More than a year after they were imposed, capital controls in Greece will be substantially eased on Monday in a bid to lure back billions of euros spirited out of the country, or stuffed under mattresses, at the height of the eurozone crisis. The relaxation of restrictions, whose announcement sent shockwaves through markets and the single currency, is aimed squarely at boosting banking confidence in the eurozone’s weakest member. The Greek finance ministry estimates around €3bn-€4bn could soon be returned to a system depleted of more than €30bn in deposits in the run-up to Athens sealing a third bailout to save it from economic collapse last summer. “The objective is to re-attract money back to the banking system which in turn will create more confidence in it,” said Prof George Pagoulatos who teaches European politics and economy at Athens University. “And there are several billion that can be returned. People just need to feel safe.” The full story is here: Here’s the PMI agenda courtesy of DailyFX: Here are the opening calls for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It being the first of the month, we get the latest snapshot on how the global manufacturing sector performed in July. We’ve already had the Chinese data, and there are more signs of a slowing economy there. The official manufacturing survey fell back unexpectedly, with a slowdown in orders and disruption from flooding. The purchasing managers index fell from 50 in July to 49.9, just in contraction territory (anything below 50). Analysts had been expected a figure of 50 once again. The service sector survey edged up fro 53.7 to 53.9. A private manufacturing survey was a little more positive than the official version. The Caixin/Markit reading came in at a stronger than expected 50.6, the first expansion since February 2015. Meanwhile Japan’s manufacturing PMI also contracted, coming in at 49.3. Shortly come the European and UK figures. In the light of Brexit the UK data will be particularly interesting, ahead of the latest Bank of England decision on Thursday which is expected to see an interest rate cut. The initial reading showed the sharpest downturn in the UK economy since the financial crisis seven years ago, but this may well be revised upwards. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: We saw this fall to 49.1 from 52.1... however there is a chance that we could see this revised higher given that the flash number was taken at a time when political uncertainty was at elevated levels. This is no longer the case and this might be reflected in a slightly improved number. On the European and US data, Hewson said: We will also be getting the latest July manufacturing PMI numbers for Spain, Italy, France and Germany with slowdowns expected for Spain and Italy to 51.6 and 52.2, while France is expected to stay stuck in contraction at 48.6. German manufacturing is expected to show the strongest reading at 53.7. In the US the latest ISM manufacturing report showed a decent recovery in June to 53.2, and the expectation is that this could well continue into July with a reading of 53.1, which may bode well for this week’s jobs data."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/mar/09/no-legally-binding-contract-18bn-hinkley-point-nuclear-project-edf-china","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-09T19:32:53Z","webTitle":"No legally binding contract in £18bn Hinkley Point nuclear project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/09/no-legally-binding-contract-18bn-hinkley-point-nuclear-project-edf-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/mar/09/no-legally-binding-contract-18bn-hinkley-point-nuclear-project-edf-china","fields":{"headline":"No legally binding contract in £18bn Hinkley Point nuclear project","bodyText":"The energy company behind the Hinkley Point nuclear project has still not signed off a contract with its Chinese partner that is needed for the £18bn plant to go ahead. EDF Energy and China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGNPC) reached an outline deal that was unveiled last October by David Cameron during a state visit by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. But five months on the companies have not finalised the agreement, amid growing doubts over EDF’s commitment to the project. When the outline deal was announced, the French state-owned power company said construction work could begin within weeks. However, it has now emerged that the delay in EDF taking the final investment decision on Hinkley is not just because of well-publicised financing concerns in France, but also because there is no legally binding contract with Beijing. The French energy company has found it has taken longer than expected to do due diligence on state-owned CGNPC’s ability to make its £6bn contribution to the Somerset power scheme. “The complexity of the issue is hard to imagine. There are dozens of different legal agreements and literally thousands of pages,” said one nuclear industry source. The source added that the agreements also apply to projects at Sizewell and Bradwell. EDF has brought CGNPC into a post-Hinkley deal for a new reactor at Sizewell in Suffolk and plans to help the company construct its Chinese-designed reactors at Bradwell in Essex. The delays are said to have been prolonged by breaks for Christmas and Chinese new year but sources said EDF was close to reaching a final legal deal that both sides can sign off on. EDF declined to comment. However, the hold-up comes as EDF is still trying to convince the French government it has enough cash to meet the €1.8bn annual payments it needs for Hinkley – even with the Chinese taking a 33% stake. Last week the EDF finance director, Thomas Piquemal, resigned from the company amid reports he could not support the project going ahead for at least three years until EDF’s finances were in better shape. Despite the upheaval, and the firm opposition to Hinkley from trade union members of the EDF board, the company is attempting to deliver final approval at the start of April. But a procession of deadlines for the scheme, which if built could provide 7% of Britain’s electricity, have come and gone. And many in the City of London believe the project will never happen because it is too expensive for the British consumer who will eventually end up paying back EDF via energy bills. Hinkley Point is a flagship policy for the Conservative government at a time when other energy initiatives have been foundering and there are increasing concerns that the lights will go out. Sir Ed Davey, the former energy secretary, who negotiated a much-criticised subsidy regime for the power generated by Hinkley, said the Conservatives would have been willing to pay even more than he agreed. The government will pay £92.50 per megawatt hour for Hinkley electricity, which at the time of the CNGPC announcement was double the UK wholesale price. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Davey said: “They [the Conservatives] were gagging for nuclear. George Osborne in particular was wanting to have Chinese investment, big infrastructure projects to show off to the Tory backbenchers. It was me saying ‘I’m going to walk away from this deal if we don’t do what we promised parliament’, and that meant we had to get the price down to below £90 per megawatt hour, which I did.” The government disputes Davey’s account of events. A government source told the Times that Conservative ministers lost faith in Davey’s negotiating skills and insisted on Treasury involvement in the deal. But Davey pointed out that negotiations in 2013 were led by his permanent secretary at the energy department. He said: “My permanent secretary was the person I appointed to run it, and he worked with the Treasury because the Treasury were involved. But I was the one who was prepared to walk away.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/jul/31/mark-carney-bank-blockbuster-brexit-lights-camera-rate-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-31T06:00:27Z","webTitle":"Lights, camera, rate cuts: Brexit demands an all-action blockbuster from the Bank","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/31/mark-carney-bank-blockbuster-brexit-lights-camera-rate-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/jul/31/mark-carney-bank-blockbuster-brexit-lights-camera-rate-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Lights, camera, rate cuts: Brexit demands an all-action blockbuster from the Bank","bodyText":"Movies fall into two categories. There are arthouse movies, films full of hidden delights and subtlety that appeal to the initiated only. And there are blockbusters, no-nonsense cinematic experiences designed to wow the audience with a straightforward storyline and special effects. During his first three years as governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney has been like the director of a film in which there is plenty of talk but not much else. This week he needs to channel his inner George Lucas. The City does not want Céline and Julie Go Boating; it wants Star Wars. Carney’s latest production will be unveiled to the public on Thursday, six weeks to the day since the UK voted to leave the European Union. All the signs are that Brexit has led to a complete rewrite of the Bank of England’s script. Had the referendum gone the other way, the Old Lady would have been preparing the ground for interest rate increases over the next few months. Now its job is to shore up growth and confidence in an all-action performance. Anticipation ahead of a meeting of the monetary policy committee (MPC) has rarely been higher. Threadneedle Street cannot afford to do what the Bank of Japan did on Friday and leave the markets underwhelmed. A cut in the official cost of borrowing is a nailed-on certainty. For many years it had been assumed that Bank rate could go no lower than 0.5%, where it has been pegged since the economy was deep in recession in early 2009. Brexit has put paid to that notion. Expect rates to be cut to 0.25%. That, though, is unlikely to be the end of things. The Bank has made it clear that it is considering a “package” of measures, and Andy Haldane, its chief economist, has talked of the need for a “sledgehammer”. A 0.25-point cut in interest rates will not live up to the advance billing. The Bank has a range of other options. It could cut rates even further, to 0.1%. It could use forward guidance to send out a message that interest rates will remain at ultra-low levels for a considerable period to come. It could restart quantitative easing (QE), adding to the £375bn of government bonds it bought between 2009 and 2012. It could widen the QE programme to include corporate bonds. It could expand its Funding for Lending programme, which led to a marked pick-up in activity when first introduced in the summer of 2012. Or it could come up with some new initiative that nobody is expecting: a twist in the tale that takes the audience by surprise. The Bank has shown in the past that it can make a bold statement. When the economy was collapsing in late 2008, the MPC didn’t tinker around with half-point rate cuts: it slashed them from 4.5% to 3% and continued hacking away until borrowing costs stood at a historic low of 0.5%. Business surveys released since Brexit have nearly all been pretty downbeat but most were conducted in the confused days immediately after the referendum when companies were dumbstruck by the result. There is a possibility that sentiment will have improved as a result of the calmer conditions in the financial markets and the early arrival in Downing Street of Theresa May. But why take the risk? In the current circumstances, the Bank’s job is to demonstrate that it won’t allow the economy to slide into recession through official neglect. A show of shock and awe can buy some time while the government fleshes out its post-Brexit plan. If there is an argument for holding back, it is that more stimulus will be required in the months to come. Thursday will not be the end of the story. As with all the best blockbusters, there will be a sequel. By any measure, going ahead with Hinkley would be madness As the UK government readies itself to “consider carefully all the component parts” of the £18bn Hinkley Point project, it should start with first principles. The nuclear power station, as currently financed, is a threat to the UK’s national energy security. It would be absurdly expensive for UK consumers. And the technology hasn’t been shown to work. Any of those reasons ought to be enough to condemn Hinkley to the bin, to be remembered only as a prize example of successive governments’ craven indulgence of the nuclear lobby. Taken together, they make the case overwhelming: Hinkley is not the answer to the UK’s looming energy crisis. On the national security point, Theresa May should start by reading an excellent analysis by Nick Timothy, her joint chief of staff, published last October. The government is “selling our national security to China”, argued Timothy, noting the alarm of the security services that a Chinese state-backed firm could take a one-third stake in Hinkley as a precursor to building its own nuclear reactor in Bradwell in Essex. Others make the financial point that the former chancellor George Osborne’s grovel for Chinese cash wasn’t merely embarrassing but also baffling. The UK government can currently borrow at 0.7% for 10 years. Why not take advantage of that, rather than play off-balance-sheet games to the benefit of Beijing? The costs of Hinkley are now well known. The UK insulated itself from cost overruns in the construction phase by granting EDF a licence to print money for 35 years. The price of oil, taken as proxy for the cost of wholesale energy, would have to average $150 a barrel, compared with $42 currently, for three decades for Hinkley to represent good value. Yes, nuclear-generated electricity is reliable. But if that is what we want, build smaller and cheaper modular reactors. In any case, “reliable” is not a good description of EDF. Its attempts in Finland and Normandy to build Hinkley-style European pressurised reactors (EPRs) are years behind schedule. If you want reliable energy, do not order an EPR from EDF. May, untainted by Osborne’s obsession with Hinkley, has a chance to free the UK from the madness. She must take it. One signature from Sir Philip is all that is required Last week hundreds of BHS staff picked up their final paycheques and there were multiple pictures of battered department stores closing their doors for the last time. They were the starkest possible contrast to the long-lens shots of Sir Philip Green lounging around the Aegean on his new £100m yacht, Lionheart. Green wasn’t in total relaxation mode. He was busy firing off legal letters to Dominic Chappell, the man who shepherded BHS into administration just a year after buying it from Green for £1, and to Frank Field, the MP who compared Green to the former Mirror publisher and pensions thief Robert Maxwell. Green’s clearly mad as hell about taking the rap for the demise of BHS. He has promised to “sort” the £571m pension scheme hole, and the mounting controversy – over his billions, his boat and his knighthood while BHS staff face pension cuts – would recede if he did exactly that.

The companies agreed a deal in July in which Schneider was to buy £550m of new Aveva shares for a 53.5% stake and combine Aveva’s business with Schneider’s software division. The agreement, effectively a reverse takeover of Aveva, would have left it less vulnerable to the tumbling price of oil. Aveva makes programmes to design oil rigs, ships and nuclear power stations and some analysts have said the oil price influences about three quarters of its revenue. While inspecting each other’s businesses, the companies found obstacles to a combination that made the deal too risky and expensive, Aveva said. These problems were compounded by the financial complexity of the proposed arrangement. “As a result, the board has determined that the anticipated uplift in shareholder value was unlikely to have been realised to the extent previously considered,” Aveva said. Shares in Aveva, founded in 1967 as a spin-off from Cambridge University, fell 36% to £13.87. The shares hit a then four-year high of £23 when the deal was announced and reached £23.20 earlier this month. Aveva said its trading was in line with the board’s expectations and that its outlook for the year ending in March was unchanged. The terms of the deal were not binding and no break fee is payable by either side, it added. Oil companies and businesses that feed off the industry have slashed spending to cope with the plunging oil price, which has fallen by about two-thirds since summer 2014 because of slowing demand and a glut of supplies. Some analysts think the price could halve again from less than $40 a barrel to $20. The price of Brent crude fell 15 cents to $37.77 on Tuesday and was heading for its eighth day of declines as mild winter weather exacerbated existing fears to send prices close to 11-year lows. Julian Yates, an analyst at Investec, said another bidder might emerge for Aveva but that the fraught oil market could put off potential acquirers. “It is disappointing that the deal has broken down as in our view, this seemed the logical next strategic step for the business, considering the pressures in its core market and the greater critical mass Aveva would have garnered,” he said. “We imagine there will be hopes that another suitor will step forward. Aveva is a quality asset, but one where trading is under pressure.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/aug/11/nuclear-reactors-offline-fault-power-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-11T11:23:00Z","webTitle":"Nuclear reactors in northern England to be shut down due to faults","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/aug/11/nuclear-reactors-offline-fault-power-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/aug/11/nuclear-reactors-offline-fault-power-plants","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear reactors in northern England to be shut down due to faults","bodyText":"Four nuclear reactors at two large power plants in the north of England are to be shut down temporarily, after inspectors discovered a fault with a boiler unit.

An EDF spokesman said the latest shutdowns would not lead to power blackouts in the area, and the investigations would take around eight weeks. The fault, which was found in the reactor's boiler units, was discovered by chance during routine inspections on one of the main reactors earlier this year. EDF said in a statement: \"Although routine inspections of other boiler spines have not previously indicated any similar defects, EDF Energy has taken the conservative decision to shut down Heysham 1 reactor 2 and Hartlepool reactors 1 and 2, that are of similar design, over the next few days to carry out further inspections in order to satisfy itself and the regulator that the reactors can be safely returned to service.\" The Heysham 1 plant in Lancashire was taken offline in January because of a faulty boiler pump. The outage is not thought to have affected power supplies in the area. Last May, a reactor at Heysham 1 was shut down after smoke was seen coming from the plant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/jul/26/nhs-squeeze-can-be-reversed-by-applying-some-radical-thinking","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-26T18:00:48Z","webTitle":"NHS squeeze can be reversed by applying some radical thinking | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/26/nhs-squeeze-can-be-reversed-by-applying-some-radical-thinking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/jul/26/nhs-squeeze-can-be-reversed-by-applying-some-radical-thinking","fields":{"headline":"NHS squeeze can be reversed by applying some radical thinking","bodyText":"As Polly Toynbee scathingly pinpointed in her splendid article (Jeremy Hunt saves his own skin as he lets the NHS sink, 26 July), the NHS is as dependent on injections of foreign labour as a drug user is on heroin. According to the OECD report Health Workforce Policies in OECD Countries, published in March, Britain is the world’s second largest importer of health workers after the US, with more than 48,000 doctors and 86,000 nurses in 2014. While 5% of Italy’s and 10% of Germany’s doctors were born overseas, the figure for the UK is a shameful 36%. Shameful because in 2010, along with all WHO members, we signed the Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel, which “encourages countries to improve their health workforce planning and respond to their future needs without relying unduly on the training efforts of other countries, particularly low-income countries suffering from acute shortages”. Clearly, Jeremy Hunt has a lot to do. Explaining why 12,000 British doctors prefer to work abroad might be a good place to start. David Hughes Cheltenham • Polly Toynbee refers to Jeremy Hunt “talking up the scandal in Mid Staffs” in order to “encourag[e] the Care Quality Commission to set higher nursing and doctor numbers per ward”. The CQC does not set staffing ratios; we make recommendations for practical actions to improve care, based on detailed inspections involving clinical professionals. It is the responsibility of the leadership of individual trusts to determine how best they implement our recommendations in a way that ensures the delivery of high-quality care within the resources available. Trust boards are ultimately responsible for the future of their organisations and must use the CQC’s reports to help them plan that future – this includes taking a rounded look at staffing. Boards must ensure that there are sufficient medical and nursing staff to meet the needs of patients; it is for them to determine whether this is best done through additional recruitment, or whether demand could be more effectively managed by making changes to their model of care – as we have already seen some trusts successfully achieve. In an increasingly challenging context, the CQC is committed to supporting the NHS in the delivery of good, safe care that is clinically and financially sustainable: the care that we would want for ourselves and our families. David Behan Chief executive, Care Quality Commission • The plan you refer to (Overspent hospitals are told ‘reset’ means they must make cuts or face punishment, 22 July) is another blow in the unspoken agenda to destabilise the NHS. Why not “Underfunded hospitals struggle to provide safe care while budgets are cut”? The Department of Health has returned an average of £2.5bn a year to the Treasury for the last three years. Why don’t the managers get together and ask for more money, and say they would resign rather than continue to attempt to fulfil the demands of NHS England and the DH? I am told that the average length of stay for a CEO in an NHS hospital is three years, so what have they got to lose? Portraying the NHS as failing when it is being systematically undermined by government policies in order to bring in the private sector is dishonest and affects those Theresa May said she wanted to help. Can we ask her to look at what has been happening to the NHS over the last six years and apply some radical thinking to restore its funding? Wendy Savage President, Keep Our NHS Public • The easiest way to resolve overspent hospital budgets is just to stop treating patients with minor or non-life-threatening conditions or “voluntary” disorders such as sporting injuries. Patients who already suffer from these conditions should be treated. Healthy people should be advised to take out insurance. No private organisation pretends that it can do more and more with less and less resources. If politicians want to spend money on armaments, railways and nuclear power etc, and to merely write off the cost of their extremely expensive mistakes in the NHS, they must bear the public opprobrium for reducing what can be provided free at the time of use. Professional staff should no longer compromise either their health or their standards by trying to do too much. Dr Richard Turner Harrogate • We urgently need a Labour party that is prepared to undo the damage done to our NHS by successive governments. Cuts, privatisation and opening the NHS up to the market, against public and professional opinion, has made the NHS less safe, less efficient, and at risk of becoming less caring. The Health and Social Care Act 2012 speeded up a process of destruction that had already started. The junior doctors’ dispute, still unresolved, reflects the impossibility of providing the same level of routine services over seven days, when the resources scarcely exist to provide this over five. So we, as NHS doctors from all branches of the profession, whether we are in the Labour party or not, urgently need an opposition that is united, with clear policies to increase funding to the NHS, repeal the Health and Social Care Act, reverse the privatisations, and get rid of markets in healthcare. Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow secretary of state Diane Abbott have declared an intention to do all of this, and have displayed exactly the type of decisive leadership the NHS is calling for. We believe the re-election of Corbyn as leader of the Labour party is essential for the very survival of the NHS.

The revelation of the surge in wind, solar and bioenergy to a record 25% comes in a week when the government has been heavily criticised by business leaders and Al Gore for cutting support for clean energy. The high performance of renewable electricity between April and June, the latest period data is available for, was due to both more wind and sun and more turbines and solar panels having been installed, compared to the same period the year before, when renewables contributed 16.4% of electricity. Gas-fired power stations provided the most electricity - 30% - with renewables second. Nuclear power was third with 21.5% and coal - the most polluting fuel - fell back to fourth, with 20.5%. Ageing coal and nuclear plants have been closing in recent years, while renewable energy has been rapidly rolling out. Since May’s general election, Conservative ministers have argued that the subsidies given to renewable energy were rising too fast and announced plans to cut them, including an 87% reduction for solar power and an end to support for onshore wind farms. Industry figures said the government was slashing support too heavily and would strangle renewable energy just as it was taking off. “The new statistics show that the UK is relying increasingly on dependable renewable sources to keep the country powered up, with onshore and offshore wind playing the leading roles in our clean energy mix,” said RenewableUK’s chief executive Maria McCaffery. “We’ve had a series of disappointing announcements from ministers since May which unfortunately betray a lack of positive ambition at the heart of government. If ministers want to see good statistics like we’ve had today continuing into the years ahead, they have to knuckle down, listen to the high level of public support we enjoy, and start making positive announcements.” The renewable surge was led by solar energy, which more than doubled between the second quarters of 2014 and 2015. Electricity from wind rose by 65%, helped by the expansion of several large-scale offshore wind farms, while electricity from biomass rose 26%, mainly due to a switch from coal to wood chips at a unit of Drax power station. “Government support has driven down the cost of renewable energy significantly and these statistics show that has successfully enabled renewables to compete with other technologies,” said a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change. “Our priority is now to move towards a low-carbon economy whilst ensuring subsidies are used where they are needed most, which provides the best value for money for hardworking bill payers.” However, John Cridland, director general of the CBI, the UK’s leading business organisation delivered a scathing attack on Tuesday on the government moves that have weakened green policies. “These changes send a worrying signal about the UK as a place for low-carbon investment,” he said. “Over many years, the UK has built up real credibility on climate leadership and low-carbon investment. This is hard won, but easily lost.” Former US vice president Al Gore also attacked the UK government, listing a long series of reversals on green policies and saying he could not understand the rationale, with climate change presenting a clear danger to the UK and the rest of the world. Energy secretary Amber Rudd, visiting China with George Osborne this week, announced a £2bn loan guarantee for the proposed new Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset, saying the plant was “value for money” for low-carbon, baseload electricity. But critics attacked the £24.5bn price tag and history of nuclear cost overruns and delays, with a former Tory energy minister calling it “one of the worst deals ever” for British consumers and industry. Energy minister Andrea Leadsom spoke out in favour of shale gas exploration on Wednesday, which ministers have pledged to fast-track, saying it was “an inconvenient truth” for the anti-fracking lobby that shale gas could have economic and environmental benefits. “We need to meet the UK’s rising demand for energy, using clean and low carbon energy sources if we are to continue to combat climate change and grow the economy,” she said. However, the government’s energy statistics released on Thursday said demand “fell by 2% continuing the recent downward trend”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/jan/05/uk-construction-sector-december-2015-building","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-05T12:39:38Z","webTitle":"UK construction sector ends 2015 on a high note","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/05/uk-construction-sector-december-2015-building","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/jan/05/uk-construction-sector-december-2015-building","fields":{"headline":"UK construction sector ends 2015 on a high note","bodyText":"Construction firms ended 2015 in party mood after a recovery in housebuilding during December. According to the Markit/Cips UK construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI), housebuilders set aside a difficult year to invest more heavily in new plots after the general election created uncertainty over government policy. Commercial building in UK cities also held up well to push the December index to 57.8, up from a seven-month low of 55.3 in the previous month, where a figure above 50 indicates an expansion in activity. George Osborne’s offer of a £12bn boost to infrastructure spending over the next five years gave the outlook for construction a lift, coupled with the government’s determination to encourage an increase in housebuilding on green- and brownfield sites, which has been frustrated in recent years. Markit said more than half of the survey panel anticipated a rise in business activity over the course of 2016, while only 7% forecast a reduction. Commercial activity performed well in December and the civil engineering sector, a proxy for the infrastructure sector, struggled – but their fortunes appear to be reversing. Commercial builders have reached the end of a cycle in London that has pushed land prices to new highs, discouraging further speculative building. The relative decline of regional centres to the benefit of the capital, dampening demand for new office space, has denied them a route out of the south-east. Max Jones, a construction specialist at Lloyds Bank, said: “While 2015 appears to have ended on a high, sentiment about the outlook for this year will likely depend on which part of the sector you look at. Commercial construction is beset by uncertainty in the regions and price pressures in London and the south-east, yet housebuilding remains boosted by government measures to increase demand.” Tim Moore, an economist at Markit, said: “Civil engineering remained the weakest performing area of construction in December. Nonetheless, civil engineering activity looks set to experience a near-term spike at the turn of 2016 from spending related to flood relief and additional capital budgets.” Infrastructure spending on flagship projects including the Thames Tideway and Hinkley Point nuclear power station are expected to give more work to civil engineering firms over the next few years. But Kalpana Padhiar, a construction analyst at the global credit insurer Euler Hermes, warned that the sector was still recovering from backing unprofitable projects during and after the financial crash. “December’s figures undoubtedly bring a positive end to 2015, but risk masking the challenges faced by a sector still nursing its wounds. While many across the sector can now afford to be more selective about the work they take on, the major headwinds are unlikely to drop as we move into 2016. Rising capital pressures, an increasing skills gap and a potential interest rate hike suggest firms should continue to proceed with caution,” she said. • This article was amended on 6 January 2016.

The announcement came in a speech by the energy secretary, Amber Rudd, which she described as a “reset” of Britain’s energy policy on Wednesday. Rudd said she wanted policy to focus on making energy affordable and secure. The government wanted a “consumer-led, competition-focused energy system that has energy security at the heart of it”, she said, adding that the balance had swung too far in favour of climate change policies at the expense of keeping energy affordable. “We are tackling a legacy of underinvestment and ageing power stations, which we need to replace with alternatives that are reliable, good value for money, and help to reduce our emissions. It cannot be satisfactory for an advanced economy like the UK to be relying on polluting, carbon-intensive 50-year-old coal-fired power stations. Let me be clear: this is not the future,” she said. Green campaigners offered a cautious welcome to Rudd’s pledge to restrict coal-fired power by 2023 and eradicate it in a decade, although they have been critical of government moves to abandon support for renewable energy. “With this announcement, the UK is demonstrating the type of leadership that nations around the world must take in order to craft a successful agreement in Paris and solve the climate crisis,” said former US vice-president Al Gore. “The UK has become the first major economy to set a clear date to phase out coal, and I am hopeful that others will follow suit as we repower the global economy with the clean energy we need for a sustainable future.” But the veteran green campaigner added that he was “confused” by the government’s cuts to support for clean technology such as solar and wind power. David Nussbaum, the chief executive of the charity WWF, expressed mixed views on the speech, saying he welcomed the phasing out of coal but questioned the strategy on renewables. “As the government will highlight, decarbonising our economy will involve a mix of technologies,” he said. “But the way to develop a climate resilient economy and to be fair to bill payers is to pursue renewables ambitiously and to do so now. “Other countries are taking advantage of the fact that around half the global energy infrastructure being built today is renewable. And as renewables prices tumble the global market booms. Is Britain happy to be left behind?” Coal provides about 30% of the UK’s electricity but it is the most carbon intensive of fossil fuels and environmentalists have long been pushing the Department for Energy and Climate Change to set a date for phasing it out, preferably by 2023. To meet this goal, the UK will have to put a huge effort into getting enough gas-fired power stations built to meet demand. Burning gas emits about half as much carbon as coal and is considered by some to be a “bridging” fuel, as countries work towards a zero-carbon future. Rudd acknowledged that gas and nuclear power generation would in effect need a government subsidy for building power plants, but insisted they were the most secure energy sources for the future. Rudd’s critics are likely to call the government’s focus on gas and nuclear power short-sighted as she has cut so many subsidies for renewables and energy efficiency schemes. The energy secretary claims many of these grew too expensive under the coalition, in which the energy brief was held by a Liberal Democrat, Ed Davey. A Whitehall source said: “It is about moving away from short-term expensive subsidies and schemes that didn’t work.” However, several analysts, campaigners and the affected industries argue that slashing support for renewables is a backwards step when it comes to tackling climate change, growing green industry and saving consumers money in the longer term. Davey published a series of questions for Rudd on Tuesday night, including asking how the UK would meet its legal obligations under the Climate Change Act under her new policies. This month Rudd was accused of having misled the public after a leaked letter revealed that the UK was predicted to fall short of its EU obligations to get 15% of its energy from renewables by 2020. Pressed on the shortfall, the energy secretary was forced to admit the UK did not have the right policies to meet its decarbonisation targets and argued that the government should maintain support for renewable heat at the spending review. Davey claimed the Conservatives opposed ending coal-fired power under the coalition and challenged Rudd to guarantee the lights would stay on with her strategy of “gas, and more gas”. Last week National Grid for the first time had to use “last resort” powers to tell companies to reduce their electricity usage in an effort to reduce the risk of blackouts. Green MP Caroline Lucas said: “This switch from coal to gas is like trying to go dry by switching from vodka to super-strength cider – it entirely fails to seriously address the real challenge at hand. Investing in renewables and energy conservation would be far more effective economically, environmentally and in terms of energy security. We must begin weaning ourselves off gas as quickly as possible.” A Whitehall source said Rudd remained focused on the energy trilemma, a recognition of the need to balance energy security, affordability and climate change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jan/15/engaging-with-oil-companies-climate-change-futile-admits-leading-environmentalist","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-15T13:25:46Z","webTitle":"Engaging with oil companies on climate change is futile, admits leading UK environmentalist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/15/engaging-with-oil-companies-climate-change-futile-admits-leading-environmentalist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jan/15/engaging-with-oil-companies-climate-change-futile-admits-leading-environmentalist","fields":{"headline":"Engaging with oil companies on climate change is futile, admits leading UK environmentalist","bodyText":"Engaging with major fossil fuel companies on climate change has become futile, according to one of the UK’s most esteemed environmentalists who spent years working on sustainability projects with BP and Shell. Jonathon Porritt said “hydrocarbon supremacists” at the companies had successfully ousted reformers wanting to diversify into green energy. The founder director of non-profit consultancy Forum for the Future (FFF), said: “We came to the conclusion that it was impossible for today’s oil and gas majors to adapt in a timely and intelligent way to the imperative of radical decarbonisation. We felt we had no option but to end our long-standing partnerships with both Shell and BP.” Porritt brought the Ecology Party – now the Green Party – to prominence in the 1970s and was later director of Friends of the Earth. He has advised the Prince of Wales, Marks &amp; Spencers and many others. Writing in the Guardian, Porritt said: “These are companies whose senior managers know, as an irrefutable fact, that their current business model threatens both the stability of the global economy and the longer-term prospects of humankind as a whole. It got harder and harder for me to look them in the face knowing what they knew, and witnessing at first hand the intricate patterns of denial and self-deception that they were forced to adopt.” Oil, gas and coal companies are being targeted by a fast-growing campaign that aims to stigmatise them by persuading investors to dump their fossil fuel shares, a call backed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and others. In parallel, a series of authoritative analyses have shown that only a quarter of existing, exploitable fossil fuels reserves are burnable if global warming is not to exceed the dangerous 2C level agreed as the limit by the world’s nations. One counter-argument to divestment has been that holding on to shares and engaging with the companies is more effective in driving change. The Church of England has resisted calls to divest its endowment completely for this reason. “Our approach is to get stuck in on ethical issues and try and have a positive influence,” said Church Commissioner Edward Mason in December. But Porritt said this time has now passed and that the unburnable carbon analysis has left the fossil fuel companies “entirely unmoved”. “There was a time when I seriously persuaded myself that it was still just about possible for companies like Shell and BP to find some way of transitioning into ‘fully-integrated energy companies’, investing as much in renewables, storage and efficiency as in hydrocarbons, instead of reverting to what they are today: pure-play hydrocarbon dinosaurs,” he wrote in a recent blog. “It didn’t happen. Worse yet, the lengths they went to to justify their continuing investments in new hydrocarbons have become more and more extreme.” Over $670bn (£442bn) was spent in 2013 exploring for new fossil fuels reserves. Shell is spending billions on Arctic exploration and Canadian tar sands projects, both of which were deemed incompatible with preventing dangerous climate change according to a recent analysis in the journal Nature. “With BP the moment [for transition] came and went under the leadership of John Browne and with Shell, it pretty much died after Mark Moody-Stuart moved on,” Porritt wrote in the Guardian. “In both companies, the hydrocarbon supremacists rapidly regained the ground they’d lost: doing renewables as Corporate Social Responsibility was fine, but anything that threatened to go seriously ‘beyond petroleum’ was deemed to be deviant heresy.” Shell, Exxonmobil and Statoil have all been forced to respond recently to concerns about a “carbon bubble”. This is the suggestion that promised international action to curb climate change by drastically cutting fossil fuel burning will make many fossil fuels reserves worthless in the future, an idea being taken seriously by the Bank of England, Goldman Sachs, Citibank and other financial institutions. Porritt said fossil fuel companies are ultimately doomed, if not in the short term. “It has been quite a painful journey for me personally. I so badly wanted to believe that the combination of reason, rigorous science and good people would enable elegant transition strategies to emerge in those companies,” he said. “But we learn as we go. And go those companies surely will, if not in the near future.” Note: The Rockefeller Brothers Fund have divested from fossil fuels, not the Rockefeller Foundation as the original version of this article wrongly stated."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/20/energy-minister-open-minded-about-uk-solar-subsidy-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-20T15:22:28Z","webTitle":"Energy minister 'open-minded' about UK solar subsidy cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/20/energy-minister-open-minded-about-uk-solar-subsidy-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/20/energy-minister-open-minded-about-uk-solar-subsidy-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Energy minister 'open-minded' about UK solar subsidy cuts","bodyText":"Energy minister Andrea Leadsom has told MPs she remains “open-minded” about plans to slash subsidies for solar power in order to protect consumer bills, but told MPs on Tuesday that “very expensive” nuclear power stations were nonetheless “affordable for customers”. Leadsom was questioned by MPs on the energy and climate change (ECC) select committee about proposed cuts to renewable energy subsidies that her predecessor has called “catastrophic”. She said changes were needed to avoid a projected overspend and that the government remained committed to cutting carbon emissions: “It is simply not the case the government is moving away from green,” she said, noting £42bn of renewable energy investment since 2010. Several solar companies have blamed the planned subsidy cuts for their closure, which has caused more than 1,000 job losses, and Leadsom accepted the plans had caused uncertainty. But she said it was a “short-term issue” to get over and that future announcements about an energy policy “reset” would be aimed at giving investors certainty. The consultation on the changes to renewable energy subsidies ends on Friday and Leadsom said: “I can absolutely tell you that my mind is open in terms of the consultation feedback. We do not have a foregone conclusion.” Asked about her Conservative predecessor Greg Barker’s comment that the plans were catastrophic, she said: “This is a consultation and anybody that has that view should feed into it.” The solar industry argues that 27,000 jobs are at risk but Leadsom said it was not possible at the moment to assess how many jobs might be affected. She said about 34,000 people worked in the solar industry but many worked for companies that did other business too. Critics have argued that the proposed 87% cut to the solar feed-in-tariff would kill off the industry just as it approaches the point when falling costs meant it would no longer need support. “It is vital that industries over time stand on their own two feet,” Leadsom said. “I don’t think anyone here would advocate an industry that only survives because of a subsidy paid by the billpayer. Are they in fact able to continue with a very much lower subsidy or not - this is the point we need to get to.” A deal to build a £24bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point, supported by a 35-year subsidy deal, is expected to be announced on Wednesday, with a Chinese state-owned company taking a 33% stake in the project led by French state-owned company EDF. Angus MacNeil, the SNP chair of the ECC committee, said: “There is a feeling about that this government is miserly when it comes to renewables but profligate when it comes to nuclear. Is there one rule for renewables and one for nuclear?” Leadsom said: “What we are looking at with nuclear is an absolutely reliable long-term source of long-term investment in low carbon energy. It addresses energy security and decarbonisation as well as the costs being affordable for consumers. We have absolutely focused on what is in it for the UK terms of these very expensive builds of new nuclear and we expect to get 60-75% of the expenditure to come into the UK supply chain.” Leadsom also criticised Friends of the Earth for warning in 2011 that subsidy cuts proposed at that time would devastate the solar industry, since which time installations have risen. “It is very important to keep in mind the balance between what we are achieving on the ground, which is the superb over-deployment of solar versus what we are hearing, which is that we are destroying jobs and destroying the sector,” she said. “We have chosen politically in this government to be on the side of hardworking families and businesses and to do everything we can to keep bills down.” But Craig Bennett, CEO of Friends of the Earth, rejected the criticism. “Andrea Leadsom’s comments only go to emphasise the hypocrisy and incompetence of this government when it comes to energy policy,” he said. “The solar industry would have been decimated in 2011, but Friends of the Earth went all the way to the supreme court to prove the plans were unlawful, and we’ve had four years of a UK solar success story as a result.” Bennett warned that the planned new cuts would cause many thousands of job losses. “Ministers defend this with tired old language about ‘billpayers’, ‘hardworking families’ and solar needing to ‘stand on its own two feet’. But they are applying exactly the opposite logic for new nuclear, where they’re happy to guarantee inflation-proof taxpayer subsidies at twice the market rate for the next 35 years,” he said. “Solar is about to join wind as one of the cheapest forms of electricity generation but after decades of pampering, nuclear remains one of the most expensive.

As such, the committee report notes that: “It would be fair to say that, in this debate, there are no small risks or benefits. Every issue the committee has dealt with in this inquiry bears significant potential benefits and risks. “The question for the committee is, then, given the benefits for Australia and India from the proposed agreement, can the risks be tolerated and ameliorated,” the report asked. To counteract the potential risks of the treaty, including the possibility for Australian uranium to be used in the formation of nuclear weapons, the committee has made six recommendations. Among them, the recommendation that the bilateral treaty only be ratified if India manages to achieve the full separation of civil and military nuclear facilities, and that the country establishes a new, fully independent, nuclear regulatory body. It also recommends the International Atomic Energy Agency verify that inspections of nuclear facilities live up to international standards. India, which is nestled between nuclear-armed neighbours Pakistan and China, is estimated to possess up to 110 nuclear warheads. Australia should commit “significant diplomatic resources” to encourage India to sign the CTBT and facilitate a regional nuclear arms limitation treaty, the report recommends. Labor changed its party platform banning the sale of uranium to countries that have not signed the NPT in 2011, paving the way for the deal with India. The report highlighted the huge economic benefits of the treaty. “From Australia’s perspective, selling uranium to India would double the size of an export industry, both in terms of income and employment opportunities,” the report said. “Moreover, it will do so in regional and remote Australia at a time when lower commodity prices are having an economic impact on these regions.” The Australian Safeguards and Non-proliferation Office estimates India’s import requirements for uranium could grow to 2,000 tonnes a year, valued at $200m. The Minerals Council of Australia thinks that could result in a net gain of 4,200 uranium mining jobs. India currently gets about 50% of its energy from coal, which the report noted is the lesser option when compared with nuclear power. Presently, only 2% of India’s energy is generated by nuclear power. The committee acknowledges that keeping India isolated due to its status as a non-signatory of the NPT has not resulted in the country ditching its nuclear arsenal. The bilateral treaty, it argued, would give Australia leverage to make changes and strengthen safeguards. The Greens, in additional comments to the committee’s report, said the agreement was putting “short-term political expedience above global security”. “As such, the Australian Greens cannot support this agreement and urge others to do likewise,” the comments said. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons wants the committee to ensure that all safeguards are in place before the treaty is ratified. “It is disingenuous for the committee to recommend ratification while simultaneously acknowledging the substantial deficiencies that must be addressed before the agreement can be acted on,” Tilman Ruff said. Dave Sweeney from the Australian Conservation Foundation said the report’s claims that the uranium mining industry will double as a result of the potential deal “do not stack up”. “In recent months Rio Tinto has moved away from further mining at Ranger in Kakadu and BHP Billiton has dismissed more than 350 workers at South Australia’s Olympic Dam operation,” Sweeney said. “Australian uranium production in 2014 was the lowest for 16 years. Uranium provides less than 0.2% of national export revenue and 0.02% of Australian jobs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/oct/21/fukushima-turn-off-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-21T05:00:00Z","webTitle":"Fukushima proved turn-off point for nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/21/fukushima-turn-off-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/oct/21/fukushima-turn-off-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima proved turn-off point for nuclear power","bodyText":"Nuclear power generation fell last year by its steepest annual level since the industry began because of the continuing impact of the Fukushima accident in Japan. Despite going out of favour in some countries, 66 new reactors are under construction, most in China. The amount of electricity produced by atomic plants was measured at 2,349 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2012, which was 7% less than in 2011 and 11% lower than 2010 just before Fukushima, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Nuclear power as a technology was in the doldrums following the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island accidents in 1986 and 1979. It has come back into favour because of worries about how to replace fossil fuels to reduce carbon emissions. That renaissance was brought to a juddering halt by Fukushima in March 2011, when an earthquake and tsunami hit the power plant, causing enormous damage and a release of radioactive materials. This triggered the immediate shutdown of plants in Japan but also encouraged Germany – another major user of atomic power – to decide to phase out its remaining plants. Sweden, Italy and Spain made similar moves. The 48 operable Japanese reactors produced no power in 2012 but there were also serious outages at four plants in the United States, while three new plants came on stream – two in South Korea and one in China. The Ningde 1 is the first of four reactors being built in Fujian province, alongside a further 24 as the world's second largest economy has made by the far the biggest commitment to atomic power. China is keen to move away as quickly as possible from a dependence on coal-fired electricity generation, whose air pollution is a cause of deep unease at the highest level of government. Russia is the second biggest builder of new reactors, with 10 under construction. There are six in India and a handful elsewhere in the world, such as France and Finland. The announcement that the Hinkley Point C plant will go ahead in the UK will give hope to other nuclear operators, notably Hitachi of Japan which is eyeing other sites. Calder Hall on the now-sprawling Sellafield site in Cumbria is regarded as the first power station in the world to generate electricity on an industrial scale from nuclear energy. It is now being decommissioned along with many other plants in Britain, such as Oldbury 1 in Gloucestershire and Wylfa 1 on Angelsey in North Wales, which closed last year. Both plants had reached the end of their working lives, although life extensions have also been granted to other facilities. The peak for nuclear power generation was 2006 when 2,660 TWh was produced worldwide. The volume of new reactors easily outnumbered those being retired. But in pure numbers of reactors ,the high point was 11 years ago at 444, according to the World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2013. Most reactors are regarded as having a life span of around 30 to 40 years, but 44 are said to be operating beyond this limitation already. The average age of plants worldwide is around 28 years. • This article was amended on 23 October 2013 to correct a reference to \"terawatts per hour\" to terawatt hours."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/jan/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-global-economy-china-sends-a-shiver-through-davos","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-19T20:02:13Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the global economy: China sends a shiver through Davos | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-global-economy-china-sends-a-shiver-through-davos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-global-economy-china-sends-a-shiver-through-davos","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the global economy: China sends a shiver through Davos","bodyText":"China’s economy is slowing. For any other country, an annual growth rate of 6.8% would be exceptional: for China it was the weakest rate of expansion in 25 years. Developments in what is now the world’s second biggest economy are the reason financial markets have started 2016 in such turmoil. That threat is not lost on the global elite gathering in Davos, where the fear is that phase one of the global financial crisis was caused by the US housing market, phase two was caused by the eurozone and phase three will now be a meltdown in China. The risk is certainly there. For a start, China’s growth rate may be only about half that suggested by official statistics which are so unreliable that even members of the politburo take them with a large pinch of salt. Li Keqiang, the Chinese premier, is so sniffy about the official data that he looks at rail freight, electricity production and bank loans to judge how well the economy is actually doing. What’s more, China escaped the worst of the 2008-09 global downturn by going on a colossal binge. Private debt has doubled in the past eight years and Beijing has ramped up public investment, often in wasteful projects. Chinese economic policy in the first half of the 2010s looks similar to US economic policy under Alan Greenspan in the first half of the 2000s: one problem has been solved by blowing up a debt bubble that will eventually collapse and cause an even bigger problem. In its early stages of development, China needed German industrial goods rather than the financial products that are now the UK’s speciality. It would be wrong, though, to assume that Britain could comfortably ride out a China crisis. Britain’s banks are more heavily exposed to China than those of any other country. George Osborne would find a Chinese recession a personal embarrassment since he has gone out of his way to ingratiate himself with Beijing. The chancellor irritated Washington by announcing that the UK would be a founder member of the Chinese-inspired Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank; he has given China the contract for the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point; and he wants China’s help in building his “northern powerhouse”. The chancellor believes the 21st century will belong to China in the way that the 20th belonged to America. Mr Osborne’s thesis would not be invalidated even if China is in the early stages of an economic hard landing that will see its growth falter and unemployment rise. The period of rapid US industrialisation in the second half of the 19th century was punctuated by regular booms and busts that had little lasting impact. China’s sustained growth since the Deng reforms of the early 1980s suggests it may have more in common with the US than it does with its former communist rival, the Soviet Union. Even so, it would be wrong to assume that China’s transition to a more consumer-led economy will be trouble-free. The temptation for Beijing will be to buy off potential trouble in Chinese factories by driving down its currency to make its industrial goods cheaper. If China responds to its slowdown by exporting deflation to the rest of the global economy then things could quickly turn nasty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/blog/2013/oct/21/caption-competition-nuclear-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-21T14:19:51Z","webTitle":"Caption competition: Dave's big new nuclear power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/oct/21/caption-competition-nuclear-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2013/oct/21/caption-competition-nuclear-power-station","fields":{"headline":"Caption competition: Dave's big new nuclear power station","bodyText":"There's something of the Bond villain lair to this photo of David Cameron meeting top executives from EDF, the energy company set to build new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset.

It’s almost as if, for each generation, pouring out on to the streets is part of growing up. There is a collective ritual to this – we have a national penchant for cathartic moments. Historians point to a revolutionary narrative harking back to 1789. But if you are looking for some of the romanticism of May 1968 in the latest unrest, don’t hold your breath. Is France is on the verge of breakdown? Protests against a new labour law have led to fuel shortages, after trade union activists started blocking refineries and nuclear power plants. The government has had to start making use of the country’s strategic oil reserves. The police have fired teargas at protesters and arrested 77 people; air and rail traffic has been partly disrupted; and there were fresh demonstrations this week with crowds tens of thousands strong. The dispute over reforms the socialist government wants to introduce to liberalise the labour market is now two months old – more strikes and protests are planned in the run-up to the European football championships France is hosting from 10 June. This couldn’t have come at a worse time for the French president, nor for Europe at large. François Hollande hopes to be re-elected next year but his ratings are the worst of any postwar French leader’s. His Socialist party is split, one side favouring market-oriented reforms, the other holding fast to radical-left or anti-capitalist views. Mainstream rightwing opponents are capitalising on the scenes of chaos. Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right Front National – which gained 7 million votes in last December’s regional elections – is ready to cast herself as the person to restore order. All this is happening with France still in a state of emergency after last year’s terror attacks. The country’s European partners are closely monitoring events. With less than a month to go to the UK referendum, the Brexit camp could profit from scenes of instability across the Channel. Germany and the European commission, who have long pushed for labour-market reforms in France over worries that the country may become the next weak link in the eurozone, are scrutinising Hollande: will he backtrack? He has said he won’t, but he is also notorious for wavering. He fears another dramatic upheaval in the country – something resembling the massive 1995 strikes, or even the 2005 riots in the Paris suburbs. It would be a mistake to read the latest events as a popular uprising against austerity measures supposedly dictated from Brussels – or to draw parallels with movements such as Syriza in Greece or Podemos in Spain. The occupation of a central square in Paris by the Nuit debout student movement that began in March may have been compared to other insurgent movements, but it has failed to attract similar crowds or to widen its appeal. It’s true there is strong anti-establishment sentiment in France, but it tends to benefit the far-right more than the far-left. After the 2008-9 financial crisis struck Europe, France did not go through the radical economic restructuring, nor the wide-ranging public spending cuts, that some southern EU countries experienced. Public spending, among the highest in the OECD countries, has continued to grow. France suffers high unemployment, reaching 24% among 18- to 24-year-olds (and 46% among unqualified young people). Liberalising the labour market is meant to make it easier to hire; but it will also make it easier to fire people. France’s labour system is very much two-tier: one part of the population benefits from strong protections and solid, open-ended contracts; the rest find themselves either out of work or in precarious jobs. French trade unions represent only 7% of the active population, mostly employees already in highly protected sectors – partly because trade union finances are closely connected to the public sector and large enterprises. This produces paradoxes: France’s political culture is such that young people are prone to mobilise against any kind of reform, especially if they believe it damages their chances of entering “protected” sectors. Many fail to see how labour reforms make it easier for them to get a job in the first place. This has often been described as France’s “preference for mass unemployment”, over more flexible and perhaps less well paid work. So this may be crunch time for France. Hollande all but wasted the first two years of his presidency by failing to make significant economic reforms. Belatedly, just one year ahead of the next presidential election, he is trying to push forward. But his strategy has zig-zagged and confused everybody. Now he has run into a radicalised trade union, the CGT – whose roots go back to the heyday of France’s Communist party – which has decided that actions such as blocking refineries can put it at the forefront of a new class war. The other key player in the union movement, the more centrist CFDT, has come out strongly in favour of the labour reform. Within the French left old disputes have returned with a bang. Never before, under the Fifth Republic, has a socialist government been confronted with this degree of social unrest. It’s true there is political polarisation, as elsewhere on the continent. But one specific ingredient is that France has hung on rigidly to its welfare state, while other countries moved to reform theirs years ago. Nothing like Thatcherism ever happened there, and that’s surely a good thing. However, France has also been unable to adapt to globalisation in the way others in Europe have done, as if social rights could only be protected if nothing changes. Current events boil down to a show-down between two currents of the left, one reformist, and the other backing a labour system the country can no longer afford – at least not in the way it has existed for decades. Hollande is hoping most French people understand that, but his performance has been unconvincing. Fast-track legislation and bypassing the parliament hasn’t helped. Yet giving up entirely on reforms would not only spell the end of Hollande’s re-election hopes, it would set France backwards – and Europe would soon feel the effects."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/blog/2016/may/12/angela-merkel-suddenly-looking-politically-mortal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-12T11:29:46Z","webTitle":"Angela Merkel is suddenly looking politically mortal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2016/may/12/angela-merkel-suddenly-looking-politically-mortal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/blog/2016/may/12/angela-merkel-suddenly-looking-politically-mortal","fields":{"headline":"Angela Merkel is suddenly looking politically mortal","bodyText":"Europe’s most important politician took a bit of a pasting from the Brexit camp this week for allegedly throwing her weight around in David Cameron’s company. She has had a rough few months since the Syrian refugee crisis hit Germany and is suddenly looking politically mortal. But does Angela Merkel deserve it? Yes and mostly no. In these turbulent times we may miss her quietly steady hand when it’s no longer there to hold. Merkel has felt the grip of history very personally. She was born in Hamburg in 1954, the child of Germans who had been refugees – key word – from the east in the postwar mass upheaval of peoples. A convert from Catholicism to become a Lutheran pastor, her father took the family back. Young Angela grew up in the Stasi-riddled GDR which collapsed with the Berlin Wall in 1989. It has made her the perfect post-reunification chancellor from 2005 to the present. But for how much longer? In her plan, so close admirers tell me, she wanted out after 10 years, aware of Helmut Kohl and Margaret Thatcher staying too long. Her CDU and SPD coalition partners are increasingly uneasy, and rival parties of left and right – the AfD is Germany’s Ukip – are gaining ground. She will soon be 62. But a successor? No one seems to be in sight, let alone snapping at her sensible heels. Der Spiegel reports that she will, after all, run for a fourth term in 2017. Phew. Win or lose on 23 June Cameron or his own successor will need a grown-up ally in Berlin to negotiate whatever comes next. Europe’s Nigel Farages will be restless. The other evening I heard Neil MacGregor, star former director of the British Museum, give a glowing lecture about postwar Germany’s achievements, including its willingness to face the ugly side of its own history, as others, including neighbour Austria, wartime Japan and imperial Britain have not. He’s heading for Berlin to turn the newly rebuilt Berlin Palace – destroyed in the war – into a world-class centre for Germany’s treasures on the city’s “museum island”. Lucky him. But MacGregor used his lecture to make the point that Merkel’s apparent generosity towards the surge of Syrian and other refugees (and economic migrants) who flooded into Germany last year wasn’t mere sentimentality. Most German families, including hers, number ex-refugees among them because of the defeat in 1945 and redrawing of eastern borders. It was like the entire population of Canada being expelled to Britain, he said. MacGregor went further in explaining Merkel’s cautious and inclusive instinct for consensus, which earlier saw the physicist she once was defending nuclear power until the hostile consensus forced a U-turn. That’s caused Germany trouble too. The instinct lies deep in the fragmented centuries of German history – Germany has no national history like France or Britain, he says – when as many as 360 mostly petty states and princes enjoyed rights and (dare I add) “sovereignty” under the titular rule of the Holy Roman Emperor. But the emperor was elected by lesser princes, he points out. A very medieval thing to do, the system survives in the way the Pope is elected to be an absolute monarch by his cardinals. In Germany it created a need for compromise over 1,000 years before Napoleon finally abolished in 1806 what then became a Hapsburg dynastic empire in south-east Europe. The emperor couldn’t impose his will. Put it another way, as MacGregor did: “If Martin Luther had been born in England or France he would have been burned at the stake.” That’s quite a thought. Plenty were by their kings, but in divided Germany, Protestant-minded princes protected the pioneer of Europe’s Reformation from church retribution. You can see where this is taking me in the Brexit debate. Those of us who live on an island, especially one with a nostalgic imperial culture and a centralised state, have a much less subtle sense of “sovereignty” than those who have boxed and coxed for centuries without a sea wall. In fairness to the Brexit camp, MacGregor is hopelessly generous to the Germans, a good failing in these nationalistic times. After 1945 West Germans didn’t purge quite as many compromised Nazi officials as they like to claim. They were too useful, as the British and Americans found too. At the back of MacGregor’s lecture I also waited for him to acknowledge the statist and centralising forces which grew in brutal reaction to the fragmented chaos of medieval Germany. Most conspicuous was Prussia, a militarised autocracy through which “Iron and Blood” Bismarck finally united most Germans in the Second Empire in 1871. Charlemagne’s had been the first and, of course, Hitler’s fantasy Reich was the third. Bismarck turned from warmonger to peacenik too late and the whole system crashed after his death in 1918. Merkel is a very different sort of German. But misjudging the wider public mood over refugee admissions – many Germans still support her, but – has cost her much popularity. Her deal with Turkey to stop the flow causes further unease, though President Erdoğan’s libel suit against a naughty German comedian was thrown out this week, as the Shah of Persia’s similar bid was decades ago. Can she stagger on into the 2020s? She may have to if the leadership of Europe is not to risk falling into the hands of assorted Trump lookalikes. Even that is an unhealthy thought. All political careers end in failure, as Enoch Powell remarked. And he should know. But consensus-seeking has its dangers too and produces its own reaction. We can all see that now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/sep/15/liberal-democrats-vote-accept-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-15T12:17:26Z","webTitle":"Lib Dems vote to accept nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/15/liberal-democrats-vote-accept-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/sep/15/liberal-democrats-vote-accept-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Lib Dems vote to accept nuclear power","bodyText":"The Liberal Democrats have voted to accept nuclear power, in a historic reversal of their long-held opposition to atomic energy. Party members backed nuclear power as long as it is not subsidised, after several hours of tense debate at the Glasgow autumn conference Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat energy secretary, urged his colleagues to support nuclear power, saying it would be \"reckless\" to reject such a major low-carbon source of energy that is needed to tackle climate change. He argued against nuclear power at the party's conference in 2006 but has listened to arguments about its low-carbon benefits since then. \"I've changed my mind because of climate change,\" he said. It would be \"unimaginably\" hard to create a zero-carbon Britain without getting electricity from nuclear, Davey said. The motion backed by the party was \"option B\", accepting that in future nuclear power stations could play a limited role in electricity supply, in a safely regulated environment and without allowing any public subsidy. They rejected \"option A\", ruling out the construction of a new generation of nuclear plant. There were strong feelings on both sides that split former political allies. Joel Kenrick, an ex-adviser to Chris Huhne when he was energy secretary, argued in favour of allowing nuclear power to tackle climate change. But Huhne's other former adviser, Duncan Brack, said the party's idea of allowing limited nuclear without subsidy is a \"chimera\" because it would be impossible. Many others argued that abandoning the party's long-held opposition to nuclear power would risk alienating core voters. The party also backed the controversial practice of fracking for gas, which critics claim can damage the environment and rural landscapes. It supported shale gas drilling in \"controlled\" circumstances. Nick Clegg has already publicly given his backing many times to the idea of nuclear power without subsidy, so the motion is only confirming that the party's members back his stance. Davey is already deep in negotiation with EDF, the French energy firm, about how much extra it can charge people for electricity to cover the cost of the construction of new nuclear plants. Nevertheless, green groups reacted with fury to the Liberal Democrat acceptance of nuclear power. Craig Bennett, policy director at Friends of the Earth, said it \"punches a huge hole in the Liberal Democrats fast-sinking green credibility\". \"Nuclear power comes with massive costs attached,\" he said. \"Ed Davey is deluded if he thinks new reactors can go ahead without public subsidy – building them will result in the Liberal Democrats, yet again, breaking their promises.\" Dr Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, said the vote \"shows how far the Liberal Democrats have slid from their previously principled position on energy and climate\". He added: \"The party now seems prepared to thrust the issues of nuclear waste and funding on to future generations, rather than take on vested interests and put us on the road to dealing with the climate crisis in a clean, safe way.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/jan/03/major-offshore-wind-operator-plans-6bn-uk-pound-investment-2020","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-03T16:04:50Z","webTitle":"Major offshore wind operator plans £6bn UK investment by 2020","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/03/major-offshore-wind-operator-plans-6bn-uk-pound-investment-2020","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/jan/03/major-offshore-wind-operator-plans-6bn-uk-pound-investment-2020","fields":{"headline":"Major offshore wind operator plans £6bn UK investment by 2020","bodyText":"Dong Energy, the biggest operator of offshore windfarms in Britain, has said it plans to spend a further £6bn in the UK by 2020, convinced that the government is serious about supporting wind power. Vattenfall, another significant UK windfarm operator, says it too is “optimistic” about 2016 and is hoping to proceed with a turbine testing site off Scotland this summer. The statements of intent are a major boost to Amber Rudd, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, who has been under fire for cutting subsidies to solar and other low-carbon sectors despite signing up to the Paris climate change accord. Brent Cheshire, Dong’s UK division chairman, said he had harboured concerns about government policies as little as two months ago, but had since been reassured by recent firm commitments to offshore wind. “It was a concern that it took as long as it did [for ministers to recommit to offshore wind] but we have now got it. I think there is the clarity we need to commitment to new investment,” he explained. Cheshire said it made more sense for the government to back offshore wind than the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, which was going to prove a lot more expensive. But he also warned it would take time for companies to cut their offshore windfarm costs, and that hopes that this arm of the renewable sector could become subsidy-free as early as 2023 were “not realistic”. Vattenfall has for years being trying to build a European offshore wind deployment centre off the Scottish coast in Aberdeenshire, but has faced legal opposition from American billionaire and Republican presidential hopeful, Donald Trump. The British supreme court has now ruled the project can go ahead. The centre would allow the Swedish-based company behind windfarms in Thanet and Kentish Flats to experiment with different kinds of turbines to see which are the most cost-effective. Vattenfall said it was upbeat about offshore wind after Rudd said last month she would support the industry as long as it brought costs down. “We are optimistic about offshore wind and although we still think there may be potential investment opportunities onshore we are more cautious about that,” the Vattenfall spokesman said. Denmark-based Dong has spent £6bn so far developing windfarms in Britain and now says it wants to double this amount in the next four years. This means pressing ahead with projects such as the giant Hornsea scheme off Yorkshire. Once completed, this scheme will become the world’s first gigawatt-scale windfarm, 80 miles offshore. Hornsea’s 240 turbines are scheduled to commence electricity generation by 2020 with the capacity to power 800,000 homes. Cheshire admitted that the intermittent nature of wind – and many other renewable energy technologies – meant back-up “baseload” generation was needed but said this did not need to come from nuclear but could come via interconnectors - electricity cables from abroad. He also argued that offshore wind power was very predictable given the sophistication of modern weather forecasting systems."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/feb/21/carwyn-jones-says-welsh-labour-will-distance-itself-from-jeremy-corbyn","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-21T14:24:02Z","webTitle":"Carwyn Jones says Welsh Labour will distance itself from Jeremy Corbyn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/21/carwyn-jones-says-welsh-labour-will-distance-itself-from-jeremy-corbyn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/feb/21/carwyn-jones-says-welsh-labour-will-distance-itself-from-jeremy-corbyn","fields":{"headline":"Carwyn Jones says Welsh Labour will distance itself from Jeremy Corbyn","bodyText":"Welsh Labour will attempt to distance itself from the UK party and the infighting that has blighted Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership during its campaign to hang on to power in the Welsh assembly. Speaking to the Guardian as the party launched six pledges at its conference ahead of May’s assembly elections, the first minister and leader of Welsh Labour, Carwyn Jones, accepted that events in Westminster were bound to have an impact on the campaign. “I can’t pretend that what’s been happening in Westminster is good,” he said. “The infighting, the division, that’s bound to have a negative effect. I can’t pretend that all we’ve seen in the last few months in Westminster has been exactly helpful for the election in May. No one can pretend that.” Jones said the tactic on doorsteps would be to emphasise that candidates represent Welsh Labour, not the UK party. “It’s a Welsh election,” he said. “This is Welsh Labour, which in terms of policy is autonomous. We develop our own policies, our own laws – there’s no influence from London at all” Corbyn attended Welsh Labour’s conference this weekend and in his speech said Labour in Wales was an inspiration to the rest of the party. “There is so much that the UK Labour party can learn from Labour in Wales … and we will,” he said. Jones has fundamental differences with Corbyn, not least on Trident and nuclear power. He said Welsh Labour had always formed its own policies. “It doesn’t matter who the leader is in London, that’s what we’ve always done. It’s nothing to do with Jeremy. It’s important that people see we think autonomously to our colleagues in London and elsewhere.” Welsh Labour’s six pledges are: Free childcare for working parents. Tax cuts for all small businesses in Wales. 100,000 quality apprenticeships for all ages. New treatment fund for life-threatening illnesses. Double the capital limit for people going into residential care. An extra £100m to improve school standards. Jones said: “We’re investing in people to see our people grow, to see our communities grow, to see our nation grow.” He claimed this was being done in the face of devastating, politically motivated cuts to its funding from the Tories in Westminster. Welsh Labour will argue during its campaign that the election is a straight fight between it and the Conservatives, the second biggest party at the assembly – although the Welsh nationalist party, Plaid Cymru, will not agree. Jones accepted, however, that there was a new threat this time: from Ukip, which is planning to fight in all seats. The latest poll suggests that Ukip could leap from no presence to nine seats in the 60-seat assembly. The poll predicts that Labour could drop from its current 30 seats to 27. Jones said: “Ukip are a party that are getting the support of people who are generally annoyed. It’s not about Europe necessarily, it’s not about immigration necessarily. It’s a kind of ‘We’re annoyed’ vote. We’ll be saying Ukip are not a Welsh party, they are an English party with a Welsh branch. We’ll be saying, do you really think these people have policies that suit you and Wales? Are they are really a party with roots in Wales? They are totally dictated to by London.” The NHS will almost certainly be the biggest election issue. Labour’s health record is continually attacked by Tories in Westminster and the Welsh assembly, but Jones is fighting back. Labour has been cheered by a report from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which says the NHS appears to be performing no worse in Wales than in other parts of the UK. And the Welsh government is also keen to point out that junior doctors have not gone on strike there. “The ammunition is disappearing rapidly,” said Jones. Welsh Labour has governed alone or in coalition since the first devolved elections in 1999. “People will say to us, is it someone else’s turn?” Jones said. “It doesn’t work like that. You have to earn the trust of the people, you have to work hard for their support. People can trust what we say. You vote Welsh Labour, you get what it says on the tin. We don’t make wild promises. What we say we’re going to do, we do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/nov/06/arrests-myster-drones-flying-french-nuclear-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-06T14:02:33Z","webTitle":"Three arrests fail to staunch mystery of drones flying over French nuclear plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/06/arrests-myster-drones-flying-french-nuclear-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/nov/06/arrests-myster-drones-flying-french-nuclear-plants","fields":{"headline":"Three arrests fail to staunch mystery of drones flying over French nuclear plants","bodyText":"Three people have been arrested with drones near a nuclear power plant in the Cher region south of Paris, as sources told the Guardian that the true number of French nuclear facilities being targeted may have been underplayed. The three twentysomethings, detained near Belleville-sur-Loire plant on Wednesday night with two drones, are thought to be model plane enthusiasts and unconnected to the recent spate of drones spotted over nuclear reactors in recent weeks by mystery operators. Blueberry Radio, a local station, reported that they had inadvertently strayed into a plant security zone during a post-birthday trip to film a remote-controlled boat on a lake. The three, who include a locksmith and student couple, now face possible one-year prison sentences and €75,000 fines. “These people do not have any link with the other flights done in the last weeks,” Yannick Rousselet, Greenpeace France’s nuclear campaigner told the Guardian. “It looks like they wanted to play with their drones close to the plant, which was not a good choice.” The French nuclear operator EDF admits 13 drone incidents in the last month, but the Guardian has learned that other nuclear facilities may have also been targeted for surveillance by the drones. Sources say that drones also overflew sites including an Areva spent fuel reprocessing plant in Flamanville on the Cotentin peninsula on 27 October and nuclear research centres in Saclay, south of Paris, and Cadarache, in Bouche-du-Rhone. “I think there have been more than 13 drone flights,” said Yves Marignac, the director of World Information Service Energy-Paris, and an advisor to France’s nuclear safety authority and environment ministry. “There are also reports of flights in Saclay, south of Paris and other facilities. Greenpeace have been saying for days that EDF is not the only nuclear operator affected by these flights and this has not been denied by other operators or by the government. So this is not strictly speaking a targeting of EDF sites.” EDF maintains that its plants are immune to “external stresses” and the French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve has said that measures to “neutralise” the drones were in place. Le Figaro has reported that police officers have been given orders to shoot down any aircraft that could threaten the plants. But Rousselet, who lives close to the Flamanville plant, said that two army helicopters failed to intercept drones there on 27 October. “They were efficient and high speed helicopters,” he said. “They tried to follow the drones, but lost them.” “Immediately after Cazeneuve’s statement, there were two overflights and the day after that, there were seven,” he added. “That means there is some kind of provocation to the French government taking place.” In the aftermath of the first mysterious drone flights, some suspicion fell on Greenpeace, despite their denials, as the group has previously entered French nuclear plants to expose what they say are ongoing security failings. The group used drones earlier this year to film illegal coal mining in China and usually trumpets such activities. The Guardian has learned that Greenpeace activists flew a drone over the Sellafield nuclear plant after 11 September 2001, which the group has never publicly admitted. But that action was launched in the context of a bid to have the High Court overturn a government decision to proceed with the licensing of a Plutonium Mox plant in Sellafield, and photos taken in the operation were never put online to avoid revealing sensitive information to groups with malicious intent. Few experts believe that Greenpeace has the capacity or motive to engage in a campaign as sophisticated, sustained and technically-complex as the one unfolding in France, involving up to four drone missions aimed at different sites at the same time. Marignac said that he believed there were three possible culprits. “One is that anti-nuclear people have formed an underground group although the operation seems to involve too much capacity for a really secret group,” he said. “The second option is a group like Anonymous or an anti-government group, trying to defy the government and show that there are breaches in security.” “The third and most worrying possibility is that it is a malevolent and potentially terrorist group really challenging the government, saying ‘These are the means we have.’” He declined to speculate on whether lax security exposure, blackmail, warnings or reconnaissance were the most likely motives, but noted that many of the sites surveilled contained spent fuel pools and that drones were particularly useful for acquiring “precise on-site information”. The French environment minister Segolene Royal recently admitted that she did not “have any lead” on who was behind the drone operations. Rousselet said that in the absence of laser-based weaponry, the French government lacked a technological solution to the problem and so had no option but to find the culprits quickly. “We have direct and indirect contacts with the security services and my sense is that it looks like there’s some kind of panic developing as they don’t have any idea of who might be responsible,” he said. A spokesperson for the European Commission said that it was “too early to determine the implications the drone events might have for the security of nuclear power plants in Europe.” “However, given the nature of the installations concerned and, notably their relevance to energy supplies in Europe, the European Commission will follow closely any developments,” she added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2015/nov/29/george-osborne-spending-great-leap-forward-autumn-statement","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-29T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"If only Osborne’s spending would make a great leap forward","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/29/george-osborne-spending-great-leap-forward-autumn-statement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/nov/29/george-osborne-spending-great-leap-forward-autumn-statement","fields":{"headline":"If only Osborne’s spending would make a great leap forward","bodyText":"Our chancellor could not resist it. Once again, while presenting the latest revisions to his “long-term plan”, he dragged up the Labour chief secretary Liam Byrne’s line in 2010 that “there’s no money left”. I say line, because it was not a spoken remark but a phrase contained in the customary written note from the outgoing chief secretary to the incoming one, who happened – for what turned out to be a very short time – to be the Liberal Democrat David Laws. This was meant to be a joke, and Treasury officials thought it was bad form for Laws to publicise a private letter. But the joke rebounded on Byrne and Labour, and the Conservatives are still milking it all these years later. And last week shadow chancellor John McDonnell tried a deliberately more public joke with his production of Chairman Mao’s little red book. This backfired too, and the Tories will milk it mercilessly as well. The “no money left” remark was an obvious joke. There was plenty of money left, as investors all over the world almost fell over themselves to lend to the British government. They were doing this under the premiership of Gordon Brown and the concurrent chancellorship of Alistair Darling. They have been doing it ever since under the premiership of David Cameron and concurrent chancellorship of George Osborne. The position of the UK was in no way comparable to that of the benighted Greek economy, although that never stopped Osborne from misrepresenting the case. In the old days, confronted with the Osbornes of this world, people with a resemblance to the Major in Fawlty Towers used to shake their heads and observe: “He is not quite 16 annas to the rupee.” A similarly jovial comment to Byrne’s was made by outgoing Conservative chancellor Reginald Maudling to incoming chancellor James Callaghan in 1964. But it was kept for Callaghan’s memoirs in 1987. As Callaghan wrote of Maudling, who had taken some time to pack his bags: “On his way out, he put his head round the door carrying a pile of suits under his arm. His comment was typical: ‘Sorry, old cock, to leave it in this shape. I suggested to Alec [Douglas Home, the outgoing prime minister] that perhaps we should put up the Bank Rate but he thought he ought to leave it all to you. Good luck.’” Now, it is a pity that McDonnell, having started so well in his response to the chancellor, should then have led with his chin. The point he was trying to make about Osborne’s dealings with communist China over contracts for nuclear power stations is a serious one. I find people are baffled as to how a political son of Thatcher, who gave privatisation to the world, should be relying on a combination of a communist state and a French nationalised industry to build nuclear power stations on dubious financial terms in circumstances that raise such serious questions about security – which is supposed to be an obsession of this government – that they worry the Americans too. Ah, China! We come by a circuitous route to Osborne’s fourth budget in 12 months, and what has been popularly greeted as a U-turn. This reminds me of the time I was invited to the Chinese embassy in London in the early 1970s. I was on the Financial Times in those days. I thought the Chinese wanted my views on the economy, but what they were really after was an explanation of strange phrases in the press, and the frequent use of the expression U-turn. As far as I recall, the expression first came into vogue politically in 1972, when the Conservative government of Edward Heath completely changed the direction of its economic policy. This, notwithstanding the various concessions made by the chancellor to his critics last week, is not what Osborne has done. There may have been U-turns over specific issues, such as the favourable revision of plans for expenditure on the health service and the police, and the timing of welfare cuts aimed at the poor, but there has emphatically not been a U-turn when it comes to Osborne’s overall strategy. That strategy remains: to reduce the size of the state for ideological reasons; to aim at a budget surplus not only on current account – which makes sense when, to coin a phrase, “the sun is shining” – but also on capital account. The latter, as almost all economists know, does not make sense, and it is noteworthy that, for all his rhetoric about “infrastructure” and the “northern powerhouse”, Osborne is budgeting for an absurdly small proportion of GDP to be devoted to such expenditure. The idea that the chancellor propagated in his post-statement interview on the Today programme – that welfare cuts are needed in order to make room for public sector capital investment – is patently absurd. Such investment should be financed by long-term borrowing at what are, historically and in practice, negligible interest rates. One does not, unless one is a Russian oligarch or Middle Eastern potentate, finance the purchase of a house with one year’s earnings. The concessions made by Osborne in response to the OBR’s latest forecasts of the probable outturn of the balance between revenue and (previous) plans for expenditure are certainly welcome. But, as the OBR itself is only too aware, its forecasts – rather like Bank of England governor Mark Carney’s on the probable path of interest rates – tend to change markedly from quarter to quarter. And tax revenues could slow down if the Bank decides to clamp down on the rapid growth of the consumer credit that has been assisting the recovery. Incidentally, it is characteristic of this slippery chancellor of ours to claim that his critics want to run permanent budget deficits. He ought to be aware that even dyed-in-the-wool Keynesians such as your correspondent know there is a time and a place for deficits, and the Great Recession and its aftermath made a sequence of deficits necessary. Indeed, Osborne himself has, thank goodness, been overseeing a sequence of budget deficits. He would not have got where he is today without them. His ill-conceived austerity meant, of course, that the deficit was reduced too fast, thereby ensuring that we have experienced the slowest recovery on record. Carney has several times pointed out that fiscal tightening has impeded the recovery. And the OBR notes, in its Economic and Fiscal Outlook, that its higher forecast for growth “mainly reflects the government’s decision to ease the pace of fiscal tightening”. I rest my case."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/may/24/uk-renewables-cuts-risk-slowing-shift-to-clean-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-24T10:38:59Z","webTitle":"UK renewables cuts 'risk slowing shift to clean energy'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/24/uk-renewables-cuts-risk-slowing-shift-to-clean-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/may/24/uk-renewables-cuts-risk-slowing-shift-to-clean-energy","fields":{"headline":"UK renewables cuts 'risk slowing shift to clean energy'","bodyText":"The UK government risks slowing the shift to clean energy sources by cutting support for renewable energy and strongly backing gas as a transitional fuel, according to the UN’s environment chief. Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), told the Guardian that he thought the UK’s push for nuclear and gas over renewables could be more costly in the long term. His warning came as North Yorkshire council gave the go ahead for the first fracking tests in the UK for five years. Councillors gave the green light on Monday to UK firm Third Energy to begin hydraulic fracturing for shale gas at wells near the village of Kirby Misperton, in the Ryedale district. Steiner said that it was a “legitimate choice” for the government to pursue “intermediary steps” to decarbonise the economy, such as using gas rather than coal. But speaking to the Guardian before the North Yorkshire decision, he said: “If you invest a lot in an intermediary solution, you’re essentially slowing down the long-term transition [to renewables] so you’ll just have to do many things much faster and you may face the risk of having to pay much more to do it [later down the line].” He added that removing government support for renewable energy would hold back the sector. “The picture in the UK has become less clear [on green energy]. That will not necessarily stop renewable energy from moving forward, but I think it will have a dampening effect on the sector that’s so critical, and that’s the private sector,” he said. Since coming to power, the Conservative party has ended subsidies to onshore wind power, cut them for solar power and scrapped plans for zero-carbon homes, defending the changes as being necessary to protect consumers. “Whenever public policy becomes hesitant or reverses a policy there, you can create uncertainty. And that I think is probably where the UK, like other countries, do need to look very carefully at what they are signalling in this arena, which is the market, the investor, the funding.” A spokesperson for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: “We are dedicated to reducing our emissions and moving to low carbon energy, but this has to be done in the most cost-effective way for households and businesses. “The UK remains an attractive location for investment in renewable energy. We are giving investors the longer-term certainty they need by announcing £730m of funding for renewables contract auctions to drive further investment and build on the record levels we saw last year.” On nuclear power, Steiner said that it might make sense in some countries as a way to cut emissions, but ultimately he thought it would quickly be beaten by renewable energy on economic grounds. “Nuclear is an option that is clean in terms of CO2 emissions but economics is a very complicated subject, and the UK is just learning that firsthand with supposedly state of the art technology,” he said in a reference to the troubled plans for new reactors at Hinkley Point. Steiner, who is stepping down in June and moving to the Oxford Martin school at the University of Oxford, said it was “extremely important” that last year’s historic Paris climate deal should be formally ratified and adopted quickly, to send the right signal to businesses. “If you take Paris literally, it signals to the world that we will decarbonise our economies over the next 50 years. This is revolutionary, this is unprecedented. Unless we get markets, industry, technology to believe this is really going to happen [by ratifying soon], they’re not going to invest themselves in it. “Public budgets are usually 15-20% of GDP, so 80% of the economy [the private sector] sitting back is a death knell.” On Donald Trump, who has pledged to unpick the Paris deal if elected US president and denies the science of manmade global warming, he said: “Whenever there is anywhere in the world someone saying I don’t believe in climate change, UNEP has to be worried. This is not a question of belief, it’s a question of science, of evidence.” But he said that while the US, which is the world’s second biggest carbon emitter, was “still a very significant player”, it would be Africa that might decide the fate of the world’s climate. “This continent now has 1 billion people, it will double its population in the next 50 years, so we will have 2 billion Africans. If Africa were to go down the 20th-century fossil fuel path, the Paris agreement would almost become redundant. Because we would just add to the emissions footprint of the planet in such a magnitude that any attempt to decarbonise our economies wouldn’t work.” But he argued that Africa was not going down that route, because it had fewer vested interests in fossil fuels and renewable energy provided a shortcut for the millions of Africans who still do not have access to energy. Over his 10-year term as the head of UNEP, the Brazilian-born Steiner has overseen a significant increase in its budget and beefed-up powers bestowed on it at the Rio+20 Earth summit in 2012. His greatest achievements, he felt, were moving from an environment agenda “trying to save one lake, one forest, change one chemical at a time” to something much more systemic, and making green issues relevant to the economy. “UNEP has brought an economic understanding to the environmental agenda,” he said in an interview with the Guardian at the UN environment assembly in Nairobi. But his biggest regret was not doing more on oceans. “It is a frontier that is in some ways abstract to us terrestrial beings. But it is fundamental to what is happening on our planet. The world needs to pay far closer attention,” he said. “In a world where most of our fish stocks are overexploited or declining, or where as one report says they will soon be more plastic in the ocean than fish, what kind of outlook is that for a civilised 21st-century society?” The Guardian’s travel and accommodation was paid for by the UN."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/may/24/why-british-environmentalists-should-vote-for-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-24T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"Why British environmentalists should vote for Brexit | Michael Liebreich","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/24/why-british-environmentalists-should-vote-for-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/may/24/why-british-environmentalists-should-vote-for-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Why British environmentalists should vote for Brexit","bodyText":"The leading lights of the UK environmental movement would have us believe that a win by the Brexit camp on 23 June would be akin to a natural disaster. According to them, it is only our membership of the EU that renders our beaches swimmable, our water drinkable and our air almost breathable. Freed from the noble, ceaseless efforts of the ever-vigilant EU, troglodyte Britain would tear up decades of environmental legislation and return to our 1970s roots as the “dirty man” of Europe. This is complete and utter tosh. First, the EU’s record on the environment is far from the rose-tinted picture it is so keen to promote. The common fisheries policy has protected neither fisheries nor fishing communities. The common agricultural policy discriminates against African imports, destroying the rationale for investment in Africa and holding back sustainable development. For a brief decade, Europe led the world in renewable energy investment, but not any more – that would be China. EU nations promoted clean energy at vastly inflated costs through imposed renewable energy targets, tariffs and subsidies. When budgets reached breaking point in 2011, European renewable energy investment slumped by more than half and has yet to recover. Environmentalists wax lyrical about Germany’s “Energiewende”, or energy transition, and how it accelerated the shift to renewable energy. What they won’t tell you is that in the past 17 years, Germany’s energy-related carbon emissions have declined by precisely zero: it retired safe, zero-carbon nuclear power stations and built new coal-fired power stations. For two decades the EU promoted the fiction that diesel was beneficial for the climate, in the face of a rapid catch-up by petrol technology. In 2013, when it looked like the EU had arrived at a historic deal to clamp down on vehicle emissions, Angela Merkel intervened to block it and protect the German car industry. “Dieselgate” demonstrated that in the US the only way Volkswagen could achieve certification for its cars was to break the law. In the EU it didn’t need to bother: officials simply nodded through vehicles they knew performed up to 12 times worse on the road than in lab tests. When the gig was up, Europe’s car companies lobbied and were allowed a doubling of pollution levels. In the UK, meanwhile, the most significant recent environmental policies were all local initiatives, not driven by the EU. When it became clear that the bureaucratic and fraud-prone EU carbon trading scheme was going to produce a nugatory carbon price, the UK unilaterally enacted a floor price which drove its coal-fired power stations into retirement. It was the UK which unilaterally decided to phase out coal-fired power entirely by 2025. And it was the UK which unilaterally decided to create the Pitcairn marine reserve, the largest single marine protected area in the world. You don’t need to hark back to the Clean Air Act of 1956, or Margaret Thatcher’s historic 1989 speech to the UN, to see UK’s environmental leadership. Deeds, not words, as the Suffragettes used to say, and perhaps it is the EU which should be taking lectures from the UK, not the other way round. In coming decades, the planet faces an unprecedented challenge in the form of climate change. The only way to address it (short of renouncing the modern, energy-intensive lifestyles so beloved of environmentalists) is through technological innovation. In 2000, the EU announced that its Lisbon strategy would make the EU “the world’s most advanced knowledge-based economy by 2010”. It was an abject, risible failure. The EU had, and still has, has no real understanding of the drivers of technological innovation, and no willingness to make the hard choices it might require. Think this is an exaggeration? The EU’s main science programme is called Horizon 2020, currently distributing €80bn in research funds over seven years. UK researchers win more funding from it than the UK puts in, and we are constantly told how vital it is to the future of UK science. The rules to apply for Horizon 2020 money state that “most of the EU funded projects are collaborative projects with at least three organisations from different EU member states or associated countries.” Why is this necessary? Is it because scientists are too stupid to find the best collaborators themselves? Or is it because Horizon 2020 is really about driving European integration, not about funding the most promising science? And what does Horizon 2020 actually fund? Its 2,000 projects can be searched by keyword. Between them, “graphene”, “batteries” and “PV” – three anchor technologies for any future clean energy system – account for just 45 projects. Look for the keyword “cultural” and you find 77 projects; “cooperation”, 142 projects; “social” 262 projects. Not surprisingly, sociopolitical and socioeconomic researchers – and their green NGO fellow-travellers – have been queueing up to demand that this pseudo-innovation, cargo-cult-cum-gravy-train must roll on at all costs. The EU’s persistent anti-innovation bias has seen it slump from 30% of the world’s economy in 1980 to just 15% today. If it continues on current trends, by the time my children reach my age it will account for just 7% of the world economy. Its people will be no wealthier than the global average. All pretensions of global environmental leadership will surely have been swept away. The UK is facing a historic opportunity to loosen the ties that bind us to this fate. To align instead – in a way that EU protectionism fundamentally prevents us from doing – with the growing, dynamic 85% of the world’s economy which contains 93% of its population. The parts of the world in desperate need of environmental innovation. The parts that are already, in fact, leading in environmental technology.

Boris Johnson was quick to say that many of the signatories of the letter to the Times from almost 200 business leaders wanted to join the exchange rate mechanism in the 1980s and the euro ahead of its launch in 1999. “On both occasions all those same people were wrong,” he argued. Last year Leave.EU co-founder Richard Tice said that after a vote to quit the EU, voters will ask “why was there so much fear and why did our political and corporate establishment mislead us for so long?” It seems that the views and reputations of corporate leaders, the very same buccaneers who will supposedly lead the charge for trade outside the EU following a Brexit vote, must be trashed to sway voters in the upcoming referendum. The problem for the outers is that big businesses are, with a few exceptions, not kidding. They always like the status quo and more than that, they like the protective cocoon that Brussels wraps around them in the form of expensive regulation. Corporate lobbying is usually characterised as a means to reduce red tape. Often it is the opposite. Regulations that are difficult or expensive to comply with keep out competition and allow the firms that remain to charge their customers more. There is also the cooperation that can be won at the EU bargaining table. Probably the first casualty of Brexit will be the Hinckley Point nuclear power station. As deals go, the Somerset energy scheme already hangs by a thread. So the question is, why would François Hollande agree a request for more funding from the main contractor, the government-owned utility EDF, when the UK has turned its back on the continent? That’s not to say that all threats spark an immediate concern. Last week, HSBC warned that it could shift 1,000 investment banking jobs from London to Paris if the UK quits the EU. It might move some people to France, or even the German financial centre in Frankfurt. Yet the UK banking industry is in a dominant position and has the strength to survive and prosper outside the EU. The aviation, pharmaceutical and car industries also have the deep and sophisticated supplier networks, skilled workers and access to cheap finance to keep them in the UK. Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Honda and Land Rover owner Tata are not going to terminate billions of pounds of investment in plant and machinery, even if the EU imposes and extra tariff on British made cars, which is unlikely. The problem arises the next time there is an investment decision. The car business might be in good shape, but most van and lorry making has drifted abroad and can now be found in Sweden and Germany. Cars are just a collection of parts and those can be made in Poland, Hungary or the Czech Republic. Pharmaceutical firms operating in the UK enjoy more than £2bn of grants from Europe’s research and development budget. That would need to be replaced from the £9bn net contribution to the EU each year that Nigel Farage has possibly spent several times over in his referendum pledges. Without those grants, the pharmaceutical firms will move without hesitation. It is true that Britain is a big and expanding market for goods and services and the share of exports to the EU has fallen from 54.8% in 2002 to nearer 44% today. It is also true that EU regulations cost billions of pounds to implement and many small firms must comply. And jobs growth is more likely to come from small and medium sized business, many of which never set foot outside Britain’s shores. Yet the presumption must be that an independent UK will dispense with often necessary regulations to save cash and be content for its largest trading partner erecting more barriers to trade. And while the letter might seem like blackmail by major corporations seeking to retain their cosy relationships inside the EU, they have deep pockets for much-needed investment. The risk is they will take their money elsewhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/apr/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-steel-crisis-port-talbot-matters-more-than-china","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-01T18:01:35Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the steel crisis: Port Talbot matters more than China | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-steel-crisis-port-talbot-matters-more-than-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-steel-crisis-port-talbot-matters-more-than-china","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the steel crisis: Port Talbot matters more than China","bodyText":"Sajid Javid said some important things on Friday when he finally made it to Port Talbot almost three days after Tata Steel decided to pull out of its UK steel operations. The business secretary said the steel industry is absolutely vital to UK manufacturing. He said there most certainly will be interested buyers of the Tata assets. He said that he was on the steel workers’ side. And he said the UK government supported tariffs against dumping. Warm words were needed and it was important Mr Javid uttered some. The problem, though, is that such assurances are too little, too late and too flimsy. If the business secretary was as serious as he now claims about finding long-term solutions for the UK steel industry he would have been proving it by trying to find them months ago, when the crisis that made landfall this week was still a gathering storm on the financial oceans, rather than now, when the damage is already being done. The fear, underpinned by Mr Javid’s disturbing infatuation with the libertarian individualist ideas of the American writer Ayn Rand and by his low-profile laissez-faire approach to the steel crisis generally – surely he must have known the Tata situation before he set off to Australia – is that what he brought to Port Talbot were crocodile tears. The big charge against Mr Javid, and perhaps even more strongly against his patron George Osborne, is that in the end they have always been prepared to let the UK steel industry go rather than fight for it as a strategic national asset. They are willing to do that because their highest priority is neither the protection of the steel industry nor doctrinaire laissez-faire economics so much as ensuring the long-term investment of Chinese capital in British infrastructure projects that, for domestic political reasons, cannot be financed by taxation. Underlying that is the suspicion that the Conservative government will now always go to extreme lengths to avoid offending China, and will be particularly insouciant if it involves creating employment crises in places where few people are likely to vote Conservative anyway. In the case of steel this has meant an essentially passive policy in the face of the global glut caused by Chinese over-production as its growth slows. The charge of passivity is consistent with the generally relaxed approach taken by Mr Javid since last May – in contrast to the more committed instincts of his junior minister Anna Soubry. If the choice comes down to the steel plant at Port Talbot or the Chinese-backed Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, therefore, the suspicion is that Mr Osborne will go for the latter. In a contest between an existing British industry and the Chinese capital investment connection it is Xi Jinping who will get the nod every time. An important piece of specific evidence for the charge, though, is Mr Javid’s readiness to block European Union moves to put tariffs on cheap Chinese steel. Mr Javid attempted to muddy the waters on this on Friday. Yet it is a fact that Britain, along with others, has opposed European efforts to overhaul anti-dumping rules that would have helped the EU to raise retaliatory tariffs against Chinese steel similar to the level of those adopted by the US. And it is a fact that Britain led a group of EU nations that voted against higher tariffs. Mr Javid is also on record as welcoming the low price of steel because it helped UK manufacturing. Britain is also arguing that China should be recognised as a market economy within the World Trade Organisation even though the Chinese steel industry is 70% government-owned. Mr Javid’s claim on Friday that he supports tariffs on dumping is a piece of sophistry, since he may think he can argue that China is technically not dumping low-cost steel. If he does believe this, he is on his own. Ministers have suddenly found themselves in an extremely uncomfortable place over steel this week. Not for the first time, Mr Osborne and his supporters have underestimated the political kickback against a strategy that may have seemed brilliant in the Treasury hothouse but that fails to survive contact with the real world. All those words in Mr Osborne’s budget and autumn statement about industrial policy and the march of the makers now ring hollow. They ring hollow not just in Aberavon, which Mr Osborne may not care about because it will never return a Tory MP, but also, much more threateningly for the chancellor, across a middle Britain that still thinks making things is important and something we do well. The sooner that MPs get the chance to hold both ministers to account the better."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2015/oct/21/britain-sucking-up-china-national-humiliation-former-adviser-steve-hilton","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-21T08:34:43Z","webTitle":"Britain 'sucking up' to China is a national humiliation, says PM's former adviser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/21/britain-sucking-up-china-national-humiliation-former-adviser-steve-hilton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/oct/21/britain-sucking-up-china-national-humiliation-former-adviser-steve-hilton","fields":{"headline":"Britain 'sucking up' to China is a national humiliation, says PM's former adviser","bodyText":"David Cameron will hold lengthy talks with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at Downing Street on Wednesday as his former strategy adviser Steve Hilton denounced the visit as a “national humiliation” and “sucking up” to the communist leader. Hilton, who left Downing Street in 2012 to teach at Stanford University in California and is CEO of tech startup Crowdpac, told BBC Newsnight that Britain’s lavish treatment of the Chinese leader was “the worst national humiliation since we went cap in hand to the IMF in the 1970s”. “The truth is that China is a rogue state just as bad as Russia or Iran, and I just don’t understand why we’re sucking up to them rather than standing up to them as we should be,” he said. The former adviser said he thought the government should be much tougher. “I think that we should consider sanctions on China, not rolling out the red carpet.” His remarks, his strongest attack on Cameron and chancellor George Osborne’s judgement, came as Britain seeks to cement multibillion pound trade deals during the Chinese president’s four-day state visit to the UK. Investment by Beijing in Britain’s first UK nuclear power plant in a generation is expected to be confirmed as part of what the government hopes will amount altogether to £30bn of agreements. Hilton said Britain’s US partners were bewildered by Cameron’s attitude, adding that the UK could make these infrastructure investments without needing to go to China for finance. Xi’s itinerary on Wednesday includes a visit to Imperial College London with Prince Andrew, an exhibition on cultural collaboration with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, a meeting with Cameron at No 10 and a banquet at London’s Guildhall. Although Hilton left Downing Street three years ago, he remains in close touch with Cameron and helped the prime minister with his recent speech at the Conservative party conference in Manchester that promised an all-out war on poverty."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2016/may/19/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-about-power","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-19T11:00:07Z","webTitle":"Readers recommend playlist: songs about power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/19/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-about-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2016/may/19/readers-recommend-playlist-songs-about-power","fields":{"headline":"Readers recommend playlist: songs about power","bodyText":"Below is this week’s playlist – the theme interpreted and tunes picked by a reader from the comments on last week’s blog. Thanks for your suggestions. Read more about the weekly format of the Readers recommend series at the end of the piece. When introducing the topic, I referenced a Dylan Thomas poem, The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower. I wanted to hear songs that captured the power of the universe, where it comes from and what we do with it all. Of course this could only mean one thing. Certain proteins containing chlorophyll pigments absorb energy from sunlight, a process summised in They Might Be Giants’ Photosynthesis. The song might be geared towards educating children how life on Earth began, but it’s also quite fun: “Photosynthesis does not involve a camera, or a synthesiser although that’s interesting too.” At some point in prehistory, early humans noticed that life-sustaining energy came from the skies. The sun provided life, warmth and growth, while the moon marked time in the sky, shape-shifting while pulling up the oceans’ skirts to reveal delicious seafood. Julian Cope’s Psychedelic Odin documents the rise of old religion, which placed its architecture and technology on propitious sites around the cold north, the better to document and record the whims of nature’s cycles. In Greek mythology, the god Pan is connected to spring, that time when life and light returns to the land after the privations of winter. Stevie Wonder, in Power Flower, channels this god from the dawn of modern thinking to sing about the elements of fire, air and water. So where did all this photosynthesis and accumulative natural energy lead? Well, to here. Dead plants made oil, coal and gas, fossil fuels make money, and there are winners and losers in the extraction process. The extractor risks life and limb to feed their children, while the riches are grabbed by the mine owner and the planter of the derrick. Eric Burdon mined a few old tunes in his time, and there are few he handled better than 16 Tons. Man’s greatest benefactor? Easy: Prometheus, thief of fire. He felt sorry for mankind shivering in caves, and stole fire from mount Olympus to bring comfort to humanity, against the wishes of Zeus. Jimi Hendrix celebrated Fire, and for not dissimilar reasons. In 1966, wearing silks and satins at Christmas in the UK, Jimi is said to have stood in front of the fireplace at Noel Redding’s mother’s place, coveting the warmth of two pounds of smoking nutty slack, guarded by a large Alsation. “Move over, Rover,” he said, “and let Jimi take over.” Fish, Franklin, Faraday, Van Vliet: all pioneers in uncovering the boundless usage and wonder of electricity in all its forms. But catfish and eels got there long before we did. It wasn’t until the late 19th century this astonishing force was wrestled towards industrial application. In Electricity, Captain Beefheart introduces us to the high-voltage man who brings the light, the midnight cowboy who reads dark roads without a map – and, of course, lighthouses. Enough of the serious stuff. Here’s a human dynamo who just needs his partner to plug in, charge him up and set him off like a battery bunny. With the words “a sweet romance is not for me, I need electricity”, the Polecats’ protagonist in Make a Circuit With Me promises 50,000 volts to the lucky recipient of his diode. Having witnessed the Dresden firestorm first hand, Kurt Vonnegut eventually found a literary technique capable of preserving his experiences in the novel Slaughterhouse-Five, in which a character’s death is remarked upon with the phrase, “so it goes”. This was war on an industrial scale. Nick Lowe doesn’t quite sing the phrase that often in his So It Goes, but he does take the listener on a journey from the voltage used at a concert to the disagreements between men of supreme power that lead inevitably to war. In 1887, Lord Acton said: “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men.” But the Weirdos are denying any personal culpability in We Got the Neutron Bomb. It’s not their fault they can lay waste to entire nations who refuse to cough up their resources. It’s nothing personal, just survival of the fittest. To paraphrase MR James, Killing Joke offer a warning to the incurious on Glitch. If it all sounds a bit Y2K, the Joke are actually expounding a theory that suggests our technological society is precariously balanced on the cusp of a disastrous loss of the power which drives the modern world. One wrong move, a glitch, an unforeseen combination of switches thrown, and pff! The lights go out. Oi Polloi, on the other hand, have a solution. Nuclear Waste uses neat wordplay to suggest that nuclear power is actually wasteful, and exists only to create weapons. They want our governments to invest in renewable resources such as wind and wave power, hydroelectrics and solar power. And they’re not asking, they’re shouting. Finally – what to do when disaster strikes? Executive Suite’s When the Fuel Runs Out illustrates a situation where the only warmth left is fuelled by love and companionship. More power to them.

That includes Hillary Clinton","bodyText":"Democrats have a decision to make: do they think money in politics is a corrupting force that influences the decisions made by elected officials, or not? After years railing against the Citizens United decision, which opened the floodgates to outside spending in elections, some of them appear to have done a complete reversal. The Clinton campaign has spent the last few weeks furiously pushing back at the criticism that she is influenced by the vast donations her campaign receives from backers in the oil and financial industries. Her supporters have been vigorously arguing there’s no evidence of a quid pro quo. How quickly they forget. As journalist David Sirota reported earlier this week, in the 2008 Democratic primary campaign, Clinton harshly criticized then senator Obama for accepting donations from oil and gas executives – and even cut a campaign commercial about it. The kicker? It was less money than Clinton has accepted from people working for fossil fuel companies so far this campaign season. While Clinton called the suggestion that she might be influenced by the wealthy bankers who raise money for her campaign an “artful smear” in 2016, she also had no problem hurling even stronger accusations about Obama in 2008: “Senator Obama has some questions to answer about his dealings with one of his largest contributors – Exelon, a big nuclear power company,” she said. “Apparently he cut some deals behind closed doors to protect them from full disclosure of the nuclear industry.” Then there are the closed-door speeches that Clinton gave for Goldman Sachs and other big banks after she left her role as secretary of state. While she has steadfastly refused to release the transcripts, she’s claimed it has never affected her position on the banks one iota. Which is fine, if that’s the principled stance you want to take, but it’s not one her party has had in the past. Mitt Romney was hit hard in the 2012 presidential campaign by Democrats for the speeches he gave to financial institutions. So which is it? Are politicians corrupt (or susceptible to corruption) if they are giving highly paid speeches behind closed doors to financial institutions, or not? It doesn’t work both ways. Clinton has also criticized the supreme court’s ruling in Citizens United by rightly pointing out that the original case was sparked by an attempt to air a documentary that was critical of her right before an election. Yet she has reaped the rewards from the ruling – possibly more than any other candidate – from myriad Super Pacs and outside groups that have spent heavily in favor of her candidacy. The president of Citizens United even told the Center for Public Integrity last week: “Wouldn’t you know that Hillary Clinton has become one of the greatest beneficiaries of the Citizens United supreme court decision. It is an irony that is not lost on me.” Sure, even hardcore Sanders supporters will admit there is no evidence of direct quid pro quo when talking about large donations various parties made to the Clinton Foundation when Clinton was secretary of state. But it would be difficult not to worry about at least the potential for a conflict of interest, when weapons manufacturers and Saudi Arabia were making donations to the Clinton Foundation while their weapons deals were approved by the State Department, oil companies were doing the same before the State Department approved the oil sands pipeline project, and other fossil fuels donated at around the same time the secretary was advocating increased fracking abroad. But of course there is no quid pro quo – that has never been the prime criticism of wealthy individuals using their vast resources to “buy” elections, push candidates in one direction, or influence office holders in much more subtle and nuanced ways than outright bribery. And by taking this position that only quid pro quo equals corruption, Clinton supporters are essentially adopting the reasoning of the Roberts court that they claim to abhor – that unless there is direct evidence of overtly trading money for votes, corruption doesn’t exist. As Lawrence Lessig has written, Democrats have been slowly embracing this stance for years, but the Clinton campaign seems to cementing it as the party’s policy. No one has made this point better than Clinton surrogate and former representative Barney Frank – or should I say, the 2012 version of him. Last week, Frank accused Sanders supporters of engaging in McCarthyism by suggesting that politicians, and Clinton in particular, are influenced by big money contributions from wealthy backers, and as a result, did not push for prosecutions of the executives of large banks. However, Frank sang an altogether different tune about the influence of campaign contributions when he was leaving Congress in 2012. “People say, ‘Oh, it doesn’t have any effect on me,’” Frank told NPR at the time about the constant need to continually raise money as a congressman. “Well if that were the case, we’d be the only human beings in the history of the world who on a regular basis took significant amounts of money from perfect strangers and made sure that it had no effect on our behavior.” I guess we can assume Clinton is the first person in the history of the world to avoid this problem altogether then."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2015/mar/13/irans-advances-create-alarm-in-saudi-arabia-and-the-gulf","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-13T16:03:03Z","webTitle":"Iran's advances create alarm in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/13/irans-advances-create-alarm-in-saudi-arabia-and-the-gulf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/mar/13/irans-advances-create-alarm-in-saudi-arabia-and-the-gulf","fields":{"headline":"Iran's advances create alarm in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf","bodyText":"The commanders of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) have been working overtime recently, flaunting their achievements across the Middle East and flexing muscles as international negotiations over the country’s nuclear programme enter their critical and perhaps final phase. On Wednesday it was the turn of Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari, the IRGC’s most senior officer. “The Islamic revolution is advancing with good speed, its example being the ever-increasing export of the revolution,” he declared. “Not only Palestine and Lebanon acknowledge the influential role of the Islamic Republic but so do the people of Iraq and Syria. They appreciate the nation of Iran.” Last month a similarly boastful message was delivered by General Qassem Suleimani, who leads the IRGC’s elite Quds force — and who is regularly photographed leading the fightback of Iraqi Shia miltias against the Sunni jihadis of the Islamic State (Isis) as well as against western and Arab-backed rebels fighting Bashar al-Assad in southern Syria. “Imperialists and Zionists have admitted defeat at the hands of the Islamic Republic and the resistance movement,” Suleimani said. Iran’s advances are fuelling alarm in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, where Tehran has been a strategic rival since the days of the Shah, and which now, it is said with dismay, in effect controls four Arab capitals – Baghdad, Damascus and Beirut and in the last month Sana’a in Yemen – which is uncomfortably close to home. Iran’s regional position has certainly improved. Its high-profile role fighting Isis in Iraq, Assad’s retention of control in Syria with the help of its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, and the Houthi rebel takeover in Yemen have all been deeply discomfiting for the Saudis. Anti-government protests in Shia-majority Bahrain are also often blamed on Tehran — though that ignores the domestic roots of the unrest. In Riyadh King Salman has dropped his preoccupation with the Muslim Brotherhood in favour of building a united Sunni Arab front to confront the Iranians, diplomats say, though translating that strategy into action is another matter. The message from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is that whatever the outcome of the nuclear talks, Iran is bent on expanding its power and influence. “The Iranians have scored major victories but only where there are Shia minorities,” a senior Gulf official told the Guardian. “Our concern is that the nuclear issue will become a tool of their foreign policy.” Arab alarm is shared by Israel. Binyamin Netanyahu used identical arguments in his recent speech to the US Congress, timed to influence next week’s nuclear endgame in Geneva. “The Saudis will be incredibly worried that we are getting close to a point where the Iranians will be players because of the nuclear issue and the way the Americans have effectively ended up on the same side as the Iranians in Iraq,” said one veteran Saudi-watcher. “But the noise they are making is in inverse proportion to their ability to do anything about it.” Arab governments are not reassured by the promises of John Kerry, the US secretary of state, that Washington is not seeking a “grand bargain” with Tehran that will allow it to “destabilise” the Middle East, bolstered by the easing of economic sanctions. Saud Al Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, warned of Tehran’s “hegemonic” ambitions as the IRGC supported the military operation to retake the Iraqi town of Tikrit from Isis. In Gulf capitals Hassan Rouhani, the emollient Iranian president, is seen as less important than the hardline supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It is hard to disentangle propaganda from reality. But independent analysts argue that Iran is inflating its gains for both foreign and domestic consumption. “If you listen to Suleimani there is a degree of exaggeration,” argues Ali Ansari of St Andrews University. “It’s rhetorical reassurance. He is saying to Iranians: ‘We are powerful and and everyone is worried about this’ – partly to make the point that they are not really under pressure. People outside can see what Iran’s strengths and weaknesses are. But there is this belief that you need to negotiate from a position of strength and that if you are weak you will be trampled on.” Iran-watcher Hossein Rassam also detects a domestic calculation in the IRGC statements. “Critics of Rouhani’s policy of rapprochement with the international community inside Iran can turn to the supreme leader and say there wasn’t really much need for that softer tone because now we have more bargaining chips in our hands. Iran is the only power in the region which can actually fight Isis and the west needs us for that.” Meir Litvak, an Israeli expert on Iran, sees both genuine belief and posturing in Tehran’s stance. “The Iranians believe they have been able to save the Assad regime from total collapse and there is at least stalemate in Syria,” he said. “That means they have been able to maintain the link with Hezbollah and maybe open a second front by proxy against Israel on the Golan Heights. The Houthi rebellion in Yemen was initially a genuinely domestic affair but the Iranian regime saw it as an opportunity. And it has become a bonus for it – even if they are not that active in Yemen. But if the Saudis are scared that’s a plus for the Iranians.” Arab diplomatic sources say they expect to see an IRGC and Hezbollah presence in Yemen, helped by a new agreement on regular flights between Tehran and Sana’a. Iran’s role in Bahrain, where the Shia majority remains locked in confrontation with the Saudi-backed Sunni monarchy, is more about scoring propaganda points than material support – despite claims in Manama about Iran’s sinister role. Still, in the heartlands of Iranian influence, Iraq and Syria, there have been significant costs as well as benefits, including the deaths of two senior IRGC commanders. Continuing sanctions and low oil prices – seen in Tehran as a deliberate strategy by the Saudis – have also made it harder to shell out billions of dollars to subsidise the Assad regime. Iran’s great advantage, suggests Emile Hokayem, an analyst, is its commitment and competence, in Syria and beyond. “The expertise, experience and strategic patience it deployed in support of the Syrian regime to a great extent facilitated Assad’s recovery from serious setbacks in 2012. In contrast, the war in Syria has exposed not only the political and operational limitations of the Gulf states, but also the rivalries among them.” Additional reporting by Saeed Kamali Dheghan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/oct/13/edf-nuclear-deal-fair-balanced-hinkley-point","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-13T19:10:43Z","webTitle":"EDF nuclear deal is fair and balanced | @guardianletters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/13/edf-nuclear-deal-fair-balanced-hinkley-point","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/oct/13/edf-nuclear-deal-fair-balanced-hinkley-point","fields":{"headline":"EDF nuclear deal is fair and balanced","bodyText":"Dale Vince of Ecotricity is wrong to suggest that end-of-life costs for Hinkley Point C will be an economic burden on the UK (Report, 13 October).

The political fallout from the removal of Nhlanhla Nene led to a near-11% fall on Thursday in FTSE 100 financial services group Old Mutual, and an 11% slump in Investec, the stockbroker listed in the FTSE 250 index. South Africa’s president, Jacob Zuma, removed Nene, who had been in the post for less than two years, late on Wednesday, giving no explanation. David van Rooyen, a former mayor and member of parliament who has served on financial committees, was sworn in on Thursday during a brief ceremony in Pretoria. The main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, called Zuma’s decision “reckless and irrational”, saying Nene had been sacked because he opposed “excessive spending” on a proposed deal with international energy companies to build nuclear power stations and on new aircraft purchases for South Africa’s struggling national airline. Economists at Capital Economics said Nene had been regarded as an “advocate of fiscal discipline” and the sell-off in the markets also drove yields on government bonds above 10% for the first time since 2008. While London-listed companies with large presences in South Africa were hit hard, so was the Johannesburg stock exchange where its banking index lost 13.5%. “The sell-off in South African markets on Thursday was probably a sign of things to come,” Capital Economics analysts said. “That added to a sharp sell-off of the rand, to … its weakest ever rate against the US dollar.” Ratings agencies have already pushed the country’s credit rating to just above junk status – which pushes up the cost of borrowing. Ratings agency Fitch downgraded the country to BBB-, while Standard &amp; Poor’s maintained South Africa’s rating, but revised the outlook to negative. In response to Nene’s departure, Fitch said there were questions about “the motivation for the change in personnel and the implications for economic policy”. “The change [in finance minister] would be relevant to our sovereign rating assessment if it led to a loosening of fiscal policy, such as an upward revision to the government’s nominal expenditure ceilings, and a faster increase in government indebtedness,” Fitch said. Many economists questioned Van Rooyen’s ability to steady an economy being hammered by the collapse in prices of South Africa’s commodity exports that range from coal to gold, and raised concerns that public spending could spiral out of control. London-listed Anglo American, which employs around half its 135,000 workforce in South Africa, rocked the mining industry this week by announcing plans to cut 85,000 roles and sell off more than half its mines in response to the plunging price of iron ore and other metals.

Analysts at stockbroker Liberum Capital said the tie-up with France's EDF will make Hinkley Point the most expensive power station in the world. \"Having considered the known terms of the deal, we are flabbergasted that the UK government has committed future generations of consumers to the costs that will flow from this deal,\" the analysts said. The government gave the go-ahead last week for an EDF-led consortium to build the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Its two reactors will cost £8bn each and will provide enough power to supply 7% of Britain's homes for 60 years. The energy secretary, Ed Davey, has gambled that the cost of fossil fuels will rocket by the time Hinkley Point starts operating in 2023, according to Liberum's analysts Peter Atherton and Mulu Sun in a report publishedon Wednesday. The government has also given EDF so much leeway on time and cost that the consortium's risk is negligible, they argued. The analysts said: \"The UK government is taking a massive bet that fossil fuel prices will be extremely high in the future. If that bet proves to be wrong then this contract will look economically insane when HPC commissions. We are frankly staggered that the UK government thinks it is appropriate to take such a bet and underwrite the economics of any power station that costs £5m per MW and takes nine years to build.\" Davey agreed a minimum price of £92.50 for every megawatt hour (MWh) of energy Hinkley Point generates – almost twice the current wholesale cost of electricity. The price is also index-linked to inflation, meaning EDF can expect revenue of about £121 per MWh by 2023, the analysts calculated. That means the price of gas will need to increase by at least 130% to make the government's agreement pay by making nuclear power more attractive than gas. Caroline Lucas, the Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: \"When City analysts tell you a contract is 'economically insane', it's time to admit that you might have got it wrong. The analysis doesn't even take into account the fact that they are only expected to meet a 'share' of the costs of dealing with the toxic waste created by their generators, with the public facing another bill for clean-up costs in future.\" The two planned pressurised water reactors are the first to start construction in Europe since Japan's Fukushima disaster and the first in the UK since Sizewell B power station opened in 1995. The deal means consumers' bills will pay for the electricity generated by the plant. The agreement has sparked controversy after four of the big six energy companies increased their prices by an average of 9.1% this month. The government predicts lower bills from investing in nuclear power but Atherton and Sun said there was a high chance that consumers would lose out compared with investing in fossil fuels. EDF will make about £1bn a year pre-tax profit when the plant starts operating – almost half the total profits made by the big six energy suppliers last year from their power generation arms, the analysts said. EDF said the deal was fair and that consumers would not pay anything until Hinkley Point C was operational: \"Hinkley Point C is competitive with or cheaper than all other large-scale options for new-build generation in the next decade. It is also the cheapest of all low-carbon technologies.\" The Department of Energy and Climate Change said cost estimates needed to include the average price of energy over the life of the plant as well as building, operating and decommissioning expenses. A spokesperson said: \"Taken together, we expect the deal on Hinkley Point C to be competitive with gas-powered generation in the 2020s. The impact on consumer bills of Hinkley Point C should be considered against the costs of alternative generation mixes, and we expect consumers to be better off in a market that provides diversity in our energy supply, and which includes new nuclear.\" Low-carbon future Analysts may not think the UK has struck a good deal for the building of Hinkley Point C but the government has put nuclear power at the centre of its energy policy. The coalition has stuck with targets introduced by the last Labour government to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050. As part of that effort nuclear power has been rebranded as a low-carbon source of energy. The government also argues that nuclear power will reduce reliance on imported energy from unpredictable countries such as Russia and will help protect against volatile prices. Britain has not opened a nuclear power station for almost 20 years and most existing plants are due to close by 2023. But the government has said it will not foot the bill for new reactors. In addition to Hinkley Point, France's EDF plans to build two reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk. Japan's Hitachi has been enlisted to construct two or three reactors each at Wylfa on Anglesey and at Oldbury in Gloucestershire. France's GDF Suez and Iberdrola of Spain are planning a new plant at Moorside, near the existing Sellafield site in Cumbria. Other sites earmarked for new plants are Bradwell in Essex, Hartlepool, and Heysham, Lancashire. But Professor Steve Thomas of Greenwich University argues nuclear power stations are almost never built on time and to budget and that the government could end up paying the price. He points to plants at Olkiluoto in Finland and Flamanville in France, both of which have overrun by many years and have seen costs rocket. The Finnish government and EDF's partner at Hinkley, Areva, are at war over who picks up the bill despite Areva originally agreeing a fixed price. \"The UK government asked me what they could learn from what went wrong at Olkiluoto and I said 'nothing because everything went wrong'.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/oct/11/observer-view-renewable-energy-policy-conservative","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-10T23:05:14Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on the Tory renewable energy policy | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/11/observer-view-renewable-energy-policy-conservative","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/11/observer-view-renewable-energy-policy-conservative","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on the Tory renewable energy policy","bodyText":"The Conservative party has spent much time mocking Labour for being out of touch on business issues, particularly Jeremy Corbyn’s support for rail and possibly energy nationalisation. But George Osborne seems much more at home tickling the tummies of huge, state-owned companies in China and France, especially with regard to nuclear power, than tending his domestic, private-sector firms. While the chancellor was out wooing on a recent trip to Beijing, he seemed blissfully unaware that subsidy cuts to the UK’s growing army of small and medium-size “green” companies have been causing havoc. Last week, the true scale of his destructive policies became clear when one of the largest providers of solar panels in Britain, the Mark Group, collapsed into liquidation with the loss of almost 1,000 jobs. It was not long before a second solar and insulation provider, Climate Energy, bit the dust and now the Solar Trade Association predicts that dozens of firms and 27,000 employees are in danger. Mark Group was happy to make clear where the blame should lie, saying the government’s “draconian policy proposals… will essentially eliminate the solar PV market in the UK”. The Department of Energy and Climate Change has denied this, claiming it’s all down to “commercial decisions”. It has the unenviable task of implementing the policies on renewable energy, but few are in any doubt that the orders come from the Treasury, which is on a wider mission to bear down on all costs. The latest proposal, to cut solar subsidies by 87%, is just another in a long line of changes that have hit energy efficiency, onshore wind, biomass and many other sectors that create jobs and a lower-carbon economy. These cuts look particularly irresponsible in the run-up to the UN climate change talks in Paris, but at any time it is odd to see a party that wants to make Britain greater showing little time for nurturing a new business sector."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/may/13/how-to-simulate-a-terrorist-atrocity-trafford-centre-manchester-drill","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-13T17:37:33Z","webTitle":"How to simulate a terrorist atrocity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/13/how-to-simulate-a-terrorist-atrocity-trafford-centre-manchester-drill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/may/13/how-to-simulate-a-terrorist-atrocity-trafford-centre-manchester-drill","fields":{"headline":"How to simulate a terrorist atrocity","bodyText":"“I wanted to see what I would do if I came up against something like that,” says Sarah Quinn. “My heart was racing and you go into panic mode, thinking: ‘What do I do?’ I slung tables and chairs on top of me and hid underneath. My thought was that if there’s less body on show, the less they could shoot me. At one point, I was dragged along the floor by two men, because they saw my injuries and thought that was the best way to react.” Quinn, who works for the probation service, has been a volunteer with the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service for a couple of months, and that is why she found herself in Manchester’s Trafford Centre in the early hours of Tuesday morning, cowering under a table with a gash to the head, glass in her arm and gunshots echoing around the shopping mall. She was taking part in a drill to test the skills and capabilities of the police, counter-terrorism units, fire and ambulance services in the north of England in the event of a terrorist attack – in this case, involving a suicide bombing and masked gunmen. A video clip shows a bomb going off outside a burger restaurant, which leaves dozens of people lying “killed” or “injured” on the ground, while others run off screaming. Quinn arrived at the shopping centre at 8pm to get her makeup done – blood on her face and fake glass in her arm. “There were actors for the main parts so they had the worst makeup, but we had cuts and bruises. It looked really real. When someone came back from makeup, you thought: ‘That looks like a right good beating.’” If you could ignore the ear defenders and safety goggles. And when the explosion happened, and the gunfire was cracking, it felt real, she says. “It was a case of: ‘Where should I run?’ The explosion and gunfire was echoing and you couldn’t tell where you needed to run. You could have run straight into something. It was scary. Even though you knew it wasn’t real, it really felt real.” The aftermath was also rehearsed: ambulance crew checked her out and the police took a statement. The police had been planning the exercise since last autumn, says assistant chief constable Rebekah Sutcliffe. Hundreds of people were involved, as well as a huge range of organisations, from the Home Office, military and counter-terrorism network to the Trafford Centre owners. Senior officers were also being trained. “I was involved as a commander, and you do forget it’s not real at times,” she says. “You’ve got that element of knowing it’s an exercise but you’re under pressure – it’s a quick-moving exercise, so you feel that reality.” What they are testing, she says, is not just an individual’s ability or preparedness for an event such as this, “you’re also testing how long it takes to turn out a particular capability.So if you need somebody to come from Merseyside to Manchester to be part of the control room – how long does that take them, and have you got the communications systems you need? You’re testing all of the infrastructure that supports your response and identifying what works well and what works less well.” What didn’t work so well, it became clear, was attention to cultural sensitivity and the idea that not all terrorists are Islamic extremists – someone shouted the phrase “Allahu Akbar” as the bomb detonated, for which the police have been heavily criticised. “Clearly we’ve had problems with the use of the phrase, which has been really unfortunate, and we’ve given an apology for that, quite rightly,” says Sutcliffe. “But in terms of the exercise objective and training we needed to get out of it, it has been a huge success.” The police have said they need to be more culturally aware in future. “If you were wielding a sword or a firearm in an exercise in the Trafford Centre, they would have made sure [to make it safe],” says Francesca Hunt, co-director of immersive security roleplay company CrisisCast. “What they were doing was wielding an emotional phrase without the equivalent care and expertise.” CrisisCast was founded by Hunt and Brian Mitchell – both are actors and have worked in film production, and brought this knowledge to disaster and crisis management training. They can create a 20-car pile-up, or recreate an incident in a nuclear power station; later this year they will be staging a plane crash at an airport, complete with wrecked fuselage, to test the capabilities of the airport fire service. They use smoke, prosthetics and medically trained makeup artists who, says Mitchell, “know what a bullet hole really looks like, and the colour of blood. On some exercises you’ll see very pink blood, but blood is more coffee-coloured. It’s dark when it comes out.” Their 400 actors have also been trained by a psychologist so they know how they should react in a traumatic situation. “It’s not what we call jazz-hands acting,” says Hunt. “It’s not about trying to do a big show and doing a great Lady Macbeth bit – ‘Oh my god, I’ve got blood on my hands.’ It’s to do with making sure the person you’re dealing with gets caught in the realism.” And it is very real, says another member of the team, Mick Massey, who spent 30 years with the London fire brigade. “It’s as real as you can get without it actually happening,” he says. “It’s about developing muscle memory. The only way, sadly, I learned that was from real incidents.” As a young fireman, his first major incident was the blast at the Olympia exhibition centre in west London in 1976, blamed on a breakaway IRA group; he was also at the 7/7 attacks and the Paddington rail disaster. “The more realism you put in, the more comfortable you feel – if you can feel comfortable – when it happens for real.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/sep/18/india-china-trade-deals-xi-delhi","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-18T13:09:12Z","webTitle":"India and China announce trade deals during Xi visit to Delhi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/18/india-china-trade-deals-xi-delhi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/sep/18/india-china-trade-deals-xi-delhi","fields":{"headline":"India and China announce trade deals during Xi visit to Delhi","bodyText":"India and China have announced a series of deals aimed at boosting economic growth in both countries. Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, said on a visit to Delhi that China would invest billions of dollars over the next five years in railways, industrial parks and, potentially, nuclear power in India. \"We can bring prosperity to Asia, and we can create opportunities for the world,\" Xi said during a ceremonial welcome at the presidential palace in the Indian capital before a meeting with Narendra Modi, India's newly elected prime minister. Modi claimed a landslide victory in May's elections after campaigning with a development agenda. The 64-year-old Hindu nationalist has often spoken of his admiration for the economic development achieved by China in recent decades and knows that his own country desperately needs a massive infusion of investment to improve its collapsing infrastructure. Experts said the amount pledged by Xi – $20bn (£12bn) initially – was less than had been expected. \"It's disappointing. It did not match the hype created before the visit. There was even some rumours of $100bn being invested. This is $4bn a year, if it comes,\" said Srikant Kondapalli, an expert in India and China at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University. Xi's visit to India started in the western state of Gujarat, which Modi ran for 12 years. The two men had dinner on Wednesday night in a tent set up on a redeveloped riverfront in the city of Ahmedabad. Trade between the two developing nations has increased rapidly in the last decade, reaching around $70bn last year, with China now India's largest trading partner. But India's trade deficit with China is already at about $40bn and there are fears that it could grow if China uses India as a dumping ground for cheap manufactured goods in the future. Despite the statements of goodwill, the visit has been overshadowed by a tense standoff in the Himalayas. Indian officials claim that hundreds of Chinese troops crossed the unmarked 2,200-mile mountain frontier between the two states last week. Modi told a press conference after the meeting with Xi: \"We need to ensure that there is peace along the border, and if there is, we can work together in mutual cooperation. If this happens we can realise true potential of our relations.\" Border incidents are common, though the timing of this confrontation has troubled observers. \"If some of the reports about the number of Chinese troops involved are true then it is the biggest mobilisation for a long time. It's not clear why. Perhaps there is some difference in the civil-military relationship and this is a message to Xi Jingping [from the military],\" Kondapalli said. Xi, who is only the third Chinese premier to visit India, described the border issue as a long-term problem. \"As the area is yet to be demarcated, there may be some incidents,\" he told reporters. Xi also said China would support India becoming a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a regional security body whose largest members are China and Russia. The relationship between the two regional powers is complex, with both looking for commercial advantages while mindful of core security concerns. One long-term irritation for Beijing is the presence of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader, in India. Despite tight security, dozens of Tibetan protesters held a noisy demonstration outside the building where the two leaders met on Thursday morning in central Delhi. Dorjee Tseten, of Students for a Free Tibet International, said: \"Xi Jinping is leading one of the most oppressive military offensives that Tibetans have faced in the past 50 years of China's occupation of our country.\" New Delhi had earlier asked the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet for India in 1959 and is considered a \"separatist\" by Beijing, to reschedule a conclave of religious leaders scheduled for this week in the capital so that it would not clash with the Chinese president's visit. The Tibetan leader says he seeks only greater autonomy for his homeland, and on Thursday he urged Xi to learn from India's democracy. \"I think the Chinese president should learn some of India's experience. Look, east India, south India, west India, north India, different language, different script. But no danger of separation,\" he said. \"Democratic rule, rule of law and free media …\" In a column published in a local newspaper prior to his arrival, Xi said the \"Chinese dragon\" and the \"Indian elephant\" both cherished peace and shared one of the most dynamic and promising bilateral relations of the 21st century. Xi, who took power in 2012, arrives after touring the Maldives and Sri Lanka, two countries where growing Chinese influence has worried India. Delhi also has concerns about China's relationship with its hostile neighbour Pakistan and its growing role in Nepal. Beijing has been unsettled by Indian-US cooperation in the Asia Pacific region and Indian's stance on territorial disputes involving China and other nations in the South and East China Seas. Modi's efforts to build a rapport with his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, during a heavily publicised recent visit to Tokyo and his plans to meet Barack Obama later this month point to a carefully balanced approach to India's relations with world powers. China and India fought a war in 1962 which ended in a crushing defeat for Delhi's forces."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/nov/10/tpps-clauses-that-let-australia-be-sued-are-weapons-of-legal-destruction-says-lawyer","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-10T02:58:13Z","webTitle":"TPP's clauses that let Australia be sued are weapons of legal destruction, says lawyer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/10/tpps-clauses-that-let-australia-be-sued-are-weapons-of-legal-destruction-says-lawyer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/nov/10/tpps-clauses-that-let-australia-be-sued-are-weapons-of-legal-destruction-says-lawyer","fields":{"headline":"TPP's clauses that let Australia be sued are weapons of legal destruction, says lawyer","bodyText":"When the text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership was finally released last Friday morning, many supporters and detractors went straight to one of its most controversial provisions: so-called investor state dispute settlement (ISDS). This provision, opposed by Labor and the Greens in Australia, gives foreign investors the power to sue the Australian government for introducing legislation that harms their investment. Andrew Robb, the Australian trade minister, was quick to defend the agreement from its detractors. He lauded Australia’s efforts to secure significant exemptions, which he said would make it impossible for foreign corporations to sue the Australian government for enacting environmental policy. “It’s a trade agreement which looks at issues relating to trade that can affect public policy in the environmental area … It does provide safeguards, the best safeguards that have ever been provided in any agreement in this regard.” Robb said critics were just the usual suspects “jumping at shadows”, “peddling lines they’ve been peddling for years without having a decent look at what’s been negotiated”. But George Kahale III is not one of the usual suspects. As chairman of the world’s leading legal arbitration firm – Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt &amp; Mosle LLP – his core business is to defend governments being sued by foreign investors under ISDS. Some of his clients are included in the TPP, and he says the trade minister’s critics are right: “There are significant improvements in this treaty, but they do not immunise Australia from any of these claims. If the trade minister is saying, ‘We’re not at risk for regulating environmental matters’, then the trade minister is wrong.” Speaking via Skype from his office in New York, Kahale thumbs through the investment chapter, pointing out the critical loopholes that leave Australia wide open. “The one where all the discussion should be focused is 9.15,” he says, referring to one of the “safeguards”. “That’s a very nice provision, which I imagine the trade minister points to as, ‘We’ve really protected ourselves on anything of social importance.’ I think that’s nonsense, frankly.” Here’s what 9.15 says: “Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent a party from adopting, maintaining or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental, health or other regulatory objectives.” This entire provision is negated, says Kahale, by five words in the middle: “unless otherwise consistent with this chapter”. “So at the end of the day, this provision, which really held out a lot of promise of being very protective, is actually much ado about nothing.” Kahale says many provisions in the TPP investment chapter are a vast improvement on previous trade deals. But he says all this hard work could be for nothing because of another provision. “Why would you spend so much time and effort doing a great job in negotiating narrow provisions to this treaty, when you have a ‘most favoured nation’ clause?” This is where things get a little technical. Essentially, an MFN clause is tantamount to a classic wipeout move. It would enable foreign corporations from TPP states to make a claim against Australia based on the ISDS provisions in any other trade deal Australia has signed, no matter which country it was signed with. That means it does not matter how carefully the TPP is drafted: foreign investors can cherrypick another treaty Australia has signed, and sue the Australian government based on the provisions included in that treaty. Kahale has described MFN as “a dangerous provision to be avoided by treaty drafters whenever possible” because it can turn one bad treaty into protections “never imagined for virtually an entire world of investors”. Including an MFN clause in the TPP was a “major mistake”, Kahale argues, and another reason Australia is still wide open to being sued for legislating to protect the environment. If you are curious about what this might look like, take Germany, for example. The German government has had two claims brought against it by the same corporation, Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company. First, Vattenfall sued the government for €1.4bn over the Hamburg provincial government’s decision to place extra environmental restrictions on a coal-fired power plant the company was planning to build along the river Elbe. To settle this case, Germany had to remove the restrictions. In 2012, Vattenfall announced it was suing the German government again, this time over its decision to phase out nuclear power after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. This was in breach of its contract to allow the company to build and operate nuclear power plants, claimed Vattenfall, which has lodged another claim against Germany, reported to be worth €4bn. Billion-dollar claims are becoming the norm, says Kahale, citing a recent case in Ecuador, where the government now owes more than $1bn to the multinational oil company Occidental. “That is a huge number for Ecuador! From my reading of the facts, and my reading of the decision, terrible mistakes were made. The decision was 2-1 to begin with, with a very strong dissent. Now you can be sure, if they’d had a different panel of arbitrators, that could just as easily have been 2-1 the other way.” The problem with ISDS is not just that corporations can sue governments, says Kahale, but that its entire legal framework is fundamentally flawed. ISDS claims are not heard in a standing court staffed by independent judges. Instead, claims can proceed in ad hoc courtrooms – a hotel room, for example – by three arbitrators hand-picked by the parties. Unlike a traditional court of law, these arbitrators are not obliged to refer to precedent and, since their decisions are not open to appeal, they are free to rule according to their personal opinion. The arbitrators can also be severely conflicted, says Kahale, because they may act as a judge one day and as a lawyer for a party the next. Kahale’s criticisms have been echoed by Robert French, the chief justice of Australia’s high court. In a speech last July, he said: “Arbitral tribunals set up under ISDS provisions are not courts, nor are they required to act like courts, yet their decisions may include awards which significantly impact on national economies and on regulatory systems within nation states.” Kahale believes the ISDS system is so badly flawed it should be abolished, and started again from scratch. Australia, he warns, should think very carefully before signing up to it in the TPP. “What I would say to Australians is that while the system is in the state it’s in right now, signing any new treaty is a very serious mistake. You have to weigh the benefits against the burdens. Somebody at some point might be able to explain to me where all the benefits are, but I certainly haven’t seen any.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2015/jul/09/levy-on-renewables-a-boost-to-fracking","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T18:33:20Z","webTitle":"Levy on renewables a boost to fracking | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/09/levy-on-renewables-a-boost-to-fracking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2015/jul/09/levy-on-renewables-a-boost-to-fracking","fields":{"headline":"Levy on renewables a boost to fracking","bodyText":"As renewable energy producers have pointed out, the removal of their exemption from the climate change levy in Wednesday’s budget is likely to drive them from profit into loss, and thus put many of them out of business (Cuts for renewable producers, help for polluters, Budget supplement, 9 July).

For most of the last decade she has been beyond question the commanding figure in European politics. But for how long can she go on? In particular, is she the inevitable leader of her party into the next German general election in autumn 2017, when she would be seeking a fourth term as chancellor? These questions have been lurking in the corridors of power in German politics for many months. But after three regional elections at the weekend, they have taken on new immediacy. The CDU lost vote share in all three regions that voted on Sunday, failing to win two regions where the party had hopes of victory and slipping badly in the third, while remaining in first place. Some of those losses contributed to the rise of the anti-refugee AfD party, which has opposed Mrs Merkel’s liberal approach to refugees. It was, as she said on Monday, a difficult day. With autumn 2017 now not far away, CDU nerves are still jangling. Yet it would be a premature mistake to assume that Sunday’s results mark the beginning of the end either for Mrs Merkel or even for her policy. For one thing, contrary to some of the more simplistic early readings, these results gave a mixed message to the ruling party. The CDU’s vote declined by 3% in two of the regions, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt, and by 12% in Baden-Württemberg. These were obviously not good results, but they could surely have been a lot worse, given both the stage in the political cycle and the passions aroused by migration. Since the local CDU in both Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Württemberg had distanced itself from Mrs Merkel’s policy, and since these elections were won by the centre-left SPD and by the Greens respectively (both of which supported a more liberal approach to refugees) it is hard to pin the CDU’s relatively poor showing on the chancellor or her approach to migration. Mrs Merkel therefore lives to fight another day. The CDU also remains the strongest party in German politics. This is partly because, in spite of the truly spectacular showing by the incumbent Greens under Winfried Kretschmann in what was once the CDU stronghold of Baden-Württemberg, none of the established parties seems yet to be a serious rival to the CDU in the general election when it comes. The SPD and the liberal FDP both marked time or declined at the weekend. The rise of the anti-refugee AfD – which sits in the same group as the British Conservatives in the European parliament – was clearly the immediate story of these elections. The party went from nowhere to a double-figure share in all three contests, rising to 24% in Saxony-Anhalt, which is part of the poorer and less liberal former east Germany. It mobilised people who had voted in recent elections and it took votes from all the other parties, not just the CDU (indeed one in six AfD votes in Saxony-Anhalt came from the former communist Left party). It was a spectacular result. But it needs to be interpreted with care and proportion. This is not the rebirth of Nazism. Nor does it mark the end of German openness to migration. The truth is that, with these elections, Germany may now have become a more normal European country than it was before, having resisted that change longer than most of the others. Its big parties are in decline. The old party system is splintering. Germany is now sporting its own anti-immigrant party alongside the others, much as Ukip and the Front National have muscled their way on to the stage in Britain and France. Mrs Merkel and her migration policy have had a rebuff. But the chancellor is an adaptable leader. When her party first lost to the Greens in Baden-Württemberg five years ago, she did an about-turn on nuclear power and was re-elected stronger than before as chancellor in 2012. In the wake of the Cologne attacks, she was already taking a tougher line on refugees than she did in the summer. These results will confirm her in that caution. They will make her more determined than ever to drive through the provisional deal with Turkey at the EU summit later this week. Large uncertainties nevertheless remain. Mrs Merkel is weaker than before. She has problems with her party and with EU partners. She still leads the most important country in the EU, but the other players can sense her weakness. Mrs Merkel has been written off before. But the decision she faces about whether to run again in 2017 just got more difficult, not more straightforward."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2016/oct/11/music-you-missed-from-rebel-yell-to-jordan-irelands-mysterious-solo-album","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-11T07:03:13Z","webTitle":"Music you missed: from Rebel Yell to Jordan Ireland's mysterious solo album","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/11/music-you-missed-from-rebel-yell-to-jordan-irelands-mysterious-solo-album","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2016/oct/11/music-you-missed-from-rebel-yell-to-jordan-irelands-mysterious-solo-album","fields":{"headline":"Music you missed: from Rebel Yell to Jordan Ireland's mysterious solo album","bodyText":"Are Australian solo artists making the best music in 2016? With seven solo musicians and one duo listed here, I could certainly argue the case. That said, solo artists have always dominated my music collection; they are less swayed by prevailing trends and their music ages better. Over the past year it’s become clear that women are making the most interesting and idiosyncratic club music. Holy Balm and Elisabeth Dixon have great new albums, Chiara Kickdrum is featured on the Domestic Documents series of local “electronic abstraction”, and the live sets I’ve seen recently from LA Suffocated, WDK, Lucy Cliché and Workshop have been truly excellent too. Three caveats for the following list: Lawrence Arabia is a New Zealander. I’m not 100% sure when Jordan Ireland’s record came out because he sent me the files but didn’t answer further questions. And while I usually stick to LPs, the triple album from Pale Earth listed here is balanced out by an EP from Rebel Yell. As always, please pay for the albums you enjoy and tell me what I missed in less-visible Australian gems released in July, August and September. Nullarbor 1988-1989 by Friendships Where to begin with young Melbourne duo Misha Grace and Nic Brown? This debut is strange, brave and wildly exciting. Friendships dive deep into jungle, grime and dubstep, yet amid the fury of beats, breaks and fastidious production they find space to inject great helpings of heart, art, beauty and risk. And when the bass hits, it hits hard. The record overflows with ideas. Grace did a series of (very good) paintings to accompany it while Brown delivers a conceptual narrative in gauche spoken-word sequences that seem to be set in a Wake In Fright-style outback dystopia. “Recognise something in me, love, that resonates with you/Light it on fire and piss on it” he croaks on Footscray 1989 to the tinkle of saloon piano. The contrast between Brown’s junkie-ramble poetry and the amphetamine-charged club tracks makes this record too odd-shaped to pigeonhole. I’ve never heard anything like it. I Had Myself A Nuclear Spring by Kate Carr Last year Brisbane expat and field recordist Kate Carr spent a month in Marnay-sur-Seine: a small town in France next to a nuclear power plant which turned into a temporary wetland after the river flooded. She roamed “muddy marshes filled with buzzing electrical towers, corroded machinery, shrieking birds and canals feeding a nuclear complex” using recording gear compromised by the area’s electromagnetism, creating the electrical hum that is this album’s sinister thread. If you’ve ever doubted the capacity of sound art to elucidate chewy ideas, and not merely mood or some boffin’s confusing PhD thesis, Carr’s work will convince you otherwise. These pieces are full of space yet dense with a particularly modern dread. At times, to draw us closer, she plays a few reverberant guitar notes. Otherwise, it’s chirruping wildfowl, water, bass of indeterminate origin and always, the anxiety-inducing purr, buzz and whine of electricity. It is the soundtrack of psychosis for Chuck in Better Call Saul and a metaphor for the low-humming knowing that there’s no escape, not even in nature. Mother Of Millions by Rebel Yell The industrial techno of Brisbane’s Rebel Yell (Grace Stevenson) is anything but bleak. Run through a metal guitar pedal, Stevenson’s vocals are like the commands of a berserk boot camp instructor set in the bloopers reel of Blade Runner. Stevenson says a gig she saw with Australian electronic music-makers Lucy Cliché, Video Ezy and Sarah Spencer (Blank Realm) opened her eyes to industrial music, as well as a burnt CD she got from an op shop called “dark tech”. Mother of Millions is her first EP and already her sound is impressively distinct: noxious, militaristic and properly industrial. Disobey at your peril. One Of Us by Cash Savage and the Last Drinks If alt-country with banjo and fiddle has always seemed a bit fruity for your palate, Cash Savage and the Last Drinks may convert you to its nourishment. Savage sings like salvation depends on it – though not hers. “For you, for us, for everyone,” she belts out on Run With The Dogs, lassoing us all in on the ride. The Melbourne band’s third record is split between rousing, jam-band rock songs and tear-jerking, bushwhacking ballads. The former crest in choruses built for cathartic sing-a-longs with soaring, golden-toned guitar breaks, The War On Drugs’ highway song momentum and Patti Smith’s vocal intensity. Elsewhere, ballads like Song For A Funeral – about swallowing the bitter pill that is a loved one’s suicide – function as forgiveness shared. Country rock can sound flat or twee on record so kudos to producer Nick Finch for making One Of Us so vital. Deliverance by Witch Hats Something’s changed, I thought, on hearing the third record from Melbourne band Witch Hats. Frozen in time since their 2009 debut Cellulite Soul (2011’s Pleasure Syndrome passed me by), their music was still personified as the combative neighbourhood punk with a point to prove. Deliverance, I realised, was Witch Hats gone dad-bod: paunchier but far better at knowing which buttons to push. Still got the swing, still got the swagger. Kris Buscombe’s voice embodies the disconsolate sneer of late-70s UK punk, especially with uppercuts such as “Fuck your mother, fuck your father too/They’ve both got tickets on you” on Weekend Holocauster. The ska influence is stronger now and the spectres of several of post punk bands float by – The Stranglers, Magazine – but Witch Hats’ guitars have more meat on their bones. Ludicrous that the 3:37-minute title track has only been played once on Triple J. Just as one chorus ends, another one hits. Jordan Ireland with Purple Orchestra by Jordan Ireland Jordan Ireland, previously singer and guitarist in Townsville “buzz band” the Middle East, told FasterLouder in May: “All the hype and excitement surrounding our little knot of young and very naive country kids became really daunting, really quickly.” The Middle East broke up at Splendour in the Grass in 2011, the year of their first album. Ireland’s solo album is more akin to dappled shade than sound. Strings, strumming, barely perceptible percussion, piano and flute are muted and textural, with Ireland’s voice murmuring melodies from the deep, languishing in the possibilities of the irresolute. The pastoral psychedelica of early Pink Floyd or the gently soaring vocals of Kishi Bashi are fair comparisons, though Ireland’s songs are hazier and more diaphanous. The record was produced by Greg Walker (Machine Translations), whose intuitive touch explains how closely its sound supports Ireland’s claim that “the birds, the air and the [purple] mood” were all active members of the orchestra. There are no videos, press materials and no Bandcamp site. Journalists will laud it as lush baroque pop – if they ever hear it. Always by Pale Earth When Pale Earth’s Benjamin Thompson came to Room40 with a two-hour triple album of 33 electronic tracks, he thought label head Lawrence English would suggest he trim it to one very good album instead. He didn’t, and Always was released in its entirety. To listeners used to a drip-feed of singles heralding albums that barely clock 30 minutes, the scale of Always was a challenge to rise to. “I’ve been absolutely confused and excited by the people who tell me they’re listening to it all,” Thompson said. The songs chronicle Thompson’s travels through Asia, Japan and (his dreams of) Korea. From shimmering ambience a la Fennesz to wonky beats and experiments in texture, the only thread sewing this collection together is Thompson’s effort to literally create soundscapes. A drone piece evokes a cold mountain morning in Taiwan before an earthquake. There’s a song about how light streams through water. Thompson’s sonic travelogue may not be translatable but his sound parcels are always interesting and often beautiful and we can only hope his travel bug is permanent. TTNIK by Scraps The synthpop of Brisbane’s Scraps (Laura Hill) is described by her US label Not Not Fun as “alienated karaoke”. It’s spot on. She is both solo and solitary sounding, making music to dance to, despondently. No duo or trio could have made a record this entwined in its own logic; reduced to only the rawest sequencer rhythms and most essential melodies, bent to Hill’s will. Notes snake up to coil around her vocals, before sliding away. The backdrop – enmeshed in the songs through samples – is the isolation and communion of the Australian suburbs: girls gossiping on the phone; the tipsy chatter of (what sounds like) mums at a pool party; a guy detailing his hobbies in a creepy pitch-shifting voice. Hill is a master of the waning synth note, wringing out every of drop of melancholy from the fades on Touch Blue. Absolute Truth by Lawrence Arabia The lyrics of New Zealand musician Lawrence Arabia (James Milne) are snort-out-loud funny but in the manner of Oscar Wilde, they ring true too. “I was so fresh and foolish/Bold and bullish, kind of toolish,” he sings on Brain Gym. Milne’s fourth album of wry symphonic pop is out on seminal Dunedin label Flying Nun. On his last (excellent) record, Milne made genres like ragtime seem easy and he’s similarly breezy here. There’s a hint of Lambchop’s mid-afternoon languor on The Old Dancefloor and Yo La Tengo’s poised mid-tempo rock. Elsewhere, Milne tosses yacht rock overboard in favour of shameless cruise-ship schmaltz. On Another Century you imagine him as the performer on a late-70s liner, singing for passengers in puffy bathing suits with bronzed leathery skin. Its syrupy swooping strings, fresh-faced falsetto and “shooby do wop” choruses stroll dangerously close to parody, but like Beck circa Midnight Vultures, if you embrace the role-play it’s fun as hell. Wide Asleep by Sophie Hutchings As a child, pianist and composer Sophie Hutchings would withdraw to practise alone. It explains her deeply contemplative style as well as her discomfort with playing live. “I pretty much have to be kicked onto stage,” she told music journalist Bernard Zuel. Hutchings’ third record is beautifully accented by cellist Peter Hollo and violinist Jay Kong. Unlike many pianists, she doesn’t dazzle you with virtuosity or solicit your sentimentality. They are certainly no showy crescendos. Instead, her piano holds a healing space for you to enter and make your own. The notes swell and retreat; pool, overflow and spill. Hutchings’ compositions are the sound of a state of flux – the principle that change is the only constant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"media/2015/oct/29/freedom-of-information-act-tom-watson-foi","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-29T12:27:52Z","webTitle":"Freedom of Information Act must be strengthened, says Tom Watson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/29/freedom-of-information-act-tom-watson-foi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2015/oct/29/freedom-of-information-act-tom-watson-foi","fields":{"headline":"Freedom of Information Act must be strengthened, says Tom Watson","bodyText":"Labour deputy leader Tom Watson has said his party will push for a stronger Freedom of Information Act and voiced concerns about the government commission reviewing the legislation. Writing to the Society of Editors, which is running a campaign against what it says is an attempt to water down the public’s access to information, Watson said the party is setting up a group to make recommendations about how the act could be improved to lead to greater transparency. Watson said: “The Labour party shares some of your concerns about what the consultation could mean for the act ... We want to see the act extended and strengthened in the interests of open, transparent and accountable government.” The government commission examining FoI is looking at the balance between transparency and the government’s desire to keep information private. Its official remit says it will consider the act’s impact on the government’s ability to provide “robust protection” to documents and create “safe spaces” for decision making. Proposed changes include new charges for requests, changes to make it easier to refuse requests on cost grounds and plans to strengthen ministers’ powers to veto disclosures. However, Watson said the commission’s remit should be expanded to investigate the act’s successes and said it should be extended to increase scrutiny of public money spent on contracts with the private sector. The makeup of the six-person commission has also caused concern among freedom of information campaigners and the press. It includes former home secretaries Jack Straw and Michael Howard, who have both criticised the act, as well as QC Lord Carlisle who said the Guardian’s decision to publish Edward Snowden’s revelations about mass surveillance was a “criminal” act. Watson also criticised the lack of transparency around the commission, which is not subject to FoI requests and recently held a briefing at which journalists were forbidden from saying who attended or what was said. He added: “The Labour party believes the act has given the public, campaigners and the media a powerful tool with which to hold the government to account. “Without the act, the death rates of individual cardiac surgeons would not have been published by the NHS, we would not have learned that the police use Tasers on children and the existence of cracks in the nuclear power station at Hinckley would have stayed hidden.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/apr/16/japan-hit-by-second-powerful-earthquake-with-fears-of-more-to-come","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-16T08:15:47Z","webTitle":"Japan hit by second powerful earthquake","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/16/japan-hit-by-second-powerful-earthquake-with-fears-of-more-to-come","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/apr/16/japan-hit-by-second-powerful-earthquake-with-fears-of-more-to-come","fields":{"headline":"Japan hit by second powerful earthquake","bodyText":"A second major earthquake in less than two days has shaken Japan’s southern island of Kyushu, with at least 34 people thought to have been killed, about 1,500 injured and more feared buried after building collapses and landslides. The 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck at about 1.30am on Saturday, waking people across the island – including the thousands already in crisis centres. It caused widespread damage, with several landslides and a village evacuated over fears a dam might burst. On Thursday a magnitude 6.5 earthquake in the same region of Kumamoto brought down buildings, killed nine people and injured about 800. More than 100 aftershocks followed until the bigger quake on Saturday morning, which led to the earlier, smaller event being reclassified as a foreshock. Japan’s prime minister, Shinzō Abe, expressed concern about secondary disasters from mudslides as the weather forecast for the area predicted wet weather and strong winds. Rain began falling at about 3pm local time, with torrential downpours anticipated through the night. The Fukuoka Meteorological Agency estimated that between 100mm and 150mm of rain would fall on Kumamoto over the next 24 hours, increasing the risk of landslides. “Daytime today is the big test” for rescue efforts, Abe said. He called off a visit to Kumamoto on Saturday after the new earthquakes struck. “He was scheduled to visit Mashiki but now he does not think that would be the best use of his time,” his office said. Before the rain began, 4,200 households in the mountain town of Misato were told to evacuate, along with 40 in the village of Nishihara and 5,200 in Oita prefecture’s city of Yufu, which also suffered damage in the earthquake. More than 15,000 people have been affected by the orders. The Japanese government’s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said on Saturday that 1,500 people had been injured, 80 of them seriously, and that casualty figures were likely to increase. Nearly 70,000 people had left their homes, he said. He said the military presence would be boosted to 20,000 for rescue efforts. Police and firefighters are also being ordered to the region. In a nationally televised news conference, Suga asked people not to panic. “Please let’s help each other and stay calm,” he said.Saturday’s quake triggered tsunami warnings, though none took place, and there was confusion and anxiety for the thousands of evacuees whose homes had already been destroyed or damaged. One major landslide tore open a mountainside in Minamiaso village in Kumamoto prefecture, destroying a key bridge that could cut off food and other relief transport to the worst-hit area. Another landslide hit a road, collapsing a house that fell down a ravine. In another part of the village, houses were left hanging precariously at the edge of a huge hole. The earthquakes’ epicentres were relatively close to the surface, at a depth of about six miles, resulting in more severe shaking and damage. The public broadcaster NHK TV said as many as eight tremors an hour were being felt in the area. At a news conference on Saturday, Abe told reporters he wanted the government at all levels to share information in a timely manner. The government planned to send 5,500 police officers, and members of the fire service would be sent to the prefecture. “Securing the safety of citizens is our top priority,” the prime minister told media. On Saturday the latest destruction and aftershocks left Kyushu on tenterhooks. NHK TV showed people in evacuation centres in shock and unable to sleep. “The earthquake last night was much worse than the one on Thursday,” said Yumiko Ogata at the Mashiki gymnastics centre, one of the evacuation stations. “People are holding up psychologically, but nobody slept last night. “We need food and we need water. We may just about get through, lunch but we do not have anything for this evening.” The situation worsened at the centre as the day went on. Food did not arrive and supplies were short. “We have no idea whether or not supplies are on the way. As well as food and water, the rain is coming in and the temperature is going to drop. We need blankets now too,” Ogata said. In the Kumamoto village of Aso a highway bridge was swept away by a landslide and about 200 people were evacuated from the village of Nishimura after reports that the Okirihata dam was under structural strain. The Uto city hall also partially collapsed and about 150 patients had to be transferred from Kumamoto city hospital after the building’s ceiling came down. “We can no longer care for people here,” a hospital official told the Sankei newspaper. NHK TV showed stones that had tumbled from the walls of the historic Kumamoto Castle and a smashed wooden structures in the complex. At the Ark hotel, east of the castle, hotel guests woke up to strong shaking and a warning siren. Hotel staff told guests, including tourists and journalists covering the quake, to evacuate their rooms and gather in the lobby for safety. A bright spot, broadcast repeatedly on television on Friday, was the rescue of an apparently uninjured baby, wrapped in a blanket and carried out of the rubble of a home. Kyushu Electric Power Co, the utility operating the island’s Sendai and Genkai nuclear power plants, said its reactors were unaffected. In Kumamoto, however, 100,000 homes were without power. Yukinori Hori, an official at the Sanrigi residents centre, said the more than 300 local people taking shelter there had enough to eat and drink and were stoic in the face of the disaster. “We have a lot of problems that we are not thinking about, because they are small and at least we have supplies and our lives.” Associated Press contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/may/21/garden-bridge-chummocracy-sadiq-khan","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-21T07:00:07Z","webTitle":"This garden bridge is an oddity born of the chumocracy | Ian Jack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/21/garden-bridge-chummocracy-sadiq-khan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/may/21/garden-bridge-chummocracy-sadiq-khan","fields":{"headline":"This garden bridge is an oddity born of the chumocracy","bodyText":"Of all the planned developments to the British landscape – high-speed rail links, nuclear power stations, the steady urbanisation of the countryside – the proposed garden bridge across the Thames sits low on the scale of national concern. At £175m, its estimated cost amounts to no more than 350 averagely priced London homes (or a 90-house street, say, of the less averagely priced ones, where the old middle class used to live). The popular actor Joanna Lumley was its inspiration. It has a fashionable designer, Thomas Heatherwick, and the famous firm of Arup as its engineers. It is ostensibly “green” – a bridge built entirely for pedestrians, with nearly half of its decking area devoted to wildlife-friendly trees and plants. The publicity shots show a line of foliage floating above the river as ethereal as a Chinese print: lovely! And something about it stinks. The history is now well known, at least among Londoners. Lumley originally conceived the bridge as a memorial to Princess Diana; eventually found a likely site for it just to the east of the Southbank arts complex, in the gap (all half a mile of it) between the crossings at Waterloo and Blackfriars; and got Heatherwick excited by the idea. The two were friends. In fact, Heatherwick’s company listed Lumley as an associate. A third friend – Lumley had known him since his childhood – was Boris Johnson, who as London mayor held the power to take the scheme forward. Chummery is an interesting word; it originally described the bachelor quarters shared by officers in the Indian army and other imperial enterprises. Here, a different kind of chummery got to work. The mayor had to persuade officials at Transport for London that a new bridge was necessary in the city centre rather than across the long unbridged, unglamorous stretches downstream; the department then invited tenders for the work, specifying a pedestrian rather than a garden bridge but nevertheless selecting the Lumley/Heatherwick proposal above bids from two other firms with far greater experience of bridge-building. Later investigations by the Architects’ Journal discovered that TfL officials – sometimes with Johnson in attendance – had met Heatherwick four times before the tendering process began in February 2013; and that, shortly before tendering opened, Johnson and Heatherwick had travelled to San Francisco to solicit corporate sponsorship for the bridge from Apple. In the well-chosen words of Christopher Bovis, an internationally respected expert on public procurement standards, the story of the garden bridge’s tendering was “littered with procedural irregularities”. City Hall said in a statement at the time that the meetings had “no bearing” on a “fair and transparent procurement process”. In any case, Apple, in fact, didn’t bite; too few businesses did. An ornamental project meant to be funded by private money has in the end been bailed out by the Treasury and TfL, which each invested £30m to add to the £83m donated, often anonymously, by private companies, foundations and individuals – leaving a gap in capital funding of roughly £33m and a question mark over how the £3.1m a year in operating and maintenance costs will be met by the charity charged with its management, the Garden Bridge Trust. How many people want this bridge is hard to know. The London Evening Standard likes and promotes the idea, but evidence of popular support is mixed. Two opinion polls last year found 78% and 42% of Londoners in favour, a difference almost certainly achieved by how the question was asked. Many people knew nothing about the bridge, and only one in 10 claimed to know much; the more information the question contained, the more likely it was to prompt a negative response. This year a third poll found 60% against. Locally, and among all kinds of environmental and community-minded activists, opposition is fierce. On Monday evening about 400 critics of the plan crowded out the spacious church of St John’s, Waterloo, to hear the scheme denounced by the local MP, Kate Hoey, and a succession of hostile architects, planners and local politicians. They wanted the new mayor, Sadiq Khan, to initiate an inquiry into the procurement process and to promise that no more public money would be spent. But this was just the means; the end was to stop the bridge. That seemed more than a possibility on Monday evening. Khan had previously expressed what he called “real concerns about the procurement process at City Hall”, which needed to be “fully investigated by the next mayor”. But on Tuesday morning, when the next mayor did his first Speak to Sadiq phone-in on LBC, his position had softened. What mattered now was that the Garden Bridge Trust made the bridge “a genuinely public and open space” by reducing the number of days – 12 have been scheduled – that the trust plans to close it for private fundraising events; by reducing the hours of those events; and by guaranteeing that children at local schools will be involved in planting and watering the gardens. Only the first of these demands causes much difficulty. According to the trust’s business plan, the trust will raise its yearly £3.1m budget from a mixture of merchandising, visitors’ donations from contactless-card payment points (the trust expects 5% of visitors will touch in, at £2 a time), but most of all from the summer days and nights when the gates will be shut to the hoi polloi, and black-clad waiters will move through the pontine shrubbery to serve wine and miniature crab cakes to the staff and friends of the PR company, bank or law firm that has hired the space for £60,000 a time. To reduce that revenue would be awkward; but some compromise, surely, will be found. Like his objections, Khan’s endorsement of the bridge looks rather half-hearted: the standard word, iconic, the standard comparison with New York’s High Line as a city lung and tourist attraction. Michael Ball of the campaign group Thames Central Open Space, thinks that Khan is simply “trying not to lose lots of friends”. Compared with building good houses that averagely waged Londoners can afford, the garden bridge amounts to very small beer. But treating it so cautiously is not a good portent. How thrilling it would have been – how refreshing to his supporters and the political system – if Khan had denounced the bridge in every way: not only as an unnecessary claim on public funds, a folly that won’t allow cycling, a thoroughfare that will shut its gates every midnight, an out-of-this-world oddity that will clutter a historic riverscape; not only as all those things, but also as a symbol of the chummery – the chumocracy, even – that so offends the democratic and egalitarian traditions he is proud to represent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2015/nov/02/germanys-planned-nuclear-switch-off-drives-energy-innovation","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-02T14:35:54Z","webTitle":"Germany's planned nuclear switch-off drives energy innovation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/02/germanys-planned-nuclear-switch-off-drives-energy-innovation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/02/germanys-planned-nuclear-switch-off-drives-energy-innovation","fields":{"headline":"Germany's planned nuclear switch-off drives energy innovation","bodyText":"Hinkley Point will be the first nuclear power plant to be built in Europe since the meltdown of Japan’s Fukushima reactor in 2011. But while the British government sees nuclear energy as a safe and reliable source of power, Germany is going in a different direction. As a result of the Fukushima, Chancellor Angela Merkel pledged to switch off all nuclear power by 2022 and fill the gap with renewables – a process known as the energiewende (energy transition). Germany’s push for renewables grew out of the anti-nuclear protests of the 1980s and currently more than a quarter (26%) of its electricity comes from wind, solar and other renewable sources, such as biomass, although 44% is from coal. The country’s government wants to increase the share of renewables in electricity to 40% to 45% by 2025. No other country of Germany’s size has attempted such a radical shift in its power supply in such a short space of time. Described by Merkel as a herculean task, the transition is Germany’s most ambitious economic project since die Wende – the phrase used to describe the fall of the Berlin wall and subsequent reunification of east and west – with an estimated cost of €1tn (£742bn) over the next two decades. However, Reinhard Bütikofer, the Green party’s spokesman for industry in the European parliament, said the really “mind-blowing” energy transition is happening in the UK, where the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset will cost electricity customers at least £4.4bn in subsidies. “They are cutting down on solar, PV [photovoltaics], purportedly for cost reasons, while on the other hand they pledge to guarantee the nuclear industry and energy price twice the market price for the next 30 years. That’s crazy.” The energiewende is not uncontroversial, not least due to the rising cost of subsidies paid by ordinary bill payers, which has triggered complaints that poor households are subsidising affluent dentists to put solar panels on their roofs. But the transition is not opposed by Germany’s main business lobby, the BDI, despite lingering concerns about what the transition means for the country’s manufacturing base at a time when confidence in the Made in Germany brand has been knocked by the Volkswagen scandal. “There is broad consensus in society on the political targets – to reduce CO2 and increase energy efficiency and the share of renewables,” said Carsten Rolle, the BDI’s head of energy and climate policy. “We see the main question in managing the energiewende.” One company caught in the transition is Trimet Aluminium, a family-owned business that is one of the largest users of power, consuming the equivalent of 1% of Germany’s electricity each year. At Trimet’s smelter near Hamburg in the north, 270 furnaces run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Inside each furnace, sparks like strobe lights dance on molten metal as temperatures peak at 960C (1,760F) The annual electricity bill for this plant runs to €120m. Along with 2,000 energy-intensive companies in Germany, Trimet is spared the renewable energy levy, a contentious exemption that limits its energy costs at a time when ordinary consumers face rising bills. However, the company is not immune from the energiewende. In 2014, production was stopped more than 70 times to maintain electricity supplies to domestic consumers. Although renewable energy is cheap when the sun shines and the wind blows, it cannot be stored for calm, cloudy days. To keep the power lines humming for ordinary households, large industrial users can be disconnected from the grid for up to one hour at a time. “We see the energiewende as an opportunity, but we basically have to reinvent our processes,” said Trimet’s head of operations, Andreas Lützerath. The company is looking at how it can adapt to a world of fluctuating power. At its plant in Essen, north-west Germany, Trimet is experimenting with using its molten metal furnaces as a virtual battery. If the project is successful, the factory could store 3,360 megawatt hours of energy over two days – enough to power 300,000 homes for one day. Germany’s dash for renewables has helped to create new industries. About 370,000 Germans work in the renewable energy industry, twice the number who work in fossil fuels, according to the Heinrich Böll Foundation, a green political thinktank. The north German port city of Bremerhaven has staged a partial revival, after decades of decline following the collapse of the shipbuilding and fishing industries in the 1970s and 1980s. Just 10 years ago, unemployment peaked at 26%. The tide has begun to turn, as a result of new jobs in the wind energy industry, although unemployment remains stuck at 15%, well above the German average. “It was really a poor town,” recalls Norbert Giese, vice-president of government relations at Senvion, a wind turbine maker employing 350 people in Bremerhaven, almost 10% of its global workforce. Senvion makes some of the most powerful wind turbines in the world. In November the company starts work on two orders: 72 turbines destined for offshore wind parks in the North Sea. But the BDI fears some companies in the energy-intensive sectors of steel and chemicals are reducing their investment in new plants and machinery, Rolle said. “It is a silent shift to other regions in the world.” To counter this perceived loss of competitiveness, the IHS research group has argued that Germany should slow the uptake of renewables and lean more heavily on natural gas to cut the costs of its energy transition. The researchers argue that small and medium-sized companies – the Mittelstand enterprises that make up the core of the German economy – are seeing their competitiveness blunted by high electricity costs. Unlike large producers, these firms have to pay the renewable levy on their energy bills. According to IHS calculations, small and medium-sized companies lost out on €15bn (£10.7bn) worth of exports in 2013 due to high electricity costs. However, Bütikofer said it was a myth that the push to renewables was putting German companies out of business. “The industrial Mittelstand has always persevered, moved ahead of the curve by being more effective than others,” he said. He believed that from damaging firms, the energy law can stimulate energy efficiency. “[The energiewende] is nudging sectors of German industry towards more ambitious innovation and I think that is the name of the game for future competitiveness.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/oct/01/hinkley-nuclear-project-edf","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-01T16:19:45Z","webTitle":"Conflict of interest concerns over EDF’s Hinkley nuclear project approval","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/01/hinkley-nuclear-project-edf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/oct/01/hinkley-nuclear-project-edf","fields":{"headline":"Conflict of interest concerns over EDF’s Hinkley nuclear project approval","bodyText":"Nuclear experts receiving EDF pensions were involved in the official safety review of the company’s planned Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset, sparking concerns about a conflict of interest over the approval of the project. The involvement senior executive grade officers at the Office of Nuclear Regulation (ONR) made it “very difficult” for the regulator to take a critical eye, warned another independent industry consultant. The revelations, obtained via a series of freedom of information (FoI) requests, raise wider concerns about the use of consultants due to a lack of experienced staff inside the ONR and come a week after the Hinkley project got a go-ahead from the European competition directorate for a proposed UK subsidy scheme. Building new reactors is a key part of the coalition’s plan to keep the lights on in the medium term when old coal and atomic power plants are coming to the end of their lives. EDF, the French state energy group, plans to use a new European pressurised reactor (EPR) design for the Somerset plant that was successfully submitted for approval to the ONR, a statutory body which boasts of holding the nuclear industry to account on behalf of the public. But the standards of the safety and regulatory sign-off of the new Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant has been called into question by experts, who believe the construction will run over budget or fail. Critics argue that vital safety issues highlighted in the regulatory process were ignored, which may have happened to ensure the project’s approval met the deadline set out by the UK government. “The ONR bypassed a number of safety issues with the rationale of ‘although it is not solved we think it will be solved by the time we need’,” said nuclear industry consultant John Large. “I suspect the political pressure was on them. The government was putting the pieces in place to give an announcement [that Hinkley Point C had been approved] in January 2013.” The safety regulator said two of its staff had EDF pensions but refused to disclose if other employees and contractors, who were not receiving pensions, had worked at EDF or the other firms involved in the project such as Areva, China General Nuclear Power Group and China National Nuclear Corp. The ONR stated it could not release this information because the files holding these details are “in deep storage and away from the ONR’s main office location” but it said that all its staff were obliged to comply with the civil service code of conduct. It insisted there was no question of a conflict of interest: “Neither of the individuals concerned were employed by other companies whilst working for ONR. Any individuals who received a payment from companies or organisations involved in the GDA (generic design assessment), in addition to ONR, would be expected to declare this interest, which is recorded in the register of business interests.” But the regulator said it had struggled to recruit as quickly as it might have wanted to do and relied on a pool of experts who could also be employed by the wider industry. “ONR would not tolerate a situation in which a person carrying out assessment for ONR is also working on a related matter for a current or prospective licensee. Should a potential conflict of interest emerge, we have a clear protocol that provides a robust process and defines clear criteria against which the emerging conflict can be judged.” The Department of Energy and Climate Change declined to comment on the issue saying it was a matter for the ONR which operated independently from government. Large is not the only one concerned with the speed at which the ONR’s safety assessment was carried out. “I don’t know how it is feasible,” said Mika Johansson, a senior inspector at STUK, the Finnish nuclear regulator which is overseeing the construction of another EPR reactor in its own country. “I don’t know how they [the ONR] did it so fast.” The ONR did indeed flag up problems with the instrumentation and control system during its design assessment process. In its quarterly updates on progress, each aspect of the plan was graded by a traffic light-style alert system that represented the difficulty of solving the issues raised. In August 2012, six issues related to the instrumentation and control system were highlighted. Four of these were given a red alert, which, according to the report means the resolving of these issues are “in serious doubt with serious risks apparent”. By December the nuclear regulators approved the EPR design, signing off all of these alerts without much explanation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/mar/03/dobsons-switch-at-schroders-corporate-governance-anyone","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-03T19:30:21Z","webTitle":"Dobson's switch at Schroders: corporate governance, anyone?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/mar/03/dobsons-switch-at-schroders-corporate-governance-anyone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/mar/03/dobsons-switch-at-schroders-corporate-governance-anyone","fields":{"headline":"Dobson's switch at Schroders: corporate governance, anyone?","bodyText":"Well played, Michael Dobson, that was a terrific 14-year innings as chief executive of fund manager Schroders, one of the few grand old City names to flourish in the modern world. A loss-making company in 2001 now makes profits of £600m. Take a bow, throw a party and enjoy your retirement. Hold on, Dobson isn’t retiring at all. He is merely moving into the chairman’s office, a switch that – as usual on these occasions – looks like a triumph of chumminess over common sense. There are good reasons why the UK code on corporate governance – born as a reaction to ancient boardroom scandals like Polly Peck and Maxwell – states baldly that “a chief executive should not go on to be chairman of the same company”. One individual can end up with too much power and resist new thinking. Boardroom virtues of independence and openness can be lost. The new chief executive operates under a shadow. Schroders says it seeks “stability and continuity”. Almost any company, after a good run, could make the same plea. They all think their boardrooms contain only strong personalities. It is rarely a persuasive argument. The code, it should be noted, is not an absolute prohibition. Non-compliers are told to consult their major shareholders. But, in Schroders’ case, this is hardly onerous. The family controls 44% of the stock and Bruno Schroder, a board member since 1963, has given a thumbs-up, which will tend to dampen outside dissent. If they really don’t like it, non-family shareholders can sell their shares. But there is wider principle here. Schroders, managing £313bn of other people’s money, is a firm we expect to read the riot act on governance to quoted companies. That job has just become harder. Schroders says there are cases where, having assessed the merits, it has approved of a chief executive becoming chairman – for example at Wood Group in 2013. But it was in the oppose camp in 2014 at Experian, the last time this issue blew up at a FTSE 100 company. The point remains. Dobson’s experience may be hard to replicate, but a firm of Schroders’ standing should be able to attract a top-notch chairman who is properly independent – and see the sense of doing so. Has Costa run out of steam? Little can be read into a single month’s sales figures, said Alison Brittain, chief executive of Whitbread, at the end of last year. Fair enough, a warm November seemed a reasonable explanation for why Costa Coffee’s like-for-like sales growth had slipped to 2.5%, the slowest quarterly increase for five years. But here comes Costa’s latest reading, covering the next 11 weeks to mid-February – it’s even slower at 0.5%. Brittain is sticking to her line about “lower footfall on the high street and an unusually warm winter” but this is starting to look like more like a trend rather than a blip. Maybe the UK is simply saturated with coffee shops. This would not be surprising if the entrepreneurial classes have been reading Whitbread’s accounts. The last set showed a return on capital for Costa of 46.3%, a ratio so fat it invites independent operators to try their luck. The average hipster lacks Costa’s buying clout but the chance of a 20% return on capital, or even 10%, is worth a shot. From Whitbread’s point of view, there is a fair argument that actual growth at Costa – as opposed to same-store increases – is more important. On that score, the rate is still 10.5%, so this is a long way from being a crisis. And, anyway, Premier Inn is far more important to Whitbread in profit terms. But you can also understand why Whitbread’s share price has fallen from £54 a year ago to £38, down 6% on Thursday. Costa, having outrun all competitors with ease over the past decade, is suddenly looking tired. Definitely maybe at Hinkley Point Is Hinkley Point, the planned £18bn nuclear power station in Somerset to be built by French firm EDF, a runner or not? Here’s the latest dispatch from the Anglo-French summit: “EDF is currently devoted to prepare [sic] all necessary elements for the announcement of a FID [final investment decision] for Hinkley Point C in the near future, with the full support of the French government.” Top marks for ambiguity and obfuscation. In the mouth of EDF, “in the near future” could mean next year, which is what the latest stories of delays have suggested. Last October, remember, the company said the contract was ready to sign within weeks. As to the actual decision, “France and the United Kingdom welcome the major progress made in recent months with a view to confirming the project.” A view to confirming? Call that a definite maybe. It would be funny if our government hadn’t based its entire energy policy for the 2020s on Hinkley and neglected to draw up a back-up plan. The sooner the Hinkley farce is called off, the better."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/mar/01/uk-energy-policy-is-in-disarray-but-blackouts-are-unlikely","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-01T16:26:33Z","webTitle":"Analysis: UK energy policy is in disarray - but blackouts are unlikely","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/01/uk-energy-policy-is-in-disarray-but-blackouts-are-unlikely","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/mar/01/uk-energy-policy-is-in-disarray-but-blackouts-are-unlikely","fields":{"headline":"UK energy policy is in disarray - but blackouts are unlikely","bodyText":"“Keeping the lights on” is supposed to be the primary duty of energy policy: for good reason. Blackouts are not just difficult for consumers, but dangerous. Our basic infrastructure, from streetlighting to communications and home appliances, is entirely reliant on a dependable electricity supply, and businesses from retailers and offices to steelworks and food processors would be useless without it. That is why the idea of blackouts is so incendiary, and why the government chose to make its “non-negotiable” commitment to keeping the lights on today. It was reacting to the closure of two power stations and the fears raised in some sections of the media that this could result in blackouts. “The [regulated] capacity market [for electricity] has driven down costs and secured energy at the lowest possible price for billpayers, but I’m taking further action to tackle the legacy of under-investment and ensure our country’s long-term energy security,” said Amber Rudd, energy and climate change secretary. “By buying more capacity earlier we will protect consumers and businesses from avoidable spikes in energy costs.” But a Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) spokeswoman confirmed to the Guardian that the department had no firm assessment of whether power cuts were likely in the next five years. In reality, the danger of widespread or prolonged blackouts is remote. Some small blackouts happen every year for local reasons, such as roadworks, a temporary failure, or flooding. These are easily manageable, and have little impact. The systems in place to avoid bigger blackouts include ramping up older and seldom-used generation capacity, called “supplemental balancing reserve”, managing power dynamically across the grid so that areas of generation are joined up with consumption, and - most of all - taking power away from big energy users. Called “demand-side response”, this means energy-intensive companies, such as steelworks and factories, signing contracts with the National Grid that they will use less power at times of national need. It means that the lights are very unlikely to go out. National Grid said: “For next winter, we’ll continue to work closely with industry, Decc and Ofgem and have already concluded successful tenders for an extra 3.6GW of supplemental balancing reserve [from seldom-used power plants] for the winter of 2016-17, as well as continuing to focus on growing demand-side response activities.” For the businesses in question, however, this is another costly management headache. Claire Jakobsson, head of energy and environment policy at the EEF organisation of manufacturers, told the Guardian: “Demand-side response can play its part in managing the grid, but it is imperative that any agreements made with industry are on a voluntary basis. Furthermore, it must not be in place of a credible strategy for delivering new [power] plants and security of supply should be a top priority.” Keeping otherwise redundant power stations at the ready and compensating big energy users for the costs of being flexible is also an expensive way of managing energy. Those costs raise consumer energy bills, and are likely to continue to do so. About £1.50 will be added to each consumer bill this year solely to maintain “last resort” power from plants that have been mothballed, National Grid said. Demand-side response adds several pounds more. Even if blackouts are unlikely, the UK’s energy sector is in disarray. There’s the closure of power stations with contracts to generate energy. The failure to build new gas-fired plants. The extension of the life of existing nuclear power plants, and doubts over plans for two new reactors. The tumbling oil price which has triggered thousands of job losses. The damages inflicted on the renewable energy sector by abrupt policy reversals. Some of these problems are economic in origin, such as shutting old coal-fired power stations which no longer make a profit, and the failure to build gas-fired power stations when the use of gas as stand-by generation makes its economics tricky. They are also in part created by government policy, however. No part of the energy system is unscathed. And these ructions follow on years of mis-selling scandals and alarm at profit-taking by the “ big six”, which have shaken consumer confidence. The latest announcement of changes to the government’s flagship energy market reforms, which only became fully operational last year, illustrate how desperate matters have become, forcing ministerial reassurances to consumers and business. Rudd insisted: “Ensuring that our families and businesses have secure energy supplies they can rely on now and in the future is not negotiable and I’ll take no risks with this.” Ofgem also moved to reassure consumers, but with a veiled warning to the industry. A spokesman told the Guardian: “National Grid has already procured 3.6GW of reserve for 2016-17, and the additional capacity market auction will provide further incentives for generators to be available to help secure supplies. However there is no room for complacency. Energy companies must be vigilant this winter.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2016/apr/26/abandon-hype-in-climate-models","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-26T09:14:38Z","webTitle":"Abandon hype in climate models","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2016/apr/26/abandon-hype-in-climate-models","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2016/apr/26/abandon-hype-in-climate-models","fields":{"headline":"Abandon hype in climate models","bodyText":"The scenarios modelled for the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report assume the large-scale deployment of technologies that achieve negative emissions that draw down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and permanently store it. But whether such proposed methods could be deployed at a material scale is unproven. It would be more prudent to exclude these techniques from mitigation scenarios used by the IPCC, unless and until we have sufficient evidence of their availability and viability to support their inclusion. Most of the modelled emissions pathways limiting warming to 2 °C (and all the ones that restrict the rise to 1.5 °C) require massive deployment of Biomass Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). This involves growing biomass which is used to generate power and geologically sequestering the carbon dioxide produced. While the constituent steps of this process have been demonstrated, there are but a few, small, examples of the combined process. To rely on this technique to deliver us from climate change is to demonstrate a degree of faith that is out of keeping with scientific rigour. There is a distinct lack of evidence to determine whether BECCS is technically feasible, economically affordable, environmentally benign, socially acceptable and politically viable at a material scale. Technically, there are serious doubts about the ability to sequester the vast quantities of carbon dioxide that are implied in the models. Economically, without a substantial carbon price, the costs would be much higher than competing power-generation technologies. Environmentally, growing such volumes of biomass would have profound effects on biodiversity. Socially, the use of land for BECCS would restrict agriculture – contributing to substantial increases in food prices; while politically, the issue seems so toxic that the Paris Agreement carefully avoided mentioning negative emissions at all. Such impacts would not be material were BECCS to be deployed at a small scale, but the economic scenarios consistent with 1.5 °C (or even 2°C) assume that BECCS is deployed at a truly gargantuan scale, at which these adverse impacts would indeed be material. For a technology to be deployable it needs not only to work, but also to possess a social licence to operate. For example, that Germany possesses the technical ability and financial means to build new nuclear power plants is not in question, but lacking the social and political will to do so makes the point moot. The IPCC’s own scenario database suggests that the ambition of the Paris Agreement cannot be achieved without negative emissions technologies. Even with rapid decarbonisation, there will be a need to achieve net negative emissions during the second half of this century. That objective cannot be achieved from a standing start. Well-functioning methods would need to be developed and rolled out at a rate unprecedented in human history. Yet to model what you want to happen, rather than what there is evidence could happen, is to lose the thread of reality. It is redolent of a defeated leader issuing orders to armies that have long since ceased to exist – not so much vision, as delusion. Should modellers be able to model what they like? Of course. Scenarios allow us to undertake useful thought experiments that provide us with the means to assess potentially novel approaches. But it is hazardous to rely on science fiction in the development of the scenarios that are used to inform policymakers. To include scenarios for avoiding dangerous climate change that employ entirely speculative approaches seems reckless in the extreme. Some will defend the use of these technological imaginaries in IPCC scenarios by arguing that without them hopes of avoiding dangerous climate change are forlorn and that this would generate a degree of despair that would undermine the will to act. But that is not the role of models. “Fake it ‘til you make it” may work as a tactic, but it is a lousy strategy. As the dust settles on the Paris Agreement and policymakers face up to the challenge of achieving the ambition set out by their leaders, we need to reflect on what actually needs to happen. Policymakers can only hope to develop realistic plans, if the basis on which they are making those plans is itself realistic. While the boundary between ambition and delusion may be not be entirely sharp, the inclusion of negative emissions amounting to 600-800 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (equivalent to 15-20 years of current annual emissions) is clearly more than a stretch goal. For this reason, negative emission techniques should be excluded from the mitigation scenarios used by the IPCC unless and until there is sufficient evidence to warrant their inclusion and then only on a scale that is demonstrably realistic. The IPCC recently announced a Special Report on the 1.5 °C target. To be credible, this must include detailed assessment of proposed negative emission techniques, drawing on a wide range of expertise from natural sciences, engineering, social sciences and the humanities to assess to what extent, if any, such approaches could be deployed without creating countervailing side-effects. On the basis of such a comprehensive assessment, policy makers will then have to make an explicit decision either to invest in the necessary research, development and demonstration of the technologies or to explain how they propose to meet their ambitious targets without such interventions. Policymakers cannot be allowed to hide behind the vague language of the Paris Agreement (“achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases”). In the absence of comprehensive research and indications of political feasibility, it seems prudent to exclude from the models what is currently magical thinking. Only by undertaking research will it be possible to determine whether today’s science fiction could be transformed into tomorrow’s science reality.

They then briefed what they had done to the waiting media, who found it all terribly amusing. Is this how grownups go about politics? In what other line of work is it acceptable to shout down a colleague because you don’t like their presentation? Here’s the sort of macho, yah-boo circus that deters anyone vaguely normal from wanting to have anything to do with anything political. These same MPs will, undoubtedly, be the first to complain about the Labour leadership briefing against their colleagues. If at a local Labour party meeting – never mind the PLP – a bunch of activists linked to Momentum started trying to shout down their local MP, we might expect it to make national headlines: the thuggish hard-left trying to drown out anyone who disagrees with them. I don’t want to write about this. I want to write about the consequences of Tory cuts to services, tax credits or universal credit, about the Tory split on the European Union, about the privatisation of the NHS. But unless this approach to politics is checked, it will continue to proliferate. It seems there was only a handful of hecklers, and they are alienating even those MPs with a principled stand in favour of Trident renewal. But the damage is being done, allowing the Conservatives to tear strips off one another over the European Union – if they choose to do so – with little political cost. I happen to be among those who believe Labour should be focusing on domestic issues, rather than Trident, though an impending parliamentary vote on funding rearmament makes that difficult. But we are, supposedly, a mature democracy. What does it say about us if we unable to debate whether to spend tens of billions of pounds of public money on nuclear weapons, which some former senior military officials believe is a waste of money, 25 years after the Soviet Union collapsed? Ex-armed forces head Field Marshal Lord Bramall and two senior generals could hardly be dismissed as proto-Corbynites when, seven years ago, they declared that: “Nuclear weapons have shown themselves to be completely useless as a deterrent to the threats and scale of violence we currently face or are likely to face, particularly international terrorism,” adding that: “Our independent deterrent has become virtually irrelevant, except in the context of domestic politics.” Major General Patrick Cordingley – who led Britain’s forces in the Gulf War – has said: “Strategic nuclear weapons have no military use. It would seem the government wishes to replace Trident simply to remain a nuclear power.” David Owen was among those who abandoned the Labour party in the early 1980s, partly in protest at its nuclear unilateralist stance; but back in 2009 he stated that the cost of replacing Trident was “no longer credible”. Then there’s the Tory ex-defence secretary, Michael Portillo, who says: “Our independent nuclear deterrent is not independent and doesn’t constitute a deterrent against anybody that we regard as an enemy. It is a waste of money and it is a diversion of funds that might otherwise be spent on perfectly useful and usable weapons and troops.” Even Tony Blair confessed in his memoirs that he hesitated over renewal, that he could “see clearly the force of the common sense and practical argument against Trident”, though concluded that abandoning Trident would be “too big a risk”. Bear in mind that, when Parliament voted on Trident renewal in 2007, 95 Labour MPs voted against, leaving Blair dependent on Tory support. And here’s the point. Some may support Trident. Some may support nuclear weapons, but only a smaller, less expensive option. Some may oppose nuclear weapons altogether. How we defend jobs, skills and communities in communities currently dependent on Trident needs discussion, too. But there is a sensible, mature debate to be had. Unfortunately, those MPs yelling at their own senior colleagues have no interest in it. They seem determined to create such a poisonous atmosphere that reasoned debate is rendered impossible. Even from their own perspective, it makes no sense. If they want to win back the party leadership in a future contest, they need to convince the party membership. Yet they are only toxifying their brand while damaging their own party. I hope Labour decides on a free vote, then moves on to the key domestic issues facing Britain. But this risible attempt to shut down debate – and make politics even more unpleasant – needs calling out for what it is."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2016/feb/10/scrapping-carbon-capture-support-threatens-uk-climate-targets","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-10T06:01:16Z","webTitle":"Scrapping carbon capture support 'threatens UK climate targets'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/10/scrapping-carbon-capture-support-threatens-uk-climate-targets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/feb/10/scrapping-carbon-capture-support-threatens-uk-climate-targets","fields":{"headline":"Scrapping carbon capture support 'threatens UK climate targets'","bodyText":"The scrapping of government support for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has put at risk the UK’s international commitments on tackling climate change, an influential group of MPs has found. The energy and climate change committee said that, without such technology, it would be much more expensive to meet national and internationally agreed targets on reducing greenhouse gases. The extra cost could run to billions, outstripping the £1bn of public funds that had been promised for CCS. Angus MacNeil, the Scottish National party MP who chairs the committee, said: “The manner in which the government pulled the plug on the CCS commercialisation competition was hugely disappointing. UK companies had been working towards this for years and were only weeks away from final proposals. This is the latest in a series of snap decisions that have damaged confidence in the government’s energy policy.” Ministers agreed to long-term carbon targets at the landmark Paris climate summit in December, to much fanfare, but it came shortly after the chancellor, George Osborne, announced that mooted CCS plants would not receive government help. That decision, buried in the spending review in late November, days before the Paris conference started, was a severe blow to the UK’s fledgling CCS industry. CCS is seen as a way of extending the life of coal and gas-fired power stations, as it removes the emissions from burning fossil fuels from the atmosphere. Without it, much more investment would be required into low-carbon alternatives such as renewables and nuclear power. The government’s statutory advisers on meeting emissions targets, the Committee on Climate Change, have also warned that without CCS the UK will find it much more expensive to meet its carbon-cutting goals. Government support for the technology had been promised since 2005, when the idea was first mooted of a publicly funded competition among companies to find the best proposals. After years of wrangling by various governments, by last autumn the competition was in its final stages, with a prize settled at £1bn and two bidders remaining, both consortia that had spent several years and millions of pounds on their plans. These projects, in Yorkshire and Scotland, have now been halted. The MPs also warned that the government was missing the opportunity to use existing North Sea oil and gas infrastructure, much of which may be lost as those fields are depleted, as a cornerstone of a new CCS industry. They called for the government to put forward new CCS plans. Luke Warren, chief executive of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, said the government’s withdrawal had “an extremely negative impact on the industry”, and that although it might appear to be saving money in the short term, it would leave the UK with much greater costs in the next two decades. “[A new government strategy for CCS] needs to clearly set out the government’s ambitions in the near term and address the challenge of providing storage infrastructure [and] a sustainable future for vital energy-intensive industries, and maximise our North Sea oil and gas assets,” he said. Energy experts also warned of the potential consequences of a failure to pursue CCS technology. Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said: “The decision to cancel the £1bn CCS demonstration programme carries large risks. In the absence of a new plan for CCS, the UK is effectively outsourcing demonstration and commercialisation to other countries. This was the only significant large-scale demonstration programme in the EU, and one of a handful worldwide.” While CCS is currently expensive, he added, investing in CCS would be a way to bring down costs. “Given that the government wishes to replace coal with gas, significant CCS deployment will be essential - otherwise, gas demand is likely to have to fall sharply from the mid-2020s.” A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: “We haven’t closed the door to CCS technology in the UK, but as part of our ongoing work to get Britain’s finances back on track, we have had to take difficult decisions to control government spending. “CCS should come down in cost and we are considering the role that it could play in the long-term decarbonisation of the UK. We are committed to meeting our climate change targets in a way that is affordable and provides secure energy to our families and businesses.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/oct/25/we-dont-have-to-slaves-to-the-market","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-24T23:05:14Z","webTitle":"From football to steel, we don’t have to be slaves to the market | Will Hutton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/25/we-dont-have-to-slaves-to-the-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/25/we-dont-have-to-slaves-to-the-market","fields":{"headline":"From football to steel, we don’t have to be slaves to the market","bodyText":"The southern corner of Arsenal’s Emirates stadium, reserved for fans from visiting teams, was eerily empty as the game against the Bundesliga champions, Bayern Munich, began last week. Instead, there was a banner. “£64 for a ticket. But without fans football is not worth a penny,” it read. After five minutes, the Bayern Munich fans cascaded into the stands to loud applause from the 60,000-strong home crowd. Everyone knew a powerful point had been made. Except Arsenal do have a huge fan base and they do pay £64 a ticket because that is the price the market will bear. The clapping against blind market forces came as much from the management consultants, newspaper columnists, media multimillionaires, ex-central bankers and university vice-chancellors who now constitute Arsenal’s home base, as much as painters, plumbers and assembly line workers. Yet everyone was united in understanding the Germans’ protest. Football has to be more than a money machine. Passion for a club is part of an idea of “we” – a collective identity rooted in place, culture and history – that defines us as men and women. £64 tickets redefine the Arsenal or Bayern Munich “we” as those with the capacity to pay. Britain in 2015 is in a crisis about who the British “we” are at every level. Decades of being told that there is nothing to be done about the march of global market forces has denuded us of the possibility of acting together to shape a world that we want, whether it’s the character of our football clubs or our manufacturing base. The same day that the Arsenal crowd was clapping the Bayern Munich fans, Tata Steel announced it was mothballing its steel plants in Scotland and Teesside. Over the last fortnight, Redcar’s steel mill has been shut as Thai owner SSI has gone into receivership, while manufacturing company Caparo is liquidating its foundry division in Scunthorpe. A pivotal component of our manufacturing sector, with incalculable effects across the supply chain, is being shut. Yet when questioned, business secretary Sajid Javid’s trump answer is that the British government does not control the world steel price. He will, of course, do everything he can to soften the blow and help unemployed steel workers retrain or start their own businesses. But the message is unambiguous. Vast, uncontrollable market forces are at work. The government will not even raise the matter of how China exports steel to Britain at below the cost of production and intensifies the crisis. It becomes purposeless to talk about what “we” might do because there are no tools for “us” to use. The new world is one in which each individual must look after her or himself. Even the trade unions and new Labour leadership, aghast at the scale of the job losses, do not have a plausible alternative – except to plead that the £9m proposed support package for unemployed steel workers in Scunthorpe is paltry. There could have been, and still are, alternatives, but they are predicated on a conception of “we” resisted by right and left. A stronger steel industry, more capable of riding out this crisis, could have been created by more engagement with Europe and refashioning the ecosystem in which production takes place. But since the collapse of Britain’s membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992, governments of all hues have abjured any attempt to keep the pound stable and competitive, either pegging sterling against the euro and dollar or even – perish the thought – joining the euro. The pound, except for a short period after the banking crisis, has been systematically overvalued for a generation. Manufacturing production has stagnated as imports have soared. The trade deficit in goods in 2014 was a stunning £120bn, or some 7% of GDP. Yet dissociating Britain from all European attempts to manage currency movements and keeping the independent pound floating is as widely praised by John McDonnell on the left as John Redwood on the right. A devastated manufacturing sector, and now the crisis in the steel industry, is too rarely mentioned as part of the price. Alongside pegging the exchange rate should have been a determined effort to develop areas of industrial strength, with government and business working closely as co-creators. Yet even such a relationship – close to unthinkable in a British context – would have needed business keen on creating value rather than a high share price and a government setting some ambitious targets backed by spending the necessary billions. Britain, for example, could have had a brilliant civil nuclear industry, a vibrant aerospace sector, the fastest growing windfarm industry, clusters of hi-tech business all over the country – and a hi-tech steel industry. Instead it is no better than a mendicant subcontractor. It does not have a share stake in Airbus, while France and China are building our nuclear power stations. Our green industries, once the fastest growing in Europe, are shutting. Only banks and hedge funds are protected and nurtured in a vigorous, uncompromising industrial policy, but they don’t buy much steel. They are the “we” behind which even ultra-libertarian Sajid Javid will throw the awesome weight of the state. Scunthorpe, Redcar, Teesside and the West Midlands are not; they can go hang. And yet. Part of the reason the “northern powerhouse” is such a powerful idea is that it redefines the “we” so that the priorities and aspirations of the north are as valid as those of a hedge fund manager or the pampered board of HSBC. It is also obvious that newly empowered public authorities will have to co-create the vision with private partners and work with a Conservative government and the EU. There will be no “northern powerhouse” if it is locked out of European markets, nor is much progress likely with a third-rate transport and training infrastructure. It also needs a prolonged period of exchange rate stability. Little of this easily fits the categories in which either Javid on the right or McDonnell and Corbyn on the left think. There is a powerful role for public agency and public spending, but it is much less directive, statist and top-down than traditional left thinking. Equally, the driver of any growth has to be vigorous, purposeful capitalism, but one co-created between private and public in a manner foreign to the traditional libertarian right. And there should be no place for hostility to Europe, also part of this reformulated “we”. In this sense, there is a golden thread between the applause of the crowd in the Emirates and the way the “northern powerhouse” is taking shape, along with dismay at our dependence on China to build our nuclear power stations. There has been too much of a surrender to supply and demand. It is time to shape markets and football leagues alike. There is a “we”. It could be different."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2015/apr/22/japan-moves-nearer-to-restarting-nuclear-reactors-after-court-gives-go-ahead","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-22T06:10:02Z","webTitle":"Japan moves nearer to restarting nuclear reactors after court gives go-ahead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/22/japan-moves-nearer-to-restarting-nuclear-reactors-after-court-gives-go-ahead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/apr/22/japan-moves-nearer-to-restarting-nuclear-reactors-after-court-gives-go-ahead","fields":{"headline":"Japan moves nearer to restarting nuclear reactors after court gives go-ahead","bodyText":"Japan’s plans to return to nuclear power generation more than four years after the triple meltdown at Fukushima received a boost on Wednesday after a court approved the restart of two nuclear reactors. The Kagoshima district court in south-west Japan rejected a residents’ injunction against restarting two reactors at the Sendai nuclear power plant, bringing the country a step closer to operating a nuclear reactor for the first time since September 2013. The ruling comes a week after another court sided with concerned residents in a separate case by temporarily blocking the planned restart of two reactors at the Takahama plant on the Japan Sea coast, citing safety concerns. Hiroyuki Kawai, head lawyer for the plaintiffs, described Wednesday’s ruling as “extremely regrettable”. He added: “We will not give in, we will continue fighting. We will not let our emotions be swayed by any short-term results and we will fight until we get rid of all nuclear reactors in Japan.” The chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, declined to comment on the ruling but said it supported an earlier decision by Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority to approve the restart of the Takahama and Sendai reactors. “The government respects the decision to resume plants that it considers meeting safety standards, while placing top priority on safety over any other factor,” Suga said. All 48 of Japan’s working reactors were gradually taken offline in the wake of the March 2011 disaster at Fukushima Daiichi. None will go back online until they have passed stringent safety requirements introduced by Japan’s nuclear watchdog and overcome opposition from nearby residents. Wednesday’s court decision leaves Kyushu Electric Power, the operator of Sendai nuclear power plant, with just one more regulatory obstacle to overcome before it can restart the two reactors, possibly as early as June. Regulators have said they are “very close” to completing their review of the Sendai reactors’ safety regime. Once the licensing procedures are complete, the two reactors, which were commissioned in the 1980s, would have to pass a final operational safety inspection before being switched back on, the NRA commissioner, Toyoshi Fuketa, said. “We need to have a period for inspection and this is the first experience for Kyushu and for us,” he said. “It will take a certain time … it’s quite difficult to say.” In the latest lawsuit, residents had argued that Kepco and regulators had underestimated the risk posed to the Sendai plant by nearby volcanoes, and that evacuation plans in the event of a Fukushima-type disaster were insufficient. The plaintiffs said the “ability to predict eruptions is known to be inadequate”, adding there were “no grounds for Kepco’s assertion that the probability of a [volcanic] eruption is low”. Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has pushed for nuclear restarts, despite opinion polls showing that a majority of the public opposes them. He has warned that Japan’s economic recovery will be put at risk by the enormous cost of importing coal and liquefied natural gas to fill the energy void left by nuclear. The country’s increasing dependence on fossil fuels, as well as plans to build more coal-fired power stations, has raised questions about its ability to set ambitious CO2 emissions targets. Reports suggest Japan plans to cut CO2 emissions by about 20% from 2013 levels by 2030 – a much lower target than other big developed economies. Abe could draw criticism over the targets from fellow leaders when the G7 countries meet in Germany in June. Faced with mounting running costs, utilities are pushing to restart at least some of their idled reactors. Kansai Electric Power, which serves the huge city of Osaka, faces legal challenges against four of its 11 reactors, and has said it would decommission two reactors. Tokyo Electric Power, the operators of the ruined Fukushima Daiichi, is hoping to persuade local authorities to approve the restart of Kashiwazaki Kariwa, the world’s biggest nuclear power plant. Chubu Electric Power, meanwhile, was forced to close its Hamaoka plant in May 2011 owing to its proximity to offshore tectonic plates. The plant is in a region that experts say is at risk of being struck by a powerful earthquake."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2015/nov/26/move-on-with-labours-great-helmsman","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-26T19:32:45Z","webTitle":"Move on with Labour’s great helmsman | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/26/move-on-with-labours-great-helmsman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/nov/26/move-on-with-labours-great-helmsman","fields":{"headline":"Move on with Labour’s great helmsman","bodyText":"John McDonnell makes a very important point by brandishing Chairman Mao’s Little Red Book in parliament (McDonnell throws the (Mao) book, 26 November). George Osborne is not just enabling the Chinese state to own British state assets. He is actually subsidising Chinese state enterprises to do so, as well as structuring UK public sector contracts in such a way as to favour the Chinese. What’s more, with recent Chinese engagement in energy, he is effectively selling to China future UK tax revenues. Nick Matthews Rugby, Warwickshire • Put aside the Red Book and instead concentrate on the real political issue. Do we think it’s in Britain’s best interests that swathes of our national infrastructure should be sold to foreign investors, be they companies or countries? Already we cannot plan for economic growth as we might wish because foreign multinationals own much of our business and industry, and, as we have discovered with our steel plants, the government cannot stop them when they choose to walk away leaving behind a trail of economic and social devastation. Our nuclear power industry is being upgraded with Chinese funding, but at what cost to our independence and security? Furthermore, just imagine the possibilities for economic or political blackmail if George Osborne sells air traffic control to one of his new friends. Whether or not the Little Red Book was a good idea, John Mc Donnell was absolutely right on the key issue to castigate the Tories for their plans to further sell off of our essential infrastructure. Margaret Parker Holmfirth, West Yorkshire • Sometimes the Labour leadership brings me close to tears. All that John McDonnell needed to point out – as Jonathan Freedland so clearly does (Hypothetical windfall down the back of the Treasury’s sofa allowed the chancellor to play Santa Claus, 26 November) – is that the whole of the chancellor’s so-called strategy is imprudently based on a forecast which following previous predictions is likely to be flawed. There is no need for Red Books or other stunts. The government is financially irresponsible in the extreme. Why, oh why, can’t Labour just say this? David Hawkins Kingston upon Thames, Surrey • For everyone watching the chancellor’s statement, John McDonnell’s Red Book reference was clearly a joke and, as the only remnant of what used to be a relatively intellectually sound press, I would hope that the Guardian would recognise this, dismiss it as such, and instead focus on the actual details of what he said. He is saying important things and, since no one else will, it is on the Guardian that its readers rely for an objective, sensible coverage, rather than a sensationalist one. McDonnell, which should be clear from the impressive economic advisory committee he has convened, has some very interesting things to say, and they must be heard in the Guardian if nowhere else. Blairism is dead and even if wasn’t, the chancellor would have colonised it with the rest of the centre-right. Move on with your readers.

In the unprecedented legal action, comprising nine separate cases brought before the ICJ on Thursday, the Republic of the Marshall Islands accuses the nuclear weapons states of a \"flagrant denial of human justice\". It argues it is justified in taking the action because of the harm it suffered as a result of the nuclear arms race. The Pacific chain of islands, including Bikini Atoll and Enewetak, was the site of 67 nuclear tests from 1946 to 1958, including the \"Bravo shot\", a 15-megaton device equivalent to a thousand Hiroshima blasts, detonated in 1954. The Marshallese islanders say they have been suffering serious health and environmental effects ever since. The island republic is suing the five \"established\" nuclear weapons states recognised in the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) – the US, Russia (which inherited the Soviet arsenal), China, France and the UK – as well as the three countries outside the NPT who have declared nuclear arsenals – India, Pakistan and North Korea, and the one undeclared nuclear weapons state, Israel. The NPT, which came into force in 1970 is essentially a compact between the non-weapon states, who pledged to not to acquire nuclear weapons, and the weapons states, who in return undertook to disarm under article VI of the treaty. Although the size of the arsenals are sharply down from the height of the cold war, the Marshall Islands' legal case notes there remain more than 17,000 warheads in existence, 16,000 of them owned by Russia and the US – enough to destroy all life on the planet. \"The long delay in fulfilling the obligations enshrined in article VI of the NPT constitutes a flagrant denial of human justice,\" the court documents say. The Marshall Islands case draws attention to the fact that the weapons states are currently in the process of modernising their nuclear weapons, which it portrays as a clear violation of the NPT. The case against Britain, which has an estimated total inventory of 225 warheads and is in the process of replacing its submarine-launched Trident arsenal, states that: \"The UK has not pursued in good faith negotiations to cease the nuclear arms race at an early date through comprehensive nuclear disarmament or other measures, and instead is taking actions to improve its nuclear weapons system and to maintain it for the indefinite future.\" The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's general secretary, Kate Hudson, said: \"The nuclear-armed states continue to peddle the myth that they are committed to multilateral disarmament initiatives, while squandering billions to modernise their nuclear arsenals. The UK government's plans to replace Trident make a mockery of its professed belief in multilateral frameworks – and now in addition to huge public opposition in the UK, it will also face an international legal challenge to expose its hypocrisy.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/21/uk-nuclear-power-plant-contract-deal-no-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-21T19:53:16Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear power plant contract: £80bn deal or no deal?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/21/uk-nuclear-power-plant-contract-deal-no-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/21/uk-nuclear-power-plant-contract-deal-no-deal","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear power plant contract: £80bn deal or no deal?","bodyText":"David Cameron was accused on Wednesday of jettisoning his commitment to the environment when he capitulated to the pressure of spiralling energy costs by announcing he will roll back green levies that the government says is adding an unacceptable average of £112 to household bills. Cameron's coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats, immediately accused Cameron of a \"panicky u-turn\" and making policy on the hoof, but conceded they had agreed to \"stress test\" the green levies to see if they are being implemented efficiently, and at minimum cost. It is possible that the two parties could yet reach an agreement in time for the autumn statement by transferring some of the multi-billion cost of the green levies from the consumer to the taxpayer. The Scottish Nationalists proposed the same transfer last week. The deadlines to meet some of the levies may also be delayed. The Liberal Democrats said they will hold discussions with Cameron, but insisted they would not compromise on ends \"protecting the environment, helping the fuel-poor and safeguarding our green industries and jobs\". In practice, the largest proportion of the so-called green levies go to help the poor with energy efficiency measures, and Cameron's commitment to roll them back comes only a day after the former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major had warned millions of the nearly poor faced a choice between eating and heating this winter. Conservative sources insisted they would not allow support for the poor to be reduced this winter. Cameron also appeared to accept for the first time that the system of energy regulation is not working when he announced an annual energy competition review to be conducted jointly by Ofgem, the Office of Fair Trading and the new Competition and Markets Authority. Further details of the new competition test will be announced by the energy secretary Ed Davey next week, but it will cover profits, competition and communication with customers. Labour has vowed to replace the energy regulator Ofgem for over a year, something the coalition opposed, but Cameron's announcements on Wednesday are an implicit acknowledgement that the regulatory system is inadequate. The review, due to make an initial report next Spring, may look at the way in which the industry is vertically integrated – a system that critics say leads to the industry selling to itself. Cameron's announcements at prime ministers questions follows weeks in which Ministers have groped for a coherent response to the Labour commitment to freeze energy prices for 20 months. The timing appears in part to be prompted by Sir John Major's surprise call for a windfall tax on the energy utilities. Liberal Democrats were given 30 minutes notice on Wednesday that Cameron would make his announcement at prime ministers questions, prompting a senior Liberal Democrat to claim no properly worked out policies had been put in front of them. But Cameron told MPs: \"I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place as energy secretary [under Gordon Brown]. According to Number 10, green levies are due to rise from £112 annually to £194 – or 14% of the typical household bill – by 2020 if there is no policy change. The PM's spokesman said: \"One way or the other the prime minister is determined to roll back green levies. There have been discussions about more targeted support since George Osborne's speech on 9 September.\" Miliband responded by claiming Cameron came up with a new policy every day of the week, and pointed out 60% of the green levies were introduced by Cameron's own government. He ridiculed Cameron: \"Who is the man who said vote blue to go green? It was him. I tell you what's weak – it's not standing up to the energy companies, and that is this prime minister all over.\" The energy companies have been campaigning for the levies to be scaled back for months, but Davey told the Guardian at the weekend that \"anyone with GCSE maths can work out that energy bills are not rising due to green taxes\". The former energy secretary Chris Huhne also attacked the move saying :\"Don't shoot ourselves in the foot. For the government to end a charge that cuts our energy bills by £100 in 2020– that would be crazy\". Peter Luff, the Tory former chairman of the business select committee, summed up the Conservative dilemma saying \"When you are in the red, it is difficult to vote blue and go green.\" Government figures show that £50 goes on the energy company obligation – which supports energy efficiency in poorer households. A further £11 goes towards the warm homes discount, which is designed to help with the costs of fuel bills for poorer households. The other charges are meeting the UK's renewable obligations (£30), the EU's emissions trading scheme (£8), the carbon price floor (£5), feed-in tariffs (£7) and smart meters (£3). Tensions between the two parties may come to an early head on Monday when Lord Stern, author of the landmark 2006 report on the economics of climate change, will table an amendment to the energy bill compelling the UK to set a decarbonisation target before 1 April next year. The adoption of a decarbonisation target for 2030 is official Lib Dem policy and many of its peers are thought to support the amendment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/shortcuts/2013/oct/21/hinkley-point-nuclear-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-21T15:31:19Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point nuclear power station: a new type of nationalisation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2013/oct/21/hinkley-point-nuclear-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/shortcuts/2013/oct/21/hinkley-point-nuclear-power-station","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point nuclear power station: a new type of nationalisation","bodyText":"Rejoice! Britain's first new nuclear power station in a generation is to be built at Hinkley Point in Somerset, and David Cameron could not be happier. \"This is a very big day for our country,\" he said yesterday, \"the first time we've built a new nuclear power station for a very long time.\" There is only one snag: \"we\" are not building it at all. Thanks to an amazingly cushy 35-year deal agreed with the government, the plant to be known as Hinkley C is the responsibility of a consortium largely split between the French energy giant EDF and two Chinese setups, the China General Nuclear Power Group and the China National Nuclear Corporation. EDF is 85% owned by the French government; the Chinese state owns all of the latter two companies. Nationalisation, it seems, is back – only it's a new kind, whereby it is overseas governments who get to buy up our national assets. Just look at the evidence. At the last official count, a third of British infrastructure was overseas-owned – but what's particularly interesting is the amount of government money involved. EDF – it stands for Électricité de France – already owns two British coal-fired power stations, eight UK nuclear plants and a couple of British wind farms. Germany's Deutsche Bahn is a 100% state-owned railway company, and since 2010, it has also owned Arriva, which controls an array of British bus services as well as the majority of trains that run in Wales, and a whole load that serve Birmingham (prior to buying Arriva, DB had already bought the Chiltern main line, overground services in London and Tyne and Wear Metro). DP World owns 60 or so ports across the planet, including the Port of London and the Port of Southampton – and is controlled by Dubai World, an investment company that acts on behalf of Dubai's government. The state-backed China Investment Corporation owns nearly 10% of Thames Water and a similar-sized chunk of Ferrovial, the Spanish-owned conglomerate that has a big stake in the airports at Heathrow, Southampton, Glasgow and Aberdeen. Those airports are also 20% owned by Qatar Holding, which slings money around on behalf of Qatar's rulers. Oh, and just to bring things up to date, among the big investors that bought thousands of shares in Royal Mail were sovereign wealth funds whose money comes from the governments of Kuwait and Singapore. The Hinkley Point deal is traceable to a memorandum of understanding on infrastructure investment, agreed by the governments of China and the UK in 2011, and boosted by George Osborne's recent trip to Beijing (where he announced that another state-owned Chinese company is to get involved in Manchester airport). There will, it seems, be much more of this stuff – not least, perhaps, when it comes to the new high-speed rail line that will run between London and Birmingham and beyond. Among the firms who are interested in a piece of that particular action are the state-owned China Railway Group, though while in China, Osborne said talks about all that were \"for another day\". Strange, perhaps, that the same Tories who warn of the perils of government intervention in the economy and our supposed loss of sovereignty to the wicked old EU should be going down this road, but there we are: state ownership is obviously fine, so long as it's someone else's state that's doing it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/mar/30/who-is-to-blame-for-the-steel-crisis-tata-port-talbot","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-30T14:33:53Z","webTitle":"Who is to blame for the steel crisis?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/30/who-is-to-blame-for-the-steel-crisis-tata-port-talbot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/mar/30/who-is-to-blame-for-the-steel-crisis-tata-port-talbot","fields":{"headline":"Who is to blame for the steel crisis?","bodyText":"The crisis in the UK steel industry has deep roots. Globalisation and the opening-up of world markets; a slowdown in Chinese manufacturing, creating massive over-capacity in its steel plants; a subsequent boom in cheap Chinese exports and a collapse in the global steel price. Those pressures have become intense since 2012: but the story of steel in the UK has also been one of a 40-year decline in output and employment. In the early 1970s, the UK industry was producing almost 29m tonnes and employing 325,000 people; by last year, the figures were 12.5m tonnes and 30,000 people. But decline is also relative. The business, innovation and skills (BIS) select committee, in a detailed review of the government’s response to the steel crisis last December, made an important point: other major EU countries, notably Germany, Italy, France and Spain, have done better at protecting their steel industries. In terms of production, the UK has been bottom of that mini league table since 2001, having once been second only to Germany. Should the UK government – and successive governments – have foreseen the crisis? Could it have been handled better? What could politicians have done differently? Energy costs The UK steel industry has complained bitterly for years that it pays higher energy costs than European peers. The Eurostat figures quoted in the BIS committee report make the point. In 2014, UK steelmakers paid about 80% above the EU median for their electricity. UK government policies to meet legally binding targets to reduce carbon emissions are partly responsible. Yet the desire to give a helping hand to heavy industries was also recognised in the 2011 autumn statement via the Energy-intensive Industries Package. In practice, the full package was only implemented last year. The BIS committee commented: “Successive governments have not prioritised the issue sufficiently to force it up the agenda at the European commission, which could have approved the full package years ago. This delay has directly affected the competitiveness of the UK steel industry and been a contributory factor to the current crisis.” Compensation packages and exceptions from environmental taxes have costs elsewhere, of course: in the end, other consumers are obliged to pay. But the point seems clear – the government was prepared to help steel, but actual remedies were slow to arrive. Business rates UK steel companies have claimed they pay up to seven times as much in business rates than European competitors. They have argued that the UK business rate regime discourages investment in new plant and machinery. The BIS committee sympathised: “We recommend that the government demonstrates its support for rebalancing the economy towards manufacturing, and the steel industry, by reforming business rates.” In the event, the chancellor’s budget this month was friendlier to the oil and gas industries than to steel, which was mentioned only once in the context of the protections from climate change levies. Procurement Here the government was a belated convert to the idea of helping UK steel producers compete for UK public-sector contracts. New guidelines were published last October to “help steel producers compete on a level playing field with international suppliers”. The worry, however, is that other EU countries would be less fussy and would actively tilt the playing field. Look at Hinkley Point, the proposed new nuclear power station in Somerset. While EDF, the constructor, says the project is a “big opportunity for UK steel” and there is an “expectation” that a large proportion will come from the UK, everything is subject to a competitive process. Quite right too, purists would say: Hinkley Point is already hideously expensive. It is hard, though, to believe that all EU countries wouldn’t favour their own steelmakers more explicitly. As for the government’s new procurement guidelines, the BIS committee said: “The impact of these changes will not be apparent for some considerable time. We regret that this change in policy was not made many months, if not years, earlier.” Tariffs The UK has flip-flopped on the wisdom of encouraging the EU to imposes tariffs on Chinese steel. Anti-protectionism used to be the philosophy but the UK backed an extension of long-standing tariffs on wire rod steel last year. “Successive governments should have done much more to press for accelerated action at the EU,” concluded the BIS committee. Another difficulty is that the US is faster and more determined than the EU to impose tariffs when it judges that illegal Chinese dumping is taken place. But there is also a suspicion – again identified by the committee – that UK steelmakers are uniquely vulnerable to Chinese imports because other EU countries interpret European law to suit their own industries, albeit sometimes falling foul of the European commission’s state aid rules. Industrial policy Here the charge is that the government’s warm words about the importance of the steel industry as part of a manufacturing revival have not been met by action until the closure of the SSI plant in Redcar crisis led to a government-sponsored “steel summit” last October. “The government identified steel as an industry of vital importance but, like its predecessors, did not have the effective early warning systems in place to detect and address mounting problems,” said the BIS committee. Even the speed of the current crisis at Tata Steel appears to have taken ministers by surprise. At the start of this week, Whitehall officials did not believe that the Indian firm would put all its UK steel assets up for sale. Almost by default, the government has adopted a holding position while it, and Tata, seek private buyers. But, if no bidders emerge for a business said to be losing £1m a day, the size and nature of any government-sponsored rescue plan is a mystery."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/oct/09/baltic-exchange-faces-potential-chinese-takeover","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-09T16:43:55Z","webTitle":"Baltic Exchange faces potential Chinese takeover","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/09/baltic-exchange-faces-potential-chinese-takeover","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/oct/09/baltic-exchange-faces-potential-chinese-takeover","fields":{"headline":"Baltic Exchange faces potential Chinese takeover","bodyText":"The Baltic Exchange, one of the City’s oldest institutions, is facing a potential takeover by Chinese-owned interests. The shipping market, which has been operating in London since 1744, has been approached for a buyout by the London Metal Exchange (LME), itself now owned from Hong Kong. The Chinese have become prominent buyers of British companies in recent years, owning assets from Weetabix to Felixstowe Docks. Beijing has also been intensively courted by George Osborne on his recent visit to China to invest in new UK nuclear power stations, bid for HS2 rail supply contracts and connect the London and Shanghai stock exchanges. “It is an informal approach,” one well-placed source told Reuters about the LME move, while a second source talked about the metal exchange making “strong overtures” to the Baltic, which is owned by its shipbroker members. Jeremy Penn, chief executive of the Baltic, declined to comment on any takeover talks but said no conclusion should be drawn from that. “We would never comment in any way on anything of that nature whether it was true or untrue.” The Baltic, whose historic building was bombed by the IRA in 1992, is well past its prime as a vital location for ships to be chartered. Today it is largely useful for producing benchmark data such as the Baltic Dry Index, which tracks the rates for hiring bulk carriers of iron ore, grain or coal. But the institution retains City cachet and has been previously courted by the LME, itself the oldest and largest market for trading industrial metals such as steel, copper or zinc. The Baltic has also recently moved into the black after a period of losses. In September, it unveiled plans to pay out almost £10m in dividends to its 380 shareholders. Penn has recently announced plans to step down from his role in 2016, having completed more than a decade in his post. The LME, which says it allows producers and consumers of metal to hedge their risks against fluctuating commodity prices, was bought by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing in 2012 for nearly £1.4bn. The Chinese company regulates stock market trading rules in Hong Kong, where it is based. It is also a joint venture partner with the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges in an organisation which aims to “contribute to the further internationalisation of China’s capital markets”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/dec/02/paris-climate-talks-the-poorest-countries-are-putting-the-richest-to-shame","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-02T10:52:48Z","webTitle":"Paris climate talks: The poorest countries are putting the richest to shame | Kumi Naidoo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/02/paris-climate-talks-the-poorest-countries-are-putting-the-richest-to-shame","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/dec/02/paris-climate-talks-the-poorest-countries-are-putting-the-richest-to-shame","fields":{"headline":"Paris climate talks: The poorest countries are putting the richest to shame","bodyText":"There were never more global leaders under one roof than here in Paris at the global climate negotiations on Monday. And they all talked about leadership, about fixing climate change, about not leaving an uninhabitable planet for our children. Many spoke powerful words. The French president, François Hollande, rightly called coal, oil and gas the energies of the past (he forgot nuclear). And many talked about how renewables are the future. When Greenpeace started talking about the “carbon budget” that humanity must not exceed, governments were still in denial about the need to keep fossil fuels in the ground. This year Barack Obama justified rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline with the fact that we cannot burn all fossil fuels we’ve already found, let alone new sources. This is a start. People power is winning. But there is still no real leadership coming from the major polluters. All of them, whether the US, Germany, China or India, would benefit if they went for a real energy revolution. Not even German chancellor, Angela Merkel - who at least signalled the end of the fossil fuel era in her speech here in Paris - demanded what we really need: governments to commit to 100% renewables for all by 2050. But there are real leaders here in Paris. And they are standing up for their own and humanity’s survival. On 30 November, 43 of the most vulnerable countries - the countries that will be hardest hit by climate change - called for warming to be limited to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial times - the threshold we must not exceed if many countries in the Pacific and other Least Developed Countries are to survive. The Climate Vulnerable Forum in their declaration also called for “100% renewable energy production by 2050” and demanded real action and agreed “to strengthen our own national climate actions in order to … help trigger increased commitments from all countries.” It’s countries like the Philippines, Kiribati and Morocco - the host of next year’s climate negotiations - showing this true leadership. They put richer countries to shame. And it is those wealthier countries which now need to respond to the call by the most vulnerable and offer real support. They should start by triggering those “increased commitments” the vulnerable are demanding; they should commit to 100% renewables for all right here in Paris. Renewables are the answer. The phase-out of fossil fuels is a necessary precondition for the 100% renewables future we seek. We therefore also support the leadership of the Pacific Island states led by Kiribati who are calling for a stop to all new coal mines now. Coal is in terminal decline worldwide. But it still kills too many people all over the world and needs to phased out as soon as possible. It can be done – solar is already winning the race, including, it appears, in India. Greenpeace will stand in solidarity with these real leaders throughout COP21, as this climate conference is known. And we will speak out against all polluters. It is nothing but cynical that companies like Engie and EDF are sponsors of this conference. These energy dinosaurs still run coal-fired power plants and are holding the energy revolution back by wasting money on dangerous and expensive nuclear power. We need to kick polluters out of these climate talks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jul/21/new-onshore-wind-farms-still-possible-without-subsidies-says-amber-rudd","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-21T14:33:30Z","webTitle":"New onshore windfarms still possible without subsidies, says Amber Rudd","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/21/new-onshore-wind-farms-still-possible-without-subsidies-says-amber-rudd","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jul/21/new-onshore-wind-farms-still-possible-without-subsidies-says-amber-rudd","fields":{"headline":"New onshore windfarms still possible without subsidies, says Amber Rudd","bodyText":"New onshore windfarms could be built in the UK without subsidies, according to the energy secretary Amber Rudd. The Conservative government recently moved to block future onshore turbines by removing financial support and giving local communities the final say. Critics said the step would increase energy bills as additional clean energy from more expensive technologies would be needed to replace wind power. But Rudd told the energy and climate change select committee of MPs on Tuesday: “I have had three separate developers interested in developing [onshore] windfarms without subsidies.” She said they were “large” developers, but did not give further details. Rudd was challenged by LibDem committee member Alistair Carmichael over the large subsidies promised to new nuclear power stations. He asked whether her statement that subsidies should only be given while a new industry established itself was contradicted by the 35-year deal offered to a proposed nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset: “It’s hardly a new technology,” he said. Rudd said: “We have to have secure baseload [electricity] so you should not be surprised that we are prepared to pay for it.” She said she had met recently those involved in the Hinkley Point project, which include French state-controlled company EDF Energy. “There is a very good prospect of reaching a very happy conclusion later this year,” she said. The final decision on Hinkley Point has already been delayed by five years and the earliest it could now open is 2023. Rudd also said that Austria’s “very unwelcome” challenge to the UK’s support for nuclear power - suggesting it is illegal state aid - was unlikely to succeed. “The signal we are getting from the European commission is that the decision is robust,” she said. “We don’t think it will impact on the final investment decision.” Rudd was asked if the retrospective cuts to onshore wind power had damaged the confidence of investors. “I appreciate it was disappointing but I don’t think it came as a great surprise,” she said, noting that it had been a Conservative manifesto commitment. Rudd also gave an indication of the political aspect of the crackdown on onshore wind. Conservative committee member Glyn Davies said: “The issue in some parts of the country was the scale of the development. It turned people against wind and renewables in general.” Rudd replied: “That is one of the reasons the prime minister wanted to end subsidies for onshore wind and put local communities in charge. People felt large windfarms were being built in their areas without their consent.” Recent anonymous briefings from cabinet ministers have promised a “big reset” on the subsidies for green energy, which make up less than 4% of the average energy bill. Rudd said an announcement would be made shortly: “I am absolutely aware we need to give certainty [to investors].” Rudd said the troubled Green Deal energy efficiency policy was under review. “Energy efficiency is the most effective way to reduce bills and carbon – it is a win-win.” she said. George Osborne’s recent budget cut the funds available for energy efficiency programmes. Rudd was not asked about her U-turn on banning fracking in the country’s thousands of Sites of Special Scientific Interest. But she said: “I think shale gas will be an important part of the energy mix of the UK and part of decarbonisation, as it is effectively a low-carbon fuel.” Critics argue that gas is only a low-carbon fuel when compared to coal and that UK coal power plants are due to be shut down in any case. They argue shale gas will push out genuinely low-carbon renewable developments, rather than coal. Rudd said the recent decision of Lancashire County Council to refuse planning permission for fracking firm Cuadrilla was “disappointing” and said the government and developers would have to continue to reassure local communities that a safe and robust regulatory regime is in place."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/sep/28/hinkley-point-new-nuclear-reactors-deal-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-27T23:05:01Z","webTitle":"Farage and Putin help Hinkley Point clear EU hurdle and put UK's nuclear programme back on track","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/28/hinkley-point-new-nuclear-reactors-deal-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/sep/28/hinkley-point-new-nuclear-reactors-deal-europe","fields":{"headline":"Farage and Putin help Hinkley Point clear EU hurdle and put UK's nuclear programme back on track","bodyText":"Anti-nuclear campaigners looking for someone to blame if Hinkley Point in Somerset finally gets the green light for two new reactors might point the finger at Nigel Farage. Vladimir Putin could also be a scapegoat for the European competition commissioner's decision to back the UK government's support for the first new atomic power stations in a generation. But others would say it is less about the politics of European togetherness or energy security and more about the EC commissioner himself, Joaquín Almunia. The speculation is intense because the go-ahead he gave last week to the government's support regime for new nuclear power at Hinkley Point represents an abrupt U-turn for the European competition directorate, which barely eight months ago damned the UK government proposals outright. The reality is that, among others, UK energy secretary Ed Davey also helped turn the tables and has given the coalition a fighting chance of keeping its wider energy policy on the road before a tough general election. Spending £16bn on new reactors in Somerset has always been a flagship project for ministers, who believe it will demonstrate how hard they are working to keep the lights on and tackle climate change. The decision is also a big relief for EDF, the company behind Hinkley, which is already spending £1m a day digging foundations and making other preparations for the two huge new reactors, which will provide one-fifteenth of the country's electricity. Almunia, who steps down on 1 November, let it be known last week that he would \"propose to the college of commissioners to take a positive decision, and in principle the decision should be taken during the mandate of the commission in October\". So while the first, and main, hurdle has been overcome, other commissioners – such as the energy tsar, Günther Oettinger, who not so long ago branded the Hinkley subsidy system \"Soviet\" – could yet stick a spanner in the works. Already Austria has warned it will issue a legal challenge to any final \"yes\". The UK Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) is certainly not regarding it as a done deal. \"The process is ongoing and the EC must still make a formal decision,\" said a spokesman. EDF, the French state power company, whose government was also lobbying hard for Hinkley, declined to comment except to say: \"We are hopeful.\" Privately, officials at both EDF and Decc are no doubt delighted. Late in January the competition directorate published a scathing 68-page initial assessment, saying the combination of price guarantees and credit guarantees were potentially inappropriate, disproportionate and in breach of EU law. \"The Contract for Difference [the main support mechanism] seems to provide the utmost certainty of a stable revenue stream, under rather lenient conditions...[that] is conceived to entirely eliminate market risks from the commercial activity of electricity generation,\" warned Almunia's report. The UK government had always denied that the \"strike price\" it was effectively agreeing to cover – of £92.50/MWh over a 35-year period, roughly twice the current wholesale price of power – would distort competition. So what did change minds in Brussels? The Farage theory is that Almunia realised that refusing the financial support mechanism for Hinkley could be used by Ukip as a tool to promote its \"let's leave Europe\" policies. Farage could argue that the end of Hinkley would doom the 25,000 jobs it could have created, risk higher energy bills and undermine Britain's energy security just before the general election. This would give Ukip a boost and help pave the way for a vote to leave Europe at a referendum promised for 2017. Almunia is unlikely to have been much swayed by this argument, but Putin's actions in Ukraine have forced Europe to confront its dependence on Russian gas. A new European energy security strategy published in May included references to the importance of nuclear power that had previously been omitted. Sources in Brussels say the UK government used concerns about Putin turning the gas off to the Ukraine and potentially disrupting supplies elsewhere as a powerful argument for Hinkley. But others say Almunia was always reasonably well-disposed to atomic power and that the initial document attacking the proposed British subsidy scheme was just to demonstrate that scrutiny would be rigorous. Decc officials have had to provide reams of extra information to Brussels over the past year, and at a key meeting 10 days ago, Davey went to Almunia's office to clear up the loose ends. The importance of the decision goes well beyond Somerset. EDF, which has Chinese state companies as co-investors, is already talking of potential new reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk. The Chinese have also made it clear they would like to construct and operate some plants on their own, and recently brought in Rolls Royce as a strategic partner. Hitachi of Japan is looking at developing reactors at Wylfa in Anglesey and Oldbury in Gloucestershire, while Toshiba of Japan and GDF of France are keen on a scheme for three reactors at Sellafield, Cumbria. Keith Parker, chief executive of the Nuclear Industries Association, a lobby group for atomic power, said: \"The UK needs to start building new power stations now, as most of the UK's existing plants are due to retire in the next 15 years. Without new nuclear stations, we run the risk of losing a stable and low-carbon source of energy.\" But Greenpeace insists the EC must stop the Hinkley programme. EU legal adviser Andrea Carta said: \"The proposed deal pays no attention to either European law or the interests of the consumer. The UK government plan to subsidise Hinkley is not offering good value to UK citizens. We can decarbonise using cheaper technologies with fewer long-term liabilities. \"Furthermore, the government has failed to run a transparent tender procedure, which should lead the Commission to reject the plan. Instead of integrating renewable energy into the grid and creating a more competitive energy market, the UK wants to waste taxpayers' money to prop up a risky technology.\" Davey insists the full nuclear programme could cut consumer bills by £77 by 2030, but rival energy firms have warned the deal could mean higher bills to subsidise the project. Other critics point out that projects similar to Hinkley in Finland and France are running massively behind schedule and over budget, although EDF insists it will be able to deliver the Somerset plant on time. There are still unresolved issues such as plant safety and the disposal of Britain's high-level nuclear waste. Even if the EC does finally OK the financial support system, the arguments over new nuclear have only just begun."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/dec/03/uruguay-makes-dramatic-shift-to-nearly-95-clean-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-03T10:57:38Z","webTitle":"Uruguay makes dramatic shift to nearly 95% electricity from clean energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/03/uruguay-makes-dramatic-shift-to-nearly-95-clean-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/dec/03/uruguay-makes-dramatic-shift-to-nearly-95-clean-energy","fields":{"headline":"Uruguay makes dramatic shift to nearly 95% electricity from clean energy","bodyText":"As the world gathers in Paris for the daunting task of switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy, one small country on the other side of the Atlantic is making that transition look childishly simple and affordable. In less than 10 years, Uruguay has slashed its carbon footprint without government subsidies or higher consumer costs, according to the country’s head of climate change policy, Ramón Méndez. In fact, he says that now that renewables provide 94.5% of the country’s electricity, prices are lower than in the past relative to inflation. There are also fewer power cuts because a diverse energy mix means greater resilience to droughts. It was a very different story just 15 years ago. Back at the turn of the century oil accounted for 27% of Uruguay’s imports and a new pipeline was just about to begin supplying gas from Argentina. Now the biggest item on import balance sheet is wind turbines, which fill the country’s ports on their way to installation. Biomass and solar power have also been ramped up. Adding to existing hydropower, this means that renewables now account for 55% of the country’s overall energy mix (including transport fuel) compared with a global average share of 12%. Despite its relatively small population of just 3.4 million, Uruguay has earned a remarkable amount of global kudos in recent years. It enacted groundbreaking marijuana legalisation, pioneered stringent tobacco control, and introduced some of the most liberal policies in Latin America on abortion and same-sex marriage. Now, it is being recognised for progress on decarbonising its economy. It has been praised by the World Bank and the Economic commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, and the WWF last year named Uruguay among its “Green Energy Leaders”, proclaiming: “The country is defining global trends in renewable energy investment.” Cementing that reputation, Méndez – formerly the country’s national director of energy – has gone to this week’s UN talks with one of the world’s most ambitious national pledges: an 88% cut in carbon emissions by 2017 compared with the average for 2009-13. There are no technological miracles involved, nuclear power is entirely absent from the mix, and no new hydroelectric power has been added for more than two decades. Instead, he says, the key to success is rather dull but encouragingly replicable: clear decision-making, a supportive regulatory environment and a strong partnership between the public and private sector. As a result, energy investment – mostly for renewables, but also liquid gas – in Uruguay over the past five years has surged to $7bn, or 15% of the country’s annual GDP. That is five times the average in Latin America and three times the global share recommended by climate economist Nicholas Stern. “What we’ve learned is that renewables is just a financial business,” Méndez says. “The construction and maintenance costs are low, so as long as you give investors a secure environment, it is a very attractive.” The effects are apparent on Route 5 from Montevideo to the north. In less than 200 miles, you pass three agroindustrial plants running on biofuel and three windfarms. The biggest of them is the 115MW Peralta plant built and run by the German company, Enercon. Its huge turbines – each 108 metres tall – tower over grasslands full of cattle and rhea birds. Along with reliable wind – at an average of about 8mph – the main attraction for foreign investors like Enercon is a fixed price for 20 years that is guaranteed by the state utility. Because maintenance costs are low (just 10 staff) and stable, this guarantees a profit. As a result, foreign firms are lining up to secure windfarm contracts. The competition is pushing down bids, cutting electricity generating costs by more than 30% over the past three years. Christian Schaefer, supervising technician at Enercon said his company was hoping to expand and another German company Nordex is already building an even bigger plant further north along route five. Trucks carrying turbines, towers and blades are now a common sight on the country’s roads. Compared to most other small countries with high proportions of renewables, the mix is diverse. While Paraguay, Bhutan and Lesotho rely almost solely on hydro and Iceland on geothermal, Uruguay has a spread that makes it more resilient to changes in the climate. Windfarms such as Peralta now feed into hydropower plants so that dams can maintain their reservoirs longer after rainy seasons. According to Méndez, this has reduced vulnerability to drought by 70% – no small benefit considering a dry year used to cost the country nearly 2% of GDP. This is not the only benefit for the economy. “For three years we haven’t imported a single kilowatt hour,” Méndez says. “We used to be reliant on electricity imports from Argentina, but now we export to them. Last summer, we sold a third of our power generation to them.” There is still a lot to do. The transport sector still depends on oil (which accounts for 45% of the total energy mix). But industry – mostly agricultural processing – is now powered predominantly by biomass cogeneration plants. Méndez attributed Uruguay’s success to three key factors: credibility (a stable democracy that has never defaulted on its debts so it is attractive for long-term investments); helpful natural conditions (good wind, decent solar radiation and lots of biomass from agriculture); and strong public companies (which are a reliable partner for private firms and can work with the state to create an attractive operating environment). While not every country in the world can replicate this model, he said Uruguay had proved that renewables can reduce generation costs, can meet well over 90% of electricity demand without the back-up of coal or nuclear power plants, and the public and private sectors can work together effectively in this field. But, perhaps, the biggest lesson that Uruguay can provide to the delegates in Paris is the importance of strong decision-making. As has been the case at countless UN climate conferences, Uruguay was once paralysed by a seemingly endless and rancorous debate about energy policy. All that changed when the government finally agreed on a long-term plan that drew cross-party support. “We had to go through a crisis to reach this point. We spent 15 years in a bad place,” Méndez said. “But in 2008, we launched a long-term energy policy that covered everything … Finally we had clarity.” That new direction made possible the rapid transition that is now reaping rewards. Small nations, renewable giants Uruguay gets 94.5% of its electricity from renewables. In addition to old hydropower plants, a hefty investment in wind, biomass and solar in recent years has raised the share of these sources in the total energy mix to 55%, compared with a global average of 12%, and about 20% in Europe. Costa Rica went a record 94 consecutive days earlier this year without using fossil fuel for electricity, thanks to a mix of about 78% hydropower, 12% geothermal and 10% wind. The government has set a target of 100% renewable energy by 2021. But transport remains dirty. Iceland has the advantage of being a nation of volcanoes, which has allowed it to tap geothermal sources of 85% of its heating and – with the assistance of hydropower – 100% of its electricity. This has made it the world’s largest green energy producer per capita. Paraguay has one huge hydropower dam at Itaipu, which supplies 90% of the country’s electricity. Lesotho gets 100% of its electricity from a cascade of dams that have enough spare capacity to export power to South Africa. Bhutan’s abundant hydropower resources generate a surplus of electricity that accounts for more than 40% of the country’s export earnings. But over-reliance on one source can be a problem. In the dry season, it has to import power from India. • This article was amended on 4 December 2015.

Concerns have been stoked by the discovery of thousands of defects in the reactors’ pressure vessels, a fire, and one unresolved sabotage incident at the plants, which also border Luxembourg and the Netherlands. In December, the Doel 3 reactor on the Dutch border had to be turned off just one week after it was switched back on, following repairs that lasted 21 months, due to a water leaking on a (non-nuclear) generator. Two nearby cities, Maastricht in the Netherlands and Aachen in Germany, are said to be considering legal action to force plant safety – or closure, and on Tuesday the German environment minister waded into the row. Barbara Hendricks said that she would accept the nuclear status quo “for now”, after Jan Jambon, the Belgian interior minister, refused her request for a joint environmental risk assessment at a meeting in Brussels. But she immediately took to twitter to express German frustrations. “A transboundary assessment of the environmental impact should not only be mandatory when it comes to new builds of plants but also when the lifetime of aging nuclear power plants is being extended,” Hendricks tweeted. A German press statement spoke of “significant deviations” from required safety procedures at the Tihange 2 plant on the Dutch border, and Doel 3, which is also close to Germany and Luxembourg. Belgium depends on seven nuclear reactors for around 60% of its electricity, although it says it will phase these out by 2025. After the Fukushima accident in Japan, Germany began mothballing its entire nuclear fleet, but some of its citizens fear they could still be at risk from nuclear accidents across the border with Belgium. One of them, Simon Sybertz, a student in Aachen, said that fears among local people in the city were growing. “People are starting to realise whats happening across the border,” he said. “They’re scared because nobody is really prepared for something happening in Tihange. We don’t even have iodine. I want the Belgian government to shut the reactor.” More than 825,000 people have signed an Avaaz petition calling for the two reactors to be mothballed. German government sources say that Hendricks told Jambon that if Brussels was serious about shutting its reactors, it should start now. “We didn’t get the impression that the Belgians really have a plan to phase out nuclear within a fixed time schedule,” one source at Tuesday’s meeting told the Guardian. European nuclear industry groups insist that plant safety is a strictly national affair under EU law, and say that EU stress tests of three Belgian nuclear reactors after the Fukushima disaster – as well as Belgium’s more recent examinations of its reactors – should give confidence in plant safety. Jean-Pol Poncelet, the director general of Foratom, Europe’s nuclear trade association, said that Belgian reactors were “considered safe not just by the Belgian authorities but by their partners in the EU”. “It is amazing to see that there are complaints from the Netherlands,” he said. “The Dutch are operating a reactor in Borssele which is expected to run longer than the Belgian ones – they recently received permission to operate for up to 60 years!” The Dutch environment minister, Melanie Schultz van Haegen, recently declared her “certainty” that the plant was now safe. One international expert who has advised the Austrian government on reactors situated across its borders, told the guardian that there was no question of an imminent reactor failure in Belgium. Equally though, the analysis that Ilse Tweer conducted for the Green party found claims by the Belgian authorities that reactor defects were created over 30 years ago, probably at the time of manufacture, not credible because sonic tests had not discovered them at the time. The attendant risks now were very real, she argued: “In a loss of coolant accident, cold water has to be injected as an emergency safety measure for core cooling. This cold water will induce thermal stresses in the vessel wall because of the extreme contrast in temperature and could trigger an uncontrolled growth of cracks inside the vessel wall. “That has to be excluded as otherwise you could have a meltdown and there are no systems that could manage that.” • This article was amended on 3 February 2016 to clarify a quote from Jean-Pol Poncelet about the Borssele reactor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/may/29/hinkley-point-c-leave-hedgehogs-nuclear-debacle","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-29T08:00:01Z","webTitle":"Leave Hinkley to the hedgehogs.

They were evidence, she suggested, of the depth of commitment of French firm EDF to the £18bn nuclear power station due to be built on the site. Well, maybe. Talk of bats and hedgehogs at least provided some relief from the familiar crop of Hinkley news. French economy minister Emmanuel Macron said he was “fully behind” the project but EDF’s unions confirmed that they weren’t. Jean-Luc Magnaval, secretary of EDF’s workers’ committee, told the BBC that the unions “have reservations about several aspects of the project: organisation, supply chain, installation and procurement”. That’s a long list. Meanwhile, EDF Energy chief executive Vincent de Rivaz, appearing before the same committee as Leadsom, had to adopt a humbler tone than on his last outing two months ago. Then he had promised a final investment decision “very soon”; this time he wouldn’t speculate about a date. This farce – which has been running since last October, when the final sign-off was due within weeks – could yet roll on and on. The UK government is disinclined to set a deadline: it’s a “commercial decision” for EDF. Meanwhile, the current French government could have a radically different shape this time next year – there is a presidential election in 2017 and the incumbent, François Hollande, is the least popular leader in modern French history. French union opposition to Hinkley Point appears entrenched and the workers’ representatives have six seats on an 18-strong board. In theory, management and government can proceed regardless; but to embark on an £18bn venture with a divided boardroom would invite trouble down the line. That is especially so when you remember EDF’s last finance director, Thomas Piquemal, resigned over concerns that Hinkley could threaten the company’s future. The best thing the UK government could do at this point is to stop and consider whether the obstacles facing Hinkley are simply too big. Nervousness in France is understandable. EDF’s two current attempts to built a European pressurised reactor – the model to be used at Hinkley – are agonising; one is four years late, the other nine years. And the financial arithmetic was always challenging. Hinkley could take 10 years to build, and the owners receive nothing during the construction phase; the cash only arrives when electricity starts to be generated. And, while the returns on capital under the 35-year contract are theoretically enormous, the penalties for failure to hit a 2029 deadline are stinging, and ratchet up. That is why the UK government had to make the 35-year contract so generous – struck at almost three times today’s wholesale price. That contract now looks to belong to another era given the subsequent fall in the oil price, and thus energy costs. The only weak support holding Hinkley in place is its capacity to provide 7% of the UK’s electricity in a low-carbon fashion. But there are other ways to meet the legally binding emissions targets. Offshore wind is expanding with no Hinkley-style fuss, and its costs are falling. More importantly for the UK’s requirement for secure baseload supplies, other builders are waiting to pursue projects that use different nuclear technology. In theory, planning and appraisal can continue in parallel; in practice, confidence in the UK’s commitment to its new-nuclear programme will drain away. There is not – yet – a crisis in UK energy policy because it is always possible to build a few gas-fired stations to avert an emergency. But the Hinkley show is becoming an embarrassment. The project is expensive, uses unproven technology and its builder is a disunited and over-borrowed company that requires constant financial assurances from an ever-changing cast of politicians. The UK government should set EDF a deadline and be ready to enforce it. We can do better – much better – than Hinkley. Banking guru says Bank is too soft on banks When the architect of banking reform in the UK accuses the Bank of England of going soft on the sector, it is time to sit up and take notice. Sir John Vickers, who led the coalition government’s Independent Commission on Banking (ICB), made the assertion again last week when Threadneedle Street issued new guidelines on capital which concluded that the system (largely) had amassed enough capital. While no one appears to doubt that the banking system is stronger than it was before the 2008 crisis – the amount of capital held by banks globally has doubled since 2007 – Vickers believes that the Bank should be asking banks to hold even more. While the argument about systemic risk buffers is not easy to digest, it is worth taking a moment to think about it. Vickers argues that the Bank is being too lenient in adopting one of the ICB’s recommendations – about putting 3% of capital aside as a systemic risk buffer (think of it as a bit of extra insurance in case things go bad). The Bank says the buffer can be on a rising scale, depending on the size of the bank. On its current assessment no UK bank would need to hit the 3% level. It might be easy to decide that Vickers – now warden at All Soul’s College, Oxford – is making the point to protect his legacy. Indeed one of his fellow commission members – former Barclays boss Martin Taylor – last week insisted that the differences in capital requirements between the ICB and the Bank of England were “more or less invisible to the naked eye”. Taylor, it should be noted, is now a policymaker at the Bank. So, too, is chief economist Andy Haldane who, in seeming contrast, has welcomed what he describes as the “academic challenge” of prudential regulation. While easily dismissed as a topic for anoraks, this issue is simply too important to ignore. Just as well that Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, has decided to step in to referee. In April, Tyrie announced an inquiry into the matter. He should get on with it. M&amp;S needs to put clothes ahead of shareholders Marks &amp; Spencer’s share price is 13% lower than it was last weekend and its new chief executive finds his ambition to “cherish Mrs M&amp;S” derided as patronising waffle. Welcome to retailing’s top table, Steve Rowe: now you know how deep the national obsession with M&amp;S goes. You’re under the microscope. Rowe shouldn’t worry about the share price. His grand strategic plan is to sell clothes his customers actually want to wear, and at keener prices. Easier said than done, of course, but it’s the right priority. M&amp;S’s share price has been sustained for too long by the thin vapours of ever-rising profit margins. Now the website actually works, it’s time to address the loss of market share over many years, and never mind the immediate hit to profits. Shareholders will just have to be patient. But bin the “Mrs M&amp;S” lines. The 1970s language is one problem. The bigger drawback is that no one wants to be viewed as a caricature."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/oct/21/hinkley-point-nuclear-power-station-deal-announced-politics-live-blog","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-21T16:01:52Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point nuclear power station deal announced: Politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/21/hinkley-point-nuclear-power-station-deal-announced-politics-live-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/oct/21/hinkley-point-nuclear-power-station-deal-announced-politics-live-blog","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point nuclear power station deal announced: Politics live blog","bodyText":"• Ed Davey, the energy secretary, has dismissed claims that the coalition has broken its pledge not to give the nuclear industry a subsidy, saying nuclear is getting \"no special favours\". (See 2.53m.) He has also announced that the National Audit Office will be reviewing the deal to see whether it represents value for money for the taxpayer. (See 4.12pm.) • The three Police Federation officers criticised for their conduct after a meeting with Andrew Mitchell to discuss \"plebgate\" have issued a partial apology. They apologised for their \"poor judgment\" in talking to the media about the meeting. The IPCC and senior politicians have criticised them for giving a misleading account of what was said. In a joint statement, Ken MacKaill, an inspector from West Mercia Police, Stuart Hinton, a detective sergeant from Warwickshire Police, and Chris Jones, a sergeant from West Midlands Police, said they had decided to issue a statement \"in response to public concern generated by the widely reported outcome of West Mercia's investigation into matters arising from the meeting\". The reputation of, and public confidence in, the police service is of immense concern to each of us. We acknowledge the investigation's criticism relating to our poor judgement in talking to the media following the meeting with Andrew Mitchell, for which we take this opportunity to apologise. We would like to emphasise (as we did to the investigation) that in no way did any of us ever plan or intend to mislead anyone about what occurred during this meeting or otherwise. • The Commons standards committee has mounted an attempt to save MPs' dinner, hotel and taxi expenses amid fears they will be curbed in an unreasonable way by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa). • David Cameron has spoken by phone with fellow EU leaders to try to build support behind his drive to cut red tape from Brussels. As the Press Association reports, Cameron aims to use a summit of the European Council in Brussels this week to argue the case for sweeping away bureaucratic rules which he believes threaten economic growth. He today spoke with German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Francois Hollande to set out the findings of a business task force which last week warned the UK Cabinet that \"problematic, poorly-understood and burdensome European rules\" are slowing production, job creation, sales and innovation and left Europe trailing international trading rivals. The calls followed phone discussions over the weekend with European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso and on Friday with Italian PM Enrico Letta and Dutch PM Mark Rutte. • Labour has accused David Cameron of \"turning the clock back\" on racial equality as it launched a consultation on plans to boost the chances of people from ethnic minorities. As the Press Association reports, Labour is seeking ways to combat racism and improve the representation of people from black and minority ethnic (BAME) communities in public life. The measures could include changes to the law to allow police to increase the number of officers recruited from minority groups. The consultation, which forms part of Labour's policy review, said the rise in the English Defence League (EDL) and recent Islamophobic attacks showed \"how far we as a society have yet to travel in stamping out racism\". The document said: \"David Cameron's Government is turning the clock back on racial equality. As a non-white person, you are currently twice as likely to be unemployed as a white person in the UK, and progress on ethnic minority representation in the police has stalled. That's all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Ed Davey's Commons statement is now over. I'll post a summary shortly. Ben Gummer, a Conservative, asks if EDF will go ahead with the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power station. Davey says EDF has been focusing on Hinkley Point. Once the Hinkley Point deal is finalised, it may be able to focus more on the Sizewell C opportunity. It might be able to come up with a proposal a bit more quickly because of the work already done on Hinkley Point, he says. But a decision on Sizewell C is not expected until \"towards the end of this decade\", he says. A Labour MP asks how Davey can know what the clean-up costs will be when a site for the long-term disposal of nuclear waste has not even been identified yet. Davey says EDF will have to set money aside from day one. The plant will last for 60 years, and so, because the money adds up over time, the annual costs can be kept low. It's like a pension fund, he says. If you start early, it is cheaper. Phillip Lee, a Conservative, says he has some national security concerns about the Chinese being involved in our nuclear power stations. Would a British firm be allowed to run a Chinese nuclear power station? Davey says George Osborne has signed a deal with the Chinese to open up their markets to the British. Mike Weatherley, a Conservative, says he has \"grave concerns\" about today's announcement, particularly because of the cost of decommissioning nuclear power stations. Davey says what is different about this deal is that it requires EDF to set money aside for clean-up costs. Labour's Meg Hillier asks Davey if he is still telling her constituents to put a jumper on if they get cold at home. Davey says Hiller demeans herself because he did not say that on Newsnight. (Davey has a point. The BBC's Chris Mason wrote a good piece explaining how Davey was misrepresented.) Sir Tony Baldry, a Conservative, asks Davey to confirm that the Hinkley Point C strike price is lower than for offshore or onshore win. Davey says he is right about offshore wind. But the price on onshore wind is coming down, and becoming competitive, he says. Gerald Howarth, a Conservative, says he welcomes Davey's conversion to nuclear power. Davey says he hopes that Howarth and other Conservatives will recognise why Davey changed his mind. It was because of the threat from climate change, he says. I've found the NAO's Hinkley Point C statement. Here it is. Hinkley Point C is due to be the first nuclear power plant built in the United Kingdom since Sizewell B, which was completed in 1995. The UK government has agreed the key commercial terms for a deal with EDF Group, the project promoters, including the price that it will receive for the power generated by the plant over 35 years from the date of its commissioning, known as the “strike price”. The proposed contract will be subject to State Aid approval, Royal Assent for the Energy Bill and agreement on financing. It is not the NAO’s role to question the merits of the Government’s policy objectives or to be part of the government’s executive decision-making in regard to the proposed contract. Our work will cover the Department’s commercial approach to securing this deal and the proposed terms of the contract, to report to Parliament on value for money and the resulting risks which the Department must manage. We will also wish to identify lessons learned to inform decisions on future contracts for difference. Ed Davey says the Lib Dems changed their stance on nuclear power at their conference in Glasgow. They agreed to support it in some circumstances for the same reason he did personally, he says; the need to hit decarbonisation targets made nuclear power more attractive than in the past. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, asks if Davey will agree to full examination of the terms by the National Audit Office. And can Davey confirm that, if waste disposal costs rise above what was expected, the taxpayer will have to foot the bill. Davey says the NAO has put out a press release today saying it will be looking at this contract. And the taxpayer is paying for nuclear waste disposal. It is paying to dispose of the nuclear waste generated under Labour. This contract is different because, for the first time, it obliges a producer to pay the clean-up costs, he says. (I can't find that news release on the NAO website yet.) Adrian Bailey , the Labour MP, asks what is being do to maximise the potential of the project to create jopbs for British firms. Davey says 57% of the jobs will go to British firms. The government would have liked that figure to be higher. But Britain's nuclear capacity was run down under Labour, he suggests. Ian Liddell-Grainger, the Conservative MP whose constituency covers Hinkley Point, says this is a very good day for British industry. Davey is responding to Greatrix. He says many people expected the government to agree a strike price of £100 per megawatt hour, or £95. But the government did much better than that, he says. It got it below £90. On community benefit, he says the government is due to respond to a select committee that has made recommendations on this. But EDF has already said that £100m a year will go into the local community while construction is taking place, he says. He says Greatrix tried to use today's announcement to justify Labour's \"price fix con\". Greatrix should know that, even if part of costs are fixed, the other part of costs are variable. Firms need to be allowed to vary prices to avoid going bust. It is worrying that Labour do not understand this. Labour's Tom Greatrex is replying for the opposition. He says Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary, is not here because severe power shortages have held up the trains from her Don Valley constituency. How was the strike price arrived at? If there are any changes to the contract, will parliament get a vote? Is Davey satisfied that arrangements are in hand to store nuclear waste from Hinkley Point C? Will the community benefit rules be changed so the local community benefits while the new power station is being built, not just when it is running? Greatrex also asks Davey to accept that, if the government can agree an energy price for 35 years, Labour was entitled to propose a price freeze for 20 months. Davey says he respects people who opposed nuclear power on principle. He had concerns on this front himself, he says, as did his party. But now he is satisfied that the safety and legacy issues (ie, what do to with nuclear waste) are \"manageable\". Davey says Hinkley Point C will be the first nuclear power station built under the \"contracts for difference (CfDs)\" scheme set in place by the energy bill. CfDs offer low-carbon providers predictable future revenues, he says. The Hinkley Point CfD would last for 35 years. That is 60% of the 60-year operating life of the plant, he says. That is proportionally similar to the CfDs offered for other renewable technologies. Under CfD, energy producers are guaranteed a minimum price. This is the \"strike price\". (This CfD framework is what Davey was referring to when he told the press conference that Britain's electricity reforms were \"incredibly radical\" - see 2.53pm.) Ed Davey is making his statement now. If you've been following this blog all day, you will probably have a clear idea of what he has been saying about this already. I'll just report anything new. The real interest in this session will lie in what backbenchers have to say. Ed Davey has addressed the broadcasters, and he's hosted a press conference. Now he is about to tell parliament about Hinkley Point C. (MPs won't like that. They are quite attached to the idea that the House of Commons should hear these things first.) The SNP government in Scotland is opposed to the idea of building new nuclear power stations and can block them being built north of the border. This is from Fergus Ewing, Scotland's energy minister. This UK Government's misguided enthusiasm for nuclear comes at a time when other countries, such as Germany and EDF's home nation France, are either eliminating or scaling back their dependence on nuclear generation and when we should be putting the support to our renewables energy industry and the jobs it will support across the country. The guarantee of support and subsidy under this contract [Hinkley Point C] until after the middle of this century also sits in sharp contrast with the lack of a UK Government commitment to support our offshore renewables sector and its potential beyond 2020. The Scottish Government has an ambitious but achievable target to generate the equivalent of 100% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020, alongside generation from thermal sources fitted with carbon capture and storage. Nuclear energy cannot be relied on for our energy needs. The output from Scottish nuclear generation fell to historic lows in 2006 and 2007 due to unplanned outages. Although output has increased since then, nuclear generation has not yet recovered to its pre-2006 levels. This underlines the susceptibility of nuclear to sudden interruptions, and supports the Scottish Government's drive towards a balanced energy portfolio, based on cleaner thermal generation and the advantages which our huge renewables potential offers to Scotland. Here are the main points from Ed Davey's news conference with EDF. • Davey dismissed claims that the coalition has broken its pledge not to give the nuclear industry a subsidy (see 12.46pm), saying nuclear was getting \"no special favours\". Our policy is that we won't provide public subsidy for new nuclear unless similar support is provided to other suppliers of low-carbon generation. And this deal delivers on that policy. New nuclear is getting no special favours. (Actually Davey seems to have redefined the coalition agreement. It suggested the government would only support new nuclear power stations provided they received \"no public subsidy\", not that they received no subsidy not available to other suppliers of low carbon energy.) • He said the government would insist on a lower \"strike price\" when negotiating with EDF over the proposed Sizewell C nuclear plant. • He insisted that Britain's energy policies were \"incredibly radical\". That was because the government was using market mechanisms (like the \"strike price\") to promote low-carbon energy production, he suggested. Britain's electricity market reforms are incredibly radical. We are building the world's first ever low-carbon electricity market, so we can meet our energy sercurity needs, meet our decarbonisation needs, at the lowest cost. And that enables us to face those uncertainties with a lot more confidence than, I think, almost any other country in the world., • He accused the last Labour government of being unwilling to take the \"tough\" decisions need to guarantee the energy supply. In this country we are facing a looming energy crisis in the next decade through years of neglect and under-investment. Today 40% of our electricity comes from coal, 20% comes from old nuclear, and much of that is due to come offline in the next decade. We have known for years this was coming, but no one was willing to make the tough decisions about how to deal with it. Well, this government has changed that. • Vincent de Rivaz, the EDF chief executive, said the firm had not yet taken a decision on whether raise it energy prices for British customers but any rise would be \"at the lowest possible level\". While the press conference was going on, DECC put out a statement from Ed Davey about the npower price increase. This is another disappointing announcement from a big energy company. Some of the Big 6 seem not to have noticed that they are no longer alone in the market – there are now 15 small suppliers, and some really competitive fixed deals out there. Today I’m publishing hard figures on the costs energy companies really face in delivering the Energy Company Obligation (ECO), so consumers can see what this scheme is really costing energy companies. These figures – supplied by the energy companies themselves – show that the costs are in line with previous schemes so there should be no need for any increase to consumer bills due to ECO. The ECO is a scheme launched this year funding energy savings measures for poor households. Here is the five-page DECC paper about ECO costs (pdf). It says the figures suggest that \"customers pay an average of around £50 per annum to fund ECO.\". But DECC says that this is \"broadly in line\" with what customers had to pay to fund the predecessor schemes and that this means ECO is not to blame for bills going up. The press conference is now over. Here are some more snippets that Fiona Harvey has sent me. Think of them as email tweets. Apparently her Twitter was not working. EDF and govt seem to disagree on how many homes can be powered by HPC - 5m says EDF, 6m says DECC. Both agree won't be will 2023. Did Henri Proglio really call UK energy policy \"tragic\"? Extraordinary from head of French state owned co! 57pc of value of contracts to UK - that's a max, VdeR makes clear. So that's as far as UK industry can hope to benefit. Lord Deben[aka John Gummer, chair of the committee on climate change] namechecked by VdeR. Says played key role. That sounds interesting. More from Davey on gas - says could go up a lot, or \"an awful lot\". Clear blue water between him and Tory partners over gas? Davey has said nuke will not get special treatment under subsidy. It will be a low carbon subsidy. Is this admission that this is a subsidy? Combative question on bill increases batted away by VdeR who says now is \"not the moment\". Understandable as they need to get the strike price out. But with Npower announcing 10pc increase today, the \"moment\" for EDF to unveil its increase must come soon. The final question is about prices. Vincent de Rivaz says he does not want to talk about energy bills today. No decision has been taken yet about whether EDF is going to put up its prices. If it does decide to do that, the firm will come back to explain why, he says. Q: [To Davey] If a future government changes its mind, how will EDF be compensated. Will the loss of future profits be included? Davey says the government should not over-compensate. But it should offer EDF a fair deal. He thinks they have got a fair agreement. The full contract has not been published yet. When full details are revealed, people will be able to see what is proposed. Q: How confident are you this will get state aid clearance from the EU? Davey says so far discussions have gone well with the European Commission. But you can never pre-judge these things, he says. Q: How confident are you that you can deliver this on time and on budget, particularly given previous problems with the EPR model? Henri Proglio, the EDF chairman, says EDF is confident about the EPR model. Q: How can you be confident that this will save customers £77? Davey says he cannot guarantee that. There are \"huge amounts of uncertainty\" here. The energy world if full of uncertainties. What will happen to the cost of gas or off-shore wind? Will carbon capture and storage work? But the government must make allowance for these uncertainties. Britain's electricity market reforms are \"incredibly radical\", he says. Britain is building the world's first low-carbon energy market. Davey said that if a future government wants to cancel Hinkley Point C, it will have to pay a penalty to EDF. Fiona Harvey points out to me that that could be seen as locking a future government in to high prices. Q: What do you expect to happen to gas prices by 2023? Davey says DECC has a variety of forecasts. To meet the government's decarbonisation target, this is a good approach. Q: Will the same strike price apply to Sizewell C? Davey says the Sizewell C negotiations are not identical. The government will be looking for an even lower strike price for that deal, he says. Q: What are the penalties if EDF does not complete the plant by 2023? Davey says the penalty is that EDF won't get any money. It does not recoup money on its investment until it starts producing energy, he says. Fiona Harvey has sent me this from the press conference room. Room packed with French cameramen. Key facts EDF eager to impress on us before conference starts: 2 new reactor will supply 7pc of UK electricity. Will operate for 60 years. Just over half - 57pc - of construction work \"could\" be supplied in the UK. This is the muckshifting that EDF's head of procurement told the Guardian about last week. Crucially, these are not the high value jobs - the phrase \"muckshifting\" says everything about how EDF and its Chinese partners view the value of the UK's contribution to this project. But it will be UK energy bill payers who fund the whole thing, and pay for the waste after.EDF expects to make a 10pc return on its investment - handsome profits, in this age of austerity. Q: [To Davey] You are supposed to be keeping energy bills down. But you have just committed to paying double the market price to EDF. Won't that lower us into higher prices. Davey says the cost of Hinkley Point C won't touch customer bills until 2023. By 2023 we will be in a different world, he says. If Britain was just relying then on gas, that really would be risky. Wholesale gas prices have gone up by 50% in recent years, he says. By 2030 the average consumer bill will be £77 lower than it would have been without nuclear if this goes ahead, he says. Q: German prices have come down in recent months. Are we locked in to higher prices? Davey says Germany has far more renewables. In the UK, when the coalition came to power, only Malta and Luxembourg in the EU were producing less energy from renewables. Over the last three years the amount of power generated by renewables has doubled. Eventually renewables should lead to prices coming down, he says. Henri Proglio, the EDF chairman, says Germany has offered the renewable energy huge subsidies. So the taxpayer is paying for this, he says. Q: Can you say more about the role of the Chinese? Proglio says EDF has been in partnership with the Chinese for 30 years. It is a positive partnership, he says. The Chinese are happy to come on board because of the quality of the project. But EDF will have global control, he says. Now it's time for questions. Q: [To Davey] Should EDF avoid price rises? Davey says he did speak about this with de Rivaz this morning. But de Rivaz (or \"Vincent\" as Davey calls him) would not tell him what EDF was going to do about their prices. He says EDF has to compete with five other big suppliers. De Rivaz says EDF is \"very conscious indeed\" of the impact of price rises on customers. He will not comment on what his competitors have done. And he will not comment on what EDF will do. Today is is focusing on the future. Providing more certainty for the future will stop bills going \"up and up\", he says. In the long run this project, and others, will bring stability and certainty. Customers will not start paying for Hinkley Point until 2023, when the first energy from the power station is produced. Q: What is the construction value to the UK? You says up to 57% of the jobs could go to the UK? What is the bottom estimate? Davey says getting 57% of the jobs going to the UK was an important part of the negotiation. De Rivaz will explain more. Q: Experts say the costs are unexplored, and one told the Guardian that Britain would now be at the forefront of discovering the costs of these new ventures. Why is that, given that Osborne said he did not want the UK to be ahead of other countries on green measures? Davey says there is some certainty about costs. If there is a cost over-run, EDF will pay, he says. Vincent de Rivaz, the EDF Energy chief executive, says today is a historic day. EDF is the largest provider of electricity in the UK, he says. This deal is \"fair and balanced\" for EDF, for the UK and for customers. It will help the UK have affordable low-carbon electricity, at a price affordable to customers. He says today's announcement will kick-start the renaissance of the nuclear construction industry in the UK. He thanks government officials for the \"fair process\" they have observed during the negotiations. And he thanks George Osborne for making this project viable. And he thanks Lord Deighton, the infrastructure minister, who was also involved in the negotiations. Being part of EDF is a privilege, he says. It allows its staff to participate in this \"adventure\". Henri Proglio, the EDF chairman, is speaking now. He pays tribute to the government for its work on the deal. Davey confirms the strike price. A gain-share agreement has been struck, which means if EDF achieves savings, they will be shared with the taxpayer, he says. He says he wants to deal with some key issues. First, public subsidy. The government will not provide nuclear with a subsidy unless that is available to other energy providers. That is the case here, he says. New nuclear is getting \"no special favours\". Second, the deal allows EDF to make a \"fair\" profit, he says. The strike price is competitive with renewables. Davey says today's agreement is not legally binding. It is dependent on getting state aid agreement from the EU. Ed Davey, the energy secretary, is speaking now. He says for years it was known that the old nuclear power stations would have to be replaced. But previous governments did not have the courage to face up to this, he says. When the new power station is up and running, it will provide enough energy for 6m homes. That is 7% of the country's energy needs, he says. And energy bills will be 11% lower than by 2030 than they would have been if the nuclear plant had not gone ahead. Stephen Lovegrove, the DECC permanent secretary, is opening the press conference. He says he led the negotiations with EDF. A new generation of nuclear power stations will produce safe, affordable energy, he says. The decision to build two new reactors is the biggest nuclear project the country has seen, he says. The press conference is starting now. While we wait, here's what the coalition agreement (pdf) actually says about subsidies for nuclear energy. Liberal Democrats have long opposed any new nuclear construction. Conservatives, by contrast, are committed to allowing the replacement of existing nuclear power stations provided that they are subject to the normal planning process for major projects (under a new National Planning Statement), and also provided that they receive no public subsidy. I suppose this makes this a rare example of a double U-turn: the Lib Dems going back on their opposition to new nuclear power stations and the Tories going back on their insistence that any new power stations should not receive a public subsidy. We're still waiting for the press conference to start. I'm monitoring it on the live feed. My colleague Fiona Harvey is there in person. Still waiting for presser to start. Big question - did Ed Davey come from Somerset this morning by enviro very unsound helicopter? Ed Davey is about to start his press conference on Hinkley Point C. I will be covering it live. You can watch a live stream here. • David Cameron has hailed the UK government agreement with French-owned EDF to build the first new British nuclear power station in 20 years, saying it was a very big day for Britain and would kickstart a new generation of nuclear power in the UK. As Patrick Wintour reports, Ed Davey, the energy secretary, claimed it was a great deal for consumers and would result in energy bills falling by more than £75 by 2030. He added: \"If we don't make these essential investments … we're going to see the lights going out.\" • Critics have condemned the deal as a waste of money, and a breach of the pledge in the coalition agreement not to support the nuclear industry with a public subsidy. Ed Davey, the energy secretary, said the deal, including the \"strike price\" guaranteeing EDF nearly twice the market price for energy generated by the new nuclear power plant, was \"really good value\" for the taxpayer. (See 10.06am.) At the Number 10 lobby briefing the prime minister's spokesman refused to deny that the \"strike price\" amounted to a subsidy. This is what he said when asked if the \"strike price\" was a subsidy. What we have today is an agreement which means that for the first time in a generation we have a new nuclear power station going ahead in this country. One of the reasons why we don't have a broad enough energy mix right now is because over the previous generation, the prime minister's view is that governments haven't been able to take the right decisions that unlocked important investment decisions. The Green party have renewed their call for a National Audit Office investigation into the deal. (See 11am.) • Npower has become the latest major supplier to announce inflation-busting price hikes. As Angela Monaghan reports, it said it would increase prices by an average of 10.4% from 1 December, adding £137 to the average annual dual fuel bill. Ed Miliband said this reinforced the case for the energy bill price freeze that he is proposing. What’s clear is that the reason prices are going up is because you’ve got a broken market and you’ve got companies that are overcharging people, and it’s 10% rises again today. That’s why we need to take action; that’s why we need Labour’s price freeze, and to reform a broken market that is in the grip of the ‘big six’ energy companies. And week after week, we’re seeing company after company putting their prices up, and we’ve got a Prime Minister standing by. That’s why we need action. • Number 10 has said it will not be changing its policy on free schools in the light of the comments made by Nick Clegg at the weekend. Here's Ed Miliband on the Hinkley Point announcement. We’ll scrutinise these proposals, but we’re in the ridiculous position today where we’ve got the prime minister who says that he can fix prices 35 years ahead for the energy companies, but he can’t freeze prices now for the consumer, and no wonder we’ve got a cost of living crisis in this country. And here is some of the most interesting Twitter comment I've seen on the Hinkley Point announcement. From Matthew Pencharz, Boris Johnson's environment adviser From Andrew Cooper, a Green councillor From the New Statesman's George Eaton From the author Michael Rosen From the BBC's James Landale From the journalist Christian Wolmar From Conservative MP Mark Pritchard From PoliticsHome's Paul Waugh From the BBC's Andrew Neil David Cameron has been visiting Hinkley Point this morning. It seems the prime minister's spokesman chose his words carefully when discussing Hinkley Point C at the lobby briefing this morning. Ukip has put out a statement welcoming the fact that the government has taken a decision about Britain's \"much-needed nuclear capacity\", but criticising the detail of what is proposed. This is from Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader. With new technology coming on stream this approach looks like a dangerous gamble. As the small print says, prices can always go down as well as up. The government's decision to commit to £92.50 per megawatt hour may prove to be a great folly, especially if we as a country get serious about fracking and the massive potential of cheap shale gas. And this is from Roger Helmer, Ukip's energy spokesman. I am deeply concerned that this new proposal risks privatising the profits into the hands of the foreign EDF Energy, whilst socialising the risks for taxpayers. I am also wary that this deal could be an accounting trick designed to keep billions of state subsidy off the UK's deficit figures. It is a huge indictment of all three of the old parties that they chose to squander the UK’s clear lead in nuclear energy, so that we now have to go cap-in-hand to the French and the Chinese for help. And here is some reaction from two of the main unions representing the workers who will be building the new Hinkley Point C plant. From Kevin Coyne, Unite's national officer. At last the government has provided the stability and certainty the UK needs to begin to meet the huge energy challenge facing us. Nuclear power is a key part of a balanced, low-carbon energy policy. The go-ahead at Hinkley Point will deliver thousands of skilled jobs in construction, manufacturing and the operation of the power station. The deal will hopefully pave the way for more power stations which will in turn generate more skilled jobs. From Gary Smith, the GMB's national secretary for energy On the “strike price”, EDF seem to have sought a reasonable deal. It appears they haven't sought to drive home the advantage they had in the negotiations over the “strike price”. Because we have an energy policy that is in tatters this has left the UK government in a very weak bargaining position. All George Osborne's noise about shale gas now looks like bluff and bluster. The government wanted to try and pretend they had an alternative to new nuclear. The truth is there isn't a credible alternative. Anybody with any sense could see the government were bluffing. Damian Carrington, the Guardian's head of environment, has delivered his verdict on the Hinkley Point deal. He says the government's decision is a terrible one. Here's an extract from his blog. EDF and the government say the deal protects the public against the near-certainty of broken promises on costs. But read the small print: \"The strike price could be adjusted, upwards or downwards, in relation to operational and certain other costs.\" Perhaps the government could bail out of the deal if the costs soared? No: \"Hinkley Point C would be protected from being curtailed without appropriate compensation.\" If new risks came to light increasing the cost of insurance, could we get out then? No: \"Protection would be provided for any increases in nuclear insurance costs as a result of withdrawal of government cover.\" No wonder opponents are terrified by the lack of any independent scrutiny of the deal the government has signed. The nuclear industry has captured the government as comprehensively as the big six energy companies have captured the domestic energy market. Don't forget that just 48 hours after the Fukushima catastrophe, government officials were working with the industry to play down the terrible events - before they had even unfolded. The alternative to nuclear, made to appear unthinkable by the industry's lobbying, is in fact far from inconceivable. A huge effort to improve the UK's woeful energy efficiency is the first step. The UK government currently expects electricity demand to rise by 33-66% by 2050. Why? Germany predicts a 25% cut. That's how to seriously cut energy bills and the carbon emissions driving climate change: by not having to generate power in the first place. It also happens to create thousands of jobs in every part of the UK, unlike the government's failing green deal energy efficiency programme, which is actually killing jobs. And here is some reaction from organisations representing consumers/taxpayers. (I'm not sure that Which? and the TaxPayers' Alliance would be happy about being compared to each other, but never mind ...) From Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which? Rising energy bills are one of the top concerns for cash-strapped consumers, so everyone will want to be assured that the price the Government has agreed for new nuclear power is fair. The Hinkley deal commits billions of pounds of billpayers' money but it has been done without transparent, independent scrutiny. If it emerges that the government has overpaid, we believe there should be a mechanism to refund consumers instead of a windfall to the suppliers. We can't afford to continue with a situation where suppliers and ministers blame each other for energy price rises. We now need an independent expert review, that reports to Parliament, of all energy policy costs, with an assessment of whether consumers are getting value for money and where savings can be made. The National Audit Office should also be responsible for ongoing reviews so that ministers' decisions are held to account and consumers can have more confidence that their money is being spent wisely. From Jonathan Isaby, political director of the TaxPayers' Alliance Subsidies to guarantee investment in nuclear power will be paid for by households through higher energy bills, at a time when throwing money at uneconomic forms of renewable energy has already pushed bills to breaking point. The Treasury's financial guarantee creates the danger of taxpayers bailing out French state-owned EDF if something goes wrong with the deal. Ministers should instead focus on more affordable forms of power generation available today, rather than guaranteeing profits for energy firms and leaving families to pay the price. And here is some reaction from environmentalists From Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP. She wants the National Audit Office to investigate the deal. This is a terrible deal for billpayers. At a time when the costs of renewable energy are rapidly falling, this amounts to a ridiculously generous subsidy for the nuclear industry. Another key coalition agreement is being broken. There remain serious safety concerns about nuclear, and no safe, reliable solution for dealing with the toxic waste it creates. The Public Accounts Committee has already said that we are accumulating hazardous nuclear waste in outdated facilities which will cost nearly tens of billions to clean up. And on top of the possible costs of waste disposal, there could be a whole range of other costs to billpayers and taxpayers in future. Overseas investors will make massive profits from this deal, paid for by British billpayers. This deal will further increase the distance between those who profit from nuclear and those who pay for it. Instead of locking Britain into this costly and risky technology, the Government should be investing in energy efficiency and renewables, the costs of which are rapidly decreasing. The Government is giving the nuclear industry a guaranteed price for 35 years, but offshore wind could potentially be the UK’s cheapest power source within the next 15. From John Sauven, UK executive director of Greenpeace Hinkley C fails every test - economic, consumer, and environmental. It will lock a generation of consumers into higher energy bills via a strike price that's nearly double the current price of electricity, and it will distort energy policy by displacing newer, cleaner, technologies that are dropping dramatically in price. With companies like Dong Energy now saying the price of offshore wind will drop so much it will be on par with nuclear by the 2020s, there is little rationale for allowing Hinkley C to proceed. Giving it the green light when there is no credible plan for dealing with the waste is also unacceptable. David Cameron has said himself that, until the waste issue is sorted, no new investment is possible. This is yet another government U-turn which is creating uncertainty for investment in both energy efficiency and renewable energy, which, despite recent headlines, remain the best long-term solution for the consumer, energy security and tackling climate change. From Nick Molho, head of climate and energy policy at WWF-UK Now that the government has agreed a deal to support to EDF’s proposed new plant at Hinkley, it is essential that clear mechanisms are in place to prevent any future cost overruns from having an impact on the funding available to other low-carbon technologies such as renewables. This will be key to protect investment certainty for such technologies where there is significant potential to reduce costs, and to support economic growth in the UK without the environmental concerns associated with nuclear power, most notably the absence of a long-term geological storage solution for high level radioactive waste. (Do read this for more on how the government is trying to address the problem of finding a long-term solution to storing nuclear waste.) From the Guardian's George Monbiot Is Ed Davey right to say that Hinkley Point, and the \"strike price\" guaranteeing EDF nearly twice the market price for energy generated by the new nuclear power plant, is good value for consumers? (See 10.06am.) My colleague Karl Mathiesen is doing an investigation at the Eco Audit blog. Do help him out if you can. And here's reaction to the announcement from the business community. Predictably, they like it. From John Cridland, director general of the CBI This is a landmark deal which will help us meet our future energy challenges, while boosting jobs and growth. New nuclear plants must be a fundamental feature of our future energy landscape, and Hinkley Point C is the starter gun to securing the investment we need. Amid understandable public concern about rising bills, it's important to remember this investment will help mitigate the impact of increasing costs. From John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce After months of uncertainty, British business will be pleased that negotiations for the UK's first new nuclear power plant in decades have been successfully concluded. Nuclear power is a critical part of the UK's future energy infrastructure mix, and will help ensure our businesses have access to secure sources of energy in the years ahead. Businesses in Somerset and beyond will be a vital part of the supply chain opportunities on offer. From Energy UK, the group that represents energy companies It is good news for the UK and British customers that new nuclear is going ahead. There is a clear need to build new power stations and nuclear represents clean, reliable energy and jobs both during the build and while the plant is running. The energy industry is well aware that it has a lot to do in the coming years so customers know it is working for them. This means keeping bills down by insulating our homes better so we use less energy and keep warmer. Companies are committed to being straightforward and open when prices have to go up so customers know the reasons why. It also needs to be easier for new energy companies to enter the market so people feel there is a better choice. Building new power stations is never quick or cheap, but in the case of Hinkley development, nothing goes on the bill until 2020. From Tony Ward, head of power and utilities at consultants Ernst &amp; Young Today's announcement marks a huge step towards delivering a balanced, lower carbon, energy mix for future generations of UK energy users. The UK is now materially closer to being able to deliver its first new nuclear station in 25 years. This investment will have a lasting positive impact on the UK's energy independence, its economy, the local communities and the UK's low carbon aspirations. Agreement on the price and duration of the CfD contract is one of the most significant enablers to unlock positive investment decisions, not just from EDF at their Hinkley site, but other potential co-investors, and subsequently from other developers, such as Horizon and NuGen. Whilst not the final piece of the jigsaw, this is undoubtedly one of the most significant. With as many as 20,000 people working at the power station site over the course of its construction, and electricity supplies secured for 2.5 million homes, new nuclear projects such as this one are vital in terms of meeting the £200bn of investment needed in the sector to secure our energy future. Looking forward, a significant construction programme of new nuclear stations in the UK could boost GDP by up to 0.34% a year and nuclear exports from £700m up to £1.6bn. From Scot Parkhurst, UK energy sector director at consultants WSP Finally we have certainty that this important project will go ahead, safeguarding the specialist skills across the construction sector that have been sitting dormant for too long. Deep-rooted uncertainty in the industry, largely due to the dawdling Energy Market Reforms, have delayed construction to the extent that generating capacity is only just meeting energy demand [as highlighted in Ofgem's recent electricity capacity assessment]. On top of that, our spare capacity is set to fall to 4% over the next three years so if we see above average winter demand or reduced electricity imports from the EU then there could be no spare capacity at all in 2015 and 2016. It’s a very worrying situation for our energy security. Labour supports nuclear energy. In an article for LabourList Caroline Flint, the shadow energy secretary, says that, while the party reserves the right to scrutinise the detail of the deal, nuclear power is \"an important part of a cleaner, more secure and more affordable energy mix for the future\". More interestingly, she says that the government's decision to fix a long-term deal over the \"strike price\" with EDF puts the row about Ed Miliband's proposed 20-month energy bill freeze in perspective. [The deal] shows that all the scaremongering about Labour’s energy price freeze was wrong. As we argued, what investors need is not short-term gains based on overcharging, but long-term certainty about the returns on their investment – whether that’s a wind farm, a gas-fired power station or, in this case, a nuclear power station. That is why Labour has supported the Energy Bill which, through a mechanism known as Contracts for Difference, essentially guarantees investors a fixed rate of return on investments in low-carbon energy. Ed Davey, the energy secretary, has been giving interviews this morning about the Hinkley Point C announcement. Here are the main points he's been making. • Davey said the deal, including the \"strike price\" guaranteeing EDF nearly twice the market price for energy generated by the new nuclear power plant, was \"really good value\" for the taxpayer. Eventually customers would be saving £77 a year because of the nuclear programme, he said. It is going to be really good value for money, because by the time you get to 2023 when it starts generating, in 10 years' time, we are going to live in a very different world for electricity and energy generally ... We calculate that by the end of the next decade, by 2030, this will actually be saving consumers money. We think the average consumer will be saving £77 a year on their bill thanks to the new nuclear programme that we are putting forward. • He said the impact of the \"strike price\" would not be felt for another decade. \"It won't touch consumer bills, it won't touch industries' bills, 'til 10 years' time,\" he said. • He said Britain needed to invest in nuclear power because existing power stations were going to close and it was unwise just to rely on gas. The challenge we have got as a country is we have got to replace about two-thirds of electricity generating capacity in the next 15 years. We have got a huge gap and the question is if we just rely on gas we'll see prices going through the roof. Rising gas prices have been the cause of people's rising energy bills at the moment so I'm not prepared to gamble on future energy prices by risking it ... I’m not going to put all Britain’s eggs in one basket – we need to be much more cautious than that, and much more responsible with the future of Britain’s energy supplies. • He said he expected the \"vast majority\" of workers employed building the site to be British. We do think this is a very good deal for UK industry, not least because 57% of the value of the project is going to go UK firms ... Let’s be clear: 57% of this project is going to go to British firms and British workers. There will be tens of thousands of jobs here – during the construction, at the peak, 5,600 jobs. So this is a real boost for the British economy and British companies will get a big share of that. On Twitter Andrew Neil posted this qualification. • Davey said a foreign firm needed to be involved because Britain did not have the expertise to build a new power station. The problem is in recent years we haven’t been involved in building new nuclear power stations, there’s not a British company with a reactor design, so we are working with the French. • But he said the deal was intended to revive Britain's nuclear industry. We wanted to make sure that this deal helps us rebuild Britain’s nuclear industry. We’ve got a nuclear industry industrial strategy that I agreed with Vince Cable recently to make sure that we rebuild and regain the skills that we’ve lost in recent decades. We’ve got a nuclear skills academy, for example, to make sure we bring on the young people. We’ve got to make sure that in our universities we’ve got the skills and the expertise so that in future deals it will be a British nuclear reactor design, not a French nuclear reactor design. • He said the government was developing a plan for the long-term storage of nuclear waste. The last government developed a plan and we’ve taken it on to build on a geological disposal facility, a special place for storing nuclear waste. We’ve got huge amounts of waste that has accumulated over the last 50 or more years from the nuclear power stations we’ve had in this country for many, many years ... There will be some taxpayers’ money to pay for the nuclear waste of the past, but one of the good things about this deal is we’ve learnt from the mistakes of the past; we’re making sure that EDF have to pay the decommissioning costs and their share of the waste management cost upfront, that’s in the price. Past generations failed to do that and that’s why two-thirds of my budget today, my department’s budget, several billion pounds is going on decommissioning old nuclear power stations built many years ago. • He said the project was \"very popular\" with people living near Hinkley Point. \"People have been wanting us to take this decision for a long time because they see the economic benefits of it,\" he said. I've taken the quotes from the Press Association and from PoliticsHome. Another energy company has announced that it is putting up its prices. The Press Association has snapped this. Energy firm npower said today that electricity prices will rise by 9.3% and gas prices by 11.1% from December 1. And here's the EDF news release about the announcement. DECC has also produced these two infographics about HPC (Hinkley Point C). David Cameron has put out this statement about the Hinkley Point C (HPC) deal. Earlier this month I spoke about our new industrial policy that looks to the future, and about our determination to embrace new technologies and back new industries and energy sources so that they can flourish and help us build a rebalanced economy across the country. As part of our plan to help Britain succeed, after months of negotiation, today we have a deal for the first nuclear power station in a generation to be built in Britain. This deal means £16bn of investment coming into the country and the creation of 25,000 jobs, which is brilliant news for the South West and for the country as a whole. As we compete in the tough global race, this underlines the confidence there is in Britain and makes clear that we are very much open for business. This also marks the next generation of nuclear power in Britain, which has an important part to play in contributing to our future energy needs and our longer term security of supply. I've taken the quote from the Department for Energy and Climate Change's news release. The news release includes details about the agreement with EDF, including the \"strike price\" and how it could be adjusted. DECC also has this summary of what it sees as the benefits to Britain. Building HPC will have significant benefits for the UK economy, including: A massive investment by EDF Group and its fellow investors of around £16 billion to build the plant. UK companies could benefit from getting up to 57% of the work; 25,000 jobs created during construction, with 5,600 people employed on site at peak of construction, and 900 permanent jobs over 60 years of expected operation; Power provided for nearly 6 million homes, an area almost twice the size of London, with the site meeting around 7% of the UK’s electricity demand when running at full capacity; and A clean, home-grown source of electricity, which will reduce the UK’s emissions by 9 million tonnes of CO2 per year, helping to meet climate targets. Often politicians are accused – rightly – of being obsessed with the immediate or the short-term: tonight's headlines, this week's GDP figures, next year's elections. But from time to time they take decisions that will last for decades, and today's announcement of the go-ahead for a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C is just such a moment. It is not something that has been dreamt up overnight. It was Tony Blair's government that first proposed a new generation of British nuclear power stations and the agreement announced today is the product of negotiations lasting two years. But it should result in the construction of a plant that will generate energy into the second half of the 21st century. In other words, it will probably keep going longer than most of the people involved in taking the decision. Here's the Guardian's story about the announcement. And here's how it starts. Britain is to embark on building its first nuclear power station for two decades as the coalition hands a multibillion pound subsidy to France's EDF with help from a state-owned Chinese firm. The two planned pressurised water reactors at Hinkley Point C, Somerset, are the first to start construction in Europe since Japan's Fukushima disaster and the first in the UK since the Sizewell B power station came online in 1995. The new reactors, which will cost £14bn, are due to start operating in 2023 if built on time and will run for 35 years. They will be capable of producing 7% of the UK's electricity – equivalent to the amount used by 7m homes. In details released on Monday morning, the strike price – the fixed price at which output will be sold – has been set at £89.50 per megawatt hour for electricity produced at the new power station. That price will be fully indexed to consumer price inflation. But the price, at 2012 prices, is dependent on EDF moving ahead with a second plant, Sizewell C, in Suffolk. If it decides not to proceed, another £3 per MWh will be added to the strike price for Hinkley, bringing it up to £92.50 per Mwh. And here's the formal announcement from the Department for Energy. I will be reporting the announcement in more detail, and covering the reaction, throughout the day. Here's the agenda for the day. 11am: Number 10 lobby briefing. 12.30pm: Ed Davey, the energy secretary, holds a press conference on the Hinkley Point announcement. 2.30pm: Eric Pickles, the communities secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 3.30pm: Davey gives a Commons statement on Hinkley Point. As usual, I’ll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I’ll post a lunchtime summary at about 1pm and another in the afternoon.

Republican voters, urged on by the Republican candidates, are now eager to bomb anywhere that has a Muslim-sounding name regardless of whether it comes from a cartoon. While the poll itself may be amusing, it’s not exactly surprising given the cartoonish levels of tough-guy militarism that spews from the mouth of every Republican candidate as they try to one-up each other on who would start more wars harder and quicker. Ted Cruz has spent the past two weeks calling for a “carpet bombing” of the Middle East in an attempt to destroy Isis, saying he wants to see if “sand can glow in the dark”. He defended this call on national television Tuesday while outright avoiding the question of whether that means he’s prepared to kill the hundreds of thousands of civilians that live in Isis’s de-facto capital of Raqqa, Syria. Donald Trump, in between his calls for banning Muslims here at home, also called on American forces to commit war crimes by killing the families of terrorists. His meaningless calls to “bomb the shit out of Isis” naturally have led all the other candidates to trip over each other in an attempt to find more and more colorful adjectives to describe how their bombs would look. Chris Christie, whose whole campaign seems based around trying to sound like he could beat the other candidates up for their lunch money, was perhaps the most absurd: he threatened war with both Russia and China during the last debate. Christie claimed he was totally willing to start a third world war with Russia over a no-fly zone in Syria and would shoot down Russian pilots immediately. His reason? To avenge the thousands killed by Assad, and the “millions running around the world, running for their lives”. So Christie’s position is: we will start the third world war to save Syrians, but we draw the line in at allowing five-year-old Syrian orphans into the United States. Lost in the insanity of the rest of the debate where candidates were calling for carpet bombings, the killing of civilians and games of chicken with the world’s largest nuclear power was also Christie’s call for all out cyberwar with China. Apparently under a Christie presidency, the US would immediately respond to any hacking by the Chinese government by doxxing the entire country, essentially turning the United States government into Anonymous: “What we need to do is go at the things that they are most sensitive and most embarrassing to them; that they’re hiding; get that information and put it out in public.” I’m always for more government transparency, but the chances of this spiraling out of control and leading to actual war is hard to overstate. On top of all this, it’s such a foregone conclusion that many of these candidates will happily rip up the Iran nuclear deal and send us down a path of war with them that hardly anyone even asks them anymore. Council on Foreign Relations’ Micah Zenko has a handy chart where he is tracking all the people and places each presidential candidate has said he or she wants to bomb. He reminds us that Ben Carson has not only promised all of the above, but to also unleash drone strikes in Mexico. It’s worth noting that Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton is just as militaristic, or more so, than most of the Republicans when it comes to Isis and Iran. She has at least refrained, however, from calling for a third world war with Russia or launching drone strikes in Mexico."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/23/michael-meachers-impressive-environmental-legacy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-23T17:59:07Z","webTitle":"Michael Meacher’s impressive environmental legacy | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/23/michael-meachers-impressive-environmental-legacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/23/michael-meachers-impressive-environmental-legacy","fields":{"headline":"Michael Meacher’s impressive environmental legacy","bodyText":"Your obituary of Michael Meacher (22 October) underplays his significant contribution to the promotion of genuinely green policies. I worked as a specialist researcher for Michael in the nine months running up to the 1997 general election landslide win for Labour, preparing policy papers as he advanced the cause of sustainability as shadow environmental protection secretary. Tony Blair chose to break Labour party rules in denying Michael his rightful place as a cabinet minister. Nonetheless, as one of several junior ministers in John Prescott’s super-ministry covering environment, transport and regional government, Michael de facto led the environmental brief for several years until Margaret Beckett was appointed as the full environment secretary. He spent an unusually long time – six years – as a junior minister in the same post, and gradually grew tired of ministers, departmental officials and advisory panels undermining true environmental policies, as Blair’s No 10 interfered over policies on genetic modification and nuclear energy, on which he was extremely sceptical. Indeed, barely days after the world’s greatest terrorist event, the attacks on 9/11 in the US, he had a stand-up fight in the environment department with Mrs Beckett, who was pushing through the Blair-backed plan to trade globally with nuclear explosives in opening a plutonium-fuels fabrication plant at Sellafield, costing several billion pounds of taxpayers’ money. Blair won, but Meacher was right, as the plant has proved a technical failure and economic disaster. After that, Michael decided his own advisers could not be trusted as objective (as his friend and political fellow traveller on the left, Tony Benn, had done in the late 1970s when energy secretary, again over dodgy nuclear advice), and he created a shadow advice panel on radioactive waste, including myself, which did its best to present him with more objective evidence-based advice than his own departmental officials were providing him. Time has proved our independent advice significantly more accurate, as the nuclear waste disposal strategy finally collapsed too. Time will show Michael Meacher was the best environment secretary we never had.

The losses are Toshiba’s first for six years and compare with a 137.8bn yen profit in the same period last year. The Nikkei report sent Toshiba shares down by as much as 5.9% on Thursday morning to their lowest level in almost a month, before recovering slightly to 330.5 yen, down 3.6%, midway through the day.

The 140-year-old company’s product range includes TVs, computers, as well as rice cookers and other kitchen appliances. It also has a stake in the nuclear power industry. The company incurred huge losses in its home appliances unit and its point of sale equipment business, according to Japanese media reports, although its semiconductor business is expected to make a profit. Toshiba confirmed it would suffer a half-year operating loss, but would not provide figures. It has already said it will register a 37.8 billion yen net loss for the fiscal year to March 2015. Toshiba’s chief executive, Hisao Tanaka, and seven top executives were forced to resign in July after it was revealed the firm overstated profits over several years by almost 152 billion yen – about three times the firm’s initial estimate. In one of the most damaging corporate scandals in Japan in recent years, regulators said managers had started setting unrealistic performance targets for the firm’s new businesses, such as smart meters and electronic toll booths, after the global financial crisis seven years ago. The accounting irregularities continued after the March 2011 Fukushima disaster, amid concerns Toshiba would sustain losses in its nuclear division. In their report into the scandal, investigators said: “Within Toshiba, there was a corporate culture in which one could not go against the wishes of superiors.” Unusually, Toshiba won’t release its first-half results until Saturday, as many of its new board members have been appointed from outside and can only attend meetings at weekends. The scandal has forced Toshiba, which employs more than 200,000 people worldwide, to embark on a round of restructuring that includes selling its shares in affiliates. The firm has said it will sell its image sensor business to Sony and is expected to announce an overhaul of its home appliance, TV and computer units later this month. Japan’s government is struggling to regain the confidence of global investors after two major scandals in the past four years. In late 2011, Olympus was found to have covered up 1.7 billion US dollars in losses over 13 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/aug/07/us-democrat-chuck-schumer-says-he-will-oppose-iran-nuclear-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-07T12:01:32Z","webTitle":"US Democrat Chuck Schumer says he will oppose Iran nuclear deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/07/us-democrat-chuck-schumer-says-he-will-oppose-iran-nuclear-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/aug/07/us-democrat-chuck-schumer-says-he-will-oppose-iran-nuclear-deal","fields":{"headline":"US Democrat Chuck Schumer says he will oppose Iran nuclear deal","bodyText":"Chuck Schumer, the senior Democrat expected to become the first Jewish Senate leader in the US Congress, has broken party ranks to oppose the Obama administration on the Iran nuclear agreement. Under pressure from his constituents and opponents of the deal, Schumer made clear in a statement on Thursday that he did not believe the comprehensive agreement struck in Vienna in July was enough to prevent Iran from making a bomb. Schumer gave his verdict a day after the US president, Barack Obama, delivered a combative and passionate speech at American University in Washington, in which he accused “armchair” warmongers in Washington of luring Congress towards another military conflict in the Middle East. “Advocates on both sides have strong cases for their point of view that cannot simply be dismissed,” Schumer said. “This has made evaluating the agreement a difficult and deliberate endeavour, and after deep study, careful thought and considerable soul-searching, I have decided I must oppose the agreement and will vote yes on a motion of disapproval.” Other party figures, including congressman Eliot Engel, have also said they would side with Republicans in opposing the deal. The more Democrats who do so, the harder it will be for the White House to use its veto should Congress vote the deal down. “To me, the very real risk that Iran will not moderate and will, instead, use the agreement to pursue its nefarious goals is too great,” said Schumer. “Therefore, I will vote to disapprove the agreement, not because I believe war is a viable or desirable option, nor to challenge the path of diplomacy. It is because I believe Iran will not change, and under this agreement it will be able to achieve its dual goals of eliminating sanctions while ultimately retaining its nuclear and non-nuclear power. “Better to keep US sanctions in place, strengthen them, enforce secondary sanctions on other nations, and pursue the hard-trodden path of diplomacy once more, difficult as it may be.” Congress is expected to vote on the agreement in September and Obama has repeatedly said he will veto a disapproval. Opponents of the deal need enough votes in both chambers in order to make it veto-proof, which looks very difficult at the moment. That calculation might change if more Democrats join Schumer, who is expected to succeed Harry Reid as the Senate party leader in the near future, in opposing the deal. If Congress votes down the deal, it will strike a serious blow to the credibility of Obama, who has invested a great amount of time and energy to reach a comprehensive nuclear agreement with Tehran. He is backed by other negotiating partners including Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. “Between now and the congressional vote in September, you are going to hear a lot of arguments against this deal backed by tens of millions of dollars of advertising,” Obama said on Wednesday. “If the arguments sound familiar, they should. Many of the same people who argued for the war in Iraq are now making the case against the Iran nuclear deal.” Although the issue is still being hotly debated in the US, the Europeans have already taken measures to mend ties with Tehran, with many EU foreign ministers, including those of France and Italy, travelling to Iran to seek business opportunities in the post-sanctions era. It will be a while before Tehran benefits from sanctions relief as inspectors would have to first verify that Tehran is abiding by its own obligations and rolling back its nuclear programme. While opposing the deal, Schumer said he would give “tremendous credit” to Obama for his work on this issue. “All fair-minded Americans should acknowledge the president’s strong achievements in combating and containing Iran,” he said. But he said he has examined the text of the agreement and closely looked at restrictions on Iran in the first 10 years, nuclear restrictions after 10 years, and non-nuclear components and consequences of a deal. “In each case I have asked: are we better off with the agreement or without it?” “After 15 years of relief from sanctions, Iran would be stronger financially and better able to advance a robust nuclear programme. Even more importantly, the agreement would allow Iran, after 10 to 15 years, to be a nuclear threshold state with the blessing of the world community. Iran would have a green light to be as close, if not closer to possessing a nuclear weapon than it is today. And the ability to thwart Iran if it is intent on becoming a nuclear power would have less moral and economic force.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/dec/02/china-investment-britain-hs2-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-02T06:44:54Z","webTitle":"China pushes for greater investment in UK, including HS2 and nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/china-investment-britain-hs2-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/dec/02/china-investment-britain-hs2-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"China pushes for greater investment in UK, including HS2 and nuclear power","bodyText":"China wants involvement in Britain's first high-speed rail line and an increased role in civil nuclear power, the country's premier said in Beijing after talks with David Cameron on the first day of the prime minister's visit. Li Keqiang said China would also like to invest in power projects. Speaking in the Great Hall of the People on Monday, Li said: \"The two sides have agreed to push for breakthroughs and progress in the co-operation between our enterprises on nuclear power and high speed rail. The Chinese side is willing to not only participate in but also purchase equities and stocks in UK power projects.\" Cameron said the scale and pace of China's transformation dwarfed Britain's industrial revolution. The remarks by Li follow a concerted effort by Britain to mend fences with Beijing after Cameron met the Dalai Lama last year. The prime minister said last week he would welcome Chinese involvement in HS2. Li said Britain and China were indispensable and equal partners, noting the prime minister's recent approach to Beijing by acknowledging the territorial integrity of China – diplomatic code for accepting Beijing's rule over Tibet. Li said: \"We have become indispensable partners for each other's development. China and the UK must treat each other as equals.\" Cameron, who arrived in Beijing pledging to act as China's strongest advocate in the west, started the day by visiting the Chinese headquarters of Jaguar Land Rover. He then met Li at the Great Hall of the People for talks and lunch. Cameron is due to have dinner with President Xi Jinping before heading to Shanghai. The prime minister opened his remarks at the Great Hall of the People by echoing Xi's call for a Chinese dream. The prime minister said: \"China's transformation is one of the defining facts of our lifetime. The pace and scale of economic development and urbanisation dwarfs the British industrial revolution of two centuries ago. I see China's rise as an opportunity not just for the people of this country but for Britain and for the world. \"Britain wants China to realise its dream and I believe we can help each other succeed in the global race. Some in Europe and elsewhere see the world changing and want to shut China off behind a bamboo curtain of trade barriers. Britain wants to tear those trade barriers down.\" China has rolled out a vast high-speed rail link at an astounding pace, though the reputation of the project suffered a blow with a fatal train crash near Wenzhou in 2011. Cameron said last week that he would welcome Chinese involvement in HS2. The prime minister said during a visit to a Chinese exhibition at the V&amp;A: \"I’m very interested in what’s happening in terms of high-speed rail in China. It seems to be an absolute high-speed revolution taking place, and I’m looking forward to travelling on a high-speed train when I’m in China. \"In terms of HS2, I very much welcome Chinese investment into British infrastructure. We see already Chinese investment into Heathrow Airport, into Manchester Airport and, of course, into Hinkley Point nuclear power stations.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/dec/10/the-guardian-view-on-jacob-zumas-economics-not-prudent-and-a-danger-for-the-future","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-10T19:04:50Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Jacob Zuma’s economics: not prudent, and a danger for the future | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/10/the-guardian-view-on-jacob-zumas-economics-not-prudent-and-a-danger-for-the-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/10/the-guardian-view-on-jacob-zumas-economics-not-prudent-and-a-danger-for-the-future","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Jacob Zuma’s economics: not prudent, and a danger for the future","bodyText":"South Africa is a big country and in some ways a rich country. But, whether in colonial times, in the apartheid era, or during the years of rule by the African National Congress, the combination of volatile prices for the minerals that are its main asset, a constant need for investment from outside, and pressure for better wages and conditions has meant its economy is especially difficult to steer. When poor management at home combines with damaging changes in the world economy, trouble soon follows in South Africa. Unhappily that is very much the case today. President Jacob Zuma’s sacking of his respected finance minister Nhlanhla Nene this week represents another turn in the country’s downward economic spiral. After the news of Mr Nene’s departure, and his replacement by a virtually unknown MP from the ruling party who has little financial or economic experience, the currency tumbled. There was a chorus of complaint from banks and investment houses, and a collective sigh went up from the ANC’s well-wishers everywhere. This comes only a week after one major credit agency joined another in downgrading South Africa’s credit rating. Junk status, which would have disastrous consequences, is only a step or two away. There seems little reason to doubt that Mr Nene has been removed because he opposed spending proposals, like those for a new nuclear power station, for supporting a new aircraft leasing deal for South African Airways, and for pay increases for workers, which Mr Zuma wanted to push through. The minister’s view was that South Africa, already deep in debt, simply could not afford them, leaving aside other strong arguments against the proposals. The more fundamental problem is that Mr Zuma understands patronage very well, but seems to have no economic strategy at all. He has packed government departments, other state institutions, and the wholly or partly state-owned companies that have proliferated in South Africa, with people who owe him loyalty in return for the well-paid positions that have come their way. These people, his critics say, will protect him in the future, after he stands down as president in 2019, from the criminal charges that still hang over him, and enable him to remain a power in the land even after he loses formal office. Collectively this network of Mr Zuma’s people is a drag on the economy because their pay and benefits eat up a large share of revenue for the little most of them do, and because they are naturally inclined to place no obstacles in the way of the president’s fiscal imprudence. This is not the way to secure the economic growth that South Africa must achieve if it is to even begin to satisfy the needs, let alone the aspirations, of its people. Real unemployment stands at a dismal 35%, youth unemployment is even worse at 50%, and the squatter townships, which were supposed by now to have disappeared or been transformed, are still there. Ordinary South Africans feel they have been shortchanged. Many of the promises of 1994, especially of material progress, have been unfulfilled. They are in rebellious mood, with popular protests and strikes at unprecedented levels. When the government concedes, as it has done over student fees and the pay of some workers, it buys off protest for a while, but also adds to the strain on the indebted economy. The unfortunate truth is that the strong growth that should have come after the crash did not happen. The reasons are various, and not all of them are the government’s fault. But under a leader who seems to believe that there is an infinite amount of money in the government coffers, South Africa’s difficulties have been hugely compounded. As long ago as 2011, the National Planning Commission, established by Mr Zuma, concluded in its report that there was a danger that the progress made since the ANC took over could be reversed. Unfortunately that danger seems even closer today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/may/20/brexit-best-answer-to-dying-eurozone-eu-undemocratic-elite","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-20T05:00:31Z","webTitle":"Brexit may be the best answer to a dying eurozone  | Larry Elliott","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/20/brexit-best-answer-to-dying-eurozone-eu-undemocratic-elite","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/may/20/brexit-best-answer-to-dying-eurozone-eu-undemocratic-elite","fields":{"headline":"Brexit may be the best answer to a dying eurozone","bodyText":"The elephant in the room. Everybody knew what Mark Carney meant when he paused halfway through his regular three-monthly update on the state of the economy: the implications of Brexit. The governor of the Bank of England did not pull any punches. He warned of a potential run on the pound and of possible problems financing the UK’s whopping balance of payments deficit. He said the Bank expected growth to be materially lower and inflation to be notably higher. Voters trust the Bank of England. They sat up and took notice. The opinion polls started to move in favour of remain. When the history of the referendum campaign is written, Carney’s may be seen as the decisive intervention. In truth, there was more than one elephant in the room. Carney was right when he said there was a risk that the upheaval caused by Brexit could tip an already weakening economy into recession. But as elephants in the room go, this was the smaller, Indian version. The equivalent of the bigger, African elephant was the shocking state of the eurozone after the failure of the single currency experiment. This went unremarked by Carney, although it is relevant to the debate about Europe. Why? Because, although Britain is likely to stay in the EU, Brexit will remain a live issue unless the eurozone can sort itself out. That means either admitting that the euro has been a terrible mistake, or going the whole hog and integrating further, with a single banking system, a Europe-wide treasury, and a democratically elected finance minister with the power to raise money in Germany and spend it in Greece. This is not going to happen any time soon, and perhaps never. Countries that joined the eurozone gave up a considerable amount of economic power when they adopted the euro, but they retained the right to raise their own taxes and make their own spending decisions. Britain is not in the euro, for which we should all be thankful. But let’s be clear: staying in the EU means hitching the wagon to a currency zone unable to go forwards or backwards, and which will continue to struggle as a result. The euro brought to fruition the idea of ever-closer union, a plan that dates back to the early 1950s. Lots of things considered good ideas back then are no longer considered quite so clever: system-built high-rise flats as the answer to slum housing; nuclear power to meet energy needs. Put ever-closer union in the same category as the Birmingham inner-city ring road: it seemed a good idea at the time. Dan Atkinson and I spent the winter working on a book about the single currency commissioned in the wake of last summer’s Greek crisis. The brief was to look at what had gone wrong from a left-of-centre perspective; to explore the widespread disquiet about the way in which a country that voted in January 2015 for an end to austerity ended up seven months later being forced to accept even deeper cuts in wages and spending. The eurozone crisis is about more than Greece. It is about Italy, where the economy is barely any bigger now than it was when the single currency was introduced. And France, where unemployment is double the level of the UK or the US. And Finland, one of the most tech-savvy countries in Europe, where the economy is 7% smaller than it was before the start of the financial crisis. And even Germany, where an export boom and high corporate profits have been paid for by workers in the form of below-inflation pay increases. Our investigations took us back to the last time Britain held a referendum on EU membership, when during the cabinet discussions Tony Benn warned that Britain was signing up for something that was undemocratic, deflationary and run in the interests of big business. “I can think of no body of men outside the Kremlin who have so much power without a shred of accountability for what they do,” Benn said. Benn’s dystopian vision proved entirely accurate. When the architects of the new Europe looked to the future, they envisaged a new and better version of the United States of America. Europe would have all the good bits about the US – such as the economic dynamism, a large barrier-free market and a single currency – without any of the bad bits: the inequality, the high levels of incarceration, the poverty and the inadequate welfare safety net. This dream lives on. Yanis Varoufakis, the deposed finance minister of Greece, thinks the eurozone could be recast along Keynesian lines, with the rich and strong countries obliged to provide financial help to the poor and weak. Good luck with getting Germany to agree to that. Economic policy has been relentlessly deflationary. The interests of bankers have been given a higher priority than workers’. Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus and Spain have been the laboratory mice in a continent-wide neoliberal experiment of a sort Tea Party Republicans in the US can only fantasise about. Given the obscene level of long-term unemployment, the idea of Europe as the guardian of labour rights is laughable. The gap between the US and Europe has widened, not narrowed, since the launch of the single currency. Populist parties of both left and right are gaining in support. One left-of-centre argument against Brexit is that it would result in the breakup of the euro and by doing so set off a chain reaction that would lead to the next global crisis: a perfectly fair point. Those who fear that another recession and even higher levels of joblessness would threaten a return to the totalitarian politics of the 1930s are right to highlight the risks. Some on the left who want Brexit say that the time is not yet ripe. The left-of-centre case for divorce is that Europe doesn’t work, is not remotely progressive and is heading for an existential crisis anyway. Last year’s threat was Grexit. This year’s threat is Brexit. Next year’s threat will be something else: Italy leaving the single currency, perhaps, or Marine Le Pen’s tilt for the French presidency. This presents an opportunity for those who believe that the way ahead still involves closer integration. Jean Monnet, the godfather of the EU, always said that ever-closer union would be forged through crises, which is what Brexit would undoubtedly trigger. If the polls are right, Britain seems unready to trigger this act of creative destruction and it will be left to Varoufakis to do out of office what he could not do in power: prove a different Europe is possible. A different Europe is needed, but it is stretching credibility to imagine that the Europe of Greece and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership can easily morph into America with the nice people in charge. The eurozone is economically moribund, persists with policies that have demonstrably failed, is indifferent to democracy, is run by and for a small, self-perpetuating elite, and is slowing dying. The wrong comparison is being made. This is not the US without the electric chair; it is the USSR without the gulag. • Europe isn’t working, by Larry Elliott and Dan Atkinson, is published by Yale University press on 24 May"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/nov/17/book-review-climate-change-what-everyone-needs-to-know","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-17T11:00:05Z","webTitle":"Book review: climate change, what everyone needs to know | John Abraham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/nov/17/book-review-climate-change-what-everyone-needs-to-know","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/nov/17/book-review-climate-change-what-everyone-needs-to-know","fields":{"headline":"Book review: Climate Change, What Everyone Needs to Know","bodyText":"A new book makes the case that those who understand the basics of climate change and clean energy will be the “smart money” in the coming years. Those who don’t, however, will make bad decisions for themselves and their family. They might, for instance, end up holding coastal property after prices have begun to crash due to due the growing twin threats of sea level rise and storm surge. In short, climate change isn’t just something every educated person ought to know about because it will impact future generations or because everyone will be talking about it during the upcoming Paris climate talks. It is something everyone needs to know about now because “Climate change will have a bigger impact on your family and friends and all of humanity than the Internet has had.” “Climate Change, What Everyone Needs to Know” is part of the highly regarded Oxford University Press series of primers on subjects ranging from China to Islam, which all share the same subtitle. For its climate change book, Oxford chose Dr. Joseph Romm, the founder of the popular blog ClimateProgress.org. Romm, a physicist and former U.S. Energy Department official, writes as easily on climate science as he does on solutions. The book is written entirely in a Q&amp;A format, which makes it a highly readable introduction to the subject. Romm answers such basic questions as, ‘Why are climate scientists so confident that humans are the primary cause of recent warning?’ ‘Which extreme weather events are being made worse by climate change and which are not?’ ‘Why did scientists and governments decide 2°C (3.6°F) was the limit beyond which climate change becomes “dangerous” to humanity?’. Even people who consider themselves science literate will learn from this book. Consider the question: “What fraction of recent global warming is due to human causes versus natural causes?” As Romm explains, “The best estimate from the world’s top scientists is that humans are responsible for all of the warming we have experienced since 1950.” On the solutions side, Romm offers clear and up-to-date explanations of the roles solar, wind, biomass, and nuclear power will play in the next quarter century. If you are wondering which alternative fuel will replace oil in our cars, Romm makes a compelling case why it won’t be hydrogen but will be electricity. Romm examines one question that few people have even thought to ask, “Does carbon dioxide at exposure levels expected this century have any direct impacts on human health or cognition?”. The surprising answer is “yes” – a subject Romm has explored in more detail in recent weeks on his website. In the final chapter, Romm examines “How will climate change impact you and your family in the coming decades?”. Romm explains how U.S. government policies artificially inflate coastal property values and why climate change means that this trillion-dollar-bubble is going to burst in the foreseeable future. He looks at the question of how climate change should influence any decision about where to retire. He looks at what students should study today “if they want to prepare themselves for working in a globally warmed world” and maximize their future employability. “Climate Change, What Everyone Needs to Know” is a must-read for those who want to become climate literate and join the growing conversation about the greatest threat humanity faces today – or simply for those who want to be in on the “smart money” rather than the other kind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2015/aug/14/dungeness-where-the-wild-west-meets-the-post-apocalyptic","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-14T18:19:16Z","webTitle":"Dungeness: where the wild west meets the post-apocalyptic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/14/dungeness-where-the-wild-west-meets-the-post-apocalyptic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2015/aug/14/dungeness-where-the-wild-west-meets-the-post-apocalyptic","fields":{"headline":"Dungeness: where the wild west meets the post-apocalyptic","bodyText":"They call Dungeness the desert of England, though experts observe that, lacking both the dearth of water and the extreme differential in night and day temperatures, it fulfils none of the desert criteria. The landscape certainly divides people – a broad, echoing flatness with the famous nuclear power station on one side, the shingle dipping into the sea on the other; railway carriages turned into quaint and spooky dwellings; newcomers from “that London” planting black, post-apocalyptic architecture alongside. It’s so intense I felt on the verge of a spiritual awakening and, to head it off, asked the photographer a boring question. “Are we coming on to the promontory now?” “I don’t know,” he replied, “I’m just happy the car’s locked.” The nature reserve is incredible: a third of Britain’s plant species can be found in this one area, and the waterbirds bob about oblivious to how rare they are. The 190-hectare (468-acre) Dungeness estate is up for sale, for £1.5m. It includes the ground rent on 22 cottages, but doesn’t include the pub, the power station or either of the two lighthouses. In the 90s, people went to Dungeness because Derek Jarman, the seminal art house film-maker, lived there: everybody did fashion shoots in his front garden, and there’s now a note in the window saying: “No fashion shoots in my front garden, without prior written permission”. Even then, it was by no means the only arty house on the beach. In 1994, just after Jarman died of Aids, a photographer and I accidentally did a story on the wrong house (then we went to the pub, and he used the urinal next to the barman, and we both got kicked out because of his Prince Albert, which you may have to look up elsewhere on the internet). This time around I meet Jodie Snelling, 37, standing outside Jarman’s (actual) house with her mother, Susan, 63. “I read somewhere that it’s like the wild west, and it is, isn’t it?” said Jodie. “It really is!” I agreed, feelingly. “I came for the plants,” Susan said. Jarman’s garden is still intricately tended, round beds of intensely weird vegetation that can’t decide whether it belongs on the land or in the sea. “Look at this house next door,” Susan said, vexed. “It’s so untidy! If you lived next door to somewhere where you knew people were thronging, you’d tidy it up a bit, wouldn’t you? Sorry, I’m being my mother.” That must surely be the point of the sale, that people do throng here, and anywhere that people throng to, there’s a way to monetise it: no owner, old or new, could hope to develop the land, which is all protected. It’s reminiscent of the sale of Saddleback mountain in the Lake District – everybody gets very upset about it, but with no potential to either change the area or restrict access to it, should we mind? Way O’ the Wind cottage, truly in the way of the wind, sits beside the Dungeness fish shop. Doreen Thomas, 89, moved here when she was 21. She met her husband in the street, dancing, on VJ day, 70 years ago today. “Let me tell you something: I got bombed, doodle bugged and rocketed, I never got scratched. My dad was in the army, two uncles; the man I was supposed to marry got shot down. And then after it all, I came here. It’s awfully sad when things change, but I don’t think they can change it very much. You can’t build here at all, and I think that’ll stay the same.” Her son-in-law, Tony Greenland, tells me the exact date that he first came to Dungeness: 31 March 1961. That’s quite an acute memory, I observed. “I came to see a specific bird which was unique,” he explained. “So of course I’d remember the date.” He says the area has already changed radically. “The extraction of the shingle has reduced the water table, so we now have forests out there rather than the vegetation that we used to have. This was all under water before. This garden was under water.” His wife, Doreen’s daughter Christine, 65, remembers the truly seismic change: the building of the power station, when she was 11. “My dad fought that, all the fishermen did.” She smiled ruefully. “But we didn’t get anywhere”. The problem with the power station, apart from all the nuclear power, is the noise attenuation of shingle. “You can hear somebody talking half a mile away.” So they must know their neighbours pretty well. “The people who live here,” Doreen said firmly, “are not local. They’re from London. It started with Derek Jarman. What he did with his life was his business, but he was a lovely fella.” Of course you want to know; who wouldn’t? Greenland’s bird was a stone curlew."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/mar/10/the-faces-of-japans-tsunami-disaster-survivors-five-years-on","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-10T06:40:55Z","webTitle":"After Fukushima: faces from Japan's tsunami tragedy, five years on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/the-faces-of-japans-tsunami-disaster-survivors-five-years-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/mar/10/the-faces-of-japans-tsunami-disaster-survivors-five-years-on","fields":{"headline":"After Fukushima: faces from Japan's tsunami tragedy, five years on","bodyText":"On 11 March 2011 a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the north-east coast of Japan and triggered a triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.

To mark the anniversary of Japan’s worst disaster since the war, the Guardian met six people whose courage and determination has inspired other people across the disaster-hit region. From the mayor of a radiation-hit city who refused to leave, to a traumatised fisherman who now looks after his elderly neighbours – ordinary people who, in a few terrifying minutes, saw their lives transformed by catastrophe. The mayor: Katsunobu Sakurai Minamisoma It comes as little surprise to hear that Katsunobu Sakurai rarely looks out of his office window these days. Five years ago he watched from the same window as massive tsunami waves crashed through rows of pine trees before tearing up farmland and homes in Minamisoma. Sakurai had been the city’s mayor for just a few months when the disaster killed almost 500 of his constituents. The death toll, however, was just the beginning of Minamisoma’s agony.When the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, 25km (16 miles) south of the city centre, went into meltdown, all but 9,000 of Minamisoma’s 71,000 residents voted with their feet, leaving behind a ghost town bereft of people and essential services. While his city ground to a halt, Sakurai stayed put. Clearly exhausted, he took to YouTube on 24 March 2011 to issue a plea for help, subtitled in English, that reverberated around the world. Five years later the city’s population has recovered to around 57,000 and preparations are being made to allow residents to return to the abandoned neighbourhood closest to the nuclear plant. Yet the community is far from normal. Many mothers and their children have stayed away, and the city’s kindergartens are half empty – even though, as Sakurai points out, radiation levels in the city are now lower than those in Rome. Last year Sakurai was re-elected in a landslide, while other local leaders were turfed out by voters who believe they have bungled their communities’ recovery. “I stayed even after everyone else had left,” said Sakurai, who credits his samurai ancestors with giving him the determination to carry on. “I think people appreciated that.” There is still much work to be done. Just over half of the city’s 23,000 households have been decontaminated – a huge undertaking that is expected to cost as much as US$400m. “It’s a good job that Japan is rich enough to do all of this,” he said, with obvious mischief. His sense of humour disappeared when talk turned to the operator of the Fukushima plant, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco). “My attitude towards Tepco hasn’t changed,” he said. “And the way Tepco goes about things hasn’t changed either. They simply won’t take full responsibility for what they’ve done.” Despite the challenges, Sakurai, a veteran marathon runner, has witnessed the city’s slow ascent from despair during his regular runs. “We still have a long way to go,” he said. “But life today is heaven compared to the hell of March 2011.” The sake brewer: Yasuaki Konno Ofunato One of the most poignant images of the immediate aftermath of the Japan disaster was of a bent and rusting sign pointing to the shattered remains of the Suisen Shuzo sake brewery in Rikuzentakata. But for Suisen, regarded as one of Japan’s best sake brewers, the tragedy of the tsunami had only just begun, as it became clear that nine of the brewery’s 57 employees had died. “When my father told the surviving staff a few days later that we would brew sake again, we knew he wasn’t just putting on a brave face,” said Yasuaki Konno, the son of Suisen’s president, Yasuhiko Konno. True to Konno senior’s word, within months the firm was producing sake at the premises of a rival brewer, Iwate Meijo – one of countless examples of companies coming to the aid of stricken competitors after the disaster. Now, with the help of government aid and donations from customers determined to resurrect their local brewer, Suisen is again making premium-quality sake at its new premises on a hill overlooking the nearby port of Ofunato. In 2014 it entered the US market with its first overseas brand, Kibo, which means “hope”. “We’re originally a Rikuzentakata company but the water there was no longer good enough to produce sake,” said Yuki Murakami, a manager at Suisen, which formed 70 years ago after a merger between eight smaller breweries. The firm employs fewer staff, and production is at about 40% of pre-disaster levels. For now, though, just the ability to turn rice into Japan’s national drink is enough for Yasuaki Konno. “We were about to start shipping out that year’s supply which we had made during the winter,” he said of the events of five years ago. “When I went back the next day and saw what had happened to the brewery, I couldn’t take it in.” Konno, who oversees the production of about 20 Suisen sake labels, said the brewery owed it to its customers to rebuild. “If we’d given up it would have been another piece of bad news for the town and our customers, many of whom had lost their homes. “If we hadn’t at least tried I don’t think we’d have been able to show our faces in Rikuzentakata again.” He concedes that Suisen’s sake may have undergone subtle changes in taste due to its new premises. “Sake is not just a product – it’s an incredibly complex drink,” he said. “We’re still in the early stages of recovery, and it could be another 10 years before we’re truly out of the woods. “But nothing can ever be as bad as the situation we found ourselves in five years ago. If we can get through that, we can get through anything.” The community leader: Kazuo Sato Rikuzentakata Strange as it may sound, Kazuo Sato considers himself one of the lucky ones. He lost his home in the tsunami that killed 1,700 people in his hometown of Rikuzentakata, but he, his wife, their three children, and his own parents survived. A former fishermen, he was left too traumatised to go back out to sea. Today they all live in the same in a temporary housing complex in the grounds of a local junior high school that once served as an evacuation shelter. Other couples with children have secured loans and moved on, leaving behind the Sato family and 100 or so residents whose average age is over 60; several are in their late 90s. Sato’s 78-year-old father, Kichiro, is mending fishing nets in preparation for his first trip back out to sea since the tsunami, in search of whitebait. Before the disaster, the father and son would have gone fishing together. But the younger Sato won’t be joining his father this spring. “I was a fisherman before the disaster,” said Sato, 50. “I tried to continue after the tsunami, but I kept having flashbacks and it was affecting me psychologically. I watched the tsunami arrive from the hillside, so I could see people trying to escape and hear their screams for help. But there was nothing I could do.” Instead, Sato reinvented himself as a community leader, and now divides his time between chairing the residents’ association and working as a voluntary firefighter. He also helps the Sakura Line project to plant cherry blossoms in areas considered safe from tsunami. His office at the top of a hill overlooking the temporary housing has become the first point of contact for residents with complaints about everything from leaky roofs to lack of privacy. On occasion he plays the role of peacemaker. “There is no privacy here, which adds to people’s problems,” said Sato, who blames the stress of life as a displaced survivor for the minor stroke he suffered last year, aged just 49. “We often have to defuse arguments caused by complaints about noisy neighbours, or after people have had too much to drink.” As the exodus of younger people continues, Sato’s biggest concern is the welfare of elderly neighbours who live alone, amid a recent rise in the number of solitary deaths in the disaster-hit region. “We ask people to keep their doors unlocked so we can get inside quickly if we think something is wrong,” he said. Despite the cramped conditions inside poorly constructed prefab units, Sato says he is prepared to wait until he can raise enough money to build his family a new, permanent home. “We live at the end of a row of units and our neighbours recently moved out, so we have more privacy. Compared with what many people have to put up with, we’re lucky.” The doctor: Masaaki Shimanuki Rikuzentakata Masaaki Shimanuki’s professional wishlist sounds much like that of any other doctor: new equipment, bigger premises, more staff. But on the afternoon of 11 March 2011 the 73-year-old’s troubles were of an altogether different magnitude. Shimanuki, a doctor in the internal medicine department at Iwate Prefectural Takata hospital in the coastal town of Rikuzentakata, was in his consulting room when he felt the ground begin to shake. The biggest earthquake in Japan’s recorded history had just struck the north-east coast, generating a huge tsunami that would reach Rikuzentakata just over 30 minutes later. “Our priority was to help get our patients out of danger,” Shimanuki said during a break at the town’s only major hospital – a prefabricated replacement that was built on higher ground after the disaster. “We moved them up to the fourth floor, but even that wasn’t high enough.” As the water level continued to rise, the only place left to take refuge was the hospital roof. By nightfall 11 of the hospital’s 51 patients – most of them elderly – had died, including four who succumbed to freezing temperatures on the roof. Nine staff also died. Today, dozens of patients – all wearing obligatory flu masks – line the corridor outside Shimanuki’s office just minutes after the hospital has opened. On a typical day the hospital’s five on-duty doctors and 30 nurses see 170 people, about a quarter of whom are still living in temporary housing. Medical and administrative workers barely have time to draw breath; as soon as Shimanuki sees one patient, another joins the end of the queue. But in its organised chaos, Takata is at last beginning to resemble an ordinary hospital again. “We never thought about giving up, even during those dreadful days after the tsunami,” Shimanuki said. “We received so much help from outside that we had no choice but to carry on. But if there is one thing I could have right now, it would be more doctors and nurses.” The scallop farmer: Jun Sasaki Koishihama Five years ago Jun Sasaki could have been forgiven for banishing all thoughts of returning to the sea to make a living. After steering his boat back to port moments before the tsunami careered into the tiny fishing village of Koishihama, the fisherman and his family watched helplessly as the waves destroyed his scallop beds. In a matter of minutes he had lost 1,000 tonnes of scallops, worth an estimated 50m yen (£311,000/US$440,000). “When I saw the tsunami was withdraw back out to sea, I knew that it had taken all of my scallops with it,” said the 45-year-old, who was born and raised in the area. Like so many people who lost their businesses in March 2011, Sasaki had no choice but to embrace the philanthropic spirit that would help his and other fishing communities through their darkest hours. Within days 400 volunteer divers were working in shifts to clear the seabed of debris so Koishihahama could quickly rebuild its aquaculture industry. The Kizuna Foundation, a non-profit business launched after the disaster, offered financial help. “It was like getting a gentle push in the back, carrying us along,” said Sasaki, who by 2014 was producing as many scallops as he had done before the disaster. Now, he says, the water in the bay is even cleaner than it was before 11 March. The village, framed by pine-covered cliffs, is attempting to attract more tourists through its famed oysters, scallops and sea pineapples. “Fishermen all over the region are getting old, so we need to find other ways to keep the local economy going,” said Sasaki, who is head of the village’s 12-member scallop fishermen’s union. “We want this to be a place that attracts people who love great seafood.” Inspired by the post-disaster volunteer effort, he obtained a diver’s licence so he could remove what little debris is left, and keep a closer eye on his livelihood. “I love getting into the water now, even after what happened in 2011,” he said. “I can see the scallops for myself … and it goes without saying that they are the best in the world.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/may/15/new-greek-euro-crisis-leave-campaign-project-fear-brexit-referendum","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-15T07:59:01Z","webTitle":"A new crisis in Greece would give the Leave campaign its own Project Fear","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/15/new-greek-euro-crisis-leave-campaign-project-fear-brexit-referendum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/may/15/new-greek-euro-crisis-leave-campaign-project-fear-brexit-referendum","fields":{"headline":"A new crisis in Greece would give the Leave campaign its own Project Fear","bodyText":"They say that it pays to have friends in high places. As they battle to keep Britain in the EU, David Cameron and George Osborne have been spoilt for ammunition over recent days. Dire warnings on the consequences of Brexit came through thick and fast and, naturally, the Remain camp seized on every one. The Bank of England raised the threat of recession and soaring inflation, the International Monetary Fund warned of tumbling house prices and Gordon Brown formed a rare alliance with Cameron over the prospect of the third world war. “For a thousand years, nations and tribes of Europe were fighting to the finish murdering and maiming each other. There is no century except this one where Europe has been at peace,” Cameron’s predecessor at No 10 said in his Remain appeal to Labour voters. It looks like Project Fear has peaked. But with more than a month to go until the EU referendum, the risk for Remain campaigners is that it has peaked too soon. It’s hard to see how supporters of staying in the EU will fill the next five weeks. For the Leave camp, on the other hand, the week of Brexit doom and gloom was not necessarily as damaging as headlines might suggest. When Brexit campaigners say that people like IMF head Christine Lagarde and Bank of England governor Mark Carney should butt out of UK politics, they will doubtless strike a chord with many voters. Furthermore, there are plenty of weak spots to target in the Remain camp’s Brexit warnings. Firstly, no one truly knows what a UK economy outside the EU would look like. The Bank of England made it clear that in the direct aftermath of a Leave vote it would expect to face opposing forces of slowing activity and rising inflation. The Bank was less clear about how pronounced those forces would be. Whether they prompted a rate cut or rise would depend on their magnitude. In other words, Threadneedle Street’s policymakers have wisely stopped well short of promising a particular emergency plan because they, like the rest of us, cannot predict the post-Brexit economy with any real degree of certainty. As for longer-term estimates on how the UK would fare outside the EU, they rely on so many assumptions that they have quickly been dismissed as fantasy economics. Secondly, what the economists are predicting in the medium term is by no means bad news for everyone. Osborne would have voters believe that Brexit presents a “lose-lose” situation, but that will ring hollow for some businesses and individuals. If the IMF is right and Brexit hammers house prices, younger people desperate to get on the housing ladder may finally have their chance. If the pound tumbles, exporters who want to be more competitive could get a boost. Of course those businesses would face other challenges as the UK seeks new trade deals. There is also a risk investment into the country could slump. But looking further ahead, who knows what partnerships Britain might form. Finally, these doomsday scenarios have all failed answer one very important question. What if the UK votes to stay in the EU and the bloc disintegrates anyway? It is not so hard to picture. The spectre of economic crisis continues to hang over the continent. The euro was always a massively ambitious project and has courted collapse before. Now with renewed tensions in and around debt-stricken Greece, fears have returned of a eurozone break-up. With those fears come grave concerns for the whole EU. It’s not just in austerity-hit Greece that people are angry. Across Europe, nationalism is gaining ground as disenchanted voters turn inwards. So Osborne and Cameron had better hope that no fresh eurozone tensions flare up as the UK’s referendum day approaches. In the meantime it’s hard to see what more they can pull out of the hat. But maybe they won’t have to. The Remain camp knows Britons vote with their wallets. So from now on, expect a campaign stuck on repeat. Just as he did last week, Osborne and his allies will tell voters over and over: “If we vote to leave, British families will be poorer.” Banking crisis may have been due to the sin of pride, not crime Hubris, according to Andrew Bailey, deputy governor of the Bank of England, needs to be added to the list of risks banks face. He was referring to the overweening confidence that can afflict top bankers, driven by their pursuit of profits and bonuses. Bailey did not name a particular bank, but he could easily have been referring to RBS when he described management teams “so convinced of their rightness that they hurtle for the cliff without questioning the direction of travel”. That is not to say that Sir Fred Goodwin – he still had his knighthood at the time – did not face some resistance. One analyst accused Goodwin of being a megalomaniac for his penchant for doing deals – a turn of phrase that had been forgotten by the time he was chasing the ABN Amro takeover that eventually drove RBS off the cliff. The recriminations are continuing even now, almost eight years after £45bn of taxpayer funds were used to buy RBS shares to cushion its fall. Last week, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said that after scouring 160,000 documents it had not found any grounds to file criminal charges against RBS or its former management. The Scottish prosecution service had focused on the £12bn cash call that Goodwin pulled off in June 2008, just four months before RBS collapsed. This leads to the conclusion that it was not criminal behaviour that lay at the root of RBS’s demise but, as the official report into its collapse in 2011 put it, poor decision-making. As painful and irritating as it may be for a public stuck with a 73% stake in a loss-making bank to accept, poor decision-making is not a crime. Attention will soon start to turn to HBOS. City regulators are looking at whether there are grounds to bar those who were at the helm when it collapsed from working in the City. Many former HBOS directors have already defended themselves by saying the financial crisis could not be predicted. The clock is ticking on whether hubris – or something punishable – is to blame. Now even Russia wants to build us a nuclear plant The Russians are coming… to a nuclear power station near you. Well, they would be if the decision were up to them: state-owned operator Rosatom is keen to build reactors in Britain. You might have thought that with a Cold War of words raging between Vladimir Putin and the west over Ukraine, the very idea of a UK Russian reactors was fanciful. The Department of Energy and Climate Change was certainly keen to shoot down Russian hopes, just as it had been to quash speculation last week that the Chinese have a “Plan B” to build Hinkley Point if EDF is forced to bow out. But nothing seems fanciful these days, given that the only party without a Plan B if EDF goes into meltdown in Somerset is the British government."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/sep/30/ecomodernism-launch-was-a-screw-up-of-impressive-proportions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-30T12:46:10Z","webTitle":"Ecomodernism launch was a screw-up of impressive proportions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/30/ecomodernism-launch-was-a-screw-up-of-impressive-proportions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/sep/30/ecomodernism-launch-was-a-screw-up-of-impressive-proportions","fields":{"headline":"Ecomodernism launch was a screw-up of impressive proportions","bodyText":"Well that was interesting. Last week I and a few other people attempted to launch a new environmental political movement here in the UK. If you count alienating most of your potential supporters on the very first day as a sign of success, I think things went rather well. If not ... well, I’ll get to that in a minute. The movement is “ecomodernism”, an attempt to transcend some of the political polarisation in current environment debates with a recognition that human ingenuity and technological innovation offer immense promise in tackling ecological challenges, even as poverty in developing countries is reduced and - hopefully - eradicated altogether. At the risk of seriously oversimplifying, traditional environmentalism has for decades advocated that human societies need to be reintegrated into natural systems, using renewable energy, organic farming, natural products and the like. Ecomodernism proposes instead that “decoupling” from natural systems using powerful technologies such as nuclear power and plant genetic engineering is a better way to feed and support billions of people in cities while still leaving more room for nature elsewhere. We already have an Ecomodernist manifesto, and with two of its co-authors Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger of the San Francisco-based Breakthrough Institute visiting London, we were hopeful for an exciting, movement-building week. Our aim was to appeal to a broader constituency of people who feel that traditional green politics is too negative and moralising, and yet who are not comfortable either with the right wing’s dismissiveness of environmental problems and insistence that the free market will solve everything. Even before their plane had touched down at Heathrow, problems began to emerge. As the UK’s original paid-up ecomodernist (I’m also a co-author of the manifesto) I had the responsibility of playing host. The first event I booked in - after some friendly initial meetings - was with former environment minister Owen Paterson’s thinktank UK2020, with science writer and House of Lords grandee Matt Ridley joining us on the panel. This plan did not meet with the approval of George Monbiot. “It surprises me not at all that Owen Paterson is hosting an #ecomodernism (take no political action to protect the natural world) event”, he tweeted. At the risk of stretching understatement, it is safe to say that Monbiot is not a big fan of either Paterson or Ridley. Paterson himself didn’t help by writing a typically bombastic piece in the Sunday Telegraph using ecomodernism as a platform for excoriating the “reactionary tendencies” and “relentless pessimism” of what he calls the “green blob” (ie environmentalists in general). Battle lines were beginning to be drawn, with ecomodernism - which I feel belongs if anywhere on the centre left - apparently already co-opted to fight the war against greens for the Tory right. I’ll admit that I strongly considered cancelling the event, but Shellenberger talked me out of it. His reason owed more to bloody-minded principle than any kind of political acumen. “Ever since eighth grade I’ve had the rule that I will talk and listen to who I want, and not to who other people say I should,” he told me over the phone. Fair enough. But then the Today programme rang - not me, or Shellenberger, but Paterson, and on the morning of the event set him up against Doug Parr from Greenpeace. Facepalm. The two sparred (2:43) predictably about GM crops and climate change, which I found entirely frustrating - because both Paterson and Greenpeace are wrong on each issue. Greenpeace ignores the overwhelming scientific consensus that GM crops are safe to eat, while Paterson downplays an even stronger scientific consensus that climate change is real, human-caused and a serious threat to humanity and the planet. I tried to engage in some kind of damage limitation at the actual UK2020 event by strongly criticising Paterson for ideological selectivity in his use of science, and by stating clearly that I find the term green blob “polarising and divisive”. (Paterson looked entirely unperturbed throughout.) The point of ecomodernism is to build in the successes of the environmental movement, not to try to destroy it. At the actual ecomodernism launch event that evening, hosted by Tracey Brown from the pro-science campaign group Sense About Science, the spectre of Paterson continued to overshadow proceedings. Journalists from the BBC and the Guardian both publicly and privately lambasted our obstinate naivety in being seen to represent ecomodernism on the same stage with a man who Monbiot has called “the worst environment secretary this country has ever suffered”. It doesn’t matter what you said, the hacks told me. Perceptions matter most. Fine - so call me naive. But I do believe there has to be some way to depolarise this debate in the interests of moving forward. (Call me a hypocrite too: hell, only a few months back I was myself accusing Ridley of outright “climate change denial”.) Having spent some time now with both opposing “sides” I keep being surprised by how much they actually have in common, if only they would see it. Take rewilding, Monbiot’s current campaign - both Paterson and Ridley are enthusiastic about it to a fault. There’s a broad consensus too on the need to get coal off the grid, and for the large role that both solar and next-generation nuclear power must play in this energy transition. The divisions may be wide on climate change science, but on solutions they are far less profound. (Just don’t mention windfarms or fracking.) Wildlife conservation is something that clearly motivates all of us too: Paterson spent much of his time at the event bemoaning the loss of rhinos and elephants in Africa, while Monbiot has made biodiversity a central part of his life’s work. Ecomodernism takes this as a central organising principle in fact: the whole point of intensifying agriculture and switching to more energy-dense sources of power such as nuclear is to protect as much of the natural world as possible from direct human exploitation. The realist in me reluctantly agrees that our ecomodernism launch last week was a political screw-up of impressive proportions. But the idealist in me refuses to be quieted: is it possible that in some small way by refusing to respect the tribal rules of the game we can start to find ways to transcend them? Perhaps not - from Corbyn to Trump, polarisation seems to be the political zeitgeist of our time. Our small attempt at ideological depolarisation was certainly ill-timed. But that does not mean it is necessarily doomed. I hope."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/datablog/2015/oct/20/xi-jinping-state-visit-chinas-relationship-with-britain-in-numbers","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-20T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"Xi Jinping state visit: China's relationship with Britain in numbers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/oct/20/xi-jinping-state-visit-chinas-relationship-with-britain-in-numbers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/datablog/2015/oct/20/xi-jinping-state-visit-chinas-relationship-with-britain-in-numbers","fields":{"headline":"Xi Jinping state visit: China's relationship with Britain in numbers","bodyText":"Xi Jinping is in the UK for the first state visit to Britain by a Chinese head of state in 10 years. Hu Jintao, Xi’s predecessor, visited the country in 2005, when Tony Blair was prime minister. This visit reciprocates several made by Conservative politicians to China. David Cameron led a trade mission to Asia’s biggest economy in 2013 and George Osborne was there just last month. The Chinese government is targeting economic growth of 7% this year, the lowest in over two decades. This follows a crisis over the devaluation of China’s currency and was followed by a stock-market crash. But that did not seem to dent the UK chancellor’s enthusiasm for a deepening of Sino-British ties and Osborne has called the impact on other economies “relatively limited”. Several infrastructure projects the government is pushing for rely on Chinese investment. The most notable is the new Hinckley Point nuclear power station, which Osborne talked about during his visit to China. Chinese companies invested $5.1bn (£3.29bn) in the UK during 2014, according to Baker McKenzie and the Rhodium Group. This is more than they spent in any other major European economy. One of the more notable deals was the purchase of Pizza Express by private equity firm Hony Capital. Between 2000 and 2014, Chinese investment in Britain totalled $16bn compared with $8.4bn in Germany, $8bn in France, $6.7bn in Portugal and $5.6bn in Italy. The UK government also has ambitious targets when it comes to trade. Osborne envisions China as the UK’s second largest trading partner after the US by 2025. More UK products are making their way to China than ever before, with 4.8% of British goods exported there in 2014, up from 1.3% in 2004. However, this is still considerably behind the US (12.8%), Germany (10.6%) and the Netherlands (7.9%). But while exports elsewhere have flatlined, those to China continue to grow. UK imports from China have increased a lot faster than exports. Britain’s trade deficit with the Asian country in 2014 was £19.5m. When only looking at goods, that figure increases to £22.5m, which is second only in the world to Germany. Part of the way to change that is to make Britain a place that it is easier for Chinese companies to trade with. On his trade mission to China in 2013, David Cameron said that French and German language classes should be snubbed in favour of Mandarin. The number of pupils taking Chinese GCSE has begun to increase again after a drop off in 2012, which was largely due to many switching to the alternative ICGSE qualification. Britain and China have also announced a plan that would lead to stocks on the Shanghai market being traded in London and vice versa. Although the UK isn’t the most exposed of the G7’s main economies to a slowdown in China, a significant decline in Chinese imports could lead to a substantial loss for the British economy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/21/nuclear-power-deal-george-osborne","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-21T16:49:46Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power deal shows Osborne's lack of faith in UK competence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/21/nuclear-power-deal-george-osborne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/21/nuclear-power-deal-george-osborne","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power deal shows Osborne's lack of faith in UK competence","bodyText":"George Osborne used a trip to China last week to berate Britain for losing its entrepreneurial confidence and allowing a local nuclear industry to wither. Yet his own decision to subsidise state-owned Chinese and French companies to build and operate Hinkley Point C shows a huge lack of belief in UK competence, and arguably its private sector too. If the chancellor believes that offering a generating strike price at double the current cost of wholesale energy is a good deal all round then why not invest himself? Why did he not use a properly constituted new Green Investment Bank rooted in Britain and our publicly owned bailed-out banks to raise funds for new nuclear? The British state masterminded the building and operation of a highly successful Olympics. What better legacy than starting to secure something as vital nationally as our energy infrastructure? After all, the UK government presided over the birth of the atomic civil power programme with the opening of Calder Hall in Cumbria almost 57 years ago to the day. But a succession of ministers lost their faith in nuclear and presided over the privatisation – and largely sale abroad – of assets belonging to British Energy, British Nuclear Fuels and the atomic engineering group Westinghouse. The industry was not allowed to wither so much as flogged off while ministers dithered over whether to resurrect nuclear in an attempt to boost low-carbon power as well as energy security. The answer to why Osborne has not invested himself, of course, is that he believes with fervour that the state should not be involved – or not the British state anyway. The reality is that most nuclear players in the world are directly or indirectly state-backed. EDF, 85% owned by the French government, and the Chinese (100% answerable to the Beijing politburo) are prepared to build in Britain as a high-profile European shop window for their wares as well as to turn a nice buck. And they will want to do so by using as much of their own technology and supply chain as they can. Ed Davey, the secretary of state for energy, says Britain will provide 57% of the value at Hinkley Point. Yet EDF itself has admitted to being sceptical, saying: \"There are a lot of critical components where quite frankly the UK has lost its capability.\" It has been the same in the offshore wind business where the foreign investors and operators of schemes such as the London Array windfarm put 90% of the contracts abroad. Centrica, the owner of British Gas, was there on the ground floor of the deal with EDF to build Hinkley Point C but backed away. The company then spent £500m instead buying back its own shares before raising its power prices by 10% last week. The private sector is primarily beholden to investors and not the public good, as the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welbeck, should know. A former energy industrialist himself, he suggested at the weekend that power companies should show some \"social conscience\". RWE, another of the big six energy companies, raised its household bills on Monday by roughly the same amount, to considerable outrage. Yet the public will be rightly confused about energy prices given the EDF deal shows the government is convinced that electricity prices are going to double in future. That being so, there needs to be thought about how those and other future rises will be met. The burden cannot all fall on the head of energy users at a time of rising fuel poverty. Some of it needs to be born directly by the taxpayer and by the state. VAT, for instance, could be lifted immediately. No one can predict for certain where power prices will go but the subsidy – which still needs to be given the green light by Brussels – ensures that EDF and the Chinese will get their 10% return on capital regardless. The consumers, who are meant to pay for all this, will only know if they have been sold a bad deal later down the track. And there is a lot of detail in the EDF deal that is undisclosed, not least references to the strike price being shifted around under certain circumstances. Another interesting feature is that the developers have promised only to have the new Somerset reactors operating from 2023. That gives them enormous leeway for time overruns of the kind seen on the Flamanville plant being built by EDF in France. But what happens if EDF builds it earlier than expected? What is the impact on the strike price then? For all of these questions and concerns – and there others over safety – one can at least welcome the fact that ministers have finally taken a decision to move forward on an energy project of great national significance. It will certainly embolden other potential UK nuclear investors, as Hitachi of Japan made clear. But where is Osborne's boost to British self-belief?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/jul/19/nuclear-power-leaks-new-eu-push","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-19T18:18:11Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power: leaks show new EU push","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jul/19/nuclear-power-leaks-new-eu-push","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jul/19/nuclear-power-leaks-new-eu-push","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power: leaks show new EU push","bodyText":"The European Commission is considering a radical change in rules on state aid to nuclear power in a move that would make it easier to build new reactors in Britain. Draft documents show the proposals along with negative reactions from ministers in Berlin, who have abandoned nuclear in favour of renewables. The proposals, drawn up by the EU's Competition Commission after pressure from the UK and France and leaked in a German newspaper, are regarded as a work in progress and could yet be opposed by the influential German energy commissioner, Günther Oettinger. But Rebecca Harms, co-chair of the Green parties in the European parliament, alleged a pro-nuclear camp around Oettinger and competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia were \"leading the charge\" for a U-turn on energy policy. \"The planned subsidy rules will supposedly make the construction of new nuclear power stations worthwhile again. Ailing nuclear groups are to be set back on the rails thanks to high state subsidies.\" The issue is most sensitive in Germany, where an autumn election is looming. Furthermore, the country has decided to phase out its old atomic power plants following the Fukushima accident in Japan. Berlin has instead set its face towards a major renewable power revolution. But the rethink will delight the UK and France, who are both heavily committed to new nuclear. The Department of Energy and Climate Change in London is currently negotiating with energy firm EDF about financial incentives that would encourage the French company to spend up to £14bn constructing new reactors, firstly at Hinkley Point in Somerset. It has already offered a £10bn financial \"guarantee\" and is negotiating a deal under which the power company would receive over 96p per megawatt hour over 35 years for the electrcity generated. Environmentalists have always claimed Brussels would refuse to accept any public subsidies to EDF but the draft energy document indicates this could change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/aug/06/nuclear-weapons-70-years-bombing-hiroshima-war","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-06T11:27:15Z","webTitle":"Five ways that nuclear weapons could still be used | Alex Wellerstein","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/06/nuclear-weapons-70-years-bombing-hiroshima-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/06/nuclear-weapons-70-years-bombing-hiroshima-war","fields":{"headline":"Five ways that nuclear weapons could still be used","bodyText":"On 6 August 1945, the first atomic bomb to be used in anger detonated over the city of Hiroshima, Japan. Three days later, it was Nagasaki’s turn. That was the last such attack. Despite the worst of the cold war’s close calls, like the Cuban missile crisis, no other nuclear weapons have ever been used outside of testing. Seven decades later, it is worth asking: could it happen again? Here are five possible nuclear use scenarios. Major power nuclear war During the cold war, the most likely scenario seemed to be a conflict between the US and the Soviet Union, each of which possessed many thousands of nuclear weapons. Three other countries eventually entered into the “nuclear club” as well, developing relatively large, sophisticated arsenals with global reach. Today, the idea that the US, Russia, UK, France or China would start a nuclear war seems considerably more remote than it once was. But it is not entirely off the table. The US and Russia still possess thousands of weapons each, with the other three nations possessing arsenals in the hundreds. Tensions over regional affairs, such as the fighting in Ukraine, always carry the threat of spilling over into larger conflicts. War strategists call this possibility “escalation”, where one side, perhaps without realising it, pushes the other side into a slightly larger response, which leads to another response, and so on until – at its very worse – a full nuclear exchange, the sort of thing that can kill millions. None of these powers want this sort of thing to happen – it’s not in their interest to be mutually annihilated, and their arsenals are sophisticated enough that nobody thinks they could get away with a sneak attack without fearing reprisal. Despite sometimes having blistering rhetoric, they take pains to avoid it. Could it still happen? It’s not impossible. But it’s probably not as likely to happen today as it might have in the 1960s or 1980s, when tensions were at their highest. Minor power nuclear war What about the other nuclear powers, whose arsenals are smaller and who do not yet quite have global reach? Into this category we might put India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea. Could two of these nations wage war against one another? The scenario that has kept experts up at night for a long time has been that of a “nuclear exchange” between India and Pakistan, whose proximity, comparable nuclear arsenals, and long history of disagreements make their situation seem especially dangerous. Notably, they also have different nuclear doctrines: India, with its large conventional army, has indicated it would not use nuclear weapons first, but Pakistan has indicated that in the event of an overwhelming conventional attack, it may feel sufficiently threatened to go nuclear. These sorts of “asymmetries” make nuclear wonks anxious, because it means that each side has a different “red line”, and the other side may not know exactly where that line is drawn. For many experts, something involving smaller nuclear powers might be the most likely scenario on this list for a significant nuclear exchange. Lest anyone who doesn’t live in these regions think that this is not something to worry about, scientists have run models that have concluded that even a relatively “minor” exchange of only a few hundred weapons, aside from killing millions in the region in question, might alter the global climate in such a way as to drastically reduce crop production. Nuclear weapons state v non-nuclear state Could a nuclear weapons state, minor or major, use such a weapon against a non-nuclear power? It’s obviously not impossible: the only time that nuclear weapons were ever used in war so far was one nuclear power with very few weapons (the US) against a non-nuclear power (Japan). In terms of major nuclear weapon powers, it seems unlikely that the states today with large conventional militaries would think nuclear weapons were worth using. But what about states that are more vulnerable, with smaller militaries? One might worry, say, about a war between Israel and its neighbours, or North Korea against South Korea. The tricky thing here is that with these states, the non-nuclear powers might not know where that line might be drawn for the states with the bomb. Again, these kinds of “asymmetries” might make the chance for misunderstanding high. Nuclear terrorism Since the late 1960s, people have worried about the possibility that a group of terrorists (“non-state actors”) might acquire nuclear weapons. The ability to natively produce the nuclear fuel for a bomb (enriched uranium or separated plutonium) is still restricted only to entities the size of states, though the technical requirements have decreased over the years. But it is unlikely for the moment that any terrorist group, even one with significant resources, would be able to muster the technical and industrial expertise necessary to produce the fuel themselves. Could a terrorist group steal the fuel? Potentially. For many years after the fall of the Soviet Union, there were concerns that Russian supplies of bomb-grade uranium and plutonium might be vulnerable to theft or diversion. There are no concrete indications that this has occurred, but the record-keeping for this period was so poor that it’s not clear that anybody would be able to tell if it had taken place. The situation today is considerably better, though the physical security around the plants that create and store these materials has often left a lot to be desired. As recently as 2012, for example, a group of peace activists (including an 82-year-old nun) managed to break into the American “Fort Knox” of enriched uranium. Would a state give weapon-grade fuel, or a full weapon, to a terrorist organisation? This is usually judged as not particularly likely, as scary as it sounds. In the event of a terrorist nuclear detonation, scientists would likely be able to determine the origin of the nuclear fuel in the bomb, since every plant that makes nuclear fuel has slight differences in its product output, and these can be detected even in the wake of an explosion. Could a terrorist organisation steal an in-tact weapon? Many nuclear weapons today are kitted out with sophisticated electronic locks that would prevent their being used, or tampered with, by anyone lacking the proper codes. In theory, these kinds of countermeasures would make it very hard to use a stolen nuclear weapon, even if the heist could be pulled off. Accidental nuclear detonation Could a nuclear weapon created by a nuclear state accidentally go off? In the 1950s and 1960s, the US had dozens of “near misses”, such as bombs that crashed with planes, or fell out of planes, or caught fire for extended periods of time. Could such an occurrence result in a significant nuclear yield? With older generations of weapons, it was not as unlikely as we’d like to think (Eric Schlosser’s Command and Control is a disturbing read in this respect). Many of these bombs were not designed with long-term safety as their primary consideration. Later generations of warheads were built so that the chance of an accident producing a nuclear explosion would be exceedingly rare. But we know very little about the weapon designs of most states, and whether they prioritise safety better than the US used to in its older designs. *** Taking these scenarios all together, how likely is it that the world will once again see a nuclear weapon used against a city? If we live in a world with nuclear weapons, there will always be a risk greater than zero of “it” happening again. This worrisome uncertainty is one of the truths of the nuclear age and there is no easy way around it. Even attempting to get rid of all nuclear weapons might not resolve such a fear entirely – after all, it is always possible that a state might keep a very small stockpile of nuclear fuel hidden, just in case. The threat of nuclear war was, for many decades, the primary existential threat to humanity. Today, it has probably been dethroned by the threat of man-made climate change. But the uncertainties are still high enough that nobody should feel too comfortable about a world with more than 10,000 nuclear weapons, even if things are probably not as bad as they once were. Nuclear war is no longer at the very top of the list of things to worry about – but it’s still on the list."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/08/it-could-be-lights-out-for-solar-power-under-this-government","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-08T19:24:39Z","webTitle":"It could be lights out for solar power under this government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/08/it-could-be-lights-out-for-solar-power-under-this-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/08/it-could-be-lights-out-for-solar-power-under-this-government","fields":{"headline":"It could be lights out for solar power under this government","bodyText":"Ministers rightly wring their hands over the 2,200 jobs being lost at the 98-year-old Redcar steelworks hit by low-cost Chinese competition. But they seem deaf to warnings of 27,000 jobs being potentially lost in a brand-new industry now facing crisis due to their own clumsy cuts. Almost 1,000 redundancies have already been made by the solar panel installers Mark Group and Climate Energy. No one in the industry believes this will be the end of the sad story. The latest flashpoint for “green” developers is the government plan to slash the feed-in tariff – which subsidises people installing solar panels on their home – by almost 90%. Meanwhile, an energy-efficiency regime has been scrapped with only a vague promise of a future replacement. If these were isolated examples, then companies might be willing to hang on in the hope of better things to come. But they are the latest in a series of cuts not just to solar but also to onshore wind, and come at a time when it seems maximum effort is being expended on removing roadblocks to shale-gas fracking and nuclear power. And yet new figures out this week from Bloomberg New Energy Finance show the cost of building nuclear or gas-fired power stations is rising – as wind and solar costs fall. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) says it is exactly those falls in the cost of renewable technology that make it unnecessary for the hard-pressed consumer to continue to fund a high level of subsidies. Certainly, there is a need for subsidies to be constantly reviewed and possibly adjusted – but not hit with a blunt axe. And while many people might think it is well-heeled homeowners who benefit from the feed-in tariff on their solar panelled-roofs, Alex Lockton, general manager of the installer TH White, will remind them that schools and community groups will suffer too. “We have been engaged in community solar ventures, which have been a massive success story. But they are about to get blown out of the water if the government proceeds with its latest plans to cut subsidies by 87%,” Lockton said. Most people – Lockton included – presume that the cuts agenda is being driven by George Osborne as he tries to meet Treasury austerity objectives as much as any serious attempt by the Decc to push forward energy policy. “We are the builders,” Osborne claimed at the Tory party conference this week. But government cuts and tinkering have already destroyed a precious commodity in the world of renewables, as in any sector of commerce – and that is confidence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/apr/14/jason-rezaian-iran-washington-post","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-14T15:58:32Z","webTitle":"Iran imposing 'Kafkaesque restrictions' on Jason Rezaian, Washington Post says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/14/jason-rezaian-iran-washington-post","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/apr/14/jason-rezaian-iran-washington-post","fields":{"headline":"Iran imposing 'Kafkaesque restrictions' on Jason Rezaian, Washington Post says","bodyText":"The Washington Post has accused Iran of imposing “Kafkaesque restrictions” on the case of Jason Rezaian, the paper’s Tehran bureau chief who has been imprisoned there for nearly nine months. Martin Baron, the newspaper’s executive editor, said that Iran has displayed “abject unfairness” in the case of Rezaian, who was arrested at gunpoint in July 2014. Iran’s official Fars news agency reported on Sunday that Rezaian – who holds dual Iranian and American citizenship – will be tried on charges of “espionage” and “acting against national security”. The Post’s editorial board on Monday said the charges, if accurately reported by the Iranian press, were “absurd” and said the case against the reporter would be “laughable were it not being used to justify an outrageous human rights abuse”. The charges were reported just weeks after Iran and the world’s leaders, including the US, reached a landmark agreement to stall the nation’s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions that have crippled the country’s economy. The deal was struck by the moderate government of the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, whose efforts to restore relations with the west have enraged hardliners. “Not for the first time, Mr Rezaian looks like a pawn in Iran’s domestic power struggle over the nuclear deal,” the board wrote. “That makes it all the more urgent that Mr Rouhani demonstrate his ability to control his opposition by arranging Mr Rezaian’s immediate release.” Rezaian was detained in July 2014 after security forces raided his home in Tehran and arrested him, his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who is also a journalist, and two friends. After months of having his access to a lawyer restricted, Rezaian’s family said the journalist was finally permitted to visit with his attorney, Leila Ahsan, but the meeting was held in the judge’s chambers, and they were not allowed to discuss her client’s case. Baron said on Tuesday that Ahsan and Rezaian are scheduled to meet next week, but the meeting has been limited to one hour. It is the only visit allowed in advance of the upcoming trial before Iran’s revolutionary court. “The idea that Jason – or anyone – could be allowed only one hour with a lawyer before standing trial on serious charges is simply appalling,” Baron said in a statement on Tuesday. Since his arrest, Rezaian has been subject to solitary confinement, lengthy interrogations and limited access to counsel and visits from family members. He was forced to sleep on the floor, and suffered from infections that went untreated for some time and other health concerns. Rezaian was formally charged in January, but the Iranian government has yet to publicly disclose the charges, and the local media report did not disclose the source of its information. A trial is expected to begin next month. “These kinds of Kafkaesque restrictions reflect the abject unfairness that Iran has shown at every turn in its handling of Jason’s case,” Baron said. He called reports in the Iranian press “fanciful” and “transparently absurd”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2016/jun/09/the-national-academies-gene-drive-study-has-ignored-important-and-obvious-issues","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-09T07:34:43Z","webTitle":"The National Academies’ Gene Drive study has ignored important and obvious issues","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2016/jun/09/the-national-academies-gene-drive-study-has-ignored-important-and-obvious-issues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2016/jun/09/the-national-academies-gene-drive-study-has-ignored-important-and-obvious-issues","fields":{"headline":"The National Academies’ Gene Drive study has ignored important and obvious issues","bodyText":"If there is a prize for the fastest emerging tech controversy of the century the ‘gene drive’ may have just won it. In under eighteen months the sci-fi concept of a ‘mutagenic chain reaction’ that can drive a genetic trait through an entire species (and maybe eradicate that species too) has gone from theory to published proof of principle to massively-shared TED talk (apparently an important step these days) to the subject of a US National Academy of Sciences high profile study - complete with committees, hearings, public inputs and a glossy 216 page report release. Previous technology controversies have taken anywhere from a decade to over a century to reach that level of policy attention. So why were Gene Drives put on the turbo track to science academy report status? One word: leverage. What a gene drive does is simple: it ensures that a chosen genetic trait will reliably be passed on to the next generation and every generation thereafter. This overcomes normal Mendelian genetics where a trait may be diluted or lost through the generations. The effect is that the engineered trait is driven through an entire population, re-engineering not just single organisms but enforcing the change in every descendant - re-shaping entire species and ecosystems at will. It’s a perfect case of a very high-leverage technology. Archimedes famously said “Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world. ” Gene drive developers are in effect saying “Give me a gene drive and an organism to put it in and I can wipe out species, alter ecosystems and cause large-scale modifications.” Gene drive pioneer Kevin Esvelt calls gene drives “an experiment where if you screw up, it affects the whole world”. Its not the first very high-leverage technology. Nuclear power is similar, and solar geoengineering holds the promise of global changes from small interventions. Indeed historians may well look back on last year’s proof of the ‘mutagenic chain reaction’ as biology’s ‘nuclear’ moment – analogous to Enrico Fermi’s proof of the nuclear chain reaction three quarters of a century earlier. Like the nuclear chain reaction, initiating a mutagenic chain reaction denotes awesome power over the future and has significant geopolitical ramifications. From an evolutionary perspective a gene drive might be better regarded as a ‘gene bomb’: dropped into the normal course of inheritance, it annihilates natural variety and captures the course of a species evolution from that point in time onwards. It may even annihilate the species itself. Because it spreads in the environment, a gene drive also exerts power over geography and may be a tool for controlling agriculture, food security and land. Were the National Academy of Sciences right to rush out a gene drive policy study at high speed? You betchya. And yet reading the final result , ‘Gene Drives on the Horizon’ it appears that the very thing that drove the politics to get such a report published, that awesome and troubling political power that gene drives hold, is bizarrely underplayed. Its not that it is a bad report – it is even excellent in places: it takes seriously the threat to biodiversity and warns strongly against environmental release. It has important things to say about the need for both ecological assessment and genuine public engagement . It even dares to assert that “the outcomes of engagement may be as crucial as the scientific outcomes to decisions about whether to release a gene-drive modified organism into the environment.” Yet for all that (and 200 pages of text too) the NAS’s report fails to deliver a robust policy study because it ducks some of the most important questions. It would be fair to say that there are at least four explosive issues looming “on the horizon’ for the topic of gene drives: Militarization, Commercialization, Food Security and Biodiversity. The report tackles only the last of these and downplays or entirely ignores the remaining three. Why it looked the other way on these crucial questions is hard to fathom. The NAS study was co-funded by DARPA ( a US military agency) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Both institutions are significantly invested in gene drive research. Is there a connection? Directly addressing militarization should have been obvious. There are many scenarios for potential weaponisation of gene drives as well as serious potential ramifications from unintended effects. Imagine for a moment that a hostile actor could crash the harvest of an island state by quietly introducing a gene drive or could insert a gene drive into a biting insect population to deliver toxins. Gene drive technology will quickly and inevitably end up controlled by powerful military actors and decisions on gene drive use and development will be determined by geopolitical and security considerations as well as commercial and trade interests. The same US defense research agency (DARPA) who paid for the NAS study have made it known that they are going all-in on gene drive research and development of ‘robust’ synthetic organisms. There is good reason to be worried. As a result of playing down weaponisation concerns the report entirely failed to recommend two of the most highly relevant international governance instruments that will need to brought into play to respond to the security threats posed by gene drives. The UN Environmental Modification treaty (ENMOD) was negotiated to address exactly the sort of intentional environmental modifications that gene drives would deliver. ‘Environmental modification’ includes any technique for deliberate manipulation of natural processes – the dynamics, composition or structure of the earth, “including its biota” - so ENMOD fits gene drive governance perfectly. Meanwhile the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) has already begun to discuss gene drives. The report also entirely fails to acknowledge the strong commercial drivers that may bring gene drives into agricultural use. Here commercial interests could potentially derail precautionary governance. So far, public discussion of gene drives has been intentionally framed by speculative health and conservation applications such as eradicating malarial mosquitoes. However it is the agricultural applications that could eventually come to dominate. The NAS committee considered one agricultural case study of engineering wild pigweed to be susceptible to Roundup herbicide, but failed to address how an application like this would clearly enhance the agricultural monopoly of Monsanto – the maker of Roundup - and how its use would transform agriculture and food systems. The report did note that if pigweed in North America was suppressed by a gene drive it could inadvertently end up reducing harvests of its close relative amaranth, an important food source in South America. Ouch. This lack of of consideration of food security implications is a particularly significant gap since the key published patent application on gene drives, held by Harvard University, includes a long list of over 50 weeds and almost 200 herbicides that the technology could be used for, thereby laying out a business case for licensing the patent to agrochemical companies. Neither Harvard nor any other private entity should have the power to license this high leverage technology to private agribusiness. Ideally all intellectual property relating to gene drives should be surrendered to a neutral international body under multilateral UN governance. This would be analogous to the steps that taken by governments to control intellectual property around nuclear technologies. The NAS report correctly states that “a gene drive knows no political boundaries” and identifies the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and its protocols as one of the key international governance bodies that must address gene drive governance (the three that it fails to mention are ENMOD, the Biological weapons Convention and the UN Committee on World Food Security). This debate now has to move quickly to that international arena. In Cancun in December 2016 the 194 countries that are parties to the CBD will be making decisions on governance of synthetic biology at the thirteenth conference of the Parties (COP13). Gene Drives are synthetic biology and should be addressed there too. At the least the CBD should take note of this NAS report and also the warning comments about gene drives made by its own Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group on Synthetic Biology in order to agree an international moratorium on release of gene drives. Luckily, this would be in line with the NAS’s key recommendation that “there is insufficient evidence to support the environmental release of gene drives.” Could Gene Drives go from proof of principle to UN decision in under two years? Now that would be responsive governance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/dec/17/uk-cuts-renewable-energy-make-a-mockery-of-its-pledge-paris-climate-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-17T11:13:56Z","webTitle":"UK cuts to renewable energy make a mockery of its pledge at Paris climate talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/dec/17/uk-cuts-renewable-energy-make-a-mockery-of-its-pledge-paris-climate-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/dec/17/uk-cuts-renewable-energy-make-a-mockery-of-its-pledge-paris-climate-talks","fields":{"headline":"UK cuts to renewable energy make a mockery of its pledge at Paris climate talks","bodyText":"“My priority is to ensure energy bills for hardworking families and businesses are kept as low as possible,” said energy and climate change secretary Amber Rudd, announcing sweeping cuts to renewable energy subsidies on Thursday. Yet this rationale crumbles to dust under the slightest scrutiny. The nations’s most popular energy technology, solar power, adds just a few pounds a year to energy bills. The best cost-saving measure - energy efficiency - has had its support slashed by Rudd and the Conservative party has forgone the cheapest of all low-carbon energy, onshore wind. Coming just five days after a global agreement on climate change was signed in Paris, which Rudd attended and said was ”vital for our long-term economic and global security”, the government was under heavy pressure to row back on its proposed 87% cut to subsidies for solar panels on homes. It did, reducing the cut to 65%. But it has also imposed a cap on the total subsidy paid out, meaning the rate of domestic solar installations is set to halve, according to the Solar Trade Association. Larger solar installations (more than 1MW) on roofs and in solar parks have had their support cut by 85% and 71% respectively, meaning the market for the most cost-effective projects is all but dead. All this while the global solar market soars and while the UK solar industry had already said it wanted to be off subsidies by 2020. These cuts are snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. It makes a mockery of prime minister David Cameron’s speech to the Paris climate summit: “Instead of making excuses tomorrow to our children and grandchildren, we should be taking action against climate change today.” Rudd said on Thursday: “We have to get the balance right and I am clear that subsidies should be temporary, not part of a permanent business model. When the cost of technologies come down, so should the consumer-funded support.” Yet this only applies to renewable energy. Nuclear power, whose cost never comes down, will enjoy 35 years of bill payer subsidies to support Hinkley Point, the most expensive power station ever built. Fossil fuels enjoy £27bn a year in subsidies in the UK, according to the IMF, £425 for every man, woman and child in the country. Are these coming down? No, the UK is the only G7 nation increasing fossil fuel subsidies. What about carbon capture and storage (CCS), the technology deemed vital to tackling global warming by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change? The UK government’s own advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, warn that without CSS the costs of meeting carbon targets will double. But at the last moment, the government reneged on its manifesto commitment and last month abandoned a £1bn competition for demonstration plants. Does that sound like “ensuring energy bills for hardworking families and businesses are kept as low as possible” or “taking action against climate change today”? Action is certainly being taken on shale gas, with measures to allow fracking under protected areas pushed through on Wednesday. Rudd signalled a new dash for gas power stations just a month ago. Nick Mabey, from the thinktank E3G, summed this up pithily: “The government replaces domestic renewables and efficiency with imported gas, then proposes shale to solve the [energy] security problem. Mad.” In May, Rudd said: “I want to unleash a new solar revolution – we have a million people living under roofs with solar panels and that number needs to increase.” When the renewable energy industry has friends like Rudd, who needs enemies? But enemies there are, principally George Osborne, the driving force behind the barrage of anti-green moves since May’s election. Matthew Spencer, at the Green Alliance, has wise advice for the chancellor: “Unlike budget announcements, successful infrastructure policy can’t be made tactically; if Osborne does eventually become prime minister, he risks inheriting an energy policy mess he has created, and will find that the remaining policy levers in his hands don’t produce quick results ... He’d better not leave it too late to get on the right side of the [climate] argument.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/jul/06/edf-800m-windfall-subsidy-scheme-capacity-market-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-06T14:23:33Z","webTitle":"EDF in line for £800m windfall from subsidy scheme to keep lights on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/06/edf-800m-windfall-subsidy-scheme-capacity-market-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jul/06/edf-800m-windfall-subsidy-scheme-capacity-market-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"EDF in line for £800m windfall from subsidy scheme to keep lights on","bodyText":"EDF, which operates most of Britain's nuclear power stations, could be in line for an £800m windfall via a loophole in a government subsidy scheme aimed at keeping the lights on at times of peak demand.

Most industry experts assumed that the \"capacity market\" scheme – the cost of which will be passed to the consumer – was designed to ensure that the many gas-fired power stations threatened with closure would be kept open. But the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) now admits the scheme will be open to all forms of generation including nuclear, which has low operating costs and therefore could undercut its competitors in the auction to be run by the National Grid. The market is meant to start with that auction later this year although the ratings agency Moody's has warned it may be delayed if it is found to breach European commission rules on state aid. All but one of the UK's nuclear power plants are owned by the largely French state-owned EDF, whose UK atomic portfolio includes seven ageing plants due to be closed by 2024. Cornwall Energy, a power industry consultant, estimates that successful bids by EDF using all seven of its existing plants could be worth £223m in the 2018-19 financial year and £818m in total by 2023. Lawson Steele, a utility analyst with the investment bank Berenberg, described the potential for nuclear to take advantage of the scheme as a \"slight anomaly\". But an energy trader, who asked not to be named, said: \"This is a massive windfall for EDF. The cost to generate nuclear energy is low, so these plants are profitable, whereas gas-fired generation is marginal.\" EDF was unwilling to say whether it would participate in the capacity auctions, which will be run in December, with the power having to be made available from 2018. But a spokesman said: \"We understand that the capacity auction will be technology neutral and theoretically rules in nuclear power plants. \"We won't be giving any steer on what power plants we will be entering into the capacity auction until the pre-qualification period in August.\" If it is built, EDF's Hinkley Point C power plant will not be eligible for the capacity market as it will be subject to another, more generous subsidy scheme known as \"contracts for difference\" (CfD). Tory MP Tim Yeo, chairman of the energy and climate change select committee, was told about the decision to include nuclear power by the Guardian. He said he was surprised at the move. \"The capacity market is designed to provide flexibility and this is a rather perverse consequence of that. Decc seem to have rather a lot on their plate and they're quite an under-resourced team.\" The department said it was too early to predict who would win what in the future bidding. \"It is important to note that the capacity contracted in the capacity market will be determined by a competitive auction so it is not possible to say with certainty what proportions of each technologies will be procured.\" Tom Greatrex, the shadow energy minister, said the value of letting existing nuclear capacity take part in the auctions seemed dubious. \"Nuclear is a significant baseload power source, but is not flexible enough to be part of an efficient capacity market. There are, therefore, serious questions as to why Decc ministers have given nuclear power stations the green light to bid for capacity payments when they won't be able to add flexible capacity to the mix.\" Fellow Labour MP Alan Whitehead, who is a member of the energy and climate change select committee, wrote in a blog that the capacity market system was far too expensive and was five times more than a previous government plan to set up an emergency \"strategic reserve\". The capacity scheme is also too extensive, he wrote: \"It strikes me as rather like announcing that you are going to concrete over the Somerset levels to a height of six feet and then proclaim that a flood prevention strategy is now fully in place.\" In a report on the UK energy sector, Moody's predicted the European commission may determine that the design of the capacity payments scheme may have to be changed, triggering delays. Decc said that it remained confident that this would not happen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2015/jul/26/weatherwatch-heatwave-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-26T20:30:03Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: Some like it hot – but not this hot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/26/weatherwatch-heatwave-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2015/jul/26/weatherwatch-heatwave-europe","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: Some like it hot – but not this hot","bodyText":"In contrast to the wet and windy start to the summer in the northern half of Britain, the south-east of England is looking rather parched right now, even after the weekend’s rain. The south-east has been on the margin of a brutal heatwave which has taken grip in central and southern Europe, with temperatures reaching over 40C in many places. What is particularly shocking about this heat is its persistence, because it began early, in June. For now the extreme heat has returned to its more normal habitat, confining itself to north Africa and southern parts of the Mediterranean but over the past weeks long standing temperature records have been tumbling across Europe. Germany’s all-time highest temperature record was broken on 5 July with 40.3C in Bavaria, and in the Netherlands, Maastricht set a new national record for July of 38.2C. Spain set new record temperatures for both May and June, and this month Geneva recorded the highest ever temperature in Switzerland north of the Alps, with 39.7C. The impacts have been felt far and wide, especially in the power markets. Swiss and French nuclear power plants have been forced to reduce power output to avoid heating the Rhine and Aare rivers with their waste water. And, ironically, solar power plants have suffered slight reductions in power output because of the intense heat. Wildfires raging in Greece from heat and drought have sent up vast plumes of smoke that are clearly visible on satellite pictures. Such heat takes its toll on public health too: an estimated 700 people died in France in the heatwave at the end of June and early July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jan/27/edf-hinkley-point-nuclear-power-strategy-uk-george-osborne-chinese-sizewell-bradwell","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-27T19:10:02Z","webTitle":"EDF still at table but nuclear could be critical for Osborne","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jan/27/edf-hinkley-point-nuclear-power-strategy-uk-george-osborne-chinese-sizewell-bradwell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jan/27/edf-hinkley-point-nuclear-power-strategy-uk-george-osborne-chinese-sizewell-bradwell","fields":{"headline":"EDF still at table but nuclear could be critical for Osborne","bodyText":"What if EDF says no to Hinkley Point? What if the French power generator, under pressure from its unions and potential lenders, decides it can’t finance the £18bn project, even with the Chinese chipping in? After all, the disgruntled French workers make a reasonable point. EDF’s last big foreign adventure, in Finland, is nine years behind schedule and massively over-budget, so why risk another expedition? EDF’s share price, remember, is down 85% since 2004: the company is in a weak position to resist its local critics. The short answer is that the UK’s nuclear strategy would be in tatters if EDF backs out. If EDF can’t get financing for Hinkley, then Sizewell C, the company’s intended follow-on project in Suffolk, would also bite the dust. The same goes for the next plant at Bradwell in Essex, where Chinese constructors are supposed to be taking the lead but are relying on Hinkley’s and Sizewell’s infrastructure and momentum. And, if the UK’s nuclear strategy becomes a non-runner, then the government’s entire energy policy is dead. By the mid-2030s, Hinkley and other new nuclear plants are supposed to have replaced the current clapped-out fleet and added capacity on top. Onshore wind couldn’t fill the gap, and anyway the government hates turbines on land. Offshore wind is currently more expensive than nuclear. Building a new generation of gas-fired stations would, almost certainly, mean missing the legally binding targets for reducing carbon emissions. George Osborne could, of course, decide that the Treasury should finance Hinkley, but that would be a monumental U-turn. It would mean abandoning the core principle that Hinkley’s costs must be kept away from the public debt. UK taxpayers would be exposed to the same potential cost overruns that are causing so much angst at EDF. The position is not yet that dire for the government. EDF is still at the table and the French government, when push comes to shove, tends to be supportive. The best guess – still – is that the funds will be forthcoming. If not, Osborne’s difficulty with Google’s tax bill would look like a storm in a tea cup. All the subsidies, and the grovelling for Chinese cash, would have yielded nothing except proof of the horrible economics of nuclear power in the 21st century. Worst is not yet over for RBS Put away the bunting. Royal Bank of Scotland will not be announcing a profit for 2015 next month. In truth, such an outcome was already an outside bet, but chief executive Ross McEwan removed all doubt on Wednesday by serving yet another dish of write-offs and provisions, covering payment protection insurance, the Coutts private bank and mortgage-backed securities in the US. By way of novelty, there was an unfamiliar side order in the form of £4.2bn to cover the deficit in the pension fund. That doesn’t hurt the profits line, but the others all do. It will be the eighth year of losses. Can shareholders – in other words, us – dare to dream that the worst is over? Not yet. When finance director Ewen Stevenson speaks of “a few more bumps” this year, neither he nor anyone else can know whether the biggest bump will throw RBS into a ninth year of losses. The big unknown is the settlement with the US Department of Justice on those same mortgage securities. It could be £2bn, but could be £6bn, and current provisions cover only non-DoJ actions. RBS can absorb the latest hits, and even the DoJ’s heftiest blows, because its capital position is strong. The City, though, had started to dream of dividends or a share buyback in 2017. Those hopes are still alive but Wednesday’s fresh scars are a serious setback. George Osborne, in retrospect, did well to flog 5% of RBS shares at 330p last August. But, at today’s 256p, a three-year low, he only has one option: sit back and wait – again. Shell’s BG suit wears thin for dissenters Ben van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive, says he is “delighted with the positive shareholder vote and the confidence that shareholders have shown in the strategic logic of the combination of Shell and BG”. Well, yes, 83% is an overwhelming majority, but 17% dissent is on the high side. Shell is a corporate titan and this was, in effect, a vote of confidence in the board’s judgment. The company also had some of the world’s most powerful investment banks acting as whippers-in. The real test is where Shell stands in two years time and whether it can maintain its dividend. Van Beurden knew the sliding oil price made his BG pitch harder to sell – but he would surely have hoped to keep the scepticism in single figures."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cartoon/2013/oct/22/martin-rowson-nuclear-power-station-cartoon","type":"picture","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-22T00:17:31Z","webTitle":"Martin Rowson on a new nuclear power station for Britain – cartoon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cartoon/2013/oct/22/martin-rowson-nuclear-power-station-cartoon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cartoon/2013/oct/22/martin-rowson-nuclear-power-station-cartoon","fields":{"headline":"Martin Rowson on a new nuclear power station for Britain – cartoon","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2014/sep/14/climate-debate-must-include-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-14T19:04:54Z","webTitle":"The climate debate must include nuclear | @guardianletters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/14/climate-debate-must-include-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/sep/14/climate-debate-must-include-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"The climate debate must include nuclear","bodyText":"You published two letters on 8 September setting out the importance of acting against climate change. The implication of both is that the government needs to do more. Both were signed by individuals who lobby against civil nuclear power, by far the major source of carbon-free electricity around the world. Hinkley Point C, when built, will produce more carbon-free electricity than all windfarms currently operational in the UK. To act as if carbon-free nuclear is not part of the solution is destructive and threatens our planet. This is understood by more thoughtful environmentalists but not apparently Greenpeace, WFF or the Green party. As a consequence their credibility in matters of climate change and decarbonisation is deservedly very low indeed. David Mowat MP Conservative, Warrington South • The call for action on climate change on 21 September from Ricken Patel et al coincides with the middle of Community Energy Fortnight. Community groups are taking action on climate change by developing renewable energy projects and by promoting energy efficiency measures. These groups reduce their communities’ carbon emissions and reduce fuel poverty, fuel bills and reliance on fossil fuels. Liz Meddings Hillfields Energy Group, Bristol • 21 September is not only the start of a summit on climate change. It is also UN Peace Day – and a chance to highlight the links betwen the two issues. Armed conflict causes environmental damage, contributes to global warming by its use of fossil fuels (the US military is the largest single user of them), and inhibits the actions needed to deal with global warming. A fraction of thecurrent annual $1.75tn military spending transferred to mitigation of and adaptation to climate change could transform the situation, and remove many of the causes of conflict – a benign circle.

There will be efforts to save something from the ruins, but the financial and trading truths are brutal. This has not happened, however, in a day, or even over the past few years. Rather the plight of British steel making is the culmination of 40 years of refusal to organise economic, financial and industrial policy to support the generation of value. This is done in the laissez-faire belief – contested even in economic theory – that any such attempt is self-defeating. Business secretary Sajid Javid personifies this view. In fact, he is surely the most ideologically driven and least practical politician to hold this key post since the war. The most generous interpretation is that this is creative destruction at work. Steel was an integral element of an industrial economy now giving way to a new knowledge-based capitalism where know-how is more important than brawn. It is tragic for those whose livelihoods and skills are now redundant, but it was no less tragic for ostlers, sailmakers and coal miners in their day. The trouble is that Britain is very good at destruction, much less good at the creative part. Nor is it clear that steel’s days are over: its usage in a range of key functions – from transport to construction – remains fundamental and is growing. Rather, the economic behemoth China has monumentally over-invested in steel, for which there is too little domestic demand, and is now flooding world markets. Britain, with a systemically overvalued exchange rate, porous market, high energy costs and ideological refusal to join others in the EU to deter imports dumped below cost with higher tariffs, is uniquely exposed to the threat. Now up to 40,000 workers directly and indirectly connected to steel production are about to lose their livelihoods. Beneath the specifics of the steel industry lie more deep-seated problems. The day after Tata’s announcement, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) disclosed that the country’s balance of payments deficit in the last quarter of 2015 climbed to a record 7% of GDP. Britain’s international accounts are more in the red than those of any other developed country. Imports of goods and services, which have steadily outstripped exports for decades, are now to be given an extra impetus by the closure of UK steel capacity. What’s more, the same weaknesses that plague the old also inhibit the growth of the new. After the interventionism of the 1930s – or even the 1950s and 1960s – Britain could boast dozens of substantial companies representing industries as disparate as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, aerospace and electronics. Not so in 2016. Only two high-tech companies are represented in the FTSE 100 – ARM and Sage. Another 20 years of the laissez-faire framework Javid cherishes – he is a devotee of the wild philosopher of hyper-libertarianism Ayn Rand – and the economy will be eviscerated, with a current account deficit so large it cannot be conventionally financed. The consequences – on living standards, employment, inflation, interest rates and house prices – will be severe. Start with the pound. Since it was forced out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992, the consensus has been that the state should make no effort to manage the exchange rate. The result is that for all but four or five of the past 24 years, the pound has been well above any calculation of its real value, buoyed up by money flowing into the UK to buy our companies and our property, notwithstanding our ever higher trade deficit. This is an auction of national assets unmatched by any other industrialised country. But it also makes it harder for our producers to compete internationally. To manage the exchange rate, to shadow the euro or dollar, or even to consider joining the euro to lock in a competitive rate, are rejected with irrational hysteria. Result – a current account deficit of 7% of GDP. Britain is rightly committed to free trade, but again to the point of irrationality. China’s Leninist corporatism cannot be understood as a market economy. The world’s steel producers should not be rendered uneconomic because China’s Communist party has overinvested in steel production to create jobs vital to its collapsing political legitimacy, and so dumps steel in world markets at below cost. It is an open and shut case of dumping, with protections provided by the rules of the WTO. But the UK government, positioning itself as China’s biggest friend in the west in order to win investment in the UK nuclear industry, blocked the EU’s attempts to invoke the WTO rules. Thus we destroy our steel industry in exchange for Chinese state ownership of the next generation of nuclear power stations. So the list continues. The combination of a privatised electricity industry – insisting on sky-high returns for strategic investment – with demanding targets for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions has meant incredible rises in the price of electricity, especially for industrial users such as steel. Relief is too little and too late. More broadly the same effects impact across all of what remains of our manufacturing sector – so it becomes a less solid market for steel, adding one more twist to the downward vicious circle. Britain needs a genuine march of the makers, in George Osborne’s phrase. But that would need a completely different policy paradigm, overturning the failed attempts of the past 40 years. There was a nascent attempt, launched by Peter Mandelson in 2009, and followed through in the coalition government by business secretary Vince Cable and science minister David Willetts, to create an intelligent industrial strategy. Eight great technologies were identified in which Britain had strengths; convening councils were created to remove obstacles to their growth; the agency Innovate UK geared up to support frontier innovation; and a network of Catapults created to stimulate knowledge transfer, business start-ups and scale-ups. Foreign governments, impressed by what was happening, commissioned reports on the innovative UK. Then came Javid, keen to deliver the swingeing cuts in his budget demanded by Osborne in his quest for the 36% state. After hobbling the admired innovation infrastructure with its role for a smart state, his first piece of legislation is the trade union bill. Javid tilts at Thatcherite windmills – and shows little understanding of today’s industrial revolution. Nor does he seem to grasp how government can co-create opportunities with entrepreneurs – as well as ensuring that the big picture is as attractive as possible. Something face-saving will be put together to soften the steel crisis, but there are bigger lessons to be learned. Be sure they will be ignored. The enfeebled Labour party is unable to press the points home and the Tory party remains transfixed by anti-state, laissez-faire nihilism. I mix rage with sadness for the next generation, and the inheritance it has been left."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jul/30/manchester-northern-powerhouse-china-investment-football-golden-goal","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-30T15:00:09Z","webTitle":"Football scores a golden goal to keep China’s UK investors onside","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/manchester-northern-powerhouse-china-investment-football-golden-goal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/manchester-northern-powerhouse-china-investment-football-golden-goal","fields":{"headline":"Football scores a golden goal to keep China’s UK investors onside","bodyText":"Once we had ping-pong diplomacy, now it is football-fuelled dealmaking. When Yaya Touré ambled into a small bar near Beijing’s Workers’ Stadium last week, little did he know he was the latest big name ambassador for the “northern powerhouse”. The Manchester City star offered a bemused smile as more than 50 Chinese fans rushed forward screaming his name, one holding aloft a scarf that declared: “I am a Cityzen.” Touré’s guest appearance – 24 hours before City’s abandoned showcase derby match against Manchester United in the Chinese capital – was Manchester’s latest attempt to cash in on China’s record-breaking spending spree by appealing to its football-mad investors. The prize? A share of the $100bn-plus in overseas deals done by Chinese firms in the first quarter of this year – more than they spent in all of 2015, itself a record. These follow President Xi Jinping’s “one belt, one road” policy, aiming to address a slowing economy, falling currency and saturated domestic market. China’s cash-rich companies are looking increasingly outside London, with recent eye-catching deals ranging from a 60-year, billion-pound construction deal in Sheffield to the £45m takeover of Wolverhampton Wanderers by China’s answer to Warren Buffett, and a spate of Manchester property investments. At an investment summit hosted by Manchester’s business leaders last Monday, ex-players Dwight Yorke, Sun Jihai and Mike Summerbee entertained a coterie of Chinese executives before the dealmaking got under way at a plush hotel near Beijing’s Bird’s Nest stadium. Barbara Woodward, Britain’s ambassador to China, who was at the event, said: “Chinese investors are looking for very big projects. That billion into Sheffield is a very big project that can transform the city centre. There are lots of investors with a few million to spend, but in China there is a large-scale approach which is very suited to helping us regenerate, particularly the north of England.” In her first interview since Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, Woodward insisted the outcome had not shaken investor confidence in the UK. “This is a month on now and we’ve been very clear with the Chinese that the core investing fundamentals – skilled workforce, low tax, rule of law – all apply still. The Chinese are all signalling to us that frankly, with the pound lower than it was, then we’re a pretty attractive investment destination.” The ambassador also insists that the so-called golden era of British-Chinese relations – led by former chancellor George Osborne – was “not in trouble” despite the economic uncertainty, and experts predicting a cooling of the relationship under Theresa May. “I don’t think you should abandon the golden era at all – and the Chinese side too were very keen on that. No one is walking away from that,” she said. It may be months before the deals negotiated last week in Beijing become public, but executives present insisted that Brexit had not put the brakes on inward investment. “I’ve been very reassured,” said Sir Howard Bernstein, Manchester city council’s chief executive, who led the delegation in Beijing and said there were three or four big investments under way. A Manchester-based executive at property broker James Lang LaSalle, which advises clients on flagship London properties including the Grosvenor House hotel, said he was “very hopeful” that new Chinese-funded deals would be announced within the next three months. Gary Neville, the ex-England footballer turned property magnate, last week became the latest to unveil plans part-funded by China that will transform Manchester city centre. His £200m project – which includes £15m from Chinese investors – will see the construction of two new skyscrapers, a five-star hotel and a split-level public plaza in place of an “underused and unwelcoming” block that will be torn down. Britain’s decision to leave the EU, said Neville, had prompted him to fly out to Singapore to offer soothing words to his business partners. “There is a level of uncertainty – there’s even more uncertainty overseas … I suppose in some ways we had a decision to make: do we go or do we stop? Our duty as Mancunians is to go.” Neville’s is just one Manchester project to benefit from Chinese funding following the state visit by Xi to London and Manchester last October. Flanked by David Cameron and Osborne, the Chinese president bestowed his blessing on the then-chancellor’s “northern powerhouse”, visited Manchester City’s football academy – taking a famous selfie with striker Sergio Agüero and Cameron – and announced the first direct flight from Manchester to mainland China. Ken O’Toole, chief executive of Manchester airport, said the new Hainan Airlines service had so far filled more than 90% of seats and could smooth the way for further big-money investment deals in the north. The airport is understood to be edging closer to another new direct flight to China, this time to Shanghai. “Prior to the existence of a direct flight, this money would have gone to London and the south-east but there is now clear recognition of the strength of Manchester and the north as an investment proposition, particularly in China,” he said. Manchester’s estate agents have for some time been reporting heavy interest for the smartest residential projects from Chinese buyers. In some developments, they are reported to account for up to 25% of buyers, as they seek better value than they can get in London. But where President Xi goes, money follows. Less than two months after his visit, media tycoon Li Ruigang paid £265m to acquire a 13% stake in Manchester City’s parent company. The Beijing Construction and Engineering Group (BCEG), which is backing the Gary Neville-fronted project and whose chairman was at the event hosted by Manchester’s business leaders last week, has also agreed to provide funding to kickstart a £650m development of apartments, office space and gardens at Middlewood Locks in Salford. The Locks was one of 20 northern projects that together formed a “pitchbook” of investment opportunities, which Osborne took to Chengdu last year as part of a bid to raise up to £24bn to fund development in the northern powerhouse. A Treasury spokeswoman said discussions were ongoing with more than 15 different Chinese investors over projects highlighted in the pitchbook. BCEG is also an investor in Airport City, an £800m commercial district close to Manchester airport that includes a £130m “China cluster” – called Wuhan Square and Shenzhen Gardens – designed to attract Chinese firms setting up in the UK. Last September, a group based in Xinjiang, Hualing Group, also agreed to invest £60m in Middlewood Locks, the Thorpe Park business zone in Leeds and a digital campus in Sheffield in a deal with the developer Scarborough Group. But it is the 60-year, £1bn Sheffield deal with Sichuan Guodong Construction Group, announced earlier this month after 18 months of negotiations, that marks China’s biggest investment outside London to date. The first tranche of the funding will see £220m spent on a handful of projects in Sheffield’s city centre, including the city’s first five-star hotel, together with residential blocks and student accommodation that according to the city council should create “hundreds if not thousands” of jobs in South Yorkshire. A board made up of council leaders and Sichuan Guodong executives will meet twice a year, to jointly decide which projects to approve. Leigh Bramall, Sheffield city council’s deputy leader, said the prospect of connecting Leeds, Manchester, Sheffield and Liverpool within 30 minutes of each other – by much-needed upgrades to rail and road infrastructure – effectively made much of the north “one city, on a Chinese scale”. While 30 minutes to connect the four cities may appear a distant dream, the Labour peer Lord Adonis said journey times between Manchester and Leeds should be reduced to 40 minutes – from between one and two hours currently – by 2022. In the March budget, Osborne unveiled plans for a high-speed line from Manchester to Leeds – HS3 – and an 18-mile underground road tunnel beneath the Peak District, with initial funding amounting to £300m. While the announcements were broadly welcomed, there has been criticism that HS3 ignores major cities like Liverpool and Sheffield. Bramall said there remains an outdated view of the north among Britain’s London-centric investment community: “Some British investors have got a somewhat bucolic view of the north, or certainly have had historically,” he said. “The Chinese look at us with a fresh pair of eyes. They see the potential for big cities that have got great universities, with a fantastic quality of life, and they want to be part of the growth of those cities and make returns that way.” There is, however, uncertainty about Britain’s relationship with China post-Brexit and post-Osborne – especially since the government’s decision not to simply rubber-stamp the Hinkley Point nuclear power project, which has substantial Chinese backing. Steve Tsang, a professor of contemporary Chinese studies at Nottingham University, said May’s government would probably seek to cool Osborne’s “at any price” approach, which led to him being praised by Chinese state media for not emphasising human rights. “I think Hammond and May will want to have the relationship on a more normal basis,” Tsang said. And that could be bad news for the northern powerhouse plans: “If they do I would expect the Chinese government to be less helpful on the economic side. “It is the beginning of the end of the so-called golden relationship but I’m not saying it’s over – yet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/oct/21/nuclear-power-hinckley-deal-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-21T09:12:44Z","webTitle":"Welcome back nuclear power, our costly, unpopular light in the dark | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/21/nuclear-power-hinckley-deal-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/21/nuclear-power-hinckley-deal-energy","fields":{"headline":"Welcome back nuclear power, our costly, unpopular light in the dark","bodyText":"The best to be said of the Hinkley nuclear power station announced this morning by the government is that it was announced at all. After decades of indecision, the certain prospect of lights going out across Britain as coal stations closed finally forced Whitehall's hand. The coalition has taken a decision on energy, praise be. And nuclear is at least cheaper than wind. Beyond that, all is chaos. Buying 7% of Britain's electricity supply for 35 years from the French and Chinese at double the current (already inflated) price, suggests a nation gone soft in the head. There is not even \"risk transfer\", since risk has been all but eliminated from the contract. When asked by the BBC why foreign taxpayers should benefit from this lavish profiteering at the expense of British energy consumers, the relevant minister, Ed Davey, could not answer the question. The truth is that with billions already going on wind and more still on such wild projects as HS2 and aircraft carriers, the Treasury simply cannot find £14bn more and refuses to borrow it. Two foreign states are doing the borrowing for us, financed by a massive burden-transfer on to future British consumers, the proxy taxpayers of tomorrow. Nuclear remains a scientific tragedy. Proffered as key to the future in the 1950s, it has acquired the zombie status of cell cloning and GM foods, because of the taboo attached to its very rare accidents. Though the safest form of power to generate, it is wildly over-regulated and thus far more expensive than need be. Why a nuclear submarine can fit a serviceable reactor into its shell but local communities cannot remains a mystery. Driving down the cost of nuclear in all its forms is still the holy grail of energy technology. Meanwhile, if people really think carbon reduction is a \"critical\" matter, then the urgent answer remains gas, half as polluting as coal and in near universal abundance. But gas fracking is fast acquiring the taboo of nuclear. We seem stuck in the age of unreason. But at least nuclear is back in the energy mix."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2015/oct/12/ladybird-books-introduce-peter-and-jane-to-hipsters-and-hangovers","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-12T10:57:40Z","webTitle":"Ladybird books introduce Peter and Jane to hipsters and hangovers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/12/ladybird-books-introduce-peter-and-jane-to-hipsters-and-hangovers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/oct/12/ladybird-books-introduce-peter-and-jane-to-hipsters-and-hangovers","fields":{"headline":"Ladybird books introduce Peter and Jane to hipsters and hangovers","bodyText":"Once famous for its earnest, wholesome books that introduced British children to topics such as space travel, nuclear power and the gunpowder plot, the publisher Ladybird is launching a series of guides to help cynical adults make sense of modern life, from hipsters to hangovers. Embracing the trend for spoof Ladybird editions that juxtapose the twee and genteel imagery with captions rewritten for comic effect, the companysaid its “kidult” range is intended to “enable grown-ups to think they have taught themselves to cope”. The eight new books – penned by Jason Hazeley and Joel Morris, the writers of the BBC comedy show Miranda – will be published next month as part of Ladybird Books’ centenary celebrations. Illustrations of bearded, pipe-smoking men and women with immaculate hair appear alongside the large, simple script, which Hazeley has described as “light and silly and funny”. One passage in the Ladybird Book of the Hipster explains: This is a hipster. He is childless, unaccountably wealthy, and always well turned out. He likes art, porridge, scarves, anything reclaimed from French factories, like this dog rack. The Ladybird Book of the Mid-Life Crisis, another of the titles, begins with: When we’re young we wonder if we’ll be a surgeon or an astronaut. We can be anything we want to be. Then one day we can’t. Morris said: “That bit makes me cry. It’s too close to the bone.” He told the Independent he wanted to help adults make sense of the world, just as the classic books had helped children through the decades understand how locomotives and computers work. Hazeley and Morris said they decided to use original illustrations of previous Ladybird books and to “write as if we were time travellers from the 1960s looking at stuff such as online dating and nightclubs”. Going through Penguin’s vast archive of Ladybird artwork they realised that pictures depicting first dates and binge drinking were hard to come by: in the classic books, “mum is at home with the kids and dad is at work fixing a Lancaster bomber”, said Morris. “It’s hard to find images that have men and women in the same picture. Luckily, that’s become part of the joke.” Other titles in the new series include The Ladybird Book of Dating, and Mindfulness. Although the trend for spoof Ladybird books has been appropriated by the publisher, a search online reveals parody Ladybird artwork for titles such as Hot Dads, Ménage à trois, and The Futility of Existence. Last year, Miriam Elia, an artist and comedian, was ordered by publisher Penguin to stop selling her satirical work in which Ladybird characters Peter and Jane were mashed with Tracey Emin-style conceptual art. She was told her art book breached Ladybird copyright. After publishing a brief run of 1,000 privately printed books – selling them for £20 each – Elia was told that if she continued to sell copies, the courts would be rule that the books be seized."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/21/china-nuclear-power-britain-outdated-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-21T05:29:00Z","webTitle":"China's need for nuclear power leads Britain to revive outdated technology","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/21/china-nuclear-power-britain-outdated-technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/21/china-nuclear-power-britain-outdated-technology","fields":{"headline":"China's need for nuclear power leads Britain to revive outdated technology","bodyText":"The signing of a nuclear deal between EDF and the government is a landmark event for power generation. Today's go-ahead for the Hinkley Point C plant shows ministers are prepared to commit Britain to provide decades of guaranteed financial returns (paid for by you and me as energy users) to companies in return for winning huge slugs of investment for new power stations. The move, which also involves Chinese cash, should encourage other major investors such as Hitachi of Japan to proceed with their own nuclear plans, giving some longer-term certainty to power supplies. But it will do nothing to tackle the possibility of short-term power blackouts. Ministers insist that the commitment to provide Hinkley Point with a guaranteed price of around double the market rate is not a subsidy. The final figure of £92.50 is a considerable step up from the £80 per MWhr said to be on the table when negotiations began in earnest, and that figure is said by some calculations to be worth around £80bn in guaranteed revenues, the cost of nine Olympics. Critics will accuse the government of providing subsidies to an old technology that should not need handouts, while pointing out the safety dangers and the unsolved waste disposal problems raised by new nuclear. Questions will also be asked about the wisdom of providing a country alleged to be involved in cyber-spying, access to sensitive energy infrastructure via the involvement of a state-owned firm. The biggest plus for nuclear is that something definite has happened at all: a speculative proposal from Tony Blair in 2006 has finally been transformed into a concrete plan to spend £14bn building a new plant today. Nuclear power had been consigned to history by most policymakers in western Europe since a partial meltdown of the US plant at Three Mile Island in 1979 and then a catastrophic accident at Chernobyl in the Ukraine seven years later sent the equivalent radioactive fallout of 20 Hiroshima bombs as far afield as the Scottish Highlands. But atomic power found its way back on to the political agenda with a then-Labour government desperately seeking ways of finding low carbon alternatives to fossil fuels to tackle climate change but also energy security. Emerging economies such as China had never lost the faith and had long committed themselves to building nuclear plants as a way of keeping up with soaring demand for electricity to be generated in large volumes from small locations. Supporters of nuclear in Britain were keen to ensure that an existing industry – that arguably first started here and had operated largely trouble free since the 1950s – could gain a new lease of life. The expectations of Blair and others in the early days have been fulfilled then, even after the Fukushima accident in Japan – but only in principle. In practice, new nuclear was meant to be built by the private sector, without subsidy and only after a solution was found about where to store high-level nuclear waste. A decision on which community would be willing to host a deep-level waste repository is as far away as ever after plans for the north west were scotched by Cumbria County Council. The new plant in Somerset will be owned, built and operated by EDF – 85% owned by the French state – with the help of China General Nuclear Power Group, which is 100% owned by the Beijing government. It will be capable of generating 3,200 MW, around one seventh of UK needs, compared to say the London Array off the coast of Kent, the world's biggest wind farm, which has a maximum capacity of 1,000 MW. The subsidy levels for onshore wind (£100 per MWhr) is close to that for the new Hinkley Point plant and much higher for offshore wind (£150). But these figures are set to fall. Craig Bennett, director of policy at Friends of the Earth, said it was astonishing that the government was planning such a long-term subsidy for foreign nuclear operators. \"This is just another big bailout. Its an unbelievable wasted opportunity to spend this money in this way when the UK itself is an acknowledged leader in energy efficiency. Why give subsidies to an industry where we are not the leader any more?\" he said. Other supporters of renewable energy point out that public support is needed because these are new technologies which are coming down in price all the time. Nuclear cannot claim either, they say, and there are still questions on whether the European Commission will accept these payments. The government has also already committed itself to providing financial guarantees of £10bn to cover the building of Hinkley Point, something not available to builders of solar or wind arrays. Even Nick Butler, a former energy adviser to No 10 and a supporter of nuclear, believes the price is far too high. In a recent blog he warned: \"Lower sources of power are available and have been rejected. When deals do not match the interests of both sides – producers and consumers – at a point of mutual advantage, they tend to unravel.\" But while EDF has now convinced government of the need to provide these different support mechanisms, the hard work begins for the French and its Chinese partner. The nuclear industry has a terrible reputation for completing new plants years late and over budget. Areva, the French nuclear engineering company providing the EPR design for Hinkley, is involved in similar plants at Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland. Both are proving more difficult than expected: the Finnish reactors are expected to be at least seven years late and at least £1.4bn over budget; Flamanville is two years late and believed to be as much as £2bn over budget. And there is good reason to believe that British companies are going to miss out in Somerset. Centrica has already given up its opportunity to participate as an owner, while EDF has indicated the UK may not have the high-tech engineering skills to compete for supply contracts. Ironically Britain has largely surrendered its corporate involvement in nuclear, having sold off the bulk of its British Energy existing nuclear plant operating business to EDF, disposing of its Westinghouse atomic engineering business to Hitachi and surrendering managment of the massive Sellafield nuclear facility in Cumbria to the NMP consortium led by a US firm. Britain, with a global reputation for having tough safety regulation, is seen by both the French and Chinese governments as the perfect shop window to market their atomic expertise. Western nuclear experts claim Beijing has a lot to prove that its own regulation is up to standard, and there will be intense pressure on the UK's Office for Nuclear Regulation not to dilute standards to help Chinese firms operate their own plants here. There is already an inquiry going on into whether too many concessions have been made by George Osborne into a separate deal under which Chinese banks can operate more freely in London. Nuclear has finally come out from under the cloud spread by Chernobyl. But at what cost to the rest of us? Who are CGN? China General Nuclear Power Group is one of the biggest companies you have never heard of. In fact, it took a new name only six months ago. The change reflected its ambitions to establish itself on a world stage, outside its home base of Guangdong province. Involvement in Hinkley Point is a key part of the globalisation strategy. The state-owned company has six reactors at two nuclear facilities in China, accounting for more than half the country's atomic output, but has a further four being built and four more planned. One reactor, which it built with Areva of France at Ling Ao in Guangdong, took five years to complete."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/jul/13/brexit-repeal-bill-minister-says-government-ready-to-listen-as-repeal-bill-published-and-labour-threatens-to-block-it-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-13T16:36:43Z","webTitle":"Scottish and Welsh governments threaten to refuse repeal bill legislative consent - Politics live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jul/13/brexit-repeal-bill-minister-says-government-ready-to-listen-as-repeal-bill-published-and-labour-threatens-to-block-it-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jul/13/brexit-repeal-bill-minister-says-government-ready-to-listen-as-repeal-bill-published-and-labour-threatens-to-block-it-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Scottish and Welsh governments threaten to refuse repeal bill legislative consent - Politics live","bodyText":"Theresa May is facing a fresh constitutional clash with the Scottish government after Nicola Sturgeon threatened to block the “repeal bill”, dismissing it as a “naked power grab”. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has floated the idea of the UK having associate membership of Euratom, in an interview with the BBC. He also rejected claims that the repeal bill amounted to a power grab by the executive. And he said he was spending half his time preparing for Brexit going wrong. The Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) has published position papers on the UK’s stance in the Brexit negotiations on the European atomic energy community (Euratom) and the role of the European court of justice (ECJ). Britain’s public finances are in worse shape to withstand a recession than they were on the eve of the financial crash a decade ago and face the twin threat of a fresh downturn and Brexit, the Treasury’s independent forecaster has warned. Theresa May has said she was “devastated” when she learned of the exit poll on election night that showed she had failed to win a majority and cried when her husband hugged her in condolence. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Echoing the point made earlier by Nicola Sturgeon on Twitter (see 3.19pm), Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, has described David Munell’s claim that the repeal bill amounts to a “power bonanza” for the Scottish parliament (see 2.26pm) as “frankly ludicrous”. In a statement, Blackford also revealed more about the SNP’s conditions for not voting against the bill in the Commons. The single market is absolutely vital to Scotland’s economy, jobs and our living standards – and the UK government must change course from the extreme Brexit that it is pursuing. Until the UK government meaningfully engages with the devolved administrations and publishes a detailed economic analysis of the impact that leaving the single market or a no deal scenario will have, then the SNP has no choice but to oppose a second reading of the bill in order to get answers from a government that has sought to evade scrutiny at every opportunity. Harriet Harman, the Labour MP who led the battle for women’s rights in parliament for decades, said it wasn’t enough for the great repeal bill to retain women’s rights. Instead, she called on the government to guarantee that the rights of British women at work would continue to evolve in line with EU changes. “Women’s rights have improved by us being part of the EU,” said Harman, in an interview for the Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast. There has been an evolving process in the EU, and what we don’t want to do is get off that escalator of progression and be frozen in time and not have the advantages that women in the rest of Europe are going to get. We don’t want women in this country to be Europe’s poor relations when it comes to their rights at work. Harman said the EU had repeatedly nudged forward women’s rights over the years, by building on UK legislation in the past, for example shifting from the equal pay act to “equal pay for work of equal value”. “I think great repeal bill should not be just ‘you keep rights’ but ‘you keep up with EU’,” she added, calling it a moving process. Global Justice Now and Another Europe is Possible have produced a joint briefing on the repeal bill (pdf). They are worried it will give ministers sweeping, unaccountable powers. Nick Dearden, the GJN director, said: EU law incorporates some of our most cherished protections and rights, as well as rules that, for instance, prevent our government from selling products that can be used in torture overseas. Giving Theresa May the powers of a renaissance monarch to translate these rights and protections into British law is terrifying, as it enables her government to change the way these laws work in fundamental ways, without parliamentary scrutiny. Theresa May’s spokeswoman has told the regular press briefing that there is currently no government plan for what might happen if Scotland or Wales refuse legislative consent for the repeal bill. “That’s very pessimistic. We’re optimistic,” she said when asked about such a scenario. But pressed on whether there was a contingency plan for this, she said: “Not that I’m aware of, no.” The government was intent on securing UK-wide agreement on the deal, the spokeswoman said, and planned to “engage more and talk more” with the devolved nations. As part of this, May’s deputy, Damian Green, has contacted ministers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to arrange “further discussions over the coming weeks”, she said. “We intend for there to be ongoing, intense dialogue with the devolved administrations with the aim of everybody coming together and supporting very important legislation that’s been set out today,” the spokeswoman said. She did not rule out the idea of May seeking support from Labour or other opposition parties, saying “our approach is one of consensus”. She said: “We are open to dialogue, we want to make sure this important piece of legislation has the support from everyone that it needs.” Dan Roberts, the Guardian’s Brexit policy editor, has written his assessment of the repeal bill. Here is an extract. Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the legislation is its “Henry VIII powers” that grant the government executive power to amend existing legislation without further recourse to parliament. Though this is partly a time-saving exercise as acres of EU law are transposed on to the UK statute book, ministers admit ambiguity is also required because so many of the key features of Brexit remain unclear. And here is the full article. This is from the Press Association’s Ian Jones. My colleague Peter Walker was at the No 10 afternoon lobby briefing. He says Downing Street dodged the question about what would happen if the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly refused to grant the repeal bill legislative consent. Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister, has issued his own statement about the repeal bill, in addition to the join one he issued with Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, earlier. (See 1.42pm.) He said it was “the most significant attack on devolution” since the Welsh assembly was created in 1999. From the perspective of the Welsh government, the publication of the bill represents a moment of significant challenge to the devolution settlement. Indeed, in our view, it represents the most significant attack on devolution since the creation of the National Assembly in 1999. Despite the very clear and repeated warnings that any attempt by Westminster and Whitehall to take the powers currently vested in the EU to themselves would be wholly unacceptable, this is precisely what clause 11 of the EU (withdrawal) bill seeks to do. This part of the bill would amend the devolution legislation to put in place – with no limitations or qualifications - new constraints on the assembly’s ability to legislate effectively on matters where we currently operate within legislative frameworks developed by the EU, even after we leave the EU. Existing EU law would be frozen, and only the UK parliament would, it appears, be allowed to unfreeze it. In practice, this would provide a window for the UK government to seek parliamentary approval to impose new UK-wide frameworks for such policies. It is an attempt to take back control over devolved policies such as the environment, agriculture and fisheries not just from Brussels, but from Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast. George Osborne’s Evening Standard has an editorial describing the repeal bill as “the single greatest act of regulation in UK history”. It is very scathing, although a little out of date: the second paragraph is premised on the government calling it the “great repeal bill”, although the government is now referring to it as just the “repeal bill”, while its official title is the European Union (withdrawal) bill. Jeremy Corbyn has held extended talks with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, as part of his bid to present himself as a prime minister-in-waiting, ready to take over the EU withdrawal process if there is a change of government, the Press Association reports. Its story goes on: In discussions lasting more than two hours at the European Commission’s Brussels headquarters, Corbyn told Michel Barnier that Labour respected the result of last year’s referendum. But he said the party was seeking a Brexit to protect jobs and would not cut a “sweetheart deal” with the US which would undermine the Paris climate change agreement and harm living standards in the UK. Corbyn confirmed his unilateral offer of citizens’ rights for EU nationals living in the UK after Brexit and said Labour was ready to pay “what we are legally required” as part of the process of withdrawal. Emerging from the talks, Corbyn characterised the discussions as “very interesting, very frank”. He presented the sports-mad EU official with a shirt from his beloved Arsenal, with Barnier’s name on the back, along with a signed copy of Labour’s manifesto for last month’s election. “Now he’s got two things in red - a shirt and a book,” the Labour leader quipped. Governments publish impact assessments alongside bills and here is the one that goes with the repeal bill (pdf). It assesses the costs of the bill as “unknown: likely small” although, as the document explains, that is an assessment of the bill, “not an assessment of the decision to leave the European Union - a decision that has already been taken by the people of the United Kingdom”. The impact assessment does try to quantify how much EU law there is in UK law. While there is no single figure for how much EU law already forms part of domestic law (and how much will therefore be converted by the bill), according to EUR-Lex, the EU’s legal database, there are currently over 12,000 EU regulations (that is, directly-effective EU laws) and over 6,000 EU directives in force across the EU. In addition, research from the House of Commons Library indicates that there have been around 7,900 statutory instruments made in the UK which have implemented EU legislation. Further House of Commons Library research indicates that out of 1,302 UK Acts between 1980 and 2009 (excluding those later repealed), 186 Acts (or 14.3%) exhibited a degree of EU influence. These EU regulations, domestic regulations, and Acts of Parliament (where they implement EU law) represent – along with laws passed by the devolved legislatures and the EU treaties – the main sources of EU law in the UK. The document also says that the government thinks it will need to bring forward between 800 and 1,000 statutory instruments (items of secondary legislation) alongside the bill to transpose EU law into UK law. Here is Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, responding to David Mundell’s claim that the repeal bill will lead to a “power bonanza” for the Scottish parliament. (See 2.26pm.) Liberty and Amnesty International have issued a joint statement opposing the repeal bill. They say: Today we take another huge step towards our withdrawal from the European Union – and the government has still failed entirely to address how our hard-won rights and freedoms will be affected by changes made to domestic laws during the Brexit process. The repeal bill gives ministers vague and broad powers that could be used to erode our rights and freedoms without proper scrutiny by those elected to protect them. The two organisations want the government to insert a commitment into the text of the bill saying it will not reduce rights and freedoms. They also want the government to conduct an audit of EU-derived human rights law and to ensure those rights and freedoms are protected after Brexit. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, thinks the repeal bill “could end Theresa May’s premiership”. In a statement he said: The government are facing a parliamentary version of guerrilla warfare that resembles the days of the Maastricht treaty. But this debate is not just a quagmire for the government, it is also a political nightmare that could end Theresa May’s premiership. This bill might keep a few restless people on the Tory backbenches from looking around for her replacement for a couple of months, but it has all the hallmarks of someone in office but not in power. I am keen to work across party lines with opposition parties of all shades to find common ground. These vital protections, enshrined in European law, from workers’ rights to the environment, matter and we will defend them to the hilt. On the World at One the Conservative MP Anna Soubry, one of the party’s leading pro-European members, said the government should commission fresh legal advice to see if there is a way of staying in Euratom, the European civil nuclear power agency. She said: Spending all this time, energy and, I have to say, your listeners’ hard-earned taxpayers’ money on trying to reinvent something that works well, which nobody even vaguely sensible has a problem with us remaining in, is not great. And I would beg the prime minister, please, in this spirit, and in the reality of the general election, but in the spirit of trying to build bridges and creating a sensible Brexit, could we all please put the national interest first? And the national interest is to stay within Euratom. Euratom is emerging as an area where the government is most vulnerable to a parliamentary defeat over Brexit. Soubry is one of several Tory MPs who has spoken out in favour of Britain remaining in it. But one difficulty that she and other Euratom rebels may have is that the article 50 bill, which was given a third reading in the Commons by a majority of 372, explicitly covered leaving Euratom as well as leaving the EU, as the notes to the bill made clear at the time. Soubry was one of the MPs who voted in favour. In a briefing to journalists, David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, said that the repeal bill was not a “power grab”, as the Scottish and Welsh governments are saying. (See 1.42pm.) Instead it would be a “power bonanza” for the Scottish parliament, he said. This is not a power grab, it is a power bonanza for the Scottish parliament because after this bill has been implemented the Scottish parliament will have more powers and responsibilities than it has today and I’m happy to be held to account for that statement once the process has been delivered. Needless to say there will be a process row with the Scottish government because the Scottish government does process row, that is their speciality. We’ve seen process row in relation to the Scotland bill that followed the Calman Commission, process row on the Scotland bill, we’ve seen process row on the fiscal framework. But all of these things delivered what the UK government said at the outset that they would do - more powers and responsibilities for the Scottish parliament and that’s what this bill will do. Mundell said that the return of powers and responsibilities currently exercised by the EU to the UK government was a “transitional arrangement” that would allow for the further onward devolution of powers while ensuring the consistency of UK-wide frameworks. He said powers in areas such as environment, criminal justice, consumer rights and energy “could all in relatively short order come to the Scottish parliament”. He also played down the prospect of the Scottish parliament refusing legislative consent. He said threats like this had been made before, but had not materialised. I am optimistic that we will obtain that consent, partly because I was told in relation to the 2012 [Scotland] bill, in relation to the 2016 [Scotland] bill, in relation to the fiscal framework, that this consent would not be forthcoming and, ultimately, it was. The Scottish and Welsh governments have said they will try to block the government’s repeal bill - or European Union (withdrawal) bill, as it is now called. (See 11.59am.) In a joint statement, Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister (SNP), and Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister (Labour) have said that their governments will not give the bill legislative consent unless there are major changes to it. They say: This week began with the prime minister calling for a constructive and collaborative approach from those outside Whitehall to help get Brexit right. Today’s publication of the European Union (withdrawal) bill is the first test as to whether the UK government is serious about such an approach. It is a test it has failed utterly. We have repeatedly tried to engage with the UK government on these matters, and have put forward constructive proposals about how we can deliver an outcome that will protect the interests of all the nations in the UK, safeguard our economies and respect devolution. Regrettably, the bill does not do this. Instead, it is a naked power grab, an attack on the founding principles of devolution and could destabilise our economies. Our two governments – and the UK government – agree we need a functioning set of laws across the UK after withdrawal from the EU. We also recognise that common frameworks to replace EU laws across the UK may be needed in some areas. But the way to achieve these aims is through negotiation and agreement, not imposition. It must be done in a way that respects the hard-won devolution settlements. The European Union (withdrawal) bill does not return powers from the EU to the devolved administrations, as promised. It returns them solely to the UK government and parliament, and imposes new restrictions on the Scottish parliament and national assembly for Wales. On that basis, the Scottish and Welsh governments cannot recommend that legislative consent is given to the bill as it currently stands. The Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly do not have the power to block Brexit. But refusing legislative consent would be politically embarrassing. Under the devolution settlement, the UK government is supposed to get legislative consent from the devolved administrations if it wants to pass a law affecting an area normally the preserve of the Scottish parliament or the Welsh assembly. The supreme court recently described this as “a political convention that does not give rise to a legal obligation that can be enforced in the courts”, and so Theresa May could ignore votes in Scotland and Wales objecting to the repeal bill. But she would do so at some political cost, particularly as the leader of a party calling itself the Conservative and Unionist party. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, told Michel Barnier that she wanted the UK to remain in the single market when she met the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator in Brussels. After their meeting she said: This was a useful and constructive meeting, and I welcomed the opportunity to discuss Scotland’s priorities with Mr Barnier - in particular, our view that the UK should seek to remain in the single market. I outlined to Mr Barnier that our priority is to protect Scotland’s vital economic interests and that the Scottish government will do all it can to build a consensus against an extreme Brexit outside the single market, which would have potentially catastrophic consequences for jobs, investment and our living standards. We have always been clear that this is not about holding separate Scottish negotiations - it is for the UK as the member state to negotiate with the EU - and as such we will continue to work hard to influence the UK position. However, meetings like this are helpful in developing a mutual understanding between the Scottish government and the EU as these vital negotiations gather pace. The broad message from the Office for Budget Responsibility is that Britain’s public finances are in a troubling state, vulnerable to nasty surprises, and with a shedload of troubles looming on the horizons. And Brexit could make this whole situation worse, as slower growth over the long term could drive the debt/GDP ratio into the danger zone, over 100%. Today’s report reaches three main conclusions: 1) The government must keep “endogenous risks under review”.That means risks created or influenceable by government policy - everything from the pension triple-lock to the cost of cleaning up Britain’s nuclear power stations. The problem, I suspect, is that there may not be many votes in dealing with certain risks.... 2) Britain must prepare for shocks. There may not be a recession this year. Or in 2018. But there will be one eventually, so future budgets need to create some fiscal space to react. According to the OBR, Britain will suffer at least one financial crisis and several recessions over the next 50 years. And even if the government avoids a classic economic downturn, the economy could be hurt by a natural disaster, a terror attack or a war. 3) Ministers must deal with many sources of slow-building pressure.Britain has a nasty habit of putting off difficult decisions or unpleasant problems (for example, social care for the elderly). But problems don’t go away if you ignore them. They just build up. This chart shows how the ratio between retirees and workers will rise steadily over the next few decades. More old people will need support, and the pool of taxpayers won’t grow fast enough to keep pace. In his fiscal risk report the Office for Budget Responsibility says the government should “expect nasty fiscal surprises from time to time”. It also says that having a minority government could “loosen the Treasury’s grip on public spending control” and that the long-term impact of Brexit on growth could have a much bigger impact on government finances than the one-off “divorce bill”. It says: The new government must also manage the risks posed by Brexit. These do not supplant the possible shocks and likely pressures that we have already discussed, but they could affect the likelihood and impact of many of them. A lot of attention focuses on the possible ‘divorce bill’, but, while some numbers mooted for it are very large, a one-off hit of this sort would not pose a big threat to fiscal sustainability. More important are the implications of whatever agreements are reached with the EU and other trading partners for the long-term growth of the UK economy, which we do not attempt to predict here. If GDP and receipts grew just 0.1 percentage points more slowly than projected over the next 50 years, but spending growth was unchanged, the debt-to-GDP would end up around 50 percentage points higher. My colleague Graeme Wearden has very full coverage on his business live blog. Labour has been granted an emergency debate on Monday on the scheduling of Commons business. Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons applied for one under the standing order 24 procedure. She said there had only been seven votes in the Commons since the Queen’s speech because the government was scheduling so little business. And she said the government has refused so far to offer the opposition any dates for an opposition day debate (the ones where the opposition chooses the motion). She also said that the current rules - which allocate a certain number of days for opposition day debates and private members’ bills debates per session - needed to be revised to take into account the fact that this session will last two years, not one year as is usual. The government is reluctant to schedule opposition day debates because, without a proper majority, it it worried about losing. The recent U-turns over paying for abortion for women from Northern Ireland and holding an inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal, have shown how vulnerable it is to backbench pressure. The European Court of Justice should not be allowed to rule on UK cases which were not before the court on the day the UK leaves the EU, the Brexit department has said. The position puts the UK at odds with Brussels’ own negotiating position that the ECJ should continue to have jurisdiction over cases that originate in UK courts before the Britain’s departure date. Cases before the ECJ can take many years to be resolved. The UK’s position paper on the ECJ (pdf) says the court should not be able to hear UK cases from the day after the UK leaves the EU, but could still rule on UK law if the cases begin before the departure date. May has made leaving the court’s jurisdiction one of her “red lines” on the forthcoming negotiations, and the department’s second Brexit position paper lays out in broad terms how cases should proceed during the two-year negotiation period. However, the paper also acknowledges there “will likely be a small number of cases which are pending at the CJEU on the date we leave.” Those cases may have originated in UK domestic courts, referring questions of EU law. The paper says the UK aims to give “as much certainty as possible to those who find their cases before the court at the point of withdrawal.” However, the ECJ will not be allowed to rule on UK cases which were not before the court on the day the UK leaves the EU. “This would apply even where the facts of the case occurred before withdrawal,” the paper says. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, said: By ending the jurisdiction of the court of justice of the European Union UK courts will be supreme once more. Our sensible approach to pending cases means there would be a smooth and orderly transition to when the court no longer has jurisdiction in the UK. Here is my colleague Heather Stewart’s story on the publication of the repeal bill. Jeremy Corbyn has arrived for his meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, and he has brought him an Arsenal shirt as a present. This is from ITV’s Carl Dinnen. Fewer 999 calls will be regarded as life-threatening under an overhaul of ambulance response targets, the Press Association reports. Its story goes on: Current targets across England are being scrapped in favour of a new system which officials say will save more lives. At present, half of all 999 calls for an ambulance are considered life-threatening, and a paramedic is expected to be on the scene within eight minutes. From this autumn, the most serious calls, such as when a person is not breathing or their heart has stopped, will be expected to have a response within seven minutes typically and a maximum of 15 minutes overall for 90% of patients. These calls are still classed as life-threatening. This means millions of patients, such as those with suspected heart attack and some strokes, will now see the target for them relaxed. They will move from the life-threatening category to an emergency category. These patients will be expected to receive a response within a maximum of 40 minutes for 90% of patients and typically within 18 minutes. NHS England bosses said the move will save lives and that, at present, many calls classed as life-threatening turn out not to be. A quarter of patients currently classed as life-threatening are not transported to hospital. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has announced this in a written ministerial statement. The repeal bill has been published. Confusingly, it now seems to be called the European Union (withdrawal) bill. In October last year the government formally committed itself to building a new runway at Heathrow. Originally it was thought there would be a vote around that time, but Downing Street announced it was postponing the Commons vote for about a year, amid speculation that Theresa May was worried about Tory MPs refusing to back it. Now the vote has been delayed again. In a written ministerial statement Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, said: This government is fully committed to realising the benefits that a new northwest runway at Heathrow would bring, in terms of economic growth, boosting jobs and skills, strengthening domestic links and – critically – increasing and developing our international connectivity as we prepare to leave the European Union. The timing of the election, in particular the need to re-start a select committee inquiry into the draft Airports NPS [national policy statement] means we now expect to lay any final NPS in parliament in the first half of 2018, for a vote in the House of Commons. That could be the most interesting broadcast interview Theresa May has given since becoming prime minister, although, given that she is such a reluctant and unforthcoming interviewee, Emma Barnett has merely cleared a low bar. Still, we’ll take news where we can get it. Here are five things we learned from the interview. 1 - May has discovered housing as an issue. In the interview, she said she realised during the election campaign that the prospect of young people not being able to buy a house was a big issue. She said the same thing in her Sun interview. This insight is not particularly remarkable, but what makes it surprising is that May has just announced a Queen’s speech that contained very little on housing (there was a reference to building more homes, but the only housing-related legislation was a draft tenants’ fees bill). Her disclosure shows there is quite a gap between her analysis of what the country needs, and what her government is actually offering. 2 - May seems to think growth is the solution to her government’s financial problems. Barnett asked where the £1bn was coming from for the deal with the DUP. It could only come from three areas, she said: higher taxes, more borrowing, or spending cuts. But May, who until now has not explained how the government will fund the extra £1bn for Northern Ireland, said there was a fourth option. Actually, there is somewhere else that money comes from. And that’s what we have already shown; just look at our record on things like the extra money we’ve put into the health service. We’ve been able to do that as the economy has grown. If the economy grows, and you are creating that wealth, more money is coming into the government’s coffers, that enables you to ensure that you have got that money to spend. The problem with this, of course, is that growth is slowing in the UK. 3 - May seems to have reservations about calling herself a feminist. When Barnett asked her if she was a feminist, she did not reply with a straight yes. Instead she paused for a moment and replied: I have said yes before, yes, I’ve said that I’m a feminist, in that I believe that it’s important that women genuinely have equal opportunities. She sounded like someone trying to remember the “line to take”, not speaking from the heart. 4 - She has found something positive to say about Jeremy Corbyn. Barnett asked if her respect for him had increased since the election. She dodged the main thrust of that question, but said she admired how he responded as a constituency MP to the Finsbury Park attack. 5 - She is not 100% Maybot. My colleague John Crace had the equivalent of a sketchwriting scoop when he coined the term Maybot to describe the prime minister. It is such an apt description of her inability to engage emotionally that everyone is now using it. But today, mostly when she spoke about the election result, she did sound more human and engaging than usual. She admitted that she shed “a little tear” over the result, and she revealed that she did not listen to the exit poll on TV because she has “a little bit of superstition about things like that”. John won’t be decommissioning the Maybot quite yet, but today it sounded a little less appropriate as a descriptor. This is from the Observer’s Michael Savage: And this is from the Mail on Sunday’s Dan Hodges: The Brexit department has now published its three position papers, on nuclear materials and safeguards issues, ongoing union judicial and administrative proceedings, and privileges and immunities. You can find read them here. They look a bit dull, a colleague tells me, but I will take a proper look soon. Q: You will have to convince Jeremy Corbyn. You were very critical of him during the campaign, saying he had “poor judgment”. Now you are asking him to contribute. So why have you changed your mind about him? May says she wants people across the parties in the Commons to contribute. Q: Have you increased your respect for Corbyn since the election? May says the Finsbury Park attack happened in Corbyn’s constituency. He was there all night. She went the next day, and saw a Jeremy Corbyn who was a good constituency MP. Q: Will you still be around at the end of the Brexit deal? May says she is getting on with work. She has been involved in politics for a long time. She has been an MP for 20 years, and wanted to be a politician when she was 12. She believes in public service. Q: Your husband must want to know how long you will stay. May says he wants her to get on with the job. Q: What would you say to your younger self? May says she would say believe in yourself, always do the right thing, and work hard to tackle injustice when you see it. And that’s it. Q: Can you guarantee that you will have the numbers to get Brexit through the Commons? May says the first thing is to get a good Brexit deal. Q: But can you get it through? May says the DUP deal says they will support Brexit legislation. But she hopes MPs from all parties will back the Brexit deal. Q: Do you have a contingency plan for what will happen if Brexit makes people poorer? May says the government looks at these issues regularly. The national living wage helped people a lot. The personal allowance on tax is going up. Q: You would have done those things anyway. What about contingency plans for if companies pull out of the UK? May says since the Brexit vote, inward investment has been increasing. Q: But we have not Brexited yet. May says that is why we need trade deals. The government is looking at those. And it is trying to boost industry and improve skills. Q: Did you worry, as a feminist, about doing a deal with an anti-abortion party like the DUP? May says the deal was so that the country could have a stable government. Q: But did it stick in your throat as a feminist? May says one of the important things about that deal was that the government was not going to move back on equality issues. Q: Where will that £1bn come from? Tax rises, borrowing, or spending cuts. May says there is somewhere else the money can come from. If you have growth, you generate more income. She says that is how the extra £8bn for the NHS was found. Brexit is not just a process. It is an opportunity, she says. May says, when she became PM, a friend’s daughter, aged six, said she did not realise women could be PM. Q: If she had got to 18, that girl would have voted Jeremy Corbyn. Q: Why should people feel confident that you are any good at reading the mood music in a room when you did not realise the campaign was going badly? You will need that skill in Brussels. May says she realised the campaign was not going perfectly. She realised a lot of people, especially the young, were concerned about housing. And a lot of parents were concerned about schools too. Q: Did you feel under extra pressure not to step down because you are only the second woman PM? No, that was not an issue, says May. She says it can seem easier to walk way. But she felt it was important, having got into this mess, to get out of it. Q: Are you a feminist? May says she “has said that before”. (She does not answer with a straight yes.) Q: How did a strong and stable leader lose control of the campaign to such an extent? May says it was not a question of losing control. She says the message she was getting was that the result would be different. Looking back on the campaign, “what I regret is that we did not get across more” the vision she set out from No 10 when she became PM. Q: You say you regret not doing more on certain issues in the campaign. But you were in charge? You let your campaign get derailed. May says it was not about the campaign being derailed. It was about the balance of messages. She says there was not a point where she felt she had to change direction. When it came to the result, a lot of people close to the campaign were “genuinely shocked” by the result. She says many people in Labour did not see the result coming either. She thinks calling the election was the right thing to do. The Tories took seats they had never held before, like Mansfield. Q: Did you think of resigning? No, says May. She felt she had a responsibility to continue. She says it was devastating seeing good colleagues lose their seats. But she felt she had a responsibility to the country. The Conservatives were the only party that could govern. Q: Was there anyone you were embarrassed to face? May says the result was a shock. But she felt she had to go on. Q: Do you regret not acknowledging the result in your first statement from No 10? May says at that point she felt she had to reassure people government was carrying on? Q: But shouldn’t you have shown humility? May says it is important for the government to show humility in how it moves forward. For example, during the campaign she realised that people were very concerned about housing, and about the prospect of young people not being able to buy a home. Q: It’s a year to the day since you became PM. The election started so well. When did you think it might not be going according to plan? May says as the campaign went on she realised it was not going perfectly. But she did not expect the result she got. When the result came through, it was a complete shock. She says she did not watch the exit poll. Her husband watched it, and came and told her. It took a few minutes for it to sink in. Her husband gave her a hug. Then she rang CCHQ to find out what was going on. I felt devastated, really. I knew the campaign was not going perfectly. Q: Did you shed a tear? Yes, a little tear. Radio 5 is broadcasting the interview now. Emma Barnett says it is her most honest interview yet about the election result. Here is the interview in full. Radio 5 Live has broadcast its top line in its news bulletin. Theresa May told the programme she felt “devastated” by the election result and “shed a little tear”. Radio 5 Live’s Emma Barnett has interviewed Theresa May this morning. It will be going out shortly and I will be covering it live. I hope it is more interesting than her interview with the Sun. May is notoriously unforthcoming in interviews and the Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn did a proper sit-down with her, spread across two pages in the paper, but ended up with relatively meagre material. Here are the top lines. May suggested that she wanted to carry on as prime minister for “the next few years” but would not commit to fighting the next election. Mrs May repeatedly side-stepped the question on whether she wanted to lead the Tories into the next general election – currently set in law for June 2022 – to instead say: “I have got a job to do. “My view is I have always said that I would be here for the full term, but what I have also said is that over the years I have given my life to this Conservative Party and I will serve as long as they want me to serve.” Asked by The Sun if she would personally like to fight another election as leader, Mrs May made it clear she is only now concentrating on the next two or three years ahead to see through Brexit. She said she did not set out her vision for Britain satisfactorily during the election. Speaking to The Sun from her No10 study yesterday, Mrs May said: “I set out a year ago, when I stood on the steps here, the sort of vision I had. The sort of country I wanted us to be. “I don’t think that vision came through sufficiently during the campaign. “’Me’ was that speech on the steps of No10 a year ago. “That is what we were working on right up to the election, and it is what we are now working on. “But that did not come across during the election campaign.” This is the statement that Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, put out overnight announcing that Labour will vote against the repeal bill at second reading unless there are significant changes to it. He said: Labour has always been clear that Brexit cannot lead to any rolling back of rights and protections. We need effective legislation that protects British workers and consumers, enshrines equality laws, enforces environmental standards and devolves powers across the country. The government’s repeal bill falls short on all counts. It is simply not fit for purpose. The bill proposes sweeping new powers for ministers that are fundamentally undemocratic, unaccountable and unacceptable. It fails to guarantee crucial rights will be enforced; it omits the EU charter of fundamental rights and it does nothing to ensure that British standards and rights keep pace with our EU partners. Labour are putting the prime minister on notice that unless the bill is significantly improved in all these areas, Labour will vote it down in the House of Commons. And here are the six concerns that Labour has with the bill. I’m quoting from a Labour briefing note. 1 - It proposes sweeping delegated powers but lacks effective oversight or accountability. In particular, the Bill could allow delegated powers to be used very late in negotiations to cover significant policy changes. This is fundamentally undemocratic and unacceptable. 2 - It lacks clear enforcement mechanisms. Without remedies, key rights such as workplace rights or environmental standards could become unenforceable. 3 - It does not include the EU charter of fundamental rights. This codifies human rights in EU law and UK law in modern form and includes important protections in evolving areas such as privacy protections, discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and rights for the elderly. Failure to include the Charter will impact the way that rights are interpreted in UK courts. 4 - It takes the wrong approach on devolution and does not ensure effective involvement of devolved administrations. There should be a clear presumption of devolution. Without this, the Bill is a significant power grab for Whitehall and fails to capitalise on the potential for further devolution of power. 5 - It does not include any provision to ensure that UK rights keep pace with EU rights after Brexit. This could lead to UK rights lagging behind the EU over time in areas such as workplace, consumer or equality protections or environmental standards. 6 - There can be no qualifications, limitations or sunset clauses attached to this Bill. If there are, Labour will not support it. In addition, Labour will block the use of delegated legislation to the same effect. Starmer is fond of imposing Brexit tests. In December last year he set out five tests that Labour would use to determine whether it could support the government’s Brexit plan. And in March he set out six tests the party would use to judge the final Brexit deal. Today marks one of the most important milestones in the UK’s journey towards Brexit. The government is publishing the repeal bill, its flagship Brexit legislation and the measure that will repeal the European Communities Act, which took the UK into Europe in the first place. And, to coincide with its publication, Labour is significantly hardening its opposition to the government’s stance, threatening to vote against the bill at second reading unless major changes are introduced. Steve Baker, the hardline pro-leave campaigner who recently became a Brexit minister, has been giving interviews this morning about the bill. He told the Today programme that the government was “ready to ... listen to parliament” over the bill. Well, yes we are ready, but really what we are ready to do is listen to parliament in an open conversation about what is quite a technical bill. But when Nick Robinson pressed Baker for examples of areas where the government might compromise, Baker did not provide any examples. For example, the Royal College of Radiologists has issued a fresh statement this morning expressing concern that leaving Euratom could hold up the supply of radioisotopes used for cancer diagnosis and treatment. But when Baker was asked about this, he said that he thought the royal college had got it wrong. He told Robinson: Well, we are certainly listening to those concerns, but we believe that those concerns are not correct. Medical radioisotopes are not the kind of special fissile material - plutonium, uranium - which is covered by Euratom and safeguarding. Here are some of the other latest Brexit developments. Baker rejected a claim from Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, that the government’s approach to Brexit could fall apart “like a chocolate orange”. Asked about this, Baker said: That is not what I have been seeing in the course of the short time that I’ve been in the department. Sitting in the department, going from department to department, meeting other ministers, working with civil servants, what I see is a great deal of insight, vigour, application, clear political direction, serious choices being made. What I see is the whole government coming to together to ensure that we are able to leave the European Union smoothly and in a successful and orderly way, whatever circumstances we face. Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour is “ready to take up the responsibility for Brexit negotiations”. In a statement issued ahead of his meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU’s Brexit negotiator in Brussels today, he said: Labour is a government in waiting and we are ready to take up the responsibility for Brexit negotiations. Labour respects the referendum result and the decision to leave the European Union. But a Labour Brexit would look very different to the race-to-the-bottom tax haven backed by this Conservative government. In contrast to the Conservatives’ megaphone diplomacy, we will conduct relations with our European neighbours respectfully and in the spirit of friendship. Our strong links with our European sister parties gives Labour an advantage in reaching an outcome that works for both sides. Labour said the meeting, set to last about two hours, showed “Labour’s growing importance to the Brexit process in the wake of the UK general election”. The government has confirmed that it has dropped “great” from the title of the repeal bill. Originally the government referred to it as the “great repeal bill”. But parliamentary rules don’t allow words like “great” in the formal title of a bill, and that grandiose title has now been dropped. An overnight government press release said it would be “known as the repeal bill”. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Theresa May gives an interview to Radio 5 Live’s Emma Barnett, her first proper broadcast interview since the general election. (She has also given an interview to the Sun.) 10am: Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, takes questions from the London assembly. Around 10am: The Brexit department publishes three position papers, covering “nuclear materials and safeguards issues, ongoing union judicial and administrative proceedings, and privileges and immunities”. They will be discussed in the next round of Brexit talks, starting next week. 11am: The Office for Budget Responsibility publishes its fiscal risks report. Around 11.30am: The Brexit department publishes the repeal bill. 1.15pm: May meets the King of Spain for talks in Number 10. 1.45pm: The Social Market Foundation publishes a report from its commission on inequality in education. And in Brussels today Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, and Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister, all have meetings with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/feb/12/edf-energy-delays-hinkley-point-nuclear-decision","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-12T18:29:14Z","webTitle":"EDF Energy delays Hinkley Point nuclear decision","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/12/edf-energy-delays-hinkley-point-nuclear-decision","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/feb/12/edf-energy-delays-hinkley-point-nuclear-decision","fields":{"headline":"EDF Energy delays Hinkley Point nuclear decision","bodyText":"The timetable surrounding the construction of Britain’s first new atomic reactors in almost 30 years has once again been blown off course, its developer, EDF Energy, has admitted. The setback came as the French-owned generator and supply company reported a 25% slump in operating profits for 2014 to £863m, which it blamed on challenging market conditions. EDF had originally promised to tie up a new deal with financial backers and then take a final investment decision on the proposed new plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset by the middle of last year. This date was later revised to March 2015. But in a new statement, the largely state-owned energy group said a final investment decision might only be possible in a matter of months, and it had still not finalised talks with Chinese financial backers. Jean-Bernard Lévy, the head of EDF group in France, played down the problems. “Hinkley Point C is a major project, one of the biggest construction projects in Europe. The final investment decision is an objective which we will have to analyse rapidly. We need to be in a place where we can make this investment, but negotiations are still ongoing and I can therefore not say more on this subject.” Industry insiders believed EDF had set aside a provisional target of June due to an array of uncertainties involving the the UK government, China and Austria. Delays threaten Britain’s attempts to reduce the scope for any power supply crunch, meet its carbon reduction targets and encourage other potential nuclear developers such as Toshiba of Japan to speed up investment. The problems with the UK government surround the final wording of a “contract for difference” contract under which energy consumers will effectively guarantee long-term prices for EDF. The forthcoming general election is said to be slowing down momentum inside Whitehall departments to sign off the highly complex legal documents. Meanwhile, there is growing speculation that Chinese investors are hardening the terms under which they would be willing to help underwrite some of the cost of the new plant. China National Nuclear Corporation and China General Nuclear Power Corporation are expected to be minority shareholders in the project, but are also pushing for commitments to build and operate their own plant at Bradwell in Essex. EDF has declined to confirm that it too is trying to limit the financial damage through compensation from the UK government should there be a successful legal challenge in the European courts by Austria to the UK subsidy arrangement. Critics of the £24.5bn nuclear programme in Somerset have highlighted the industry’s poor track record for constructing facilities on time and on budget. They have questioned whether Hinkley Point C reactors would able to meet their timetable of opening for operations in 2023. EDF has already run into problems with a new project at Flamanville in Normandy, while another project in Finland, the European pressurised reactor, which uses the same design as Hinkley, is also massively behind its original timetable. Financial problems at its French design partner, Areva, have not helped the sense of uncertainty surrounding EDF’s nuclear ambitions, while EDF was forced to suspend operations at two British plants last year because of potential technical faults. The temporary outages at Heysham 1 and Hartlepool nuclear power stations helped tarnish EDF Energy’s 2014 financial results, it said, but the figures were also hit by a £136m charge related to the value of the company’s gas generating and storage assets. Despite these problems, the boss of EDF Energy, Vincent de Rivaz, said there were many positive aspects to celebrate, not least an additional 194,000 customer accounts at a time when many of the big six suppliers were losing ground. “Despite challenging market conditions, EDF Energy increased its investment in the UK. Customers will benefit from this long-term approach with more low-carbon electricity for the future,” he said. “Our spending on research and development has underpinned our ability to safely extend the lives of our nuclear power stations. At the same time, customers are seeing very competitive prices, with an increasing number benefiting from our fixed tariffs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2017/jun/23/french-growth-revised-up-eurozone-companies-canadian-inflation-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-23T18:00:14Z","webTitle":"Markets drop despite French GDP upgrade and strong Eurozone data -- as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/jun/23/french-growth-revised-up-eurozone-companies-canadian-inflation-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/jun/23/french-growth-revised-up-eurozone-companies-canadian-inflation-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Markets drop despite French GDP upgrade and strong Eurozone data -- as it happened","bodyText":"That’s all for today, and this week A quick reminder of the key points. France’s growth rate in the first quarter of the year has been revised up to 0.5%. It’s the latest sign that the eurozone recovery continues. European companies have posted their fastest quarterly growth since the debt crisis began six years ago. But growth dipped this month, suggesting a slight slowdown. A similar survey showed that America’s economic growth may have slowed this month too. US manufacturing output expanded at the slowest rate in nine months. European stock markets closed lower, with the FTSE posting its third weekly decline in a row. Worries over Brexit, and deflation, loomed over the City after a week of oil price falls. The decline in the oil price helped to push Canada’s inflation rate down. The annual CPI rate fell by more than expected last month, to just 1.3% last month. The British pound has marked the first anniversary of the Brexit vote with a small rally, up 0.35% to $1.2725. City experts, though, have shown that sterling has had a pretty awful year. The European Central Bank has launched a bid to wrestle control of London’s euro-clearing market. In Greece, unions are vowing to step up their protests unless the government grants better rights to thousands of short-term workers. The tensions come as rubbish piles up in Athens, as a refuse workers’ strike continues. The Greek government, though, is trying to rally investor confidence now it has secured its latest bailout funds. That’s all from us until next week. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The FTSE 100 has now fallen for three weeks in a row; that’s the worst run since the Brexit vote, points out Tara Cunningham in the Daily Telegraph tonight. David Madden of CMC Markets says growth fears weighed on the markets today, despite French GDP being revised up early this morning: Stock markets have fallen yet again as the disinflation fear is still doing the rounds. Oil may have recouped some of its losses today but the commodity has dropped a considerable amount since the start of the year and dealers are worried take it will put downward pressure on inflation. The cost of living in the eurozone and the US is softening already, and when you factor the recent losses in the oil market its points to a continuation of weaker inflation. Traders are anxious it could turn into weaker growth rates, and the high hopes that they had for 2017 may not be met. After another subdued day, the FTSE 100 has closed down 15.16 points at 7424. Worries over disinflation, following the oil price slump this week, weighed on shares. European issues also cast a shadow, as EU leaders in Brussels seemed unimpressed with Theresa May’s offer to EU citizens after Brexit. Other markets also fell: Here’s proof that the London stock market has underperformed since the Brexit vote, when measured in US dollars: Back in Greece, protests are set to intensify over the weekend as unions step up calls on Athens’ leftist-led government to grant better employment rights – not least extension of short term contracts that could say protestors put up to 10,000 out of work. Announcing that walkouts by rubbish collectors and other municipal workers would continue until Monday, Nikos Trakas, who heads the union representing municipal employees, said the government couldn’t hide behind legal argument in its refusal to put contract workers, now facing joblessness, in permanent positions. “A government … can’t come back two and a half years later and say there is a problem with constitutionality,” he said. “‘We are talking about ten thousand people and if they leave, local government in its entirety will dissolve.” Piles of refuse have collected across Athens and with temperatures set to climb to 36 degrees Celsius by Sunday the strike is causing mounting concerns at a time of rising tourism. Constantine Michalos, president of the Athens chamber of commerce, which represents over 100,000 businesses, issued an urgent appeal this afternoon for both workers and the government to return to the negotiating table. “Everyone has to try to limit the obstacles that diminish the growth prospects of the country by limiting claims to rights,” he said adding that it made no sense that “vested interests” should prevail at such a critical time. Just in: America’s private sector is slowing this month. Factory activity across the US rose at its slowest rate in nine months, according to data firm Markit. Companies reported that output and new business growth both slowed compared to May. This dragged Markit’s ‘composite PMI’, which measures activity across the private sector, down to a three month low of 53.0, from 53.6. That shows slower growth. But on the upside, job creation picked up and new orders hit a five-month high. Businesses also restocked their inventories, suggesting more optimism about the future. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says America’s economy is ending the current quarter on “a softer note”. That may mean that growth isn’t as strong as hoped, after a weak start to 2017. “The average expansion seen in the second quarter is down on that seen in the first three months of the year, indicating a slowing in the underlying pace of economic growth. While official GDP data are expected to turn higher in the second quarter after an especially weak start to the year (our recent GDP tracker based on various official and survey data points to 3.0% growth), the relatively subdued PMI readings suggest there are some downside risks to the extent to which GDP will rebound. Back in the UK, the Serious Fraud Office has closed a probe into whether the Bank of England broke the law during the financial crisis. After a two-year investigation, the SFO has concluded there is “no evidence of criminality” related to the emerging lending measures that the BoE took, to prevent the financial markets seizing up. This all relates to the liquidity auctions which the BoE ran in 2007 and 2008, which gave UK banks access to desperately needed capital following the credit crunch, and the subsequent collapse of Lehman Brothers. The SFO had been looking into whether any assistance was given to certain financial institutions to enable them to bid successfully for the available funding, to the possible detriment of other institutions. Surprise inflation data from Canada have sent the Canadian dollar sliding. Consumer prices across Canada fell by 0.2% during May (on a seasonally adjusted basis0) due to falling goods and energy prices. That dragged the annual inflation rate down to just 1.3%, down from 1.6% in April (and much weaker than Britain’s 2.9% inflation rate). Economists had expected a smaller fall, to 1.5%. The Canadian dollar promptly fell to 75.23 cents against the US dollar, from 75.6, as traders concluded that this creates less pressure to raise interest rates. “Taking back control” was a key message for the campaign to leave the EU last year. And today, the European Central Bank has launched a new bid to take control of the euro clearing market, currently centred in London. The clearing market is the point in the system where derivatives contracts are settled. It is meant to reduce financial risk, by using central counterparties who can prevent one default triggering a wave of forced sales and margin calls. The ECB has proposed adjusting its statute, to give it authority to oversee the clearing of euro-demominated securities. That could be the prelude to moving the market into the eurozone, or more control over activities in London. My colleague Jill Treanor explains: London is facing renewed pressure over its dominance of the €1tn (£880bn) a day euro clearing market after the European Central Bank set out proposals aimed at giving it more oversight of the lucrative business. The move by the Frankfurt-based ECB - the central bank for the 19 countries using the euro - follows a report by the European commission which called for the EU to have more powers over clearing of financial products denominated in euros after Brexit. The City dominates the market of clearing, a process which is supposed to reduce the risks of complex financial transactions by matching buyers and sellers as well as reduce the cost of trading, through so-called central counterparties (CCPs)..... Meanwhile, the Greek government has dispatched two top ministers abroad on an investment drive. It’s an attempt to capitalise on the momentum of last week’s euro group decision to throw the country a fresh financial credit line. Helena Smith reports from Athens Both the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and the economics and development minister Dimitris Papadimitriou have flown to London and the US respectively in a bid to attract investors. Tsakalotos, who was raised in Britain, is, say officials, on a mission to persuade interlocutors that Greece is now on a path of recovery, with a clear stretch ahead of it, following last week’s crucial decision to disburse a further €8.5bn euro in rescue funds to avert default. Papadimitiou, long-time economics professor at Bard College, has been in New York with leading businessmen and Geoffrey Pyatt, the US ambassador to Greece, attending the sixth Greek investment programme whose working title is “Greece at a turning point.” It is hoped that both visits will increase appetite for bonds now that yields have dropped markedly since the euro group decision. Foreign investment, though once a dirty word for prime minister Alexis Tsipras’ leftist-led government, is seen as imperative for kick-starting the economy – and tackling an unemployment rate of 23%. Economists say that budget cut savings are simply not enough after eight years of gruelling austerity to spur growth. Just in: the UK public’s inflation expectations have risen slightly, as the Bank of England argues over whether to raise interest rates or not. The public now expect inflation to average 3.1% in the long term, up from 3.0% a month ago. Expectations for the year ahead have inched a little higher too, to 2.62%. Inflation actually hit 2.9% last month, and some economists see it heading higher. But Christian Schulz, economist at Citi, says the survey doesn’t suggest the BoE should aggressively hike interest rates: “Expectations are close to long-run averages, but strong upward momentum that would call for urgent monetary tightening is absent in our view” Outgoing BoE policymaker Kristin Forbes may not agree. Last night, she gave a speech arguing that the Bank is ‘behind the curve’ and suggesting that some policymakers were too hesitant to raise borrowing costs. The price of copper has jumped to a two-month high, helped by this morning’s strong eurozone data. One tonne of copper jumped by 1.5% to $5,827, the highest level since early April. Banske Bank analyst Jens Pedersen says (via Reuters): “Positive sentiment around China and a rise in manufacturing PMIs out of Europe are supporting base metals prices.” Attention, eurozone crisis watchers. The BBC World Service covering the Greek debt crisis, looking at this month’s bailout and the long-term cost of austerity It includes contributions from our Athens correspondent Helena Smith, and is being streamed here: Greece: a Long Road to Recovery Here’s the pitch: Greece has been through dark economic times over the past decade. Last week a European Union loan of 8.5bn Euros enabled Greece to meet its latest debt payments. The IMF says this deal will help Greece stand on its own feet again over the course of the next year. But after the years of austerity and hardship, do the Greek people believe this will do anything to improve their lives? For Newshour Extra this week, Owen Bennett Jones is in Athens to discuss the consequences of living with long-term austerity and the prognosis for economic recovery. Back on the Brexit anniversary....analysts are pointing out that there’s a notable shift between the fortunes of UK-focused companies, and those with an international outlook. Those multinational firms have enjoyed a real surge in their value, up 28% in the last year, as the weak pound boosts the value of their overseas earning. But UK-centric firms have actually fallen in value, by 5% in sterling terms, due to worries over the UK economy Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG in the UK, has crunched the numbers: “The KPMG Non-UK 50, which represents the largest companies with more than 70% of their market outside the UK, is up a remarkable 28% since the EU referendum - significantly outperforming the world’s largest indices, while the FTSE 100 climbed 17% over the same period. In contrast, the KPMG UK50, which represents the largest FTSE companies with over 70% of their market in the UK, is down 5%. Put in pounds and pence, this equates to a £330 billion rise in the value of the KPMG Non-UK50 and a £19 billion loss for their domestic equivalent. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital has shown how mining companies (Glencore and Antofagasta), consumer giants (Unilever and Diageo) and banks (HSBC) have driven the rally. Over in parliament, a delicious battle is brewing over the top job on the Treasury select committee, one of the most powerful oversight roles in Westminster. Several MPs have a burning desire to succeed Andrew Tyrie, the former chair, who stepped down as an MP at the general election. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the eurosceptic, old-school Tory, is keen, and had been seen as a front-runner. But he’s now facing a challenge from former minister Nicky Morgan, a fellow Conservative, who has thrown her hat into the ring this morning: Rees-Mogg is one of those politicians who divides opinions, and there are signs that some MPs are determined to thwart him. The Financial Times reports this morning that a Stop Mogg campaign is underway. Some Labour MPs are organising to thwart Mr Rees-Mogg, although they have not yet decided who to support. “The idea is to simply stop Mogg,” said one Labour MP. “It almost doesn’t matter who the candidate is, we just don’t want him.” They argue that his role at Somerset Capital Management could pose a conflict of interests. Many also believe that as an ardent supporter of the UK leaving the EU he may not pursue sufficient scrutiny of the government’s Brexit plans. Wes Streeting, who has served on the TSC for the last couple of years (alongside Rees-Mogg), says he’s backing Morgan.. Sterling is marking the first anniversary of the EU referendum with a small rally. The pound is up half a cent against the US dollar at $1.2728. That means it’s still worth 14% less than before the Brexit vote, after a year of heightened volatility. And with Brexit talks getting underway in Brussels, the pound still looks exposed to further twists and turns. Graham Bishop, Investment Director at Heartwood Investment Management explains: “Sterling’s devaluation in response to the shock UK referendum result has been the most significant market event in recent years. It has yet to materially recover from its post-referendum low and now remains vulnerable to even more political and economic uncertainty. Paul McNamara of asset management firm GAM shows how the UK has been the worst-performing major currency over the last year: Katie Martin of the FT has dug deep into the Bloomberg terminal, and found a couple of currencies who did even worst than the pound (the Congolese franc and the Uzbekistan soum) Tara Cunningham of the Telegraph shows how the FTSE has benefitted from the pound’s weakness: Eurozone stock markets are all down this morning, as the PMIs fail to spark much enthusiasm in the City. The FTSE 100 has shed 30 points, or 0.4%, to 7410. That means the Footsie is on track for its third weekly loss in a row for the first time this year, after energy stocks and mining stocks slipped. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: It’s been a pretty bleak week for the UK index, shedding around 150 points from Tuesday’s intraday peak as the latest oil crisis drew focus from the sterling-sapping/FTSE-boosting political uncertainty that was the main market driver in the previous fortnight. Here’s Julien Lafargue, european equities strategist at the J.P. Morgan Private Bank, on today’s eurozone PMI report: The macroeconomic momentum appears to have eased somewhat in June, in particular in the Services sector. In light of the sharp improvement we have witnessed in the past 9 months, this pause is not really a surprise and, in our opinion, should not be interpreted as an indication that the economy is about to roll over. Activity in the Eurozone remains at very healthy levels and consumer confidence is at its highest level in 16 years. In addition, despite the recent drop in commodity prices, inflation dynamics remain supported by a large backlog and supplier delivery delays worsening to the greatest extent for just over six years. As such, we believe the ECB could adopt a relatively more hawkish stance in the coming months. The eurozone’s private sector has recorded its strongest quarterly growth since the debt crisis began, although growth has slowed a little this month. That’s the upshot from Markit’s monthly healthcheck on factories and service sector firms across the euro area. Markit’s ‘flash’ eurozone PMI for June has dropped to 55.7, down from 56.8 in May, and weaker than the City had expected. But still, the average PMI over the last three months is the strongest quarter since 2011 [this includes this morning’s figures from Germany and France] Markit says: Although the rate of growth waned to a five-month low, high order book inflows and elevated levels of business confidence meant job creation remained one of the strongest recorded over the past decade as firms continued to expand capacity to meet rising demand. Price pressures eased, however, largely reflecting lower global commodity prices. Markit’s Chris Williamson says the figures suggest eurozone growth has accelerated to a robust 0.7% in the current quarter, up from 0.6% in Q1. He adds: The upturn is also broad-based, with the surveys signalling an acceleration of GDP growth in both France and Germany in the second quarter, as well as across the rest of the region as a whole, albeit with some loss of momentum seen across the board in June. “Job creation continued to run at one of the highest rates seen over the past decade as firms expanded capacity to meet demand. Factory jobs growth remained particularly buoyant, thanks in part to production requirements surging higher on the back of rising exports. Germany ‘flash PMI’ is just out, and it shows that private sector growth in the eurozone’s largest economy is slowing a little. The German composite PMI has dropped to a four-month low of 56.1 this month. That’s down from 57.4 in May, but it still signals solid growth (the 50-point mark separates expansion from contraction). Firms reported that output grew sharply, but new export orders slowed to the slowest growth rate since February. Trevor Balchin, senior economist at IHS Markit, says the figures suggest Germany is still enjoying “strong economic growth”, although the service sector is falling behind manufacturing. “The latest data signalled a growing performance gap between manufacturing and services, however. The goods-producing sector continued to outperform, with the headline PMI little-changed from May’s 73-month record. Although growth of manufacturing output, exports and jobs all eased slightly since May, expansions in backlogs and total new orders gathered pace and supply bottlenecks intensified. Another boost for France! French companies are creating jobs at the fastest rate since the financial crisis. That’s according to data firm Markit, whose ‘flash’ purchasing managers report for June, just released, shows that private sector employment has jumped at the fastest rate in almost 10 years. Markit says: Buoyed by strong client demand, private sector firms in France raised their staffing numbers for an eighth successive month in June. Furthermore, the rate of job creation was the most marked in just under ten years. The increase was broad-based across both the manufacturing and service sectors. The PMI report shows that French factories picked up this month, pushing the Manufacturing PMI up to 55.0 from 53.8 in May. But services sector growth slowed, pulling the Services PMI down to 55.3 from 57.2 in May. That’s a five-month low, but still shows steady growth. Alex Gill, economist at IHS Markit says: “A particularly upbeat talking point highlighted in the latest data was the sharpest rise in employment for almost ten years. This is welcome news for the newly elected government which has made reducing unemployment one of the main aims of its administration. The slowdown in the rate of accumulation in unfinished work poses a slight concern however, and may slow employment growth in the short-term. Howard Archer of EY Item Club is also impressed by France’s GDP: Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi is encouraged by the upgraded French growth figures: Newsflash: France’s economy grew faster than previously thought in the first three months of this year. French Q1 GDP has just been revised, to show that the eurozone’s second-largest economy expanded by 0.5% in the quarter. That’s up from a previous estimate of 0.4%, and means France comfortably outpaced Britain (which grew by 0.2%) and wasn’t far behind Germany ( which posted 0.6% growth). France’s growth was driven by business investment - or gross fixed capital formation - which jumped by 1.2% in the quarter. Inventory changes also added 0.7% to growth, as companies restocked their warehouses. But net trade was a drag, though, as exports fell 0.7% during the quarter while imports rose by 1.2%. And household consumption was flat. But still, it shows that this spring’s presidential election didn’t spook the economy, and it gives Emmanuel Macron a decent starting point to build on. Reaction to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we’ll learn whether European companies are enjoying a blistering June, as data firm Markit releases its latest ‘flash’ purchasing managers indexes. These PMIs track activity, output and job creation among private companies, and are expected to show another month of decent growth as Europe’s recovery continues. The overall eurozone composite PMI is expected to come in at 56.6, down a little on May’s 56.8, but still a strong number -- anything over 50 shows growth. Inflation is also on everyone’s mind; this afternoon, Canada will release its consumer prices index. Economists expect it to drop to 1.5%, from 1.6%, as the recent oil price falls feed through to the real economy. We’ll also be tracking reaction to a damning official report into the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant. It warns that Britain will be locked into subsidising the “risky and expensive” project for decades My colleague Adam Vaughan explains: The National Audit Office said the contract sealed by ministers last September with EDF to construct the country’s first new atomic reactors in two decades would provide “uncertain strategic and economic benefits”. Further, Brexit and Theresa May’s decision to quit an EU nuclear treaty could make the situation even worse, by triggering taxpayer compensation for EDF or a more generous deal for the French state-controlled company. It’s not been the most thrilling week in the markets, and I fear that the European bourses may be rather quiet again today. Britain’s FTSE is expected to dip by around 0.1% in early trading.

In his first visit to Britain since becoming prime minister last year, Li will also announce investment plans that George Osborne, chancellor, will argue show that London is going to be the world centre for renminbi trading. China Construction Bank, China's second-largest lender, has been selected to become the first clearing service for renminbi trading in London. Chinese companies are expected to announce fresh details of their plans to provide finance and technology for the proposed nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset. And the recently created China Minsheng Investment (CMI) is expected to reveal plans to set up a London office and put money into British companies. CMI, led by Dong Wenbiao, chairman of China Minsheng Banking Corporation, has about £5bn under management. Li will be accompanied by about 200 Chinese business leaders, not all of them part of the official visit, including the heads of some of his country's biggest banks. He will meet the Queen during his stay in Britain. Chinese companies China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) and China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) have already agreed in principle to be minority shareholders in the Hinkley Point project. So far only letters of intent have been signed by EDF Group, Areva, CGN and CNNC to become strategic and industrial partners in the project. The two Chinese companies were due to take a stake of between 30% and 40%, but that may yet increase. EDF Energy, which runs 15 nuclear power plants, has been working with CGN and CNNC for 15 years. CGN currently operates 8.3 gigawatts of nuclear power. It has eight units in operation and 15 under construction, including two reactors being built in a joint venture with EDF at Taishan. CNNC has nine units in operation and 12 under construction. Lord Prescott, former deputy prime minister and chairman of the Blair government's Chinese taskforce, predicted the Chinese government would be seeking assurances that Britain would remain in the EU, since the Chinese see Britain as a gateway to investment in the bloc. Prescott told Sky News's Murnaghan programme: \"Both the Japanese and the Chinese take the view that investment in Britain is good only after you have the access to the European market of 450 million people.\" He said the prime minister, David Cameron, \"seems to be saying now we want to get out of it – every day he says something like that. That's going to make investors say to themselves, 'Am I going to put a long-term investment in a country that is probably going to leave Europe?' \" Prescott accused Cameron of downgrading the importance of the taskforce and said Cameron's meeting with the Dalai Lama in 2012 had been a disaster. The Home Office will also issue a report easing restrictions on visas for Chinese visitors to Britain, a longstanding Chinese demand. There is likely to be a 24-hour \"super-priority\" service for important business visitors, and the extension of a pilot scheme that lets tourists receive a British entry permit at the same time as a visa for countries in the Schengen area. Official data shows annual goods exports to China have grown to £12.4bn last year from £7.6bn in 2010 when Cameron took office."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/oct/20/uk-unlikely-to-press-xi-jinping-too-hard-over-steel-dumping-hammond-signals","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-20T08:48:36Z","webTitle":"UK unlikely to press Xi Jinping too hard over steel 'dumping', Hammond signals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/20/uk-unlikely-to-press-xi-jinping-too-hard-over-steel-dumping-hammond-signals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/oct/20/uk-unlikely-to-press-xi-jinping-too-hard-over-steel-dumping-hammond-signals","fields":{"headline":"UK unlikely to press Xi Jinping too hard over steel 'dumping', Hammond signals","bodyText":"Britain cannot build a wall around its steel industry, the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, has said as he indicated that David Cameron was unlikely to press the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, too harshly on the “dumping” of steel. Amid predictions that Tata Steel is to announce almost 1,200 job losses in Scunthorpe and Scotland, the foreign secretary said that the steel industry was struggling to cope with falling prices in the face of a global surplus in supply. Hammond told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: “We have got to get the balance right: trying to protect our steel industry in a sensible way, which we are doing, but recognising that we are operating in a global economy. We can’t simply build a wall around the UK.” Cameron, who has come under fire for being deferential to the Chinese at the start of a state visit by Xi, told Jeremy Corbyn in the Commons on Monday that he would raise the issue with the president. But Hammond, who denied that Britain was being naive in its relations with Beijing, questioned whether China was dumping steel on Europe. This describes the process in which China helps to drive down the global price of steel by flooding markets with its own subsidised steel. “You talk about dumping,” the foreign secretary told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4. “There is a world surplus in the steel industry, a global surplus, and steel prices have come down very sharply over the last year. That is a big problem for steel producers in this country. But it isn’t only the Chinese. There are surpluses being produced around the world.” The foreign secretary’s remarks suggest that the prime minister will mention the troubles faced by the British steel industry only in the margins of his discussions with Xi. Corbyn pressed Cameron to raise the issue after the news that Caparo steel is going into administration and before the news that Tata Steel could announce around 1,200 job losses. The prime minister, who hailed a new “golden era” in Britain’s relations with China over the weekend, will focus on unlocking £3bn in new trade deals with Beijing that would lead to 3,900 new British jobs. The economic centrepiece of Xi’s visit is likely to be a multibillion-pound Chinese investment in Britain’s new generation of nuclear power stations but there will also be deals in the creative industries, retail, health, technology, financial services, aerospace and education. The foreign secretary rejected suggestions that Britain was being overly deferential to Beijing. “I don’t think we are naive. We go into all relationships with our eyes wide open ... It is very much in our national interest to engage with China but we do so with our eyes wide open. We don’t agree with the Chinese on everything.” The foreign secretary said that Britain’s greatest leverage came from its membership of the EU. Steel imports are managed by the EU, which has imposed tariffs on Chinese steel. But he said driving up the price of UK steel would harm “downstream” industries such as Jaguar Land Rover, which is a major exporter to China because low steel prices make its car prices competitive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/05/confusing-government-policy-biggest-threat-to-uk-clean-energy-says-top-academic","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-05T15:55:30Z","webTitle":"Confusing government policy biggest threat to UK clean energy, says top academic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/05/confusing-government-policy-biggest-threat-to-uk-clean-energy-says-top-academic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/05/confusing-government-policy-biggest-threat-to-uk-clean-energy-says-top-academic","fields":{"headline":"Confusing government policy biggest threat to UK clean energy, says top academic","bodyText":"The biggest threat to renewable energy in the UK, and the country’s energy systems, comes from a lack of clarity on the part of government, a leading academic has said. Rob Gross, director of the centre for energy policy at Imperial College London, said on Monday: “[There is a] lack of clarity over what they want people to do. This lack of clarity is erasing investment in everything. With more clarity, you would get more investment.” Under the “political machinations” of the previous coalition government, the amount bill-payers were expected to contribute in support for low-carbon power was made “subject to a cap”, he said, but “there is no decision on what that cap will be after 2020”, leaving energy investors in the dark. Not just renewable energy, but gas and nuclear power were suffering, he said. The government has been unwilling to provide long-term direction, and has repeatedly made major changes to energy regulation, including reversals in renewable electricity subsidy regimes, increased support for nuclear energy, and delays to carbon capture and storage. Under the incoming Conservative government, subsidies to onshore wind and solar have been slashed, and planning obstacles put in the way of onshore turbines. The renewable energy industry has accused the government of deterring investors with its repeated changes to the subsidy and regulatory regimes. Jim Watson, research director at the UK Energy Research Centre, said it was “too early to tell” what would be the biggest problem for renewables, but that it was “potentially the government”. The new Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has called for energy systems to be brought back within government control. However, Michael Grubb, professor of international energy and climate change policy at University College London, said: “I can see no reason to go back [to centralised government control of energy] but I do think we have outgrown the idea that competition alone solves every problem in energy.” He said: “There is no evidence that privatised or nationalised energy systems are better. What really matters is the quality of the institutions that govern the energy sector, such as the energy regulator.” In part, Grubb said, renewable energy in the UK had been a victim of its own success. Government projections of how much onshore wind power and how much solar electricity would be produced have been repeatedly outdone as costs have come down and the industries have expanded. This, he said, meant the Treasury and the incoming government claimed they “had not got the budget” to provide ongoing support at the levels the technologies previously enjoyed. Keith Bell, professor of smart grids at the University of Strathclyde, said the key to incorporating more renewable energy on the nation’s grid would be to invest in more storage capacity, and interconnectors that can “correct imbalances”, for instance by transmitting excess energy to other regions when more energy is produced than there is demand for."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/grrlscientist/2015/oct/05/what-happened-to-wildlife-when-chernobyl-drove-humans-out-it-thrived","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-05T17:08:10Z","webTitle":"What happened to wildlife when Chernobyl drove humans out?

It thrived","bodyText":"After a fire and explosion destroyed the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986, more than 100,000 people were permanently evacuated from the area to avoid radiation levels that were twenty times greater than the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. But what happened to the local wildlife? According to a letter published today in the journal, Current Biology, scientists report that the Chernobyl disaster area is home to a rich and varied wildlife community, indicating that the mere presence of people is more damaging to wildlife than is radiation poisoning. Chernobyl was a disaster for people, but for wildlife? Not so much When the Chernobyl nuclear power plant melted down in 1986, more than 116,000 people were permanently relocated from a contaminated area comprising 4200 km2, an area that was later designated the Chernobyl exclusion zone. But what happened to the local wildlife? Previous studies indicate that wildlife numbers initially dropped in the months after the accident (i.e.; doi:10.1098/rsbl.2008.0778). However, thirty years later, what effect is radiation contamination having on the abundance of Chernobyl’s large mammals? An international team of researchers, headed by Tatiana Deryabina of the Polessye State Radioecological Reserve (PSRER), conducted surveys to find out. The PSRER is the Belarus sector of the Chernobyl exclusion zone. It covers 2,165 km2 (half of the total Chernobyl exclusion area) and has similar radiation levels to the Ukrainian sector. The findings for PSRER were compared to four nearby nature reserves that were uncontaminated by the Chernobyl accident: Berezinsky Biosphere Reserve, a state nature reserve covering 852 km2; Braslav Lakes National Park, which covers 645 km2; Belovezhskaya Puscha National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site situated both in Poland (105 km2) and Belarus (1501 km2); and Narochansky National Park, which covers 874 km2. Of these, just two (Belovezhskaya Puscha and Narochansky National Park) allow limited wildlife hunting. The team tested three fundamental hypotheses concerning the resilience of wildlife to the world’s worst nuclear accident: Hypothesis 1: densities of mammals were suppressed due to the levels of radioactive contamination in the Chernobyl exclusion zone Hypothesis 2: densities of large mammals were suppressed at PSRER compared with those in four uncontaminated nature reserves in Belarus Hypothesis 3: densities of large mammals declined between 1 and 10 years after the accident To test these hypotheses, trained staff conducted wildlife snow track censuses between 2008 and 2010 along 35 permanent track survey routes (total combined length of 315 km with an average track length of 9 km) (doi:10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.10.025). Specific PSRER habitat types (former agricultural lands, former villages, evergreen forest, and deciduous forest) and levels of radiocæsium contamination density were mapped using GIS along each of these routes. Aerial surveys were conducted between 1987 and 1997 from February through early March when snow cover was present. The study area survey took place from a height of 100 metres at a speed of 70-100 km/h and extended to approximately 250 metres on each side of the helicopter. As you can see, the empirical data show no evidence of long-term radiation damage to the large mammal populations at Chernobyl, and thus, the evidence does not support any of the three hypotheses being tested (Figure 1): In fact, increases in elk (moose) and wild boar populations in the Chernobyl exclusion zone occurred in the early 1990s, when these species’ populations were undergoing a rapid decline in former Soviet Union countries due to increased rural poverty and weakened wildlife management. Further, the relative abundance of wolves living in and around the Chernobyl exclusion zone site is more than seven times greater than in the four nearby uncontaminated nature reserves. “There have long been rumours that the Chernobyl site has abundant wildlife — including carnivores — so I welcome this piece”, said wildlife demographer Tim Coulson, a Professor of Zoology at the University of Oxford, who was not part of this study. “Because it is contaminated land, it is not easy to study wildlife in detail, and any studies are going to have to rely on approaches like this taken here”, said Professor Coulson in email. In fact, this study demonstrates that, regardless of potential radiation effects on individual animals, the Chernobyl exclusion zone supports a thriving and abundant mammal community despite nearly three decades of chronic radiation exposure. “It’s very likely that wildlife numbers at Chernobyl are much higher than they were before the accident,” said co-author Jim Smith, a Professor of Environmental Science at the University of Portsmouth, in a press release. Chernobyl’s wild boar populations grew especially fast -- until 1993-1994, when they suddenly crashed (Figure 1). This was due to a large increase in wolves, which are particularly fond of dining on wild boar, combined with an outbreak of African swine fever. Humans are more damaging to wildlife and ecosystems than is radiation poisoning “This study is a very positive move forward in conducting research concerning the potential health and environmental impacts of nuclear accidents”, said population biologist Timothy Mousseau, a Professor in the Biology Department at the University of South Carolina, who was not part of this study. “I applaud the authors in their efforts to bring hard scientific data to bear on the question of impacts to wildlife in the stricken regions of Ukraine and Belarus. Much more research on this and related questions are desperately needed”, said Professor Mousseau in email. “This doesn’t mean radiation is good for wildlife, just that the effects of human habitation, including hunting, farming, and forestry, are a lot worse,” said Professor Smith. “This is an extremely sad indictment on how bad people are for wildlife”, agreed Professor Coulson. “Once [people] have left an area the wildlife appear to thrive — even if the habitat is laced with radiation.” Although the detrimental effects of radiation on individual animals has been well documented, particularly on Chernobyl’s wildlife, its effects on populations isn’t so clear. “This study does not address the issue of whether radiation has effects on reproduction, survival, longevity, or general health of the animals surveyed”, Professor Mousseau pointed out. Nonetheless, this study indicates that populations of large mammals in the Chernobyl exclusion zone are doing at least as well as those in uncontaminated national parks in the vicinity. But sadly, this study clearly shows that putting a big fence around an area to keep people out is beneficial to wildlife, even if the negative effects of radiation contamination on wildlife -- increased mutation rates, cancers and other abnormalities -- may be masked by this advantage. “Obviously I am not condoning nuclear accidents for the sake of wildlife! Far from it”, said Professor Coulson. “But hopefully some good can come from it. Hopefully we will realise that for wildlife and ecosystems to flourish, we must leave them be and stop interfering.” In short, this paper suggests that not every nuclear wilderness is a bad thing.

Trevorrow isn’t set to return to the director’s chair (no director has been confirmed yet), but he will co-write the screenplay with Derek Connolly (Jurassic World, Safety Not Guaranteed). Actors Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard have both signed on to the sequel, with Steven Spielberg again executive producing through his Amblin Entertainment banner. In an interview with Wired, Trevorrow revealed that the sequel will differ in a big way from his first stab at the franchise. Jurassic World took place entirely on the fictional island of Isla Nublar, where the dinosaur theme park is located. That won’t be the case for the follow-up. “[It will not be] just a bunch of dinosaurs chasing people on an island,” Trevorrow said. “That’ll get old real fast.” Instead, he’s intent on expanding the universe of the Jurassic franchise. Trevorrow said he’s toying with the idea of making the dinosaurs “open-source” – meaning they can be bred by multiple companies around the world rather than just by InGen, the bioengineering start-up company responsible for Jurassic World’s dinosaurs. “There are applications for this science that reach far beyond entertainment,” Trevorrow explained. “And when you look back at nuclear power and how that started, the first instinct was to weaponise it and later on we found it could be used for energy … I want to do my job in setting the table for something that can be rich and thoughtful and interesting.” Since opening, Jurassic World has grossed over $1.5bn in theaters, including over $610m in the US alone, to become the third-highest grossing film of all time behind Titanic and Avatar. It has helped studio Universal manage a record year, with Fast &amp; Furious 7 and Fifty Shades of Grey also boasting stellar worldwide numbers. The follow-up is currently set to open on 22 June 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/apr/22/lake-district-villagers-ravenglass-fume-plans-electricity-pylons","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-22T12:25:24Z","webTitle":"Lake District villagers fume at plans to erect giant electricity pylons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/22/lake-district-villagers-ravenglass-fume-plans-electricity-pylons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/apr/22/lake-district-villagers-ravenglass-fume-plans-electricity-pylons","fields":{"headline":"Lake District villagers fume at plans to erect giant electricity pylons","bodyText":"John Ruskin described it as the “gateway to paradise” where the mountains literally tumble into the sea and the land bears the remnants of the final frontiers of the Roman empire. But the tranquil, isolated charm of the tiny fishing village of Ravenglass – on the west coast of the Lake District national park – is under threat. Locals say their very own world heritage site has been offered up like a sacrificial lamb after plans were initiated for a stretch of pylons that once erected will be be seen from every street in the village. Pink “No Pylon” signs have been put up in homes and residents are beginning to get vocal. National Grid plans to erect 75 pylons in the Lake District, with at least eight surrounding Ravenglass. The company wants to build more than 20 miles of pylons in and around the western side of the Lake District national park to carry electricity from a proposed new nuclear power station at Moorside, near Sellafield. National Grid has told people in Ravenglass that about 1.2 miles – less than a 10th of the new high-voltage line – might be placed underground. It has asked residents to suggest which area should be spared the blight of pylons up to 160ft tall. Mike Harrison, who is leading the campaign in Ravenglass against the plans, is baffled by the network’s approach. He voiced the widespread view that a short-term cost saving for the National Grid will ruin the cherished countryside for future generations. Harrison, Cumbrian born and bred from nearby Bowness, said: “There are so many reasons why this should not happen. There are the obvious ones that we don’t want these pylons to blight our views, but then there are the facts – this is an important village from an archeological perspective, it is also a site of special scientific interest with the dunes nearby which attract gulls. “All of this could be lost because they made the rather silly decision of planning to put this new power station on the wrong side of the national park and then they assumed this would not matter. We do not want them to come in like a demolition fleet – every aspect of life in the village will be effected if this goes ahead.” Locals say the pylons will tower over a Roman bathhouse, fort and settlement, not to mention blight views for its 200 inhabitants. There are also fears that the tourist footfall in the now “ageing” community will fall, leaving them further isolated. The village sits at the estuary of three rivers: the Esk, the Mite and the Irt. There are about 150 houses, three pubs, a hotel and a cafe. There is also Muncaster Castle – home to the Pennington family for the past 800 years – which draws in hundreds of visitors and wedding parties. Peter Frost-Pennington, who runs Muncaster Castle with his wife Iona, has thrown his weight behind the campaign. Appointing himself “steward” of the lands, he said those who live in the coastal areas of the national park are viewed as the poor relations of the rest of the Lake District because of its industrial history. Frost-Pennington argued that his more vociferous neighbours, in areas such as Windemere, Keswick and Ambleside, would never entertain such an idea. He said: “What has really upset us is that we have been ignored – this is not the best route or the cheapest one. This route is a compromise so as not to ignite tensions with other more glamorous Lake District communities. But what about our beautiful coast? “National Grid have all been perfectly polite in meetings, but what they are proposing is to barge through here with these massive pylons. This is going to be a world heritage site and they cannot destroy this wonderful landscape where the mountains meet the sea for future generations. “We are not nimbys – we are just trying to protect our heritage.” Friends of the Lake District, a membership organisation dedicated to protecting Cumbrian landscapes, has also waded into the debate and refused to help choose the area that should be pylon-free, saying that the whole route should be buried. Kate Willshaw, policy officer at Friends of the Lake District, told the Guardian: “It’s like being asked which of your children you want to save while sacrificing the rest. We can’t say any sections are more valuable than others.” She added that National Grid was trying to trap her organisation and others into identifying the most important areas so that it could claim to have taken their advice and protected them. “If somebody breaks ranks and says the undergrounding should be in one particular area then the National Grid could say at the planning inquiry that ‘this group said this was the most important part of the national park so that’s why we are saving it’,” she said. There is a significant cost to putting the network underground – 20 miles of buried lines would cost about £450m more than using pylons. However, opponents of the plans have argued that this would add only about 40p a year to the average electricity bill in England and Wales. They point out that National Grid has already agreed to remove about 45 existing pylons from the New Forest national park, the Peak District, Snowdonia and the Dorset area of outstanding natural beauty near Winterbourne Abbas. The electricity lines in these areas will be placed underground by 2021 in a £500m “visual impact provision” project. Bill Bryson, the American Anglophile author and former president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, has also joined the protest against the Lake District pylons saying one of the “finest landscapes on the planet” should not be exploited for business interests. National Grid said it was considering placing part of the route underground, but has so far refused to say how much. Details will be published this summer in a public consultation, with a planning application expected to be submitted in March next year. A spokesman for National Grid told the Times: “When building connections for generators, we strive to avoid designated landscapes. Where this is not possible, we work closely with stakeholders and communities and carry out consultations to develop a proposal that achieves the best possible balance between protecting the environment and ensuring everyone has an affordable electricity supply. “We fully recognise the importance of the national park and for more than five years have been working together with local authorities from across Cumbria and Lancashire, including the Lake District National Park Authority, as well as environmental, business and community organisations to develop our proposals.” National Grid has said that most of the line would follow the path of existing smaller pylons, which would be removed. These are about half the size at about 80ft tall and slimmer than the proposed new pylons. National Grid expects to spend about £2.5bn connecting up the power station with lines to Carlisle in the north and Heysham, Lancashire, in the south. Part of the southern route will be placed in a new tunnel under Morecambe Bay, sparing the south of the Lake District. In the meantime the future of Ravenglass, the Lake District’s poor relation, hangs in the balance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/aug/04/hiroshimas-70th-anniversary-whats-the-mood-in-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-04T07:39:46Z","webTitle":"Hiroshima's 70th anniversary: what's the mood in Japan?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/04/hiroshimas-70th-anniversary-whats-the-mood-in-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/aug/04/hiroshimas-70th-anniversary-whats-the-mood-in-japan","fields":{"headline":"Hiroshima's 70th anniversary: what's the mood in Japan?","bodyText":"Japan is preparing to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the atomic bomb being dropped on Hiroshima.

Yes, the beneficiaries were wealthier households with up to £20,000 to spare. But it kick-started explosive growth in the industry which helped to push down the cost of later installations, now on around 655,000 roofs across the UK. The government was also right to slash the tariffs paid to householders from 41.6p a unit of electricity back in 2010 to just 12.5p today, as the price of installation fell to just £6,000 or £7,000. Even at 12.5p it looks too generous; why should lower income households have to subsidise, through higher electricity bills, the better off? Renters could not benefit while homeowners could. Some estimates put the cost at around £6 on everyone’s bill. But the government’s expected cut to tariffs in January – reducing payments by 89% – will kill roof-top solar almost overnight. As we report this week, there is a rush to install before the deadline, but after that the lights go out. The subsidies, so despised by climate change deniers, have driven market innovation and price cuts. They are a mostly decent example of how government intervention can spur efficiency and job creation, outweighing the regrettably large number of dodgy double glazing-style sales tactics subsidies also triggered. Even London mayor Boris Johnson says he is “very concerned”, with warnings that up to 20,000 jobs could go in the next few months. What is odd is that we were on the path to zero subsidy anyway. The fast-falling cost of production (after all, the panels are basically made of sand) plus more efficient installation suggests that within a decade or so they could be self financing. Instead, we’ll see installation grind to a halt and British firms go bust. The government counters that the runaway £1.5bn overspend on subsidies has to be reined in, and that its plans to cut payouts “will keep bills as low as possible for hardworking families”. Yet it soon emerged that the planned cuts to subsidies for solar would only net between £40m and £100m by 2020, the equivalent of between 50p and £1.20 a year off the average electricity bill, not £6, according to government background documents. Compare that to the lengths the government will go to underwrite nuclear power projects and encourage fracking in national parks. Cut the subsidy, by all means. Halve it, even. Set a date for its complete removal. The industry will innovate and survive. But slicing it by 87% in one go is plain absurd. The axe falls just as solar is winning support from the unlikeliest of sources. This week the chief investment officer of one of the world’s biggest asset management companies gave a striking prediction, but I can’t name him as it was an off-the-record conversation. Shareholders of the major oil companies are expecting the price of crude to rebound from its current $45-a-barrel level back towards its former $100+ level. They blame the Saudis for pumping oil and forcing the price down to kill off competition from America’s giant fracking fields. But he thinks the game is up for both. Solar power, he reckons, will eventually become so cheap that, coupled with improved battery technology, it will push the price of oil down even further. He is no environmentalist or supporter of the Guardian’s Keep it in the ground campaign, but his cold financial calculation is that the oil companies will be left with stranded assets – which is why they are pumping as much as they can now, even at a low price, to avoid being left with near-worthless stock. Solar is the future, yet the government appears determined to throw it into the industrial dustbin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2015/oct/21/china-and-britain-40bn-deals-jobs-best-partner-west","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-21T18:12:09Z","webTitle":"Cameron hails UK as 'best partner in west' as he signs £40bn China deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/21/china-and-britain-40bn-deals-jobs-best-partner-west","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/oct/21/china-and-britain-40bn-deals-jobs-best-partner-west","fields":{"headline":"Cameron hails UK as 'best partner in west' as he signs £40bn China deal","bodyText":"China and the UK have signed almost £40bn worth of deals that David Cameron said would create thousands of jobs and make Britain Beijing’s partner of choice. “What this really means is jobs, it means livelihoods, it means security,” he told the UK-China Business Summit held at London’s Mansion House on Wednesday. The prime minister said he was determined to build a stronger relationship with China during his time in No 10, based on a relationship with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, that dates back to 2007 when the pair promised to “nurture and develop” links between the two nations. “The deals that have been done during this visit cement what is a growing partnership,” he said. “This visit is taking our relationship to the next level and I want to ensure that our cooperation and partnership means we can support each other to deliver the growth and the jobs that we both want – to make sure that the trade and investment flows both ways along the modern equivalent of the Silk Road.” Among the deals signed during the four-day state visit by Xi is a £50m investment by Chinese carmaker Geely, which owns the London Taxi Company, to build a new fleet of zero-emission black cabs. Another deal involves Aston Martin agreeing to spend £50m with China Equity to develop its electric Rapide S sports car. Cameron said he was looking forward to Rolls-Royce appointing new apprentices after signing a deal worth £1.4bn to design new jet engines. “I’m clear that the UK is China’s best partner in the west,” he added. The largest single deal remained China’s commitment to buy a £6bn stake in the Hinkley Point nuclear power station, though a £2.6bn contract with Carnival, the world’s largest cruise ship operator, to make new ships, and a £1.7bn agreement with Chinese developer Advanced Business Park to redevelop a 35-acre site at the Royal Albert docks in east London and create up to 30,000 jobs, were also among the near £40bn of initiatives. Xi has brushed aside concerns about his country’s faltering economy, telling an audience of business leaders in London that it would remain the powerhouse of the global economy. He said “a ray of sunshine was dawning on the world economy” and “growth remains the trend and will not be altered by fluctuations in global markets”. Speaking at the Mansion House during a landmark China-UK trade conference, also attended by Cameron, Xi said China had entered “a new normal” based on an open economy susceptible to volatile international pressures. “There will be no turning back. We will stick to our win-win strategy of opening up the economy and China’s markets,” he said, adding that growth was important but also the quality of growth. Xi told the summit there was enormous potential for trade with his country, which is expected to import around $10tn worth of goods and invest more than $500bn overseas over the next five years. The president said Britain and China must now work to “deepen mutual trust”, deliver some tangible results off the back of the new relationship and “synergise” development strategies. He added: “We are deeply impressed by the strong will and positive stance of the UK to grow relations and cooperation with China.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/jun/27/nuclear-power-10billion-financial-guarantee","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-27T20:44:50Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power gets £10bn financial guarantee boost","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/27/nuclear-power-10billion-financial-guarantee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/jun/27/nuclear-power-10billion-financial-guarantee","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power gets £10bn financial guarantee boost","bodyText":"The government has responded to warnings that Britain is on the brink of power blackouts by announcing £10bn in financial guarantees to the nuclear power industry – a concession aimed at paving the way for the building of the first new reactor in the country for a generation. The support for French generator EDF, which is in negotiations to build the Hinkley Point nuclear power station, was announced by the Treasury chief secretary, Danny Alexander, as the centrepiece of a £100bn package of infrastructure investment covering 2015-20, including new roads, schools and affordable homes. Michael Fallon, the energy minister, insisted the substantial guarantees represented a commercial loan, not a subsidy, saying: \"This is big-scale financing, not available in the markets.\" He added that similar government guarantees had been offered to Drax power station to convert from coal to biomass. EDF had already prepared the site next to the two existing stations, but would not commit to the project unless the government guaranteed a minimum price for the electricity the new reactor would produce. The news came as Ofgem, the energy regulator, said the statistical probability of major power shortages in the UK would increase to about once in 12 years in 2015, from once in 47 years now, as a result of closing power plants. About a fifth of Britain's power generation capacity is scheduled to close in the next decade, including all but one nuclear plant. Ministers are also proposing to hand National Grid new powers to switch on mothballed plants to meet spikes in demand, and to pay factories to switch off during peak evening hours, as energy announcements dominate government investment planning. The energy secretary, Ed Davey, said: \"Ofgem and National Grid will consult on possible steps they could take to ensure that mothballed power plants or demand response is available if needed in the middle of the decade.\" National Grid said one of the proposed solutions involved \"seeking large consumers to reduce (or shift) electricity use during times of high demand (between 4pm and 8pm on weekday evenings in the winter) in return for a payment\". Another planned way of boosting supply would be to \"contract with generators that would otherwise be closed or mothballed\". Alexander's infrastructure announcements also included £3bn for 165,000 affordable homes and £10bn for repairs to schools. He claimed they represented \"the most comprehensive, ambitious and long-lasting capital investment plans this country has ever known. We are putting long-term priorities before short-term political pressures.\" Labour dismissed the capital spending package as \"hilarious hyperbole\", pointing out that there was no increase in capital spending since previous announcements, and no guarantee that the promises would be transformed into reality. The shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie said: \"Of the 576 projects in the government's existing infrastructure pipeline, just seven have been completed and 80% of them have not even started. All the while, the construction sector has lost 84,000 jobs since this government came to power.\" Alexander countered that investment as a share of GDP will be higher during the current decade than it was during the 13 years for which Labour was in office. Road projects unveiled include improvements to the M6 junctions between Birmingham and Manchester and the M5 junctions between Bromsgrove and Worcester in the West Midlands. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, said: \"Public-sector net investment is going to be broadly flat over the next four years. That means it will fall in 2015-16 to 1.5% of GDP, from 1.6% in 2014-15, and will fall further as a share of national income in 2016-17 and 2017-18.\" The IFS also accused George Osborne of failing in his public duty to explain many of the spending cuts in his comprehensive spending review statement on Wednesday, saying the documents that accompanied the 2015-16 review were \"woeful\". Decisions to switch budgets between departments made comparisons with previous years impossible, it said, citing the switch of the £3bn police grant from local government to the Home Office as an example. \"This is something that matters. Publishing such a small amount of information with so little explanation is not an exercise in open government,\" said Johnson. IFS analyst Gemma Tetlow added that her attempt to deconstruct the figures showed the spending review was closer to the \"art of obfuscation\" than an explanation of the government's plans. Johnson said he was also concerned that the government was sleepwalking into decisions about tax and spending without allowing a debate about Whitehall's long-term goals. The incentive for councils to freeze council tax for the next two years would cheer council tax payers, but make it harder to increase the £27bn a year tax or reform it in the future, he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/life-and-physics/2015/nov/30/cern-makes-hotter-quark-gluon-soup","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-30T07:01:02Z","webTitle":"CERN makes hotter quark-gluon soup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2015/nov/30/cern-makes-hotter-quark-gluon-soup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/life-and-physics/2015/nov/30/cern-makes-hotter-quark-gluon-soup","fields":{"headline":"CERN makes hotter quark-gluon soup","bodyText":"As CERN Director General Rolf Heuer puts it It is a tradition to collide ions over one month every year as part of our diverse research programme at the LHC. This year however is special as we reach a new energy and will explore matter at an even earlier stage of our universe. Traditions form quickly it seems, as, compared to say eating chocolate or storing money for mysterious strangers, the LHC is a comparative newcomer on the Swiss scene. But indeed, on 25 November - last Wednesday - “stable beams” were declared in the Large Hadron Collider, and heavy ion collisions began again. As I wrote when we first did this, bringing lead nuclei into collision, rather than the protons which the LHC usually smashes together, gives us access to a complementary kind of physics. The energy density is not as high, and we won’t be making any Higgs bosons, but the volume of hot dense stuff created is bigger, and it makes sense to think of it as a new form of quark-gluon matter, with a temperature and a density. Studying its “equation of state” - meaning how this matter develops as temperature, pressure and volume change - is important. As with the proton collisions previously, the energy has been increased, and this increases the volume and the temperature of the quark-gluon matter that we can study. To be brutally honest, it is a little personally frustrating to pause the proton-proton collisions just when they were going so well, and spend time recommissioning the beams for heavy ions. But that’s just being selfish, it is important physics and deserves its turn. And anyway if it wasn’t for the neutrons in the lead, we would just be the Large Proton Collider, or LPC instead of LHC, which would bring an annoying confusion with the Legal Practice Course (although we would still not have as serious a naming issue as the neutron source at Harwell). The strong interaction is the force carried by gluons, which binds quarks inside hadrons and dominates the interactions within the quark-gluon soup being created by the LHC right now. It is one of the three fundamental forces at play in the Standard Model of particle physics (with the fourth, gravity, sitting sulkily off to one side muttering something about geometry). A couple of weeks ago I spent four days discussing the strange, wonderful and useful consequences of electromagnetism, another of those three Standard Model forces. Arguably almost the whole of everyday life - chemistry, biology, philosophy, technology - is a consequence of electromagnetism. Everything except mathematics and nuclear power stations, perhaps¹. On the face of it, the strong force is even richer than electromagnetism in its potential for new phenomena. Because it is so strong and operates at such short distances, studying it is, unfortunately, very challenging both for theory and experiment. But it seems a bit presumptious to think that it can’t possibly have any more surprises to reveal. Pentaquarks were the most recent addition to the strong interaction scene. Even more intriguingly, there are proposals that odd, stable combinations of strongly-interacting matter may even be good candidates for “Dark Matter”. Dark Matter is the stuff that, from astrophysical observations, we know constitutes about 80% of the mass of the universe. The observations pin it down via its gravitational influence, but Dark Matter itself is invisible to conventional astronomy. Most physicists think that it must be a new kind of particle, not present in the Standard Model. But perhaps the Standard Model has more surprises in store for us, and can generate a Dark Matter candidate from the known quarks and gluons?

Cwtch has two meanings in Welsh – a cosy nook, and a cuddle. You don’t usually get a cuddle on arrival, but the welcome is warm and the cakes delicious. The cafe provides simple lunches and sandwiches, and doubles as a well-stocked village shop. There is everything here that a walker could desire – including good company, and even secondhand books. The surrounding landscapes include gorges, waterfalls, ancient woodlands and moorlands. • on Facebook Richard Hartnup Dog and Doublet pub, Birmingham and Fazeley canal The 15-mile walk along the towpath from Birmingham to Fazeley takes you from the Symphony Hall and the hurly burly of modernised Birmingham, past the old heavy industry of Aston, suburbs, older villages and finally into the countryside, with views across farmland, woodland and a surprisingly hilly terrain. Towards the end of the route is the Dog and Doublet pub. Right on the canal, it is a perfect place to rest your legs, drink a nice ale and have a late lunch watching the barges go by or the cows chewing the grass across the way. From there it’s only a couple more miles to Fazeley, where you can catch the 110 bus all the way back to Birmingham. • canalrivertrust.org.uk, on Facebook catchytitled Amid Giants and Idols, Lyme Regis, Dorset Walkers on the 630-mile long South West Coast Path will rejoice on reaching Amid Giants and Idols in Lyme Regis. Its coffee was so good I had to have two, resulting in a sleepless night – but it was worth it. There’s an impressive selection of beans and a taste guide. On top of that, the cafe has lovely little touches – draughtboard, a box of jokes, brainteasers and supremely comfy sofas. It also welcomes dogs. • amidgiantsandidols.com Stephanie Chang Square and Compass, Worth Matravers, Dorset The Square and Compass, between the Jurassic Coast and the Purbeck Ridgeway, is an unpretentious yet wonderful pitstop for anyone walking this beautiful part of the country. The fare is simple – ales and ciders, plus homemade pasties and pies – perfectly befitting the needs of those traversing the rugged landscapes around Corfe Castle and Swanage. The attached Fossil Museum is another quirky yet apposite part of this wonderful outpost. • squareandcompasspub.co.uk AntonyTosh The Boat Inn, Ashleworth Quay, Gloucestershire Gloriously situated on the west bank of the Severn, the Boat Inn is the kind of country pub you imagine only exists in memory. Hidden away in both space and time – shielded behind a National Trust-owned tithe barn – this cosy, nook- and cranny-filled gem is idyllic, with with a riverside beer garden and birdsong soundtrack. Popular with thirsty cyclists, it has an impressive range of cask ales and real cider with which to celebrate at the end of the Ashleworth-Hasfield walk. Hot meals are available too, for around £6. • boatinn.wordpress.com GemmaCorden Holdsworth House, West Yorkshire When bounding along the Bronte Way, by the ruined farmhouse that inspired Wuthering Heights and the Bronte parsonage home where Charlotte wrote Jane Eyre, the last thing you want is a muddy pint in a pub full of ramblers. Fortunately, you can break up this long walk with a stay at Holdsworth House, a Jacobean Mansion with beautiful gardens and truly attentive staff. It’s the perfect place to clean and dress yourself up to contemplate the powerful, dramatic literature produced by the Bronte sisters. Just like the Beatles did when they came here on John’s 24th birthday. • doubles from £84 B&amp;B, holdsworthhouse.co.uk samanthamaskell Lord Stones Cafe, North York Moors The Lord Stones Café is a very welcome break on the Coast to Coast and Cleveland Way routes, serving soup, sandwiches and a few veggie options. You pass it at lunchtime if you start from Ingleby Cross. This is about the toughest section of both walks and it is a tremendous comfort to sit down with hot food and a brew in the dry. The magical thing about this spot is you can walk right past it if you’re descending the path from Carlton Bank. As you cross Raisdale Road and rejoin the path it is shielded from view by a small plantation of conifers: the only indication is a tiny ankle-height sign. I’ve twice found soggy hikers eating their sandwiches in the rain and directed them to it. There’s a new restaurant and a glampsite now, too. • lordstones.com Mike Ronson High Paradise Farm Tea Room, North York Moors Less than 200 metres from the Cleveland Way, High Paradise Farm is perfectly located for those undertaking the 110-mile walk and those on shorter strolls. Part of its appeal is its remoteness – the closest public road is half a mile away, so it really is only accessible by foot, bike or horse. The menu is more varied than your typical countryside cafe, with cakes, sandwiches, pizzas and platters for the hungry and a selection of hot drinks, local ales and soft drinks for the thirsty. All are served with a side of Yorkshire hospitality from Ginny, whose scone-making talents know no bounds. • highparadise.co.uk Sarah Martin Snack Shack, Dungeness, Kent One of our favourite walks is along one of the most atmospheric and alluring beaches in the south-east, the stony end to the Romney Marshes, Dungeness. On one side, the sea, and on the other some really interesting beach hut architecture. Further behind is the skulking mass of the nuclear power station, like the radioactive elephant in the room, albeit outdoors. We like to end our trudge along the shingle at the Dungeness Snack Shack. It’s a family business, and the daily catch – wholly dependent on time and tide – comes in by boat to the beach to be cooked to perfection by Kelly. My favourite is a lobster roll or, in winter when the wind makes your ears throb, the smoked cod chowder. You can take some of that fine fresh fish or a dressed crab home for dinner. • dungenesssnackshack.net Stella Atkins Wilson The Robin Hood, near Borstal, Kent The Robin Hood is a quaint pub tucked away in the Kent Downs. The surrounding woodland provide excellent off-road cycling as well as walking paths with panoramic views over the downs. A kilometre from the Bluebell hill picnic site, the Robin Hood, with its family- and dog- friendly beer garden is the perfect spot for a post-walk cider in the sunshine. Or on winter days you can enjoy a cosy armchair next to the wood-burning stove. The food is homely and comes in hungry-walker-sized portions. • therobinhood-pub.co.uk louisemcmillan16 The Bull in Ditchling, East Sussex Ditchling is in the South Downs, and there are beautiful walks and views across the hills in every direction.

From his Treasury fastness he commands all he sees. Those he favours prosper, those who displease him die. But in today’sbudget we saw him in more cautious mode. Last year he boasted of “a budget that takes Britain one more big step on the road from austerity to prosperity”. This year, with Britain’s growth forecasts slashed, neither word was breathed. For all the abuse hurled at him from the left, Osborne remains a mainstream recovery chancellor. He has neither cut as much as he threatened, nor borrowed as little as he promised. He has not balanced his budget or abolished his deficit. Britain’s debt mountain is sustained only by minimal interest rates. In his early years, and depending on definition, Osborne either held public spending steady in real terms or barely reduced it. Spain, Greece, even Canada should have been so lucky. He now plans a rise of 0.6% for the rest of this parliament, and that is not allowing for such U-turns as last year’s on tax credits or on the NHS. Keynes would surely have approved. Osborne’s austerity – much-vaunted by friend and foe alike – is now a more nuanced concept. The elephant in the room is obvious. The overall welfare and schools budget was half of all public spending in 1990. It will be three quarters and spiralling by the end of the decade. Pensions alone have gone from 3.8% of GDP in 1970 to 9% today. The chancellor’s assaults on welfare payments are easy to condemn in the particular. But no chancellor of any party could ignore the looming crisis. As Osborne said yesterday, even after cuts, disability payments are running higher than under Labour. As for in-work benefits, every expert accepts that the work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, had to grasp the nettle of Gordon Brown’s disastrous payments legacy. Cameron’s mistake, back in 2010, was to not summon all parties round the table to find some consensus on how this might be handled. Osborne is on shakier ground when he lets his prejudices get the better of him. In 2011 his VAT rise sucked liquidity out of the economy just when it needed it most. He remains an anti-monetarist who believes growth comes from putting on a high-vis jacket and having lunch with bankers. Now his latest wheeze is to encourage low earners to save rather than spend, with a crude 25%, £1,000 top-up on help-to-buy Isas. With an economy near flatlining and with close to zero inflation, Britain needs new cash in circulation, not in a bank vault. Businesses invest when people spend. If Osborne has £1,000 to burn, let people burn it for him in the shops. Drop it from helicopters. Keep it away from the banks. Then there is the political muscle-flexing Osborne we saw flashing across the Commons yesterday, limbering up for the Tory leadership fight. Spending ministers now barely exist. Osborne as education secretary declared probably the biggest single act of “nationalisation” since Nye Bevan’s NHS in 1948. Every local primary and secondary school in England is to become a government “academy”. It will mean a national schools service (NSS?), under the new regional schools commissioners appointed by Whitehall. All civic or parochial responsibility for the nation’s education has passed to central government at the whim of a politician. It is centralism unique in the western world. Just as Bevan wanted Whitehall to be able to hear “the sound of every bedpan dropping in the land”, so Osborne wants to hear the ringing of every break bell and the cry of every parental complaint. He will rue the day. The claim is that every school will now be free of bureaucracy and the national curriculum. Pull the other one. Osborne could hardly wait. His first diktat was that children should spend an extra five hours a week in school doing sports or art. His second was a new national regime for maths. He must also find £500m to set up a new fair funding regime. All this and the new system was barely an hour old. In no time the NSS will be the same accident-prone, money-munching giant as the NHS. Then there is Osborne the local government minister. His new hybrid sub-regions under “elected mayors” will receive powers over health, social care, justice and transport. In principle, this is admirable, though strange in being patchy and not coterminous with existing elected authorities. But grants are still being slashed, without commensurate tax-raising powers. In some cases Osborne is leaving the new sub-regions, including London, with their business rates, but only up to the level of their existing grants. This is most obscure. Most crucial of these reforms will be the merger of local health with social care, as piloted in Manchester. But with no financial underpinning of social care, this could be chaotic. Osborne today sounded like a Roman emperor doodling at dinner over the boundaries of some distant Germanic tribe. The poor Tory leader of Essex was left asking, “After I’ve cut to the bone, what next?” Osborne tells him to lie back and think of Crossrail. This brings us to Osborne’s fads. The hazard of over-mighty politicians is the absence of anyone to protect them, or us, from their crazes and insecurities. It has taken the government six years to discover that the north’s transport links are dire. Now suddenly we are to spend billions on HS3, M62, A66, A69 and a Pennine tunnel. Having made the mistake of authorising Crossrail 1 in 2010, Osborne must now pay for the far more sensible Crossrail 2 – the north/south railway linking Surrey to Hertfordshire via central London – but he must do so from a severely diminished pot. What of our old friend HS2, connecting London, Birmingham, the east Midlands, Leeds, Sheffield and Manchester? Its backers must have shuddered at its conspicuous absence from Osborne’s list of boasts. Missing too was the £18bn Hinkley Point, despite a flurry of praise for small-scale “modular nuclear” power. The chancellor knows perfectly well that these two dinosaurs would butcher his mega-project budget. They have survived only as evidence of his machismo. Might Osborne at last have grown so potent that he can simply turn over in his sleep and kill them?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2015/mar/04/uk-joins-romanian-push-for-new-eu-nuclear-aid-package","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-04T17:06:12Z","webTitle":"UK joins Romanian push for new EU nuclear aid package","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/04/uk-joins-romanian-push-for-new-eu-nuclear-aid-package","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/mar/04/uk-joins-romanian-push-for-new-eu-nuclear-aid-package","fields":{"headline":"UK joins Romanian push for new EU nuclear aid package","bodyText":"The UK and seven other countries last month called for a new package of nuclear aid funding and support, in a letter sent to the commission ahead of the EU’s energy union policy launch. The letter, seen by the Guardian, calls for new EU financing mechanisms for nuclear as a low carbon technology, and research and innovation initiatives to deal with the costly and unresolved issues of nuclear waste and decommissioning. New state aid guidelines are also needed, it says, and these should be based on past EU decisions, including the approval of the UK’s planned Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset. “It is vital that the forthcoming communication on an Energy Union reaffirms the important role that nuclear power, together with renewables, other low carbon technologies, and energy efficiency improvements, can potentially play in Europe,” the message says. The letter to the commission’s vice president Sefkovic and climate commissioner Miguel Cañete was signed by the Romanian energy minister, Andrei Gerea, on behalf of ministers in seven other countries including the UK, France, Poland, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Slovenia and Slovakia. The ministers’ core argument is that many countries would not be able to cost-effectively meet EU climate targets and energy security objectives, without bloc support for new nuclear plant builds and the maintenance of existing reactors. The cost-effectiveness argument is key, as minutes of a commissioner’s discussion seen by the Guardian indicate that the UK’s planned £17.6bn subsidy for Hinkley was cleared by Brussels partly on the basis that it would have been too expensive to organise a competitive tendering process. The competition commissioner of the time, Joaquín Almunia, told other commissioners that “the specificities of nuclear technology made it impossible to achieve full competition between operators, at least at the time of the HPC project. For a project like the present one, the costs of preparing a project bid are so considerable that it would seem almost impossible to organise an open and transparent bidding process with several bidders.” The minutes show that the EU decision largely rested on the imputed common interest in advancing nuclear power outlined in the Euratom treaty. But Hinkley’s approval was resisted by the commission’s environment and climate directorates who argued that it called into question the bloc’s ‘technology neutrality’ and would create market distortions. “This is really about state aid which is supposed to be for new technologies that haven’t proved themselves viable yet. But nuclear energy has had 70 years and still has not been able to prove itself viable, even when the public pays for its waste disposal and decommissioning. It should not be eligible for subsidies,” said Molly Scott Cato, the Green MEP for South West England and Gibraltar. New research to be published on Thursday by the Resilience Centre finds that the government’s plans for a new reactor at Hinkley Point C has had what Cato calls “a chilling effect” on investment in renewable energy in Somerset. In 2010, Somerset set a relatively low target of 63MW for solar energy capacity by 2020, which it looks likely to exceed. By comparison, neighbouring Devon has a solar energy target of 440MW while Gloucestershire has a goal of 920MW. But the centre, says that when the lower capacity factors of renewable energy are taken into account, renewables have the potential to generate more than three times the equivalent energy of Hinkley. Two tidal lagoons off the Somerset coast would be likely to generate 640MW, or 10% of the equivalent energy generated by Hinkley. The Resilience Centre, which comprises technical renewable energy experts and environmental engineers, pegs Somerset’s onshore and marine generating capacity from renewables at 5.4GW – around 60% of Hinkley’s output. But the joint ministerial letter insists that nuclear power should be allowed to play a role alongside renewables and energy efficiency in a decarbonised, secure and competitive energy market. “As of December 2014, nuclear provided 53% of the EU’s carbon-free electricity,” it says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/mar/15/environmental-and-economic-impact-of-british-energy-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-15T19:01:22Z","webTitle":"Environmental and economic impact of British energy policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/15/environmental-and-economic-impact-of-british-energy-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/mar/15/environmental-and-economic-impact-of-british-energy-policy","fields":{"headline":"Environmental and economic impact of British energy policy","bodyText":"In December, David Cameron joined 195 other leaders to promise ambitious action on climate change. Achieving the Paris goals requires leaving most of the world’s fossil fuel reserves in the ground. A first step must be to stop subsidising fossil fuel production. Wednesday’s budget is an acid test of the government’s Paris commitment. In last year’s budget, the chancellor gave £1.3bn in new tax breaks and direct funding to the oil industry. The UK Treasury receives a smaller share of oil revenues than most other comparable countries. Meanwhile, the government has exempted a whole new fossil-fuel industry – fracking – from half of its tax, despite huge local opposition wherever it is proposed. The government has slashed support for wind and solar energy, costing thousands of jobs. Yet its free-market rationale does not apply when it comes to the oil and gas industry, which has received continued government support even in times of super-normal profits. The chancellor has to change course. He should scrap subsidies that keep the British economy hooked on fossil fuels, and instead set out a strategy to help communities currently dependent on fossil fuel jobs to diversify and to rebuild around world-leading clean technology.

He is, of course, correct, and so we urgently need to implement an effective response. The obvious way to do this would be to cut global greenhouse emissions now, but electorates are still utterly unwilling to accept the radical lifestyle changes we need to achieve this. No western government would dare double petrol prices or remove our ability to repeatedly fly abroad for holidays. No developing-country leaders are going to tell their people they can never have a western lifestyle. The only politically feasible solutions are technological ones, such as carbon scrubbing and geoengineering. Therefore, David Cameron and other world leaders need to start making a massive investment in those areas now, possibly funded by an international financial transactions tax. Otherwise, we do face disaster. Richard Mountford Tonbridge, Kent • The chief executive of the Road Haulage Association (Budget 2016: Osborne to cut an extra £4bn, 14 March) is guilty of some very selective arithmetic. If an RPI increase in fuel duty represents an increase of £450 per truck per year, then the 40p drop in fuel prices we have enjoyed over the last few years represents a decrease of £24,000 per truck. I wonder how many hauliers have reduced their prices to reflect this. The low fuel prices are a heaven-sent opportunity for the chancellor to raise some serious revenue. If the RPI 0.75p rise would bring in £345.5m, then a 20p rise could raise over £9bn with motorists and hauliers still better off than when prices reached their peak. That would save a great deal of pain elsewhere in the economy. Keith Potter Gunnislake, Cornwall • The proposed CMA reforms in the gas and electricity distribution sector are a grave disappointment (Report, 11 March); its intention to “enable competition to grow further” may be misguided. We don’t need another layer of expensive administration the costs of which will inevitably be passed on to consumers. And it will take too long to implement. Since nationalisation, this industry has lost its moral compass and become more concerned with maximising shareholder profit than providing a minimal cost reliable service. The intention of encouraging consumers to migrate to cheaper deals is admirable, but it is optimistic to believe that this will lead to lower overall costs rather than merely redistributing the same total billing charges over the same customers. Would it not have been simpler, easier and quicker to make each major supplier improve the lot of their own existing customers that have been on a standard variable tariff (SVT) for say more than two years by moving them on to that company’s best fixed one-year tariff? The suppliers could be mandated to make this move within six months and to maintain such customers on a similarly priced fixed tariff for at least four further years. The current practice of migrating customers at the termination of a fixed price period on to a SVT unless the customer makes an effort to stay on a better tariff should be banned. The default should be to move them to another reasonably priced term tariff. Iain Oldcorn Ascot, Berkshire • It has been said that the Hinkley Point imbroglio has led to a missed opportunity to install the equivalent capacity over the period up to 2024, probably at lower cost as with power actually becoming steadily available over the construction period (Hinkley Point is a costly mistake, but only France can pull the plug, 14 March). As it happens, the current cost per megawatt of providing wind and solar power is about the same as that for building Hinkley Point. But as the sale price for Hinkley Point output is inflation-proofed by the government up to 2092, wind and solar power are certain to continue coming down from today’s prices. It is of course true that wind and solar cannot be relied on for continuous electricity in all weather conditions. But nuclear power has consistently failed to function at the levels of baseload for which it has been designed. And that also requires back-up reserve plants, thus improving the relative performance of the alternative fuels. Wind and solar power consume fuel that is cost-free, and therefore uses 100% of its potential, whereas nuclear and fossil power wastes about a third of its fuel. They also lose a large proportion of the remaining two thirds in transmission costs from generating plants over long distance to connect with the grid. Wind and solar power coming from smaller generating plants can and should be connected to local networks and will therefore be able to reduce losses in transmission. This will also reduce the length, cost and viability of any new pylon lines. Thus, had we committed ourselves to a 10-year programme of non-nuclear electricity, we would have achieved a steady increase in output and eliminated the risk of the lights going out with the stubborn persistence in choosing Hinkley Point. Harvey Cole Winchester, Hampshire • In his article on Hinkley Point, your journalist writes “business solutions are often described as zero-sum, or win-win”.

An impact assessment study by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) admits the move could wipe out up to 18,700 of the industry’s 32,000 jobs. A second subsidy scheme known as the renewables obligation has also been cut for small-scale and large projects angering both the solar industry and environmentalists, who dismissed the moves as “huge and misguided”. The government argues it needs to protect wider energy bills from the rising impact of renewable energy subsidies and that this justifies paying rooftop solar installers 4.39p per kilowatt hour from February instead of the existing 12.47p. The new figure means Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary, has rowed back from an original proposal to slash subsidies by 87% to 1.63p after a storm of criticism. “My priority is to ensure energy bills for hardworking families and businesses are kept as low as possible whilst ensuring there is a sensible level of support for low carbon technologies that represent value for money,” she said. “We have to get the balance right and I am clear that subsidies should be temporary, not part of a permanent business model. When the cost of technologies come down, so should the consumer-funded support.” The government said there would be a £100m cap on spending by 2019. The shadow energy and climate secretary, Lisa Nandy, said the solar cuts were misguided, especially after ministers had just forked out £175m to diesel farm developers. “These short-sighted cuts will place big limits on our solar industry and lead to thousands of job losses. These cuts stand in stark contrast to the generous handouts ministers recently announced to dirty diesel generators. At a time when energy bills are a big concern it makes no sense to limit one of the cheapest forms of clean energy.” Friends of the Earth said it was disappointing that less than a week after the UK government agreed a deal in Paris to keep global temperature rises to well below 2 degrees, the government had shown its true colours – “and they’re certainly not green”. Alasdair Cameron, FoE’s renewable energy campaigner, said: “These huge, misguided cuts to UK solar are a massive blow for jobs and the economy, and further undermine the government’s already tarnished credibility on tackling climate change.” The Solar Trade Association had warned that more than 6,000 jobs have been lost, with solar installers such as the Mark Group closing down ahead of likely cuts. Greenpeace said the government was moving in the wrong direction. “Bowing to pressure from the public and businesses, the government has swapped a blunt axe for a sharp scalpel, but it’s still cutting in the wrong place,” said Barbara Stoll. “In just one month, one nuclear plant at Hinkley would swallow up four years’ worth of subsidies for the whole solar sector. Why are ministers signing a blank cheque for expensive, outdated nuclear power while pinching pennies for an energy source on the cusp of a massive investment boom? This makes no economic sense and will only put up bills in the long run. “With costs falling, demand rising, and post-Paris momentum growing, the UK solar sector will see off the government’s attacks. The question is how many more jobs, investments, and business opportunities are we wasting because of George Osborne’s incoherent policies. “If the government is as committed as it claims to be to the Paris climate deal, then solar is one of the cheapest and safest ways for the UK to deliver on it.” Paul Barwell, chief executive of the Solar Trade Association, said he was particularly concerned the government was cutting the “grandfathering” commitment from the renewables Obligation, which ensures that any subsidy levels are protected for the lifetime of a project. “Closing the renewables obligation for solar is not in the interests of billpayers when solar is soon to become the cheapest low-carbon energy source. Following the Paris agreement, this needs rethinking. “Removing the grandfathering guarantee makes no sense for solar – it’s the thin end of the wedge. If you invest £1m of capital into a solar project today, in 20 years’ time you have still invested £1m – it is a sunk cost. You cannot have the level of support changing over the lifetime of a project as investors won’t take the risk.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/nov/08/reviving-nuclear-power-debates-is-a-distraction-we-need-to-use-less-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-08T01:18:15Z","webTitle":"Reviving nuclear power debates is a distraction.

Pandora’s Promise presents an environmentalist case for nuclear power, argued by a number of recent converts including Mark Lynas and George Monbiot. These converts have reached the conclusion that the dangers of global warming outweigh the health risks of nuclear power which have been exaggerated by opponents (including, in the past, themselves). The film spends a fair bit of time mocking this view, as represented by Dr Helen Caldicott, who apparently claimed more than a million deaths had resulted from the Chernobyl disaster (more conservatives estimates range from 4,000 to 500,000). It is correctly argued that the health damage associated with coal-fired electricity (disregarding those arising from climate change) far outweighs that of nuclear power, at least during the operational lifetime of power plants. The only surprising thing about this film is the release date. The makers and participants are apparently unaware that the rest of the world had this debate 10 to 15 years ago, and that, for the most part, the advocates of nuclear power were victorious. Environmentalists largely abandoned anti-nuclear campaigns and focused their energy on attempts to reduce the use of fossil fuels, and promote energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. While most environmentalists remained sceptical of, or opposed to, nuclear power, the end of active opposition paved the way for a range of pro-nuclear policy initiatives. In the years after the signing of the Kyoto protocol, most major countries, including the US, UK, Japan, China and India adopted or reinforced policies supporting nuclear power. Some European countries, notably including Austria and Germany, went the other way. Even in Europe, however, the long-stalled industry was revived with the start of construction on new plants in France and Finland. The really big developments were in the US. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, passed with bipartisan support and building on earlier initiatives of the Bush Administration, offered the nuclear power industry a range of incentives and subsidies that the developers of wind and solar power could only dream of. It includes authorising cost-overrun support of up to $2bn total for up to six new nuclear power plants, the extension of the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act through 2025, and huge loan guarantees. The shift in policy attitudes was widely acclaimed as heralding a \"nuclear renaissance\", with dozens of new plants being announced in the US and many more worldwide. So, why, a decade later, must a film like Pandora’s Promise campaign in favour of nuclear power? The answer is that the nuclear \"renaissance\" turned out to be more like a return to the nuclear dark ages of the 1980s and 1990s. Most of the new plants announced with such enthusiasm have been cancelled or deferred indefinitely. Those that have commenced construction have run over time and over budget, exactly as happened in the last big nuclear boom of the 1970s. The poster child is the Olkiluoto plant in Finland, originally announced in 2000, with a completion date of 2009 and a cost of 3bn euros. The current estimated completion date is 2015, and the cost has blown out to 8.5bn. A French plant with a similar design is having the same problems . In the US, only four new plants are being built, all at existing sites, and all behind time and over budget. It seems unlikely that any new projects will be undertaken much before 2020. Innovative ideas like small modular reactors are being explored, but any substantial application is decades away. The situation appears somewhat better in China and India, although past experience with construction projects in these countries has raised safety concerns. And even in these countries, targets for nuclear power expansion are being scaled back while those for renewable energy are being increased. So, the fact that the world has not turned to nuclear power as a solution to climate change is a matter of economics. In the absence of a substantial carbon price, nuclear energy can’t compete with coal and other fossil fuels. In the presence of a carbon price, it can’t compete with wind and solar photovoltaics. The only real hope is that, if coal-fired generation is reduced drastically enough, always-on nuclear power will be a more attractive alternative than variable sources like solar and wind power. However, much of the current demand for \"baseload\" power is an artifact of pricing systems designed for coal, and may disappear as prices become more cost-reflective. To put the point more sharply, if we are convinced by the arguments of Pandora’s Promise, what would the makers of the film have us do? Stop protesting against nuclear power? Most of us did so decades ago. Abandon restrictions on uranium mining and export? The Australian government has done so already, with barely a peep of protest. The only remaining restrictions on exports to India relate to concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation, not nuclear energy, and seem likely to be dropped in any case. Give nuclear power a level playing field to compete against renewables? In the US at least, nuclear power is already treated more favourably than alternatives, leaving aside the massive subsidies already handed out in the 20th century. The same is true in many other countries that have sought, with limited success, to promote a nuclear renaissance. Having done all of these things, the unfortunate facts are unchanged. The problem of climate change is not going away, and, in the absence of massive subsidies, no one is going to build nuclear power plants on a scale sufficient to make much of a difference. To address the problem of climate change, we need to use less energy, use it more efficiently and generate it more sustainably. Reviving 20th century debates about nuclear power is just a distraction."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/blog/2016/mar/16/budget-2016-promises-infrastructure-spending-george-osborne","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-16T11:12:51Z","webTitle":"Don't be fooled by more budget promises of infrastructure spending","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/blog/2016/mar/16/budget-2016-promises-infrastructure-spending-george-osborne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/blog/2016/mar/16/budget-2016-promises-infrastructure-spending-george-osborne","fields":{"headline":"Don't be fooled by more budget promises of infrastructure spending","bodyText":"I love it when wise guys in all political parties and none say: “We must invest more in infrastructure.” George Osborne is doing it again today. This budget the chancellor is going big on transport. Jeremy Corbyn may veer off in another favoured direction. Housing anyone? Windfarms? Hinkley Point C? Yet it’s never that easy. Announcing plans is quite different from implementing them, which is why plans are so often recycled. Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling probably first announced some schemes that Osborne will “unveil” again today, as even cautious reporters have felt the need to point out in recent days. Then there’s the money for capital projects. Sometimes it goes unspent, sometimes it never materialises. The Osborne Treasury promised to raise £20bn from pension funds – they’re always looking for safe income streams – to fund infrastructure schemes. By last summer it had only raised £1bn, mostly on low-risk private finance initiative (PFI) contracts for schools and hospitals. PFI gets stuff built, but badly negotiated contracts in the past have left education and NHS budgets carrying onerous long-term costs in some instances, not always for the right sort of building either. Whether it is over-ambitious IT projects that fail to deliver (if they even get that far) or Thames garden bridges in the wrong place, lobbyists and contractors are always trying to sell flash schemes to ambitious or susceptible ministers and officials. All too often the taxpayer carries the risk – not how it was meant to be in theory – and picks up the bill. Example? Simon Jenkins, no Corbynite leftie, used his column in last night’s Evening Standard, the capital’s free sheet of which he was once editor (and I a general reporter), elegantly to savage the record of the Brexit mayor Boris Johnson. Expensive vanity projects plus tower blocks is his verdict. Mayor Ken Livingstone did better. It’s not as if there is often a consensus to support all the big-ticket items Whitehall and Westminster are persuaded to fund. The Olympic Park at Stratford was attacked as an over-budget white elephant, and so was the Millennium Dome in 2000, now the O2 Arena. As agents for the regeneration of poor and neglected London boroughs they seem to be turning out well. So did the Canary Wharf project launched by the Thatcher government when it gave sweeping planning powers over 8.5 square miles of derelict docks to the London Docklands Development Corporation in 1981. Highly resisted by the locals, it has brought 120,000 jobs and much else to the area. But even that raises different divisive issues. How much good did all that do to ordinary people who were living in those boroughs? How much good will Crossrail (let alone Crossrail 2 which Osborne is blessing this week) do for taxpayers living outside the south-east? I have already seen chippy SNP press releases about how Scots will be paying for London again, though not about London’s efforts to help restore North Sea oil’s competitiveness in tough times. At least Osborne, MP for prosperous Tatton, seems to grasp the economic imbalances that undermine national cohesion, London-to-Oxford boy though he is. The “northern powerhouse” project, complete with devolved powers, most conspicuously to cutting edge Greater Manchester, is seriously ambitious and the chancellor had better put our money where his mouth is. The last time I travelled from Manchester to Leeds in the morning rush hour it was charming for me (less crowded too), but I could see why regulars are not charmed. There again, it must be 40 years since I allowed myself an hour to drive east across Glasgow in a rental car, only to do it in 10 minutes. No one had told me about the new M8. So a lot of things may be worse outside London, but lots of things are also better. But when it comes to infrastructure panacea paralysis, the real problems aren’t anything so “trivial” as a major road improvement or that new rail link from Manchester to Sheffield that will cut journey times from 48 to 30 minutes and increase the pathetic number of trains per hour. Such items are the remit of the former transport secretary Andrew Adonis’s National Infrastructure Commission, whose latest plans for the north of England you can read here. No, the really sobering challenges are those that have stalled under successive governments for decades amid intense controversy. It is a shocking indictment of the feeble state of central government morale and determination, for which no one can blame Brussels, though they will. At least Mrs Thatcher built the Channel Tunnel, though she may have come to regret it. Everyone has their own list, but the serious ones for my money are: London’s new airport runway, the HS2 rail link and a coherent strategy for secure, diverse and environmentally appropriate power supply, embodied by the current shambles over the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station proposed for the Bristol Channel coast. We could argue all day about the options, their relative merits, the cost benefit analysis (to whom?) and the rest. But even to raise the question is to be reminded that “investing in infrastructure projects for our grandchildren” isn’t that easy. There is no public consensus on how to proceed on any of them. For my part, I have always reluctantly favoured the third runway at Heathrow as the airport option and, even if it is announced this summer (as it may finally be), will probably now be dead before its extra noise impacts on my west London street (worse for others, I realise). Never much of an enthusiast for HS2 I have slowly turned against it. The vast sums involved might be better spent on less grandiose improvements to the booming privatised rail network, better signalling being central to increased capacity. Osborne is encouraging the new boss at Network Rail to flog off key assets like its power network, a separate piece of idiocy in a class of its own. As for Hinkley Point C, it is becoming painfully more obvious by the day that it is the wrong design, failing elsewhere for the French state energy giant EDF, with a dud agreement that may drive EDF’s fragile finances into meltdown and cost the UK taxpayer a bundle. David Cameron and François Hollande are firmly behind it. What could possibly go wrong? Plenty. It’s just another infrastructure panacea that won’t be built."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2015/nov/07/welsh-rainforest-british-adventure-walking","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-07T04:00:09Z","webTitle":"Walking in a Welsh rainforest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/07/welsh-rainforest-british-adventure-walking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/07/welsh-rainforest-british-adventure-walking","fields":{"headline":"Walking in a Welsh rainforest","bodyText":"Does the phrase “save the rainforest” conjure up visions of: a) Brazil, b) Borneo, or c) north Wales? You may not know it but Britain is home to 70,000 hectares (173,000 acres) of rainforest, in areas including western Scotland, Cumbria, south-west England and, yes, north Wales. And these temperate forests are just as precious – and under just as much threat – as their tropical counterparts. I travelled to Maentwrog, a tiny village in Snowdonia, to visit two neighbouring woodlands, Llennyrch and Coed Felinrhyd (also known as Melenrhyd). The woods date back an astonishing 10,000 years to the last ice age. These ancient places, found above the Vale of Ffestiniog, are two of Europe’s best remaining examples of Atlantic oak woodland, otherwise known as temperate rainforest. They are wet and wild: crisscrossed with streams and gullies, bordered by the Ceunant Llennyrch gorge, drenched with river spray and more than 200 days of rain a year. On the autumn afternoon that I visited, it was unseasonably hot and humid, making it feel as though we were stepping into the jungle – I half-expected to glimpse a tiger through the ferns. My guides were Kylie Jones Mattock of the Woodland Trust, which owns Coed Felinrhyd and is currently fundraising to buy Llennyrch, and plant expert Ray Woods. We wandered the woodland for hours, stopping to examine the trees – enormous gnarled oaks, plus ash, hazel and birch – and the rare lichens, mosses and liverworts. The lichen here is particularly amazing, home to species including “blackberries in custard”, which is not found anywhere else in the country. I examined it through Ray’s magnifying glass and a secret world was revealed, as brightly coloured and complex as any coral reef. We are only beginning to understand the value of such plants – for example, it is thought that tree lungwort contains properties that may have potential to cure BSE. What we do know is that they are irreplaceable, at least for the hundreds of years it takes for them to grow. As well as the rare plants and fungi (Ray foraged for several kinds of mushroom, including one as big as my head) the forest is home to birds including wood warblers and redstarts, whose populations are declining elsewhere in Europe. There may be no tigers but there are brimstone butterflies and the rare lesser horseshoe bat, a tiny bat species, and also otters in the turbulent Prysor river at the forest’s edge. There are also waterfalls galore, though too icy for many swimmers by autumn (including me; dipping a toe in was enough). The most spectacular is the 20m Rhaeadr Ddu, or Black Falls; hundreds visit the falls each year without knowing that there is a Celtic rainforest to explore too. Britain’s native woodland faces multiple threats: invasive species including conifer and rhododendron; pollution, particularly acid rain; overgrazing of livestock; encroaching development. But there is hope. Since the 1980s, environmental organisations have worked to protect these wild places though there is still much to be done. It isn’t an entirely unspoilt idyll. Around Llennyrch, classed as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI), huge electricity pylons stretch for miles, marring the farmland; a hydroelectric power station is visible from the hills above the woods; the Trawsfynydd nuclear power station is nearby – it stopped generating in 1991 but won’t be fully decommissioned for several decades. In a way, though, these man-made blots on the landscape serve to underline the natural beauty of the rainforest and its importance. So how can we save our rainforests? Visit them (and stick to the paths). Volunteer at a conservation day. Go to a fundraising event. Join a campaign. Make a donation. That way future generations will have a rainforest in their backyard – and not just in Brazil.

The energy secretary, Ed Davey, claimed it was a great deal for consumers and would result in energy bills falling by more than £75 by 2030. He added: \"If we don't make these essential investments … we're going to see the lights going out.\" The 35-year deal, struck at £92.50 per megawatt hour, is twice the current wholesale market rate for electricity, and will be attacked by some as a massive subsidy to help another non-carbon fuel, with the funds going to the French taxpayer and the Chinese government, which has a minority stake to build the new plant at Hinkley C in Somerset. With the deal between the UK government and EDF announced on Monday morning, Cameron said: \"This is a very big day for our country: the first time we've built a new nuclear power station for a very long time.\" He said the deal would be the first of many \"kick-starting again this industry, providing thousands of jobs and providing long-term, safe and secure supplies of electricity far into the future\". The subsidy inherent in the strike price reflects the risk in constructing the plant, uncertainty over the future market and the need to reduce the UK's dependence on carbon fuels, such as coal and gas. But the deal comes at a politically sensitive time as the government fends off criticism that government-imposed green subsidies are pushing up the price of electricity. Cameron has rejected a Labour proposal for a 20-month government-imposed freeze on energy prices. The shadow energy secretary, Caroline Flint, said Labour supported nuclear power, but claimed: \"David Cameron is now in the ridiculous position of saying that they can set prices 35 years ahead for the companies producing nuclear power, while insisting they can't freeze prices for 20 months for consumers while much-needed reforms are put in place.\" Davey said 57% of the jobs and contracts would go to UK contractors, a way of rebuilding the country's nuclear skills. The two planned pressurised water reactors at Hinkley Point C will be the first to start construction in Europe since Japan's Fukushima disaster and the first in the UK since the Sizewell B power station came online in 1995. The new reactors, which will cost £14bn, are due to start operating in 2023 if built on time and will run for 35 years. They will be capable of producing 7% of the UK's electricity – equivalent to the amount used by 5m homes. In details released on Monday morning, the strike price – the fixed price at which output will be sold – has been set at £89.50 per megawatt hour for electricity produced at the new power station. That price will be fully indexed to consumer price inflation. But the price, at 2012 prices, is dependent on EDF moving ahead with a second plant, Sizewell C, in Suffolk. If it decides not to proceed, another £3/MWh will be added to the strike price for Hinkley, bringing it up to £92.50/MWh. The reduction reflects the fact that advanced costs for a \"first of a kind\" nuclear power station are high, but reduce with each successive new plant as economies of scale kick in, the official said. The strike price covers not only the costs of building Hinkley Point C, but all decommissioning and nuclear waste management costs. EDF was thought to have started negotiations demanding a figure of £100, with the Treasury's gambit being £80. EDF, which is majority-owned by the French taxpayer and whose investment is likely to be guaranteed by the UK Treasury, will have to start depositing money into a special fund for such liabilities from the start of the project. The government has still not yet completed the process of agreeing a system of storing the waste. The agreed strike price should allow EDF to make a 10% rate of return on the project. Costs would fall for taxpayer if EDF managed to refinance its package in the future, so sharing the gain. The strike price is expected to be reviewed 7.5 years, 15 years and 25 years after the commercial operations date of the first reactor as well at the end of the contract term. Protection would be provided for any increases in nuclear insurance costs as a result of withdrawal of HMG cover. • This article was changed on 21st October. And earlier version said that 7% of UK electricity is enough to power 7m homes.

The sad truth about the crisis in the UK steel industry, where Tata Steel yesterday cut 1,050 jobs, including 750 at its Port Talbot plant, may be this: in the current climate, nothing less than stiff tariffs on imported Chinese steel will meaningfully improve the lot of UK and EU producers. The figures from UK Steel, the industry lobby group, are striking. Chinese steelmakers are believed to be losing about $34 (£23) a tonne on the crude steel they produce. China’s top 101 steel producers, most of them state-owned, lost about $11bn during the first 10 months of 2015, or roughly twice what they made in profits the previous year. China’s exports of steel have risen from 7.2m tonnes in 2003 to 107m tonnes in 2015. This is globalisation in action, accelerated by a slowdown in the Chinese economy that has encouraged its domestic steelmakers to turn to export markets with greater vigour. A UK steel industry that employed 30,000 at the start of last year will soon be smaller by a fifth. The UK government was criticised, rightly, last year by a parliamentary committee for being slow to react to the looming crisis and for doing less than other EU states. But note what the business committee also said about the resulting government measures, such as the bringing-forward of compensation for energy-intensive industries: “Even when fully implemented, these measures should not be seen as the answer to the long term difficulties faced by the UK industry as a result of the expansion of production and dumping of steel in the UK market by China.” Quite. The UK government can alleviate some short-term financial pain for the likes of Tata, but it cannot wish away China’s over-capacity in steel. Does the EU have the political will to slap tariffs on Chinese steel to discourage dumping? Optimists in the industry point out that a 24% import duty on wire rod, a small part of the industry, has been in place sine 2009. But they also grumble, understandably, that the European Commission takes 12 months to conduct its anti-dumping investigations whereas equivalent authorities in the US do the job in about three weeks. That difference in speed, one suspects, reflects the vastly different appetites for imposing tariffs. In short, the Europeans don’t have the stomach. Indeed, ask yourself whether George Osborne, having invited the Chinese to build his “northern powerhouse” and a couple of nuclear power stations in the UK, would really be prepared to support a tit-for-tat tariff war with Beijing. Maybe the European Commission, when its latest investigation finally reaches a conclusion, will surprise us by recommending “quick and effective anti-dumping action”, as lobby group UK Steel hopes. But it’s not the way to bet. Amec’s Brikho learns his limits It was, said Samir Brikho, Amec’s chief executive, a “transformational deal”. Unfortunately for him, the £1.9bn purchase of Foster Wheeler, announced two years ago, has ended up transforming his reputation as a boss who was one step ahead of the company’s markets. The first seven years of Brikho’s nine-year tenure were a shining success. He shed Amec’s dull construction business, which delivered wafer-thin profit margins, and got deeper into businesses servicing the oil and gas industries. The timing was excellent. Amec caught the surge in the oil price and the extra spending by oil explorers and producers. Profit margins improved in leaps and Amec joined the FTSE 100 club. “Know your limits – but never stop trying to exceed them,” wrote Brikho in the 2011 annual report in typically bold fashion. By 2015, he had already said, Amec would achieve earnings of 100p a share, more than double the 2008 tally. Foster Wheeler was meant to cement that “Vision 2015”. Instead, Amec’s shares have fallen by two-thirds since the unveiling and the target of 100p of earnings has been missed by a mile. Defenders will say the logic behind the deal remains sound because it took Amec towards the refining and storage end of the oil industry, where pricing pressures are less intense. But that is only a plea in mitigation. In retrospect, the timing and price were wrong. Amec, after paying half in cash, ended up with £1bn of debt in a downturn, which is why shareholders’ dividends have halved. Brikho is now “stepping down” with the share price roughly where it was when he stepped up in 2006. As he never said, but should have done: in this business, know your limits are set by the oil price and don’t bet the balance sheet. Yet another banking flotation? Yes, it’s CYGB, or the Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banking Group, which is being spun off by National Australia Bank. The Aussies seem anxious to wave goodbye. At the bottom end of the price range, CYGB is valued at just 0.56 times book value. That’s either admirably conservative or an acknowledgement that returns in UK banking look dull as far the eye can see. It’s probably the latter, judging by the recent slips in the share prices of bigger beasts like Lloyds and RBS."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/jun/04/uk-may-need-to-gamble-with-nuclear-safety-to-avoid-blackouts","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-04T17:24:00Z","webTitle":"UK will have to gamble with nuclear safety to provide power, analyst warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/04/uk-may-need-to-gamble-with-nuclear-safety-to-avoid-blackouts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jun/04/uk-may-need-to-gamble-with-nuclear-safety-to-avoid-blackouts","fields":{"headline":"UK will have to gamble with nuclear safety to provide power, analyst warns","bodyText":"Britain may have to stretch safety limits on nuclear power stations to keep the lights on, warned a leading energy analyst on Wednesday. Dorian Lucas, a nuclear specialist at energy consultancy, Inenco, made his comments after it was revealed that power group, EDF, had won permission to change the rules for its Dungeness B station. \"Britain has no choice but to gamble with extending the safety limits of the country's ageing fleet of nuclear power plants to avoid the looming spectre of 1970s-style blackouts,\" said Lucas. The atomic power station in Kent has come to an agreement with the Office of Nuclear Regulation (ONR) that it can have the margin increased on the shrinkage of the graphite bricks inside the reactor from 6.2% to 8%. The bricks are losing weight due to decades of radiation but a spokeswoman for EDF said the new limit was only a \"teeny little step\" that was well within the most conservative safety case. In a statement, the nuclear regulator said: \"ONR would not allow continued operation of any nuclear reactor unless it was safe to do so. We recognise the challenges presented by ageing of the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) fleet in the UK, and we continue to pay close attention to the problems associated with the graphite core of the reactors. We are satisfied that the reactors are safe to operate.\" But Steve Thomas, professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, told the BBC: \"It doesn't feel good when we come up against limits and the first thing they [the ONR] do is to move the goalposts.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/08/10-green-leaders-on-best-ways-you-can-fight-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-08T08:39:07Z","webTitle":"10 green leaders on the best ways you can fight climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/08/10-green-leaders-on-best-ways-you-can-fight-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/08/10-green-leaders-on-best-ways-you-can-fight-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"10 green leaders on the best ways you can fight climate change","bodyText":"Caroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion and former leader of the Green Party 1) Go to Paris this December “The climate summit in Paris later this year will see leaders from across the world come together in an attempt to thrash out a deal to cut global carbon emissions.

Buy and cancel a pollution permit “EU factories and power stations now have their emissions capped – we can remove pollution permits from the hands of would-be polluters by buying and cancelling emissions allowances.” In the European Union, the emissions from heavy industry and power plants are restricted by the emissions trading scheme (ETS). Permits give emitters the right to release one tonne of CO2 into the atmosphere. But the ETS is widely considered to have failed because there is an oversupply of permits – traded by companies on a market – which has lead to a drop in the price companies must pay for their emissions. Campaigners say that the permits need to be taken out of the system and that citizens can demonstrate this by doing it themselves. Buy an ETS permit 3.

Lost Treasure, recorded in 1956 by a pioneering socialist film-making collective linked to a film society in Clydebank, was intended to tell the story of Highland communities left empty and impoverished by migration to cities and the influence of powerful private landowners. Filming came to a halt after 40 minutes of footage was recorded in July 1956 when the Glasgow-based Dawn Cine Group found itself unable to fund the film’s completion, leaving their raw, grainy, black and white film to lie unviewed. The material has been stored by the Scottish Screen Archives since the 1970s, when it was handed in for preservation by one of the group’s members. It had apparently been stored in their garage. Now, six decades later, it will be shown to the public for the first time as part of the Glasgow Short Film Festival. While the rediscovered footage was recorded without sound, the film’s script has survived, along with extensive notes on dialogue, music and English and Gaelic poetry that had been intended to accompany the images on screen. Its premiere will feature a soundtrack performed live during the screening by Edinburgh singer-songwriter Drew Wright and Hamish Brown of electronic pop band Swimmer One. Organiser Matt Lloyd said the project, which saw around 40 minutes of raw footage pieced together by Finnish cinematographer Minttu Mäntynen, highlighted the divide between urban and rural communities in Scotland and the long-running debate on land ownership in the country. It was shot largely in Sutherland, particularly at Achmelvich bay near Lochinver with some sections in Glasgow, he said. It’s essentially a film that explores the collapsing population in the Highlands through a burgeoning love story between a crofter and a Glaswegian woman. It was intended as a way of telling the story of the region through the mouths of its people, and it looks at the various ways people have been forced off the land in the Highlands, at family members who went south to work in the cities, or emigrated to Canada, or went off to war. Even today the Highlands are still suffering the effects of that lack of population and industry. But he added that the film had an optimistic vision of the region’s future. There’s some interesting footage of the construction of the Dounreay nuclear power station, and of hydroelectric systems being introduced. It was never intended as a nostalgia trip about the Highlands we lost, it has a vision of how to bring jobs and people back to the area. Today we take a more conservationist view, but at the time it would have been seen as a very progressive approach. Older industries might not have been the best in terms of balancing jobs with ecology, but the equivalent today would be things like using wind and wave power to develop the Highland economy, so it’s very relevant to a modern audience. Before beginning work on Lost Treasure, the Dawn Cine Group had found success with its earlier production Let Glasgow Flourish, which exposed overcrowded and filthy living conditions in the city’s slums. Lloyd said the group, which was the production arm of the Clydeside Film Society and relied on its members and subscriptions, had been ahead of its time in an era when the cost of equipment was an insurmountable barrier to filmmaking for ordinary people. The group were not part of the formal, state-sponsored documentary filmmaking world which was dominant in the 1950s and overseen by the Films of Scotland committee. That committee’s output was “dogmatic, instructive”, promoting state industries and industrial progress. There were very few people with access to cameras in those days beyond people working in centralised studio systems and aristocrats who could afford to make their own home movies. There were state-funded documentaries, but this kind of oppositional filmmaking with socialist intentions was very rare. The Dawn group held bring-and-buy sales and public lectures to raise the money to buy their camera. They filmed protests and demonstrations. Eventually they ran out of money, but their plans for Lost Treasure were really pretty epic, and it gives an indication of what Scottish filmmaking might have been if people had had access to Brown said that while the techniques he and Wright had used on the soundtrack would have been completely alien to the film’s original creators, he hoped they had captured the atmosphere intended in the script. We’re using a lot of modern equipment, we haven’t made an effort to be authentic to the technology or arrangements or instruments of the day. We’re looking to do an artistic response rather than purely revisiting original material. He added that the film’s debut coincides with a push for land reform in Scotland, where campaigners argue that the consolidation of land in the hands of private owners has been detrimental to the communities living and working on it. Historically, Highland crofters were among the first people to buy out their land from owners, even before the residents of Eigg, that’s part of what made this project quite attractive to me. It’s a very politically active region given how sparsely populated it is, and it’s a very interesting time to revisit some of the issues in the film. After the debut in Glasgow we’ll be touring around the country, and I’m particularly excited about taking the film to the actual locations where it was shot. Lost Treasure will be shown on 16 March at the Glasgow Film Theatre, and will then tour Scottish cinemas this spring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/dec/23/john-vidal-environment-editor-greatest-job-on-earth","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-23T16:00:20Z","webTitle":"Teargas, trees and oil: my life in the greatest job on earth | John Vidal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/23/john-vidal-environment-editor-greatest-job-on-earth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/dec/23/john-vidal-environment-editor-greatest-job-on-earth","fields":{"headline":"Teargas, trees and oil: my life in the greatest job on earth","bodyText":"In September 1989, Guardian editor Peter Preston took me to one side. “Environment? Your idea. You do it,” he said. I was on the arts desk and had quite forgotten that, two years earlier, I had proposed that we cover this fast-emerging issue in more depth and with new pages. We had a great correspondent in Paul Brown, but no single journalist could keep up with events. This was the height of Thatcherism, the old Soviet Union was collapsing in ecological ruin, and there had been serious nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. That year, more than two million people in Britain had voted Green in the European parliament elections. If that wasn’t enough, the Great Storm had just blown down 15m trees in southern England, the Exxon Valdez had spilt 11m gallons of crude oil off Alaska, and the French government had blown up Greenpeace’s Rainbow Warrior in a New Zealand harbour. In such tumultuous times, few people paid much attention to Nasa scientist James Hansen when he warned the US Congress, in that same year, about the consequences of something called global warming. Instead, the debate was about nuclear power, population, EU butter mountains, the limits to growth, lead in petrol and the car economy. I suggested to Preston that I was ill-equipped to cover this vast, contentious area and was quite happy to continue covering the arts. No chance. “Four pages. Starting in two weeks,” he said. With hindsight, the Guardian had accurately foreseen a shift of the global, social and scientific tectonic plates, and the arrival of an era of ecological politics. The lids on those boxes that had long separated human rights, science, nature, economics, politics and rich and poor countries had been blown off. The debate was now both global and local, personal and corporate, and it questioned the tarnished dreams of both capitalism and socialism. This was theatre on the world stage. In those early days, two very different women and two giant corporations came to define the frontlines of the battle for the natural world. Melanie Phillips was a senior Guardian editor and in charge of the new environment section when, around 1990, at the paper’s morning conference meeting, she questioned a major scientific report that suggested that mankind was partly responsible for global warming. Phillips was adamant that warming was neither happening nor possible, and that this study showed the descent of science from the pursuit of truth into politicised propaganda. Most of the journalists present were surprised at her disavowal of science, but the Guardian’s science editor was called in to offer another view. Phillips left soon after that, and became a leading climate sceptic. It was an early warning that the “culture wars” , or the polarisation of conservative and liberal values, had begun in earnest. Within a decade, the US neocons had identified environmentalism as the leading intellectual opposition to conservatism, and were trashing climate science, Europe, the precautionary principle and anyone they thought stood for regulation or against the free market. The second woman was Wangari Maathai, a young Kenyan scientist and political dissident who, in the early 1990s, was planting trees with some of Africa’s poorest communities. She came to Britain to talk to activists after being arrested for trying to stop the destruction of Nairobi’s largest park. Within half an hour she had probably changed the agenda for a generation of people who, until then, had barely considered human rights or the poor to be part of the environmental debate. Maathai was an emissary of the developing world, and spoke in horror about how western consumerism was devastating the world’s remotest areas and poorest people. Those at the top of the pyramid, she said, were being blinded “by the need to acquire, accumulate and over-consume”. I remember her saying: “They do not understand the limits to growth and they do not appreciate that they jeopardise the capacity of future generations to meet their own needs.” The message she brought was that any debate about the natural world should not just be about science and parts-per-billion of obscure gases, or about genes or kilowatts, but must include developing countries and be rooted in justice, equity and the situation of the least advantaged. She went on to win the Nobel peace prize, and the planting of trees became a worldwide symbol of political hope and community regeneration. Into this febrile 1990s mix came two giant corporations, both of which epitomised the times and which had both greatly benefitted from the globalisation of trade and the “liberalisation” of poor countries’ economies under the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Representing the old oil age was Shell. This pillar of the global corporate establishment was, for the first time, being held to account by the likes of Ogoni writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, who objected to the devastating human impact of the pollution it caused in places such as Nigeria; and by a new generation of activists angry about oil’s effect on the global atmosphere. Both paid the price of dissent. Saro-Wiwa and others were judicially murdered by the Nigerian government in 1995, and the activists were increasingly hounded and treated as criminals by the US and British authorities. Monsanto was different. Representatives from the old American chemical company, which had a dark history of making Agent Orange and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), came to the Guardian offices in 1997 claiming that Monsanto was the leader of the new “biological” age, having re-invented itself as a global seed company and world saviour. Five directors sat down in new editor Alan Rusbridger’s office, and within minutes were literally thumping the table, saying that we had misunderstood their intention to feed the world with GM food. But we understood very well at that moment that GM farming was not just about science, genes and the promise of greater yields, but also about the intensification of power, the control of food and the gigantic profits that all large corporations could make at the expense of nature. True to form, the British government sided with Monsanto. Most of the rest of the world said: no, thanks. By the late 1990s, with the prospect of water wars, climate change and pollution all growing, and the global NGO movement in full cry at nature’s losses, governments responded with a slew of conventions and treaties to protect the natural world. The Montreal Protocol slowed the growth of the hole in the ozone layer; the Convention on Biological Diversity tried to put a lid on the mounting loss of nature; the Earth Summit had introduced the idea of sustainable development; the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change aimed to brake greenhouse gas-emissions. Fat chance. Most were compromises, signed up to by cynical governments after long and bitter rows between rich and poor. Looking back, they had a common theme: the US, backed by its industries and Britain, invariably bullied the rest of the world into watering down any proposal that appeared to compromise the western way of life. But the worldwide reaction to continuing ecological devastation was sharp. Large anti-globalisation protests led by the left had flared up as trade unionists, environmentalists, debt campaigners and the public united to march against bodies such as the WTO in Seattle, Genoa, Florence and elsewhere. I breathed teargas in five countries (Italian is the sweetest, American the worst). Tactics were swapped between US and British activists as people took to trees and tunnels in protest at the trashing of the countryside, the laying of pipelines, the growth of the car economy and the loss of forests to roads. I recall going to the Newbury road protests with an Amazonian chief, and trying to explain that hundreds of young people were living up trees to protect them. “Ah, they are crazy!”, he responded, with a smile. Ten years later I travelled with ice scientists and Greenpeace to the high Arctic. We reached 82.30 N, just a few hundred miles from the pole, and could have continued north but for a fuel shortage. The vast ice cap that regulates the Earth’s temperature had in 2011 retreated further and faster than anyone could have imagined just 20 years before. Satellite images showed the ice had reduced by nearly 50% compared to just 40 years ago. Climate science was by now pretty conclusive, with UN assessments increasingly pointing the finger at mankind. All over the Arctic, the Andes, the Himalayas and the world’s high places, the effects of accelerating ice loss and a warming atmosphere were being seen. But even at temperate European latitudes, scientists were finding plants moving north, new insects arriving and previously unseen diseases. Nepalese farmers told how raindrops were getting bigger, and in Malawi and Tanzania they spoke of how the seasons were shifting. Empirical scientific research caught up with their observations. But the political chaos around climate change was growing, too, reaching a peak in Copenhagen at the UN’s 2009 climate summit. With 186 countries present, the US spying on delegations, and with Obama, Arnold Schwarzenegger and various rock stars in town, a secret agreement forged by the US, Britain and others to stem emissions by stitching up poor countries spectacularly blew up after a leak. It was clear that climate-change diplomacy had little to do with climate, and everything to do with global power politics and rich countries trying to prevent developing countries growing too much. The meeting fell apart and the Guardian, which received the leak, was accused of near-treason for siding with the poor. “You can’t have people going around getting leaked stuff from other powers who are more powerful than Britain, and printing them and not thinking that’s not going to have an appalling effect,” fumed one affronted senior British mandarin, his efforts to pull a fast one on developing countries in vain. To this day, the UK government believes China leaked that document. Wrong. It was the political mice. Today, 27 years after Peter Preston bolstered the Guardian’s environment coverage, the world has inexorably changed. In this blink of a geological eye, the human population had exploded, adding an extra 2.25 billion people, the equivalent of another China and another India, or 10 more Americas. From being a predominantly rural species, human beings had become urban. Since 1990, the number of mega-cities of more than 10 million people has tripled. By 2030, there will be 10 more. In those years, humans moved around like never before. In 1990, air passengers flew approximately 1bn miles. Today it is 3.5bn. In 1989, there were nearly 700m vehicles on the world’s roads. Today there are 1.25bn, and air pollution has become a bigger killer than Aids and malaria combined. Vehicle numbers are expected to double again in the next 30 years. The world, too, is undeniably hotter than it was in 1989. Sixteen of the 17 warmest years on record have been since 2000, and in that time, the Arctic summer ice has dramatically declined while carbon-dioxide levels have increased from 375 to more than 400-parts-per-million. Most worryingly, in a short quarter century we have been in biological meltdown. Since 1990 we have trashed one tenth of the world’s wilderness areas and lost perhaps 40% of the world’s animals. According to some scientists, one third of the world’s arable land has been lost to soil erosion or pollution in the past 40 years. There may never have been a time when so much has changed so fast. Virtually all of the planet’s ecosystems have continued to be transformed by human actions; extinction rates of organisms are high and increasing; genetic diversity has declined globally; Europe’s common bird populations have declined by 12% since 1990; tropical forests have been falling at a rate of nearly 1% a year; marine fisheries are collapsing. We have greatly diminished the world, but there has been a fightback. In the rich north, we undoubtedly protect more land and sea than we did; we recycle more; our water, air and beaches are generally cleaner, and our homes and machines are more energy-efficient. There are signs that we are slowly weaning ourselves off fossil fuels. We waste less, we buy more ethically, and we can measure our impact on the natural world far better. Across the world, the increase in the rate of population growth, forest loss and greenhouse-gas emissions is slowing; there are hundreds of millions fewer hungry people and more people with access to fresh water and sanitation. We have legal agreements to burn less fossil fuel, to pollute the air less, and to protect more animals. We understand ecological problems better. Many environmental issues fought in 1989 are within sight of being solved. We know what needs to be done. Above all, there has been an energy revolution. In 1989, coal in Britain was in decline after the miners’ strike and gas was taking over. But renewable energy, apart from hydro-power, was considered eccentric and unlikely to grow. In a remarkably short time, it has become mainstream and popular. Wind power is now part of the land and seascape; on one day last week it supplied more than 10,000MW, or 23% of Britain’s entire electricity demand. More than 1m homes and businesses generate electricity from solar power, and just one nuclear plant, Sizewell B, was commissioned in 27 years. Government has been blind to the fact that this has been a cultural revolution, too, with the old, centralised power sources now largely unloved and seen as relics. People today aspire to renewable energy, electric cars and passive houses. Battery developments might revolutionise power again in the next 20 years. There have been other upsides. Britain now leads the world in reducing CO2 emissions, albeit largely by outsourcing its manufacturing and closing its coalfields. Last year, emissions fell to 31% below 1990 levels, with UK coal use down 41% in just three years and at its lowest level of use since the industrial revolution. Sustainable development may be the stated aim of all countries, but looking ahead, it is impossible to be ecologically or socially optimistic. Earth’s inhabitable spaces have dramatically shrunk, its resources have become scarcer, and the intergenerational injustices are mounting. Nature is resilient, but it is clear that, as the natural world is pushed to its limits, we increase chaos, conflict, natural disaster and tensions. And as the neocons, the rightwingers and Brexiteers achieve power, so the environmental protections so laboriously won by NGOs and social activists in the 1980s and 90s are in real danger of being wiped out. The next 27 years can only be fraught. Human population will, inevitably, grow by a further 2 billion people by 2050, cities will burgeon and developing countries will be stretched to their limits. If the gaining of universal wealth follows the lines countries have taken these past 27 years, then the early destruction of more vast swathes of the natural world and its inhabitants seems certain. The great fear is that the transformation to a low-carbon world will take too long, that an addiction to oil and fossil fuels will not stop, and that we will undermine that web of life that sustains us all. The twin hopes must be that we see the end of the oil age and we stop the loss of wildlife. We can see now from space what we have done to forests, soils, and oceans and fresh water in just a few years. We now know the disastrous health effects of air pollution, and of a warming world. We understand that we can grow more food without polluting water, or resorting to gene manipulation. We have proved we can heal nature. Above all, countries and people now have options to transform the way we live. In the words of Preston: “Environment? Your idea. You do it.” • This article was amended on 28 December 2016.

The resulting nuclear fire lasted 10 days, spewing 400 times as much radiation as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Today Chernobyl’s soil, water, and air are among the most highly contaminated on Earth. The reactor is at the centre of a 1,000-square-mile “exclusion zone”, a quarantined no-man’s land complete with border guards, passport control and radiation monitoring. But amid the environmental devastation, the human story of Chernobyl is often lost. That story is embodied in an unlikely community of some 130 people, known as “self-settlers”, who defiantly live inside the exclusion zone. Almost all of them are women. About 116,000 people were evacuated from the zone at the time of the accident, but about 1,200 of them refused to stay away. The women who remain, now in their 70s and 80s, are the last survivors of those who illegally returned to their ancestral homes shortly after the accident. A new film by Holly Morris and Anne Bogart, screening in London this weekend, follows the unlikely group of rebels as they continue to go about their daily lives in the toxic and lonely environment. The film depicts the zone’s scattered ghost villages, now silent, eerie and contaminated. Many villages have eight or 12 babushkas, or babas – the Russian and Ukrainian words for “grandmother” – still living in them. One self-settler depicted in the documentary, Hanna Zavorotnya, explained how she snuck through the bushes back to her village in the summer of 1986. “Shoot us and dig the grave,” she told the soldiers who tried to evacuate her and other family members, “otherwise we’re staying.” Why did she choose to live on this deadly land? Is she unaware of the risks, or crazy enough to ignore them, or both? When asked about radiation, Zavorotnya replied: “Radiation doesn’t scare me. Starvation does.” Zavorotnya and the other women lived through Stalin’s Holodomor – the genocide-by-famine of the 1930s that wiped out millions of Ukrainians – and then the Nazis in the 1940s. When the Chernobyl accident happened a few decades into Soviet rule, many were simply unwilling to flee an enemy that was invisible. Trauma of relocation As long as they were well beyond child bearing age, self-settlers were allowed to stay “semi-illegally”. But what about their health? The complications from an environment laced with radioactive contaminants, such as cesium, strontium and americium. Health studies vary. The World Health Organisation predicts more than 4,000 deaths will eventually be linked to the Chernobyl disaster. Greenpeace and others put that projection into the tens of thousands. All agree thyroid cancers are sky high, and that Chernobyl evacuees have suffered the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere, including anxiety and depression. Radioactive contamination from the accident has been deadly, but the trauma of relocation is another fallout of Chernobyl. Of the old people who relocated, one Chernobyl medical technician, whose job is to give annual radiation exposure tests to zone workers said: “Quite simply, they die of anguish.” Other babushkas have said: “If you leave you die”; “Those who left are worse off now. They are all dying of sadness”; “Motherland is Motherland. I will never leave.” Radiation or not, these women are at the end of their lives. But their continued existence and spirit indicate the transformative connections to home, and about the strength of self-determination. They are unexpected lessons from a nuclear tragedy.

The comments from Vincent de Rivaz, EDF chief executive, came at a nuclear conference where senior industry figures raised fears of a skills and supply chain crunch at the £25bn Hinkley Point C power station in Somerset. De Rivaz admitted that delays at its Flamanville plant in France were a setback, but insisted they would not impact financially on the British project, which is using the same European pressurised reactor (EPR) technology. “We should be under no illusion that building new nuclear plants has never been easy,” he told the Nuclear Industries Association (NIA). “We take the construction risk for Hinkley Point C – not the customers. Let us be clear, the cost of Hinkley Point C has not increased by one penny as a result of the delays at Flamanville.” The EDF executive said volatile oil prices, uncertainty over Russian energy supplies and high hopes for a binding new climate change agreement to restrict carbon emissions underlined the need for new nuclear plants. De Rivaz said legal and other work needed to be completed before EDF could give the final investment decision on Hinkley Point, but he remained confident that a positive decision could be made in the first quarter of 2015. He said discussions with potential new and existing foreign shareholders to the project were continuing. Asked about the problems at Areva, designer of the EPR and shareholder in the Hinkley project, De Rivaz said the French government, which owned the majority of shares in the business, had agreed to support it as a going concern. But the conference also heard from John Hutton, chairman of the NIA, who warned of a “capacity crunch” because the British supply chain would struggle to cope with an upsurge in work from other new build projects as well as existing contracts top keep reactors running or for decommissioning old ones. Andrew Storer, a Rolls-Royce executive, said he was concerned at the lack of facilities for testing nuclear equipment, while Mike Tynan, chief executive of the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Centre, said smaller UK companies in particular could struggle to meet the high standards required for a nuclear safety culture as well as product quality and skills. Meanwhile, the NIA released the results of a YouGov survey of 2,000 people which showed that 45% were in favour of new reactors and 20% opposed. Ten years ago only 35% supported more construction."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/dec/28/whitehall-culture-secrecy-freedom-of-information","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-28T09:49:00Z","webTitle":"Whitehall’s culture of secrecy is dismantling freedom of information | Richard Norton-Taylor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/28/whitehall-culture-secrecy-freedom-of-information","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/28/whitehall-culture-secrecy-freedom-of-information","fields":{"headline":"Whitehall’s culture of secrecy is dismantling freedom of information","bodyText":"For decades, hundreds of official documents, including cabinet papers, have been released on 30 December, disclosing decisions that would have been considered unacceptable in a democracy had they been known about at the time. They would be made available at what is now called the National Archives at Kew in south-west London, under the “30-year rule”. This year will be different. Instead of the usual treasure trove of long-held documents, next week the archives will release only a limited number. Kew says it is changing the way historic records are released by “moving to a more responsive and agile programme of releases”. Its task has not been made easier by the decision to gradually open up records 20, rather than 30 years, old. But the official explanation put out by the archives disguises a fundamental shift in Whitehall that is making a mockery of David Cameron’s early promises of transparency and accountability. Opening up official information, including historical records, has been downgraded. It is “a very low priority”, say senior figures with intimate knowledge of the issues. While ministers and their civil servants slash the number of staff responsible for weeding through and releasing government documents, they also blame the Freedom of Information Act for costing too much. Yet what is costing – and wasting – money is Whitehall’s increasingly determined attempts to suppress information. Here is an example of the lengths to which the government is going to stop information from seeing the light of day, and the costs involved. Maurice Frankel, director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, has worked out that Whitehall has so far spent more than £30,000 of taxpayers’ money in legal fees in a four-and-a-half year battle trying to stop the release of the appointments diaries of the former health secretary Andrew Lansley. Whitehall argues that it would be damaging and embarrassing if it revealed there had been gaps in his diaries. Officials in future would have to fill up their diaries with pointless and unnecessary meetings, it argues. Yet that would be another reason why the diaries should be disclosed, according to the tribunal dealing with the case. They would expose just how civil servants were prepared to waste even more time and money. The government, rejecting the point the tribunal was trying to make, has taken the case to the court of appeal. We also now know that senior Whitehall officials fought for three years in a failed and costly attempt to prevent British citizens from knowing that Prince Charles has access to cabinet papers. “Obviously it would have been much better if they would have been open on this point,” said the chair of the Commons constitutional committee, Conservative Bernard Jenkin. “But this is the civil service … where they’re still not used to drawing a line between what is secret and what is not secret.”. The most senior Whitehall mandarin, Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, claims the Freedom of Information Act has a “chilling effect” on the way his officials operate. The government has set up a commission designed to make it more difficult to obtain official information under the act – which has exposed child abuse, the misuse of MPs’ expenses, unhygienic restaurants and nuclear power station leaks. Whitehall has also taken responsibility for freedom of information policy away from the Ministry of Justice and placed it firmly in the hands of Heywood’s Cabinet Office, the bastion of official secrecy. And the release of records to the National Archives has been placed under the control of what are called “knowledge management” units set up in Whitehall departments. Ministers and their officials need not worry. The obstacles in the way are already formidable. The loopholes and exemptions in both the Freedom of Information and Public Records Acts allow Whitehall officials tremendous leeway. The notorious section 3 (4) of the Public Records Act states that documents can be retained by Whitehall departments “for administrative or any other special reason”. One person’s experience provides eloquent testimony. Nine months ago, Andrew Lownie, an author and literary agent, asked the archives to release a Foreign Office file marked: “Closed extract: Folio 1 from Defectors to and from the Soviet Union, including Kim Philby”. At first, the archives said the information was exempt under section 27 of the Freedom of Information Act, whereby disclosure would be refused if it “prejudices Britain’s relations with another state” or “the interests of the United Kingdom abroad”. By June the archives had changed tack. Now it said the information was exempt under section 40 (2) of the act, covering “personal information”. In a catch-22, the act allows Whitehall to withhold documents if the intention is to publish them some time in the future. There are about 600,000 Foreign Office files in a “special collection” waiting to be transferred to the archives. It has been estimated it will take 75 years for them to be weeded and sent to Kew. It will also be a long time before there will be a proper, regular release at the archives of major cabinet documents."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2014/jun/16/china-current-future-investments-18bn-trade-rail-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-16T13:20:16Z","webTitle":"China trade visit set to result in £18bn of investments for UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/16/china-current-future-investments-18bn-trade-rail-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jun/16/china-current-future-investments-18bn-trade-rail-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"China trade visit set to result in £18bn of investments for UK","bodyText":"China will deepen its investment in the UK, with around £18bn of deals expected to be signed during a three-day visit by the premier, Li Keqiang, starting on Monday. The visit, involving 200 Chinese business leaders, is also expected to shed more light on its involvement in the UK's first new nuclear power station in a generation, at Hinkley Point in Somerset. China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) and China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) have already agreed in principle to be minority shareholders in the £16bn project. With deals expected to focus on energy and nuclear power, Li's visit underscores how the nature of Chinese infrastructure investment has changed. Early Chinese infrastructure investors focused on utilities, such as water companies and airports, companies with predictable revenue streams and reliable returns. Graham Matthews, a partner in Deloitte's China services group, said the nation was moving beyond \"pure financial play\", into new-build investments, where its \"world-leading expertise\" in areas such as high-speed rail made it an attractive partner for the UK. \"The financial investments will continue, but China has knowledge that is very relevant to the UK, which would make strategic investments more relevant.\" If it is purely financial there is a lot of competition for those deals, but for strategic investment, China brings other things … that makes them a compelling partner.\" He cited examples, such as China's prowess with railways and pledges to encourage Asian companies to set-up their European headquarters at a business park, being constructed on derelict land in east London. Current investments Water China's sovereign wealth fund owns 9% of the UK's largest water company,Thames Water, while a Hong Kong-based investment consortium controlled by billionaire Li Ka-shing owns more than a quarter of Northumbrian Water. Canary Wharf China was one of several investors, including Qatar and investment banks, that rescued the property company that owns Canary Wharf. The property company, Songbird Estates, had been struggling with its debts before an international consortium of investors bought it out in 2009. Royal Albert Dock A Chinese developer signed a £1bn deal with London's mayor, Boris Johnson, to build a business park on the site of the derelict Royal Albert Docks in east London. Advanced Business Park – the developer– has promised to build \"a city within a city\" by 2017, where Asian companies will site their European headquarters. Weetabix The nation's favourite breakfast cereal was snapped up by Chinese government-owned Bright foods in 2012. The company bought a 60% stake in the 80-year old cereal, with the aim of expanding the brand abroad, especially in Asia. Heathrow airport China Investment Corporation added Heathrow to its list of assets in 2012 when it bought a 10% stake in the UK's largest airport. Ferrovial, the Spanish infrastructure group, remains the biggest shareholder with a 25% stake. London's black cabs A private Chinese carmaker, Geely, rode to the rescue of the maker of London's black cabs Manganese Bronze, paying £11m to buy the troubled firm after it fell into administration. Geely also owns Volvo, but analysts questioned its decision to buy a carmaker with potentially limited export potential that had not turned a profit for five years before the rescue. Sunseeker The Somerset company that makes luxury yachts sailed by James Bond villains was bought by China's second richest man Wang Jianlin and his Dalian Wanda group in a £300m deal last year. The group is also spending £700 on building a luxury hotel near Vauxhall in London. Harvey Nichols The upmarket department store loved by Absolutely Fabulous' fashionistas, has been rejuvenated since it was bought by Hong Kong luxury goods tycoon Dickson Poon in 1991. Since his company took over, the store has expanded beyond its London base into the Midlands and north of Britain. Superdrug High-street stalwart Superdrug has been owned by Hong-Kong based AS Watson since 2002, the world's largest health and beauty retailer. Potential future investments Nuclear power (Hinkley Point) Two Chinese companies are potentially taking a 40% stake in Hinkley Point, the UK's first new nuclear power station in a generation. The £16bn plant is expected to provide enough energy to power 7% of British homes for 60 years. Hinkley Point is only one of 12 nuclear plants that the government hopes to see built in the coming decades, and China is expected to be involved in several of them. HS2 China's president Li Keqiang told David Cameron last year that the country would like to be involved in HS2. The China Railway Group has since offered to finance and build links to Birmingham station. The Thames tunnel China's sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corporation, already owns almost a tenth of Thames Water. Now Whitehall officials are said to be courting Chinese investors to invest in the £4.2bn Thames tunnel – the London \"super sewer\" – a controversial project that has not yet had the green light from planners. A third runway at Heathrow Chinese grandees have already singled out the failure to build a third runway at Heathrow as one of the UK's problems. If Heathrow's expansion plans go ahead, Chinese investors, who already own 10% of the airport, are expected to be involved in financing and building it. Crossrail 2 London authorities are hoping foreign funds will step forward to invest in Crossrail 2, a major north-south railway project for the capital. The £16bn project is not expected to be operational until 2030s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2015/may/21/will-selfs-amanuensis-to-publish-memoir-of-working-for-the-novelist","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-21T11:56:02Z","webTitle":"Will Self's 'amanuensis' to publish memoir of working for the novelist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/21/will-selfs-amanuensis-to-publish-memoir-of-working-for-the-novelist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/may/21/will-selfs-amanuensis-to-publish-memoir-of-working-for-the-novelist","fields":{"headline":"Will Self's 'amanuensis' to publish memoir of working for the novelist","bodyText":"From an interview involving shooting whisky bottles and smoking “special” cigarettes to an attempt to take a short cut through Sizewell’s nuclear power stations, the novelist Matthew De Abaitua is set to lift the curtain on the six months he spent as Will Self’s amanuensis in Suffolk 20 years ago. De Abaitua’s memoir Self &amp; I has just been acquired by Aardvark Bureau, a new imprint at independent publisher Gallic Books, which will publish it next May. It details the half-year period in the early 1990s when De Abaitua worked as a live-in assistant for Self: at the time, the novelist had just published My Idea of Fun, while De Abaitua was 21, and had recently completed the creative writing MA at the University of East Anglia. Self, whose novel Umbrella was shortlisted for the Man Booker prize and whose books also include How the Dead Live and Shark, declined to comment on the memoir. “Will is aware of the book but isn’t going to endorse it or anything like that, which I think is the perfect situation,” said publisher Scott Pack. “If he took against it, especially vocally, then that would be potentially uncomfortable for all concerned, whereas if he got behind it and supported it then people might possibly think he was too close to it. A dignified distance feels about right to me.” An early extract published in Five Dials magazine sees De Abaitua recount the details of his initial interview with Self at Terence Blacker’s farmhouse. “Will Self arrives, six foot five, dressed entirely in black; light bends towards him like a black hole or a dilated pupil. He throws a gunnysack of weed at me and says, ‘Make something out of that’. I make the special cigarette. The interview proceeds in a fashion in which I cannot recall,” he writes. The position, he is told, will include reading not only Self’s works, but those he will be writing about, as well as “a library of drug literature in the study” The list continued: “I can bring no Class A drugs into the house, nor am I permitted to drink more than the government-recommend twenty-four units of alcohol a day. I am to do whatever I am asked. Nothing is beneath me: laundry, transcriptions, fetching and carrying, and even roughing up literary critics in the Groucho if they diss ‘the Contemporary Novel’.” De Abaitua said of the book: “I was a young man, and it’s written entirely from that point of view, I don’t put any hindsight on it. I started it 20 years after I had the experience – it was instead of having a midlife crisis. And as I started to explore some of the people who had influenced me, and my encounters with them, the more I started pulling at this particular thread, and the more it seemed it could stand in for quite big themes, not just about myself but about the times.” His duties included sourcing an enormous map of London, and mounting it on a flexible screen, “so that we can bend it around us of an evening and sit in it, in his preferred mode of silence, reading and drinking, until we are sufficiently intoxicated for bed”, he writes in the extract, as well as aiding the author in his quest to reach the sea by Sizewell nuclear power station, which Self believes will help cure the self-inflicted scratches that were then covering his face. “‘I’ve been scratching at my face all night,’ [Self] says. ‘I had image horror. Now it’s infected.’” Self is reported to have delivered these sentences to his assistant and a visiting gas man, from the top of the stairs, “naked, apart from a towel, which is draped over his head”. “This explanation does not reassure the gas man. He moves briskly at a crouch into the garden. ‘I have a plan to deal with my face. I am going to take the Sizewell cure. Get your trunks’,” writes De Abaitua. They set off for Sizewell, and try to take a short cut to the sea through the reactor complex. “Will suggests bunking over the fence. My job as Will’s assistant requires a relentless willingness to participate in the unusual,” writes De Abaitua. “But just because I am a grunt, enlisted in a very small and embattled infantry division in which Will Self is the sergeant major, does not mean that I will break into a nuclear power reactor with a pair of trunks and some sausages, and a man with a mutated face, just so he can take a short cut to the beach. No way. Not unless he insists upon it. Reason prevails. We walk around the perimeter.” “It’s quite an intense thing to do and it does change you ... It was my job as amanuensis to roam the same imaginary topography [as Self],” De Abaitua told the Guardian. “It’s not a gossipy book, but I wanted to capture that almost Withnail and I-ish quality of it ... [And] I really wanted to celebrate how this was a time in literature when people didn’t really give a shit about readers. Writers were imperious; it was all about the dictating of our unconscious, and mining that … Obviously now writers are much more subservient, and set out on social media, desperately trying to corral people into giving a shit.” De Abaitua went on to become deputy editor of the Idler magazine, and to publish the Arthur C Clarke award-shortlisted novel The Red Men, with a book deal struck for two further science fiction novels with the publisher Angry Robot. He also lectures on creative writing at Brunel University and the University of Essex – coincidentally, his office at Brunel is opposite Self’s. “We’re still in touch,” he said. “And he’s seen the book. He’s going to not comment about it, which I think is the right thing. He is a very different person, physiologically and psychologically, from the period, and it would be weird for him to comment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"cities/2016/mar/07/chernobyl-30-years-residents-life-ghost-city-pripyat","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-07T07:30:57Z","webTitle":"Chernobyl 30 years on: former residents remember life in the ghost city of Pripyat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/07/chernobyl-30-years-residents-life-ghost-city-pripyat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2016/mar/07/chernobyl-30-years-residents-life-ghost-city-pripyat","fields":{"headline":"Chernobyl 30 years on: former residents remember life in the ghost city of Pripyat","bodyText":"In a biting winter wind, Alexander Petrovich Zabirchenko walks slowly along a memorial to firefighters and workers who died in the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, touching each of the portraits engraved in granite. He does not shiver or complain of the cold. He is a big man and draws himself up to his full height before each sombre stone. “Here is Valeri, and here Vladimir and Alexandr and Anatoli … I knew these men,” he says. “I worked with them. They were colleagues and friends.” As one of the many Chernobyl workers who returned to the devastated plant to fight the fires, Zabirchenko is an official “Hero of the Soviet Union”. He bats away the honour with a wave of his hand. “These men were the heroes; every one of them. They died preventing an even bigger disaster. They saved not just Ukraine, Russia or the Soviet Union as it was, but the whole of Europe.” Next month, thousands of men, women and children in the northern Ukrainian city of Slavutych, will gather at the memorial here to light candles to the 30 initial victims of the world’s worst nuclear accident. Three decades on, they will remember not just the dead, but the memories and dreams they left behind in Pripyat, the ghost city that was once their home. The story of Pripyat and Slavutych is a tale of twin cities: Pripyat, a former model Soviet metropolis built to house Chernobyl workers but abandoned to radioactive contamination and the ravages of nature; Slavutych, an urban phoenix that rose from the ashes of the disaster to replace it. It took 36 hours after an ill-judged test on Reactor Number 4 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant went catastrophically wrong, for the Soviet authorities to order the evacuation of Pripyat, just two miles from the plant. In under four hours, more than 49,000 people left their homes, most shuttled away from the plant – but not the cloud of radioactive dust carried by wind over swaths of western Europe – by a fleet of 1,200 buses. They were told they would be gone for two or three days and advised to take the minimum: identity papers, documents, food and clothing. None ever returned to live in Pripyat, declared too radioactively dangerous for human habitation for at least 24,000 years. Six months after the disaster, the Soviet authorities declared a new city would be built around 30 miles to the north-east of the power station, to replace the old one. Many of the families evacuated from Pripyat moved to this city, Slavutych – the old Slavic name of the nearby Dnieper River. The area on which it was built was first covered in two metres of fresh, uncontaminated soil. Architects and construction workers from eight former Soviet republics – Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Latvia, Lituania, Russia and Ukraine – were each tasked with creating one of the city’s eight districts. As a result, each district has its own distinctive cultural and ethnic features: so, flats and houses in the Georgian district have more decoration than those in the more austere Russian district next door. Photographs in the city’s museum capture the excitement of the first residents: many followed the Ukrainian tradition of letting a cat cross the threshold of their new homes for good luck. At the time, the new city mayor, Volodimir Udovichenko, told them: “If Pripyat represents destruction, defeat, a lost city, a dead city – then Slavutych is the resurrection”. Today, the number of former Pripyat residents in Slavutych has dwindled to fewer than one in three, but thousands are still to this day employed at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, despite its closure under European Union pressure in 2000. Every morning the train from Slavutych transports workers such as 62-year-old Pasha Kondratiev, 50 minutes along the line to its only destination: the Chernobyl plant. Every evening, around 4.30pm it disgorges them back in Slavutych. All undergo daily radiation checks, including the train. Kondratiev, who started work at the plant 33 years ago, works at Chernobyl checking radiation measuring equipment. On the day of the accident he and his wife Natasha and daughters Tatiana, 12, and Marina, 10, walked to the bridge over the river subsidiary feeding the nuclear plant’s cooling pond, to get a better view of what was going on. The site was later named “the bridge of death”, because of the levels of radiation in the area. “I could see the ruins of the reactor. It was completely destroyed and there was a cloud of smoke coming from it. Nobody gave us any information, but we knew it was serious. We knew it was something terrifying,” Kondratiev says. The following day when the evacuation was announced, Natasha grabbed the girls and crossed the city to catch a train to relatives living in Smolensk in neighbouring Russia. At their neat bungalow home in Slavutych, Kondratiev adds: “When I saw the power plant, I understood at once there was no chance we were going back …” His wife shakes her head: “I definitely thought we were coming back at first. Then when we were on the train, some of the women whose husbands were firefighters were talking about how they’d been burned and were crying, and I became so worried about Pasha. My heart was beating so fast. In those days we didn’t have mobile phones and I had no idea what would happen to him.” Two years after the disaster, their previously healthy elder daughter Tatiana, became asthmatic. When she collapsed in the street in Slavutych, aged 19, the ambulance failed to arrive in time to save her. “Who knows if Chernobyl caused her asthma. All we know is that before the accident she was healthy. She was exposed to radiation when she was 12, which is a critical age for a child’s development. It was probably linked to Chernobyl, but nobody can say for sure,” Natasha says. She mourns for her daughter, and for their former home. “From the first day we came to Pripyat, I never wanted to leave. It was paradise. Everywhere there were roses and fruit trees, we could fish in the river and pick mushrooms in the forest. It seemed the place had been created especially for us. “We went back to Pripyat a few years ago – it was very sad for us. We went to our apartment and saw the rooms and some of the things we left behind in 1986.” Their second daughter, Marina Uldasheva, 39, says she remembers that just before the catastrophe, her mother had bought her a red raincoat. After she and her sister were evacuated, it was deemed radioactive and destroyed. “I loved that coat; it was so fashionable. But all our clothes were taken away and my long hair was cut like a boy’s. They said it was radioactive too. We were given a blue worker’s boiler suit to wear, and slippers. “I have no strong link with Pripyat – I was too young to remember it much. Unlike my parents, I have nothing with which to compare Slavutych, so it is my home and I will stay here.” In the Russian district of Slavutych, Nikolai Syomin, 59, pins his medals declaring him a “Hero of the Soviet Union” to his jacket for a photograph. Syomin, a graduate of Leningrad Technical School employed as a repairman at Chernobyl, was celebrating his 30th birthday in his Pripyat flat on the evening of 25 April 1986. “It was a hot evening and we left all the windows open. We saw some kind of smoke in the sky but we didn’t think much of it. Our apartment was in the centre of Pripyat. We later discovered the wind brought radioactive dust and made it one of the most contaminated areas.” The following day, he phoned the nuclear plant. “I got through but was told they weren’t authorised to say anything and the person put the phone down. The next day they announced that Pripyat was being evacuated.” As a designated “essential worker”, Syomin was told he must stay and help the clean-up operation. His wife Natalya, 60 – a cheerful, dignified woman, who worked as a nurse in Pripyat’s sports complex – says she grabbed one small bag and her three-year-old son Anton, and left. “In the hours after the accident, everyone received a dose of radiation. Where we lived was among the worst areas contaminated. The forest around was bulldozed and buried,” she says. “When we left, we didn’t realise that it would be for good. It was only months later that we realised nothing would ever be the same again.” Slavutych has the same “spirit” as the city they left, Natalya says, but it will always be “our second home”. “Pripyat holds so many memories for us. Our son was born there and everyone misses it. All we have are memories. It was mentally tough to go back, very painful, so we stopped going. “The last time [we were there], we saw that everything is overgrown, so we have to work hard to hold on to our memories. At the time we were young, we were alive and nothing was a problem. We didn’t worry about living near the power plant. We were told it was safe. “Every 26 April we meet with friends and neighbours from Pripyat to remember. But we cannot go back, so we have to look forward.” Next door to the Syomins, Sergei Matolievich Shedrakov, 59, and his wife Alexandra Ivanovna, 60, recall being evacuated from Pripyat with their two children – daughter Katya, then aged five, and son Pavel, aged 16 months. “There was no panic, but looking back it was terrifying,” says Alexandra, who used to work in one of Pripyat’s post offices. “People lived with the power plant, they worked there, they relied on it. We didn’t even think of radiation. “Pripyat was a lovely city, life was good there – but it’s good here in Slavutych too. As the Russian saying goes, there are no good things without bad things.” Lydia Petrovna Malesheva, 77, recalls the excitement generated by the news in the autumn of 1986 that Slavutych was to be built. “We were told a new city would be built just for us, the people who had lost Pripyat. We were so excited, we stayed up all night talking about it,” she says. “A city just for us. We could hardly believe it.” Malesheva gives a guided tour of her small garden pointing out the “summer space” for barbecues, apple, apricot and pear trees. “The first of us moved to Slavutych in August 1988. Those who had worked at the Chernobyl plant after the accident, like my late husband, were given a choice of apartments or little houses. We chose a house. Slavutych is lovely and the best solution in the circumstances – but it’s not Pripyat. I miss Pripyat very much. Sometimes it’s too painful to think about it.” She adds: “We went back for the 20th anniversary and there were so many people, it was as if the city had come alive again, but of course it hadn’t.” Once a year, around Easter, some former residents of the now contaminated “dead zone” around Chernobyl still return for a few hours – just long enough to visit relatives’ graves. Pripyat, built in 1970, was hailed as a triumph of Soviet urban planning: the austere concrete style favoured by USSR architects tempered by colourful murals and Communist slogans exhorting residents to study, work or remember the revolution. Boats and hydrofoils cruised the river whose sandy bank, nicknamed “The Beach”, was popular with sunbathers. Pripyat’s shops were better stocked than elsewhere in the Soviet Union. Its hospital and clinics were fully equipped, the Palace of Culture housed a theatre, and there were sports halls and an Olympic-sized swimming pool too. At the time of the accident, residents were excited about the impending May Day inauguration of an amusement park with a Ferris wheel, swingboats and brightly coloured dodgems. Today, Pripyat is a ghost city. The Ferris wheel that never turned has become an enduring symbol of the disaster. Radiation levels hover around 62.3 microroentgens an hour (0.62 microsieverts): just over twice the normal background radiation in London, and less than going through an airport security scanner three times – which makes Pripyat safe enough for a brief visit, but not long-term habitation. But Alexander Petrovich Zabirchenko, 68, who worked as head of Chernobyl’s electrical department, prefers not to return to his former home town, where he loved to fish in the river and the plant’s cooling reservoir. He has difficulty walking because of circulation problems he blames on radiation exposure, and will instead pay his tributes to the dead in Slavutych. “The cemetery here was built with enough room for 50 years,” Zabirchenko says, “but it’s already full. So many friends and colleagues have gone.” All those the Guardian spoke to named relatives and friends who had died of cancer, which they linked to the catastrophe 30 years ago. None expressed concern about the continuing danger from radioactive contamination. For them, the elephant in the room is not radiation, but the threat of unemployment. Many fear the completion of the new EU-funded “sarcophagus” – being built to encase the lead and concrete shell that was hastily thrown over what was left of Reactor Number 4 – will drive many out of work when it is put in place next year, in a city still strangely reliant on the power station. Marina Uldasheva, who has two children Varvara, aged five months, and Matvey, 10, says she is not worried about her husband, Vitaly, working at Chernobyl where he is a member of the team decommissioning the reactors. “I don’t think about it. Everything terrifying happened a long time ago.” Until 2008, when it mysteriously disappeared, central Slavutych boasted another Soviet-style art monument with the motto of the city’s architects: “From the ashes of the past, we will build a new world.” The challenge facing Slavutych today is how to ensure an economic disaster does not transform the city into another Pripyat.

Costs have dropped to $85 (£55) per megawatt hour (MWh) compared with the current costs of about $115 for constructing coal or gas-fired plants, its analysis found. The price of wind, which has fallen from $108 just 12 months ago, compares with nuclear which Bloomberg assesses at $190 – the latter up on a year ago as project delays are factored in to developments. The positive picture for renewable power in Britain is mirrored across the world with wind and solar technologies fast falling in price while fossil fuel costs continue to move upwards. “Wind is now the cheapest technology in the UK and this means that old rules of thumb, such as ‘renewables are expensive’ or ‘unreliable’, need to be updated,” said Seb Henbest, head of Europe for BNEF. “Some people still think that wind or other renewables are a luxury that we cannot afford in difficult economic times but costs have been falling fast and they are now competitive (to a greater or lesser extent) worldwide.” The numbers drawn up by Bloomberg are a “levelised cost of energy” (LCOE) which takes into account financing, intermittency and other issues, so that different technologies can be fairly compared. However LCOE does not account for the cost of managing intermittent power in the national grid electricity system. The figures are assessed in dollars to allow international comparisons, however the figures are influenced by a range of costs including currency exchange rates. Fossil fuel technologies have been increasing in cost, partly due to new estimates on likely higher future carbon prices. Henbest says the LCOE figures are the kind that would help power companies trying to make a decision on whether to build a new windfarm, a solar array or a gas-fired power station. The analysis comes at a time when the Conservative government has taken the axe to onshore wind subsidies and pruned back drastically some of those available for solar systems and biomass plants. Greenpeace said the latest results showed that ministers were “backing the wrong horse” by giving strong support for new nuclear plants at a time when subsidies to renewables were being hacked back. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, said: “This is yet another major breakthrough for clean technologies that just go on smashing new records on efficiency and prices. As the production costs of coal, gas, and nuclear power keep rising and those of wind and solar falling, it’s blindingly obvious that the UK government are backing the wrong horses. Millions of British consumers will pay for this mistake with higher bills to subsidise costly, outdated and polluting power sources.” The environmental group recently produced its own report which asrgued that with the right support the UK could be producing 85% of its own renewable electrcity by 2030. A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman said: “Government support has driven down the cost of renewable energy significantly, enabling renewables to compete with other technologies and helping the industry stand on its own two feet. “Our priority is now to move towards a low-carbon economy whilst ensuring subsidies are used where they are needed most, to provide the best value for money for hardworking bill payers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/mar/04/north-korea-kim-jong-un-orders-country-to-be-ready-to-use-nuclear-weapons-at-any-time","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-04T06:09:35Z","webTitle":"North Korea: Kim Jong-un orders nuclear weapons readied for use 'at any time'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/04/north-korea-kim-jong-un-orders-country-to-be-ready-to-use-nuclear-weapons-at-any-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/mar/04/north-korea-kim-jong-un-orders-country-to-be-ready-to-use-nuclear-weapons-at-any-time","fields":{"headline":"North Korea: Kim Jong-un orders nuclear weapons readied for use 'at any time'","bodyText":"North Korea should be ready to use nuclear weapons “at any time” in the face of a growing threat from its enemies, leader Kim Jong-un has decreed in a further escalation of tensions on the Korean peninsula. Kim’s warning, issued via state-controlled media on Friday morning, appeared to be an attempt to put pressure on the international community after the UN security council on Wednesday adopted a raft of new sanctions against the regime in response to its recent nuclear test and rocket launch. Kim, who was supervising the test-firing of newly developed multiple rocket launchers, said North Korea’s situation had become so perilous that it should have the option of launching a “pre-emptive attack” – a departure from previous claims that the North’s nuclear capability was purely a deterrent. In an apparent threat to neighbouring South Korea, Kim said the new rocket launchers should be “promptly deployed” along with other new weaponry. He said the regime’s enemies – notably the US – were threatening North Korea’s survival, the state-controlled KCNA news agency reported. “At an extreme time when the Americans ... are urging war and disaster on other countries and people, the only way to defend our sovereignty and right to live is to bolster our nuclear capability,” KCNA quoted Kim as saying. “Under the extreme situation that the US imperialist is misusing its military influence and is pressuring other countries and people to start war and catastrophe, the only way for our people to protect sovereignty and rights to live is to strengthen the quality and quantity of nuclear power and realise the balance of power. “We must always be ready to fire our nuclear warheads at any time.” People in the capital, Pyongyang, said the new round of UN sanctions would not affect the country’s progress. “No kind of sanctions will ever work on us, because we’ve lived under US sanctions for more than half a century,” Pyongyang resident Song Hyo-il told the Associated Press. “And in the future we’re going to build a powerful and prosperous country here, relying on our own development.” The US defence department urged the North to “refrain from provocative actions that aggravate tensions, and instead focus on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments”. “We are aware of the reports and are closely monitoring the situation on the Korean peninsula in coordination with our regional allies,” said Commander Bill Urban, a Pentagon spokesman. The UN sanctions target mineral exports and other key sectors of the North Korean economy, as well as requiring member states to inspect cargo shipments to and from the North that go via their ports. The measures, passed on Wednesday, are designed to limit North Korea’s ability to earn foreign currency, which it then uses to fund its nuclear and missile programmes. On Friday the Philippines coast guard announced it had detained a North Korean cargo ship that docked at the port of Subic Bay after arriving from Balembang, Indonesia. The MV Jin Teng was carrying a palm oil byproduct used as livestock food, Philippines authorities said. Nothing suspicious was found by inspectors and bomb sniffer dogs, but safety defects would need to be fixed before the vessel would be allowed to continue its journey to south-western China’s Zhanjiang port. The ship’s documents showed the cargo was for consignees in the Philippines and no new cargo would be loaded at Subic Bay, said coast guard Commander Raul Belesario. In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China, North Korea’s closest ally, hoped the UN sanctions would be implemented “comprehensively and seriously”, while harm to ordinary North Korean citizens would be avoided. At the United Nations, Russia’s ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, asked about the North’s firing of short-range projectiles, said: “It means that they’re not drawing the proper conclusions yet.” Japan’s UN ambassador, Motohide Yoshikawa, said: “That’s their way of reacting to what we have decided. They may do something more … so we will see.” While North Korea is believed to possess a small stockpile of nuclear warheads, most experts say the regime has yet to develop the technology to miniaturise them so they can be mounted on a missile. This is not the first time that Kim – who became leader in late 2011 after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il – has issued threats to the west. In 2013 he threatened a nuclear strike on the US mainland in response to sanctions imposed after North Korea carried out its third nuclear test and the US held its traditional joint military manoeuvres with South Korea – exercises that Pyongyang regards as a rehearsal for an invasion of the North. Dr Leonid Petrov, an expert on North Korea from the Australian National University, said Friday’s statement was not an idle threat. “North Korea is prepared to go a long way in this,” Petrov told Guardian Australia. “They believe it’s the only way they can protect their regime. The survival of the regime is the main concern for the North Korean leadership.” Petrov said the statement was intended to send a message to the UN security council, including formerly more friendly nations Russia and China. “I think North Korea [is] simply mirroring the US rhetoric that nuclear weapons may be used pre-emptively and that’s what North Korea believes they also have the right to do,” he said. Friday’s warning to the west came after North Korea fired a volley of short-range missiles into the sea off its east coast. This followed the UN security council’s unanimous decision to impose the toughest sanctions against the regime in two decades over its nuclear and rocket tests. North Korea has previously carried out live firing near or across its borders when facing international condemnation. Tilman Ruff, a Melbourne University academic and nuclear disarmament advocate, said that despite North Korea’s “really frightening and belligerent” threats he believed its programme to develop a bomb remained mostly a political tool. “I think the leadership would be cognisant of the fact that the military response that would follow any nuclear assault on their behalf would be the end of the regime and possibly take out most of the North Korean population,” he said. Tilman said that even if the regime had a proven long-range missile delivery system, the country’s nuclear weapons cache was small. “They have got probably less than 10 relatively crude nuclear weapons, in the global scale of 15,530 … that’s less than a 10th of a percent of the global nuclear arsenal,” he said. “I really do think that their nuclear programme is primarily about achieving political attention and trying to get the US attention in particular.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/sep/30/james-lovelock-interview-by-end-of-century-robots-will-have-taken-over","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-30T11:30:32Z","webTitle":"James Lovelock: ‘Before the end of this century, robots will have taken over’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/30/james-lovelock-interview-by-end-of-century-robots-will-have-taken-over","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/sep/30/james-lovelock-interview-by-end-of-century-robots-will-have-taken-over","fields":{"headline":"James Lovelock: ‘Before the end of this century, robots will have taken over’","bodyText":"James Lovelock’s parting words last time we met were: “Enjoy life while you can. Because if you’re lucky, it’s going to be 20 years before it hits the fan.” It was early 2008, and the distinguished scientist was predicting imminent and irreversible global warming, which would soon make large parts of the planet uninhabitably hot or put them underwater. The fashionable hope that windfarms or recycling could prevent global famine and mass migration was, he assured me, a fantasy; it was too late for ethical consumption to save us. Before the end of this century, 80% of the world’s population would be wiped out. His predictions were not easy to forget or dismiss. Sometimes described as a futurist, Lovelock has been Britain’s leading independent scientist for more than 50 years. His Gaia hypothesis, which contends that the earth is a single, self-regulating organism, is now accepted as the founding principle of most climate science, and his invention of a device to detect CFCs helped identify the hole in the ozone layer. A defiant generalist in an era of increasingly specialised study, and a mischievous provocateur, Lovelock is regarded by many as a scientific genius. Eight years after our previous encounter, he appears to have aged not one bit. At 97, he’s conceived a beautifully illustrated book of essays described as a “tool kit for the future”, The Earth and I, and written the introduction and conclusion; he goes walking every day, his hearing is perfect, his focus forensic and his memory unimpaired. “Yes, why not? I’m writing a fiction book at the moment. It’s tremendous fun, you know.” He applies his holistic philosophy of science to his own health. “I’m a firm believer that if you don’t use it, you lose it – and if you do a lot of walking, and if you use your muscles quite a bit, your brain seems to work as well. You’ve got to look at the whole system, not just bits of it.” What has changed dramatically, however, is his position on climate change. He now says: “Anyone who tries to predict more than five to 10 years is a bit of an idiot, because so many things can change unexpectedly.” But isn’t that exactly what he did last time we met? “I know,” he grins teasingly. “But I’ve grown up a bit since then.” Lovelock now believes that “CO2 is going up, but nowhere near as fast as they thought it would. The computer models just weren’t reliable. In fact,” he goes on breezily, “I’m not sure the whole thing isn’t crazy, this climate change. You’ve only got to look at Singapore. It’s two-and-a-half times higher than the worst-case scenario for climate change, and it’s one of the most desirable cities in the world to live in.” There are various possible explanations for his change of heart. One is that Lovelock is right, and the models on which his former predictions were based were fatally flawed. Another is that his iconoclastic sensibility made revision irresistible. An incorrigible subversive, Lovelock was warning the world about climate change for decades before it began to pay attention, and just when the scientific consensus began to call for intervention to prevent it, he decided we were already too late. But there is a third explanation for why he has shifted his position again, and nowadays feels “laid back about climate change”. All things being equal – “and it’s only got to take one sizable volcano to erupt and all the models, everything else, is right off the board” – he expects that before the consequences of global warming can impact on us significantly, something else will have made our world unrecognisable, and threaten the human race. Lovelock maintains that, unlike most environmentalists, he is a rigorous empiricist, but it is manifestly clear that he enjoys maddening the green movement. “Well, it’s a religion, really, you see. It’s totally unscientific.” He was once invited to Buckingham Palace, where he told Princess Anne: “Your brother nearly killed me.” Having read that Prince Charles had installed grass-burning boilers at Highgrove, Lovelock had tried one in his house. “It’s supposed to smoulder and keep the place warm; but it doesn’t, because it goes out, and clouds and clouds of smoke come out.” He giggles. “Princess Anne thought this was hilariously funny.” Lovelock had been trying to heat his old mill in Devon, where he lived for more than 35 years, inventing contraptions in a workshop that resembled a Doctor Who set. He and his wife recently packed up his life’s work and downsized to a remote cottage on Chesil Beach in Dorset, after the bill to heat the mill for just six months hit £6,000. “I remember George Monbiot took me up on it and wrote that it was impossible, that I had to be lying. But I wasn’t lying, I’ve got the figures.” Monbiot doesn’t quite accuse him of lying, in fairness; just of “talking rubbish” and “making wild statements”. In any case, he says that in the US he found he could heat a house for six months, in temperatures of -20C (-4F), for just £60. As a result, he has withering contempt for environmentalists’ opposition to fracking. “You see, gas in America is incredibly cheap, because of fracking,” he says. But what about the risk of triggering earthquakes? He rolls his eyes. “Sure enough, that’s true, there will be an increase. But they’re tiny little tremors, they would be imperceptible. The only trouble is that you can detect them. The curse of my life has been that I’ve spent a lot of time inventing devices that are exceedingly sensitive. And the moment somebody can detect something, they’re going to attach a number to it, and then they make a fuss about it.” He chuckles, then pauses. “I’m not anti-green in the sense that I’m in favour of polluting the world with every damn thing we make. I think we’ve got to be careful. But I’m afraid, human nature being what it is, the thing gets exaggerated out of all proportion, and the greens have behaved deplorably instead of being reasonably sensible.” Even more heretical than his enthusiasm for fracking is Lovelock’s passionate support for nuclear power. But, like fracking, he says, it offers only “a stopgap” solution. “Because in the long term, they’ll use up all the uranium.” How long would that take? He pauses to do some quick mental arithmetic, as casually as I might tot up how many pints of milk to grab from Sainsburys. “Let’s see … I think uranium that is affordable to extract would last about 50 years, something in that range. It might be 100. When you’ve used all that up, you go to thorium, and that would last you three times as long as uranium – so, shall we say, about 200 years?” The most sensible energy solution would be to cover 100 sq miles of the Sahara in solar panels. “It would supply the whole of Europe with all the energy they needed,” but it won’t happen “because it would be so easy for terrorists to go and bugger it up”. So for now, nuclear energy is the only viable option. But all this, he clarifies cheerfully, is more or less academic. “Because quite soon – before we’ve reached the end of this century, even – I think that what people call robots will have taken over.” Robots will rule the world? “Well, yes. They’ll be in charge.” In charge of us? “Yes, if we’re still here. Whether they’ll have taken over peacefully or otherwise, I have no idea.” He isn’t alone in this view: the influential philosopher Nick Bostrom has persuaded many people that artificial intelligence poses a real threat to the future of humanity; Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, among others, have called for urgent research to mitigate the risks. Still, when Lovelock outlines this vision, his tone is so matter-of-fact that for a moment I wonder if he’s joking. He isn’t. “We’re already happily letting computers design themselves. This has been going on for some time now, particularly with chips, and it’s not going to be long before that’s out of our hands, and we’ll be standing aside and saying, ‘Oh well, it’s doing a good job designing itself, let’s encourage it.’” Computers will develop independent volition and intuition (“To some extent, they already have”) and become capable of reproducing themselves, and of evolving. “Oh yes, that’s crucial. We’ll have a world where Darwin’s working.” Darwinism doesn’t work now? “Oh no, we’ve temporarily turned Darwinism backwards. I mean, we preserve the ones that would not have survived.” He pauses, and adds quickly: “Don’t let’s get dangerous on this one. I don’t want this appearing in the Guardian that he just wants all the dumb and the lowlifes wiped out.” Lovelock doesn’t sound the least bit troubled by the prospect of robots taking over, though, despite the possibility that they will destroy us. “Once they become at all established anywhere, that’s the end, because to robots time happens one million times faster – that’s a fairly exact figure – than it does to us. That’s rather wonderful in a way, isn’t it?” I ask him to explain. “Well, for a neuron to travel a foot takes a microsecond – which is fairly fast. But for electrons to go down a foot of wire takes a nanosecond. It’s a million times faster, as simple as that. So to a robot, once fully established in that new world, a second is a million seconds. Everything is happening so fast that they have on earth a million times longer to live, to grow up, to evolve, than we do.” It is possible, he goes on, that human beings may fuse with robots to become a blend of robotic and human tissue (“That’s one route”), but the likelier scenario will be pure robots. Why does he think we’ll go for all-out robots? He shoots me an amused look. “I don’t think we will. I think that they will – that’s the key thing here.” The implications for climate change are obvious. “The world that they’re going to be comfortable in is wildly different from the one that we feel comfortable in. So once they really get established, they will – with regret – start losing organic life.” Will they care about rising temperatures? “They won’t give a fourpenny fuck about the temperature, because to them the change will be slow, and they can stand quite a big change without any fuss. They could accommodate infinitely greater change through climate change than we can, before things get tricky for them. It’s what the world can stand that is the important thing. They’re going to have a safe platform to live in, so they don’t want Gaia messed about too much.” Notwithstanding his caveats about the dangers of predictions, his confidence in the robotic future he describes is “fairly high. Yes, all sorts of things can happen, but that’s the intuitive feeling I have”. As for our interaction with robots: “Well, it’s going to be very peculiar.” In the classic Frankenstein tradition, will humanity not understand what it has created until it’s too late? “Well, too late is the wrong word. Let’s say, until it has happened.” The phrase “too late”, he explains, implies regret – but whereas the robots might see no use for our continued existence, “maybe we’ve got some special property that they will appreciate. But then, don’t forget, their timescale is a million times different from ours. They’d have a lot of trouble talking to us.” In the same sense that we have trouble talking to ants? “Oh no, it’s much worse than that. It’s really more like us talking to a giant redwood tree. And you never know, they may feel about us the same way as we feel about trees.” They might even, I suggest, want to hug us? Lovelock’s face lights up in delight. “Yes, exactly! Exactly. That’s a good one.” Lovelock was no less bafflingly cheerful when he believed climate change was about to wipe out 80% of the world’s population. How can he now feel just as sanguine about a global takeover by robots? “One may say: ‘Well, of course, he’s so old he’s stopped having any feelings.’ Not true, I’ll say!” He would have been, he insists, just the same 50 years ago. “And I would hate to think it was an affectation.” He would rather not be called a maverick, because it makes him sound like someone who “makes gadgets in his garage”. “But everything in life to me is just: ‘Oh, isn’t that interesting?’” • The Earth and I by James Lovelock et al (Taschen, £24.99) is out now.

We unfurled some of those long-winded statements and took a closer look, issue by issue. On race and policing “We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very – I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.” Trump was endorsed last week by the Fraternal Order of Police, the nation’s largest union of rank-and-file officers, after eagerly courting the group. He met with leadership and completed an extensive questionnaire about his views, while Hillary Clinton demurred on both counts. His draconian plans have, however, alarmed many others in law enforcement. Earlier this year, a coalition of dozens of police chiefs and prosecutors from across the US urged Trump in an open letter to instead pursue a policy of reducing arrests and imprisoning fewer Americans. “Though this may seem counterintuitive, we know from our experience as law enforcement officials that over-relying on incarceration does not deter crime,” said the letter. “I think maybe there’s a political reason why you can’t say it, but I really don’t believe – in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. It’s hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?” New York City’s annual murder total did peak in 1990 at about 2,200, amid a crack cocaine epidemic and increased gun crime. It did fall sharply, however, under the Democratic mayor David Dinkins, who hired thousands more police officers and focused on the kind of “community policing” Hillary Clinton championed during the debate. This steep decline continued under Dinkins’s successor, Republican Rudolph Giuliani, who from 1994 ushered in an aggressive, data-driven form of policing including the “stop-and-frisk” tactic of halting and searching pedestrians for weapons or drugs on a lower standard of proof than the probable cause typically needed. Mayor Michael Bloomberg carried this on. Analysts, however, have not found clear evidence Giuliani-style policing was responsible for New York’s crime reduction. Crime fell elsewhere in the US through the 1990s during an economic boom. As the NYPD’s top spokesman pointed out during Monday’s debate, murder and violent crime continued to fall even as police drastically cut down on stops as a judge ruled in 2013 the tactic was being applied unconstitutionally. Murder numbers in New York did rise last year, as in other major cities, but are on course to fall again in 2016. Even in 2015, the total stood at 352 – 30% less than the 500 total Trump cites. JS On climate change Clinton: Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it’s real. Trump: I did not. I did not. I do not say that. Trump did say that in November 2012: “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.” In January, Trump was asked about this tweet and said “obviously I joke”, but his dismissal of climate science is consistent, if not always as outlandish as suggesting that it is a Chinese conspiracy. Climate change has been variously described by the real estate developer as a “hoax”, “bullshit” and a “canard”. She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one. Now, look, I’m a great believer in all forms of energy, but we’re putting a lot of people out of work. Trump is referencing Solyndra, a California-based manufacturer of solar cells that got a $535m federal government loan and then went bankrupt. The company is regularly touted by Republicans as evidence that the government shouldn’t subsidize clean energy (which somewhat ignores the enormous support received by fossil fuels). Trump has donned a miner’s helmet when campaigning in West Virginia, casting himself as a friend of coal and the key to its renaissance. But his promise to bring back coal jobs will be a tough one to keep, given the market, as well as environmental, obstacles it faces. OM On women “You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it’s said in entertainment. Some of it’s said – somebody who’s been very vicious to me, Rosie O’Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her. But you want to know the truth? I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ‘I can’t do it. I just can’t do it. It’s inappropriate. It’s not nice.’ But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. They’re untrue. And they’re misrepresentations. And I will tell you this, Lester, it’s not nice. And I don’t deserve that.” This was Trump’s response after Clinton dug into him for calling women “pigs, slobs, and dogs”, opposing equal pay laws, and mocking a Latina Miss Universe winner, Alicia Machado, by calling her “Miss Housekeeping” and “Miss Piggy”. Clinton’s campaign has spent millions – although not multiple hundreds of millions, not yet – on ads against Trump that are not very nice. But his claims that the ads are “untrue” are hard to square with the reality that many of Clinton’s ads almost exclusively consist of audio of Trump’s own remarks. On Tuesday morning, Trump explained what he meant by his cryptic remarks that he wanted to say “something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family”. “I was talking about the affairs – the many affairs that Bill Clinton had,” he said on Fox and Friends. “When she hit me at the end with the women, I was going to hit her with her husband’s women.” In that vein, in the run-up to Monday night’s debate, Trump threatened to invite Gennifer Flowers – famous for sleeping with Hillary’s husband in the 1980s – as his guest. Trump explained he held back because the Clintons’ daughter, Chelsea, was in the auditorium. Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Trump’s running mate, said on Tuesday he was “so proud” of Trump’s “restraint”. This also marks the second time, in a presidential debate, that Trump made excuses for his name-calling by saying he was talking about Rosie O’Donnell. In August 2015, when Fox News host Megyn Kelly asked Trump to explain why people should vote for someone who has called women “fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals”, Trump joked, “Only Rosie O’Donnell.” Trump clearly feels this to be exonerating. Last summer, as he faced criticism for his exchange with Kelly, Trump noted, “That was the biggest applause in the evening actually, so it was sort of interesting.” On Monday night, Trump endured Clinton’s accusations of sexism by muttering, “I never said that” and “I didn’t say that.” On Tuesday morning, Trump could be found gamely criticizing Machado’s weight on Fox News. MR On national security Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she’s very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their – they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. I looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, they’re old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not – we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike. I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it’s over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can’t take anything off the table. Russia is modernizing its nuclear forces, particularly with new intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuke-launching submarines. Both programs are years from completion and follow a generation-long lag in Russian military modernization following the collapse of the Soviet Union . By contrast, the Obama administration has begun a $1tn modernization of US nuclear forces – submarines, missiles and bombers – slated to last 30 years. The upgrade has caused major concern within the arms-control community. “The planned US investment in nuclear forces is unrivaled by any other nuclear power,” said Kingsman Reif, the director of disarmament at the Arms Control Association. Beyond that, Trump in three short sentences, reversed decades of declared US nuclear policy – and then appeared to reverse himself. “I certainly would not do first strike” is a commonsense position that the complexities of nuclear deterrence render a potentially catastrophic declaration, since it creates doubt among both allies and adversaries about the US’s commitment to its ultimate weapon. Nevertheless, it has been the undeclared policy of the United States for generations. Barack Obama reportedly mulled adopting the position Trump stated on Monday, only to have his cabinet secretaries express alarm at a shift that might worry allies located near a resurgent Russia and aggressive North Korea. The proposal appears dead within the Obama administration. But then Trump seemed to revert to the defense establishment’s consensus position, that being “prepared” for such a war represents the most effective deterrent to facing a nuclear holocaust. “I can’t take anything off the table” is a formation far more consistent with traditional US nuclear policy, though Trump’s diametrically opposed public musings on nuclear weapons raise new questions about how a President Trump would steward the US’s deadliest arsenal. SA On guns and the NRA The African American community – because – look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. They’ve been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that’s what it is. They’ve controlled these communities for up to 100 years. Conservatives often blame Democratic mayors when talking about “inner city” violence. But a FiveThirtyEight analysis of 2015 murder trends found murders rose in big cities led by both Democrats and Republicans, and that murders increased at about the same pace in both sets of cities. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I’m very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they’re protecting the second amendment. But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. The National Rifle Association has been one of Trump’s strongest supporters. The group opposes legislation that would simply bar people on government terror watch lists from buying guns – a position shared by the American Civil Liberties Union. Polls have found a majority of Americans support “no fly, no buy” legislation, even though groups on both the left and right have criticized the measure as an infringement of civil liberties. Does Trump agree with the NRA and the ACLU, or does he agree with Clinton that people on watch lists simply should not be allowed to buy guns? His comments last night were, once again, ambiguous. After the Orlando shooting at Pulse Nightclub, Trump tweeted he was going to meet with the NRA “about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no fly list, to buy guns”. Later, a Trump campaign spokeswoman said that Trump stands with the NRA on the issue, and the NRA’s chief lobbyist told ABC News “there is not a difference between what Mr Trump is saying and what the NRA’s position is. That’s a media-created diversion there”. LB On Isis She’s telling us how to fight Isis. Just go to her website. She tells you how to fight Isis on her website. I don’t think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much … See, you’re telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you’ve been fighting – no wonder you’ve been fighting Isis your entire adult life.” Trump accuses Clinton of giving away her strategy to Isis and claims that second world war general Douglas MacArthur, whom he often likes to cite, would not approve. He states Clinton had been fighting Isis all her adult life, even though she turned 18 in 1965 and Isis took on its present form in 2013. DS On cyber warfare I don’t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She’s saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don’t – maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK? Despite strong evidence linking Russia to the hack of the Democratic National Committee, Trump cannot resist mounting a defence of Moscow, and by extension President Vladimir Putin. He tries to muddy the waters by trying to blame China without a shred of proof and then, incomprehensibly, “somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds” – a remark that underlines his tendency to insult people who are overweight. We have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is – it is a huge problem. I have a son. He’s 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it’s unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it’s hardly doable. Yet another comment from the school of the surreal. Trump referencing his son unfortunately echoes Jimmy Carter who, in 1980, said he spoke about nuclear arms control with his 12-year-old daughter, asking her “what the most important issue was”.

The business secretary, Sajid Javid, said earlier this week that President Xi Jinping’s visit would increase trade and investment between Britain and China by £25bn; but the figure had leapt to £40bn by the time the prime minister spoke on Wednesday. No 10 officials remained coy throughout much of Friday about precisely how that figure had been arrived at, claiming repeatedly that full details would be published when the state visit had officially ended. A statement was finally released after 6pm, detailing a long list of deals, including a promise from Chinese firm HNA to buy £1.4bn-worth of Rolls-Royce jet engines, to be built in Derby; and £6bn worth of investment in the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant. But some of the agreements had a familiar ring about them. A £1bn memorandum of understanding about a “garden of ideas” – a pleasure garden to be built in China, in association with the Eden Project – appeared strikingly similar to a deal signed, in the presence of George Osborne, in 2014. Doubts were also raised about £6bn of investment “to help fund regenerative medicine and tissue engineering research with Oxford University” – apparently the same deal announced by the university earlier this week as worth just £1.5m. No 10 said this was based on the Chinese bank behind the investment pencilling in a total of £6bn. The decision by Chinese firm Sanpower, which owns House of Fraser, to open the department store’s first branches in China was first reported in April – and ultimately involves a Chinese investor, expanding in its own domestic market, albeit behind a British shopfront. Other items referred to Chinese cash “unlocking” investment, before apparently listing the total value of the project in question, for example: “Hualing’s investment will unlock three major regeneration projects in Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield with a combined gross development value of £1.2bn.” The government also trumpteted an announcement by BP that it would sell China’s Huadian Corporation up to 1m tonnes of liquid natural gas each year, valued at £6.5bn; but the income from it will be spread over two decades. The previous public statement from UKTI, the government’s trade and investment arm, referred to deals worth “£BILLIONS”, and press officers spent the day referring all enquiries to Downing Street. Osborne has been keen to secure fresh Chinese investment, including in his “northern powerhouse” project. On a recent trip to the city of Chengdu, he opened up what he called a “northern pitchbook”, encouraging firms to bid on everything from construction of the HS2 high-speed rail link, to a new science park in Newcastle. But the welcome accorded to the Chinese delegation was particularly controversial, taking place against the backdrop of thousands of job cuts in a steel industry which blames Chinese cut-price competition for its demise. Other deals that had been highlighted during the trip, including a commitment by BBC Worldwide to make a number of programmes including a Chinese version of the long-running series Coast, were not listed by the government because of, “commercial sensitivities or confidentiality”. Speaking at the UK-China business summit earlier in the week at which many of the deals were signed, Javid said: “A forum like this where business leaders from both countries can come together and make deals for our mutual benefit is greatly rewarding for the prosperity of all our people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2015/dec/22/public-services-christmas-chief-executive","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-22T12:32:11Z","webTitle":"Christmas high tide has Suffolk council chief executive on standby","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/dec/22/public-services-christmas-chief-executive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2015/dec/22/public-services-christmas-chief-executive","fields":{"headline":"Christmas high tide has Suffolk council chief executive on standby","bodyText":"On Christmas Day, Stephen Baker will, all being well, enjoy a family Christmas lunch at his home just outside Ipswich. But there will be one intrusive presence at the meal: Baker’s Blackberry will be on the table. That’s because Baker, chief executive of two district councils, Suffolk Coastal and Waveney, is on call for the possibility of coastal floods. Christmas Day this year will see very high tides along the whole Suffolk coast, all part of Baker’s patch, stretching from Lowestoft to Felixstowe, the largest container port in the UK. On Christmas Day, high tide at the pretty seaside town of Aldeburgh will be just before lunch. It will be as high as 2.7m – two metres less than the maximum high tide for the town. “A high tide is forecast on Christmas Day, which means that if we also have an area of low pressure and onshore winds, we could have a problem,” explains Baker. Just two years ago, in 2013, Suffolk suffered flooding that Baker describes as devastating. Several streets in Lowestoft town centre were flooded, with people having to move out of their houses and businesses facing big losses, including the new branch of Wetherspoons, which had only just opened. But it’s not just towns that are under threat along the Suffolk coast. The county has many small hamlets and villages along its shores and inland that are also at risk: Snape, home to the music venue Snape Maltings, was flooded in 2013. In all, there are 118 towns and parishes in the huge rural hinterland of Suffolk, which also contains the Sizewell nuclear power station right on the coast at Leiston, between Aldeburgh and Southwold. If Baker’s Blackberry does go off on Christmas Day, it will be one event in a sequence of well-planned responses to an emergency. There’s no individual emergency planning officers in Baker’s two district councils, but the county council runs a joint emergency planning unit and when there are crises such as a major flood, there’s a clear chain of response that links up all the different agencies involved. It’s the Environment Agency’s job to monitor flood risk from main rivers, reservoirs, estuaries and the sea; if there is a flood, the agency will alert local police. In Suffolk, strategic command centre is at the force’s HQ in Martlesham, just outside Ipswich, so Baker, if needed, will leave the family turkey and drive over to the HQ. While the police and other emergency services attend to the immediate needs, to make sure people are safe and property and businesses are protected, it’s the job of local government to run the longer-term recovery and response. As chief executive, Baker is on hand from the start of any major emergency. One of the challenges for him and his team is that, unlike the emergency services, they are not usually resourced for 24-hour working. “In 2013, as it happens, although I have two directors who should be able to take over from me, one was sick and the other was on the verge of being sick,” he explains. “So I pulled a straight 24-hour shift. Then one of our directors was able to come in, which gave me eight hours for some sleep before I went back. You obviously have to be there for as long as it takes.” Baker, who is also deputy spokesperson on civil resilience for Solace, the association of local authority chief executives, says most people don’t realise the huge role played by councils, who step in once the police and other blue-light services have moved on to deal with other emergencies. “The burden on local authorities is immense. It takes absolutely ages in the aftermath of floods and other emergencies. I really feel for colleagues in Cumbria,” says Baker. The financial burden is also huge, according to Baker. While there is a formula that provides compensation to local government from central funds for emergency response, the recovery phase is a “different kettle of fish” he says. Recovery takes much longer and the costs involved can be hard to quantify. “I don’t think people understand what councils or their chief executives do, partly because it is so varied,” he says. “We could and perhaps should be smarter about branding. But our focus is always on the community and on helping people get back into their homes and businesses.” Baker is hoping that this year, his Christmas lunch won’t be interrupted. But if it is, he and his team have learned one small lesson from the floods of 2013. This year, council workers will be wearing high-vis jackets with their council logos clearly on show, just to let people know that the flood response comes from all local services. And so they know who to hold to account, as well.

Of course they can. The Chinese government has just dramatically reduced the price by dumping. The Saudi government in the past raised the price of oil by restricting supply. It is called power, or monopoly, and you get more power by destroying competitors’ industries. I once thought Sajid Javid must be knowledgeable about business. I now doubt it. Ernie Kirkbride Whitby, North Yorkshire • Nils Pratley’s analysis of Hinkley Point was good (22 October) but he failed to appreciate the full impact of using CPI to determine the future price of electricity generated. If the price of oil were to rise to $150 per barrel, inflation goes up and so does the price Hinkley Points can charge. A win-win situation if you are Chinese. Poor value for the rest of us. Rob Wilson Chorley, Lancashire • Does Henry Stewart (Letters, 20 October) mean to suggest that because Britain colluded with the United States in the illegal invasion of Iraq and related human rights violations, such as facilitating “renditions”, that there are no grounds for British citizens now to protest against the human rights violations record of the Chinese government? Surely he doesn’t wish to suggest that the wrongs of one time obviate the wrongs of another time? Jane Tienne Cambridge • If privatisation and free enterprise is so great, as Tory ideology insists, why are they forced to turn to China’s state-directed economy and the French state-owned EDF energy company to build the £18bn Hinkley Point nuclear power station? Sasha Simic London • Your heading China’s economic growth rate slows to six-year low (20 October) in the third quarter of this year is correct, but it is also true that the country’s GDP increased by more in that quarter than in the second. The 6.9% recorded has to be based on the 107.1 of the preceding period which gives a figure of 7.4%. Harvey Cole Winchester, Hampshire • Can we please have a picture of Dave buying a round with some of the steelworkers at Scunthorpe/Motherwell/Clydebridge/Teesdale in the local (ex?) working men’s club. John Cooper Youlgreave, Derbyshire • The 2006 white paper on Trident said we need it to protect our vital interests. So we will renew Trident at a cost of £100bn and give over our vital interests to the Chinese and the French. Weird (There’s outrage over steel but we should be furious over solar, 23 October). Jim McCluskey Twickenham, Middlesex • I note that David Cameron bought President Xi a pint of Greene King IPA in a visit to a pub near Chequers on Thursday evening (Report, 23 October). Perhaps in sharing a pint of India Pale Ale, originally brewed at least in part for consumption in India when it was part of the empire, a point was being made about imperial ambitions. Particularly as the Greene King version is somewhat lower in strength and underpowered in hoppiness compared to traditional versions of the beer.

Unlike in the previous days’ activities, red is not featuring prominently – he’s visiting the ground of Manchester City, not his reported favourite team, Manchester United, the Red Devils. But there’s been a definitive colour scheme to the rest of the visit. There have been many red carpets Xi has been courted at Downing Street, attended a lavish state banquet in his honour hosted by the Queen, and spent two nights at Buckingham Palace. There have been red flags On the first day of his visit, Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan were whisked down the Mall in the Queen’s diamond jubilee state coach. The road was lined with hundreds of pro-China demonstrators, many in coordinated outfits from mysteriously marked boxes, and waving red China flags. There have been red uniforms The opening ceremony to welcome Xi to Britain saw him inspect a guard of honour at Horse Guards Parade. There have been red decorations The floral arrangements at the Guildhall banquet were on point – on the day David Cameron announced a £6bn deal had been reached with China General Nuclear Power Corporation for a nuclear plant at Hinkley Point, Somerset. There have been coordinated red outfits The home secretary, Theresa May, greeted Xi in a matching ensemble of red shoes, red dress and red hat. Cameron’s tie did not appear to get the memo. Even more coordinated red outfits The state banquet in Xi’s honour at Buckingham Palace was the first one to be attended by the Duchess of Cambridge – and Kate’s outfit was very on-message. And there have been pints of ... Greene King There was no Red Stripe on offer when Cameron and Xi popped into a pub near the prime minister’s retreat at Chequers. The leaders’ choices were pints of Greene King IPA, though they might have enjoyed it more by leaving it to settle. Anyone would think the UK was really trying hard to make Xi feel importantIn speeches to dignitaries at Buckingham Palace and to MPs and peers at the Palace of Westminster, Xi took many opportunities to remind his audience that the UK and China were becoming “increasingly interdependent”. At the Queen’s banquet, he used a similar phrase: “With growing interdependence and interwoven interests, countries in the world are increasingly becoming a community of shared future.” But one thing the government says it is definitely not doing, is kowtowing to China in order to get £30bn David Cameron does not agree with his former adviser Steve Hilton that Xi’s visit is “the worst national humiliation since we went cap in hand to the IMF in the 1970s”. Nor with China expert James McGregor, who warned: “If you act like a panting puppy, the object of your attention is going to think they have got you on a leash.” There’s no room for getting red-faced over China’s human rights record, or the steel industry Cameron promised he would raise the issue of job losses at UK steel plants, blamed in part on cheaper Chinese imports, as well as the country’s chequered human rights record, but said those would be part of “many issues” to discuss. It fell to the BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, the only UK journalist granted a question at the press conference with the leaders, to grill the Chinese president on the issues. “Is there any price that is worth paying in order to further our business interests with China?” she asked. Britain is going into closer relations with China with its ‘eyes wide open’, insists the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond.

Despite having suffered near-wipeout at the general election, the Lib Dems are claiming to be optimistic about their chances of rebuilding support because Labour is taking a firm swing to the left under Jeremy Corbyn. Farron used a rally on Saturday night to appealed to liberal-minded members of other parties to find a new home in the Lib Dems, although he has backtracked on earlier suggestions that disheartened Labour MPs could soon defect. “If Labour aren’t interested in standing up to the Tories and providing a credible opposition, that’s their funeral,” he said. “The Liberal Democrats will fill that space. Radical and liberal and responsible too. When the tectonic plates of politics move, they sometimes move immensely quickly – that is what is happening now. “These are momentous and historic times, history calls us, we will answer that call. Britain needs a party that is progressive, moderate and liberal. We are that party. This is our moment.” Meanwhile, Sir Vince Cable, the former business secretary, has called for Labour moderates to unite with the Lib Dems to create a new political force on the centre left. He even suggested an “avalanche” of Labour MPs could split off and join together with his party. However, Labour MPs, including John Woodcock, chairman of the moderate Progress group, have rubbished the idea that any centrists will cross the floor. The theme of the Bournemouth conference is the Lib Dem “fightback” as the party claims to have gained 20,000 new members since the election and to have unexpectedly won a few more councillors in byelections over the summer. However, Farron faces an extreme uphill challenge given the scale of Lib Dem losses at the election, when the party under Nick Clegg struggled to win over centrist voters by promising “a stronger economy and a fairer society”. The party has just eight MPs and got only 8% of the vote, coming fourth, way behind Ukip. Farron could now face a further loss of support to Labour because of Corbyn’s liberal position on immigration, surveillance and human rights. The new Labour leader also has a strong record on wanting to scrap tuition fees, abolish Trident and oppose nuclear power – all issues on which the Liberal Democrats compromised in coalition. On top of that, Farron is at risk of leaking support to the Tories among centrists worried about the prospect of a more leftwing Labour party gaining power in 2020. The new leader will also have a harder time gaining media attention now that his parliamentary representation has shrunk so significantly. Already, the Conservatives and the SNP have been questioning why the House of Commons needs to go on holiday during Lib Dem conference given its relevance to just eight MPs. A Conservative minister said it was raised privately with David Cameron and he is understood to be sympathetic to the complaints but felt it would be too mean to deal his former coalition partners such a blow this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/video/2013/oct/28/nuclear-power-solution-energy-needs-debate-video","type":"video","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-28T09:00:00Z","webTitle":"Is nuclear power the solution to our energy needs? – five-minute video debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2013/oct/28/nuclear-power-solution-energy-needs-debate-video","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/video/2013/oct/28/nuclear-power-solution-energy-needs-debate-video","fields":{"headline":"Is nuclear power the solution to our energy needs? – five-minute video debate","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/20/nuclear-power-station-hinkley-edf","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-21T07:32:00Z","webTitle":"Hinkley nuclear power station gets go-ahead as coalition signs off EDF deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/20/nuclear-power-station-hinkley-edf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/20/nuclear-power-station-hinkley-edf","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley nuclear power station gets go-ahead as coalition signs off EDF deal","bodyText":"Britain is to embark on building its first nuclear power station for two decades on Monday as the coalition hands a multibillion subsidy to France's EDF with help from a state-owned Chinese firm. The two planned pressurised water reactors at Hinkley Point C, Somerset, are the first to start construction in Europe since Japan's Fukushima disaster and the first in the UK since the Sizewell B power station came online in 1995. The new reactors, which will cost £14bn, are due to start operating in 2023 if constructed on time and will run for 35 years. They will be capable of producing 7% of the UK's electricity – equivalent to the amount used by 5m homes. After months of delay, the news came as the coalition has come under intense pressure over rising electricity bills. British Gas and SSE have both announced price rises for customers of close to 10% and Ed Miliband's promise to freeze energy bills has struck a chord with voters. There are expected to be further rises announced by the big six energy companies this week. Over the weekend the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, waded into the row over energy prices, warning that the latest wave of hikes looks inexplicable. Welby, a former oil executive, insisted the big six energy companies had an obligation to behave morally rather than just maximising profit. \"They have control because they sell something everyone has to buy. We have no choice about buying it,\" he told the Mail on Sunday. \"With that amount of power comes huge responsibility to serve society.\" The guaranteed subsidies promised by the government for Hinkley Point C will lead to accusations that ministers are loading a further cost on spiralling energy prices by again requiring British taxpayers to subsidise nuclear power. The coalition counters that similar subsidies are going to other carbon-free industries such as renewables and that the country needs the energy security and steady base load that nuclear provides. Gas prices, although relatively low, are predicted to rise. Britain is taking a sharply different route to Germany, which has decided to phase out nuclear power, and Italy, which has scrapped a planned nuclear programme. France, traditionally the nuclear enthusiast, has pledged to cut atomic power to 50% of its electricity mix from 75% today. The strike price – the guaranteed rate to be paid for electricity produced at the Somerset site – will be announced as £92.50 per megawatt hour on Monday, following two years of complex negotiations. That is nearly twice the market price of energy. The price is guaranteed for 35 years and will rise in line with inflation. EDF was thought to have started negotiations demanding a figure of £100, with the Treasury's gambit being £80. The price will fall to £89.50 if EDF presses ahead with a second plant at Sizewell, Suffolk. Chancellor George Osborne removed another obstacle last week when he announced that Chinese firms would be allowed to invest in civil nuclear projects in the UK. Ministers will come under twin attack from green groups, both for endangering safety and providing subsidy, as well as from enthusiasts for shale gas for failing to put their faith in cheap gas, currently nearly half the cost of nuclear. The energy secretary, Ed Davey, is preparing to counter green groups by arguing that onshore or offshore wind could not fill the energy gap created by the decommissioning of the first wave of power stations. By some estimates, Hinkley Point C will generate the equivalent output of 6,000 onshore wind turbines. EDF's longtime partner, China General Nuclear Power Group, possibly in combination with China National Nuclear Corporation, is expected to have a 30% to 40% stake in the consortium, with Areva taking another 10%, according to French weekend newspaper reports. The deal is thought to provide a 10% return on EDF's investment. The coalition policy is being led by the Liberal Democrats – the party that had, in principle, opposed nuclear power right up until its party conference in September. The deal is a huge gamble for both the government and EDF, since projecting the state of the electricity market and wholesale prices 35 years ahead is fraught with risk. Michael Fallon, the Conservative energy minister, signalled another review of the green subsidies imposed on energy firms, but Davey said: \"It only takes a GCSE in maths to recognise that green subsidies are not pushing up prices. It is a fact that 47 % of energy prices come from wholesale prices and they have risen 50% in five years.\" • This article was amended on 21 October 2013. An earlier version said that 7% of the UK's electricity was enough to power 7m homes. The correct figure is 5m. It was further amended on 22 October 2013 to clarify that the strike price of £92.50 is per megawatt hour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2016/aug/07/nasa-secret-art-studio-rocket-science-jet-propulsion-laboratory","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-07T12:00:02Z","webTitle":"Nasa's secret art studio: how to make rocket science beautiful","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/aug/07/nasa-secret-art-studio-rocket-science-jet-propulsion-laboratory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2016/aug/07/nasa-secret-art-studio-rocket-science-jet-propulsion-laboratory","fields":{"headline":"Nasa's secret art studio: how to make rocket science beautiful","bodyText":"If you’ve marveled at space news recently, there’s a good chance it’s thanks to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This arm of Nasa is responsible for the most ambitious of missions, like sending robots to Mars and, most recently, the Juno spacecraft to Jupiter. But the JPL has another under-the-radar mission: uniting two uncommon bedfellows – design and science – in new and meaningful ways. You’ve probably never heard of the Studio at JPL, a group of rocket-science misfits who roam the facilities, offering their not-so-traditional design skills to engineers. You’ve definitely never seen their digs, a trailer on the outskirts of campus that looks like a science fair exploded on the inside. But you may have already seen their work. The studio comprises eight jacks-of-all-trades who have experience in sci-fi movie effects, anthropology, advertising, architecture and illustration, among others. They work like freelance contractors, usually juggling at least five projects apiece. For example, Joby Harris has created models of Saturn’s moon, Enceladus, and sketched out space helmet designs. And Liz Barrios recently helped an international team of scientists visualize what the surface of a comet would look like for the Rosetta spacecraft landing. (Turns out, the texture of pancakes is a very close comparison.) The team is also tasked with quietly sprinkling scientifically accurate awe all over the JPL. In the nondescript building number 180, for instance, there’s a sculpture – a column composed of plastic rods that stands about 15 feet high – set to dramatic effect alongside the words, “Dare Mighty Things.” Every few minutes, bars of light, varying in size, drip from above and shoot up from below the column. It’s reminiscent of a particularly active glowworm cave. In reality, it’s the beating heart of JPL’s work. The sculpture pulls data from a nearby building in the dark room of Mission Control. There, neat desks are arranged audience-style, facing ever-updating screens displaying the real-time activities of the 13 antennae in the Deep Space Network (DSN). The sculpture is displaying data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), which exchanges information with the Wall-E-esque Curiosity rover. When an engineer in Mission Control types directions on a keyboard, Curiosity will do what it’s told. It will then send the data it collects back to the MRO high above the surface of Mars, which sends it to the antenna DSS 55 in Madrid, Spain, which sends it back to Mission Control in Pasadena, which sends a stream of light shooting down the length of the sculpture in building 180. All of this in real time, with only the delay of about 15 minutes that it takes for the data to travel 33.9 million miles from Mars to Earth. The JPL is full of unassuming wonders like that – in this case, and in many others, thanks to the studio. The JPL’s sprawling Pasadena, California, facilities resemble a very high-tech college campus, especially during summer intern season, when I went to visit. For space enthusiasts, it’s more like Disney World. Every year, the lab welcomes about 50,000 visitors for free tours, complete with mini museums and 3D glasses. The visitor map looks like the brochure of a Hollywood studio backlot tour. Even the interesting facts shared with visitors align with a movie-script version of Nasa: maybe you’ve heard about the lucky jar of peanuts that must make an appearance in Mission Control at every launch. Or the “rocket boys” who founded the lab by blowing things up in an isolated arroyo. In part because of its untraditional beginnings, and in part because it’s the only arm of Nasa that is managed by a private organization (the California Institute of Technology), the JPL’s culture has always been a little more freewheeling and entrepreneurial. This could explain why, in 2003, Elachi decided to hire an art student and set him loose on campus. Elachi had given a tour to Art Center president Richard Koshalek, who told Elachi that he needed an artist to share JPL’s complex work with laymen. “At the time, it was a fairly radical idea that we would need people from Art Center or similar places to help us communicate,” says Steve Matousek, who worked with Goods and team on a successful mission proposal in 2003. But Koshalek already had a student in mind. That student was Dan Goods, an artist with close-cropped hair and a notably even-keeled, humble manner. “I told him he had one year to demonstrate what he can do,” Elachi says. “Within a few months he was so popular and in-demand that we gave him the green light to expand his group.” The studio’s work is arguably unique in all of Nasa, and inarguably represents a shift in thinking that’s happening in other small pockets – bringing art and science together on a more equal plane. Studio designers create art, yes, but they also contribute to the science happening at Nasa. “Science and design aren’t typically used in the same sentence, but they should be,” says Amanda Phingbodhipakkiya. The neurologist-turned-designer recently created The Leading Strand to unite designers with scientists on similarly equal grounds. “Science is highly complex, and design as a field elucidates complex information. Designers try to understand by making systems, using color, conveying emotion. Scientists have their scientific process. In the end it’s all very creative.” There’s no typical type of person who works at the studio, and there’s no typical day. Generally, members are working on project requests from engineers. Maybe they have a big-picture logistical problem they’re trying to think through, or they want to share their work with the public, or they just want a better-designed place to hang out. “It’s usually people coming to us, for all sorts of reasons,” Goods says. The studio also creates art to communicate JPL’s work to the public, but it’s more immersive than the art Nasa has commissioned in the past, by the likes of Norman Rockwell or Annie Leibovitz. The Studio’s take is usually somewhere between an art installation, a public monument and an interactive museum exhibit. When the Rosetta spacecraft landed on the 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko comet in 2014, the studio commissioned STUDIOKCA, an architecture and design firm, to create a 12-foot-long glowing sculpture, complete with a “tail” of water vapor that grew just as a real comet’s tail would. Another installation, the Orbit Pavilion, also designed by STUDIOKCA, will be on display at California’s Huntington library starting in October. There, visitors sit beneath a massive nautilus-shaped metal structure and listen to satellites passing overhead as if they were airplanes. “We want to give people a sense of urgency about what we do,” Goods says. The Studio does this for Nasa employees as well. There’s a digital counter next to the elevators in building 180, displaying three rows of numbers: how many planets have possibly been detected around other stars, how many have been confirmed as detected, and how many are in the habitable Goldilocks Zone that could support life. “Now, we take a picture of this and send it to Nasa headquarters every month,” Goods says. “That’s how they update how many planets they’ve found.” In another building, we approached a small meeting room labeled Left Field, “a brainstorming war room kind of place”, as Goods describes it. It’s where designers consult with engineers who must pitch potential missions to Nasa board members, down to cost estimates. That’s tricky because JPL’s missions usually involve, say, sending a spacecraft to Jupiter, arriving 10 years from now. In 2003, Matousek asked Goods to help pitch his proposal for just that journey – the Juno mission – to Nasa review board members. The team brought a cohesive aesthetic to mission proposals, asked guiding questions, and created models to demonstrate that ambitious plans, like a huge solar panel, were in fact realistic. “The studio takes something that seems hard to understand or difficult, but when you step away or get in the middle of what they designed, you go, Ah, of course! And the idea hits home,” Matousek says. Their pitch emerged victorious. In July, Juno entered Jupiter’s orbit, sticking to the proposal Matousek and Goods worked on 11 years ago, including the cost. “We’re not going to solve their differential equations,” Goods says. But Studio designers can tell when engineers aren’t on the same page, and they aren’t afraid to ask “stupid” questions to help the engineers “think through their thinking” – a motto of the studio. “They kind of have a permission, a freedom, to say things they wouldn’t normally say,” Goods says. “They start to talk about what they work on in different ways, especially when we ask a bunch of questions their peers don’t ask.” The designers are also rigorous about understanding the science: there are no artistic liberties when you’re demonstrating the feasibility of a $750m mission. With this meeting of the minds, the JPL’s complicated work can better hit two notes – compelling storytelling and accurate, well-though-out science. That’s critical for the federally funded JPL, if only for the practical reason of maintaining budget. “We’re spending the public’s money and they deserve to know that we’re doing something really great with it, and that this is about furthering humanity,” says studio member David Delgado. Still, ask any studio member why their job is important, and their answer will probably include another word: awe. “One of my favorite moments was when I showed a bunch of scientists one of the pieces I’d done,” Delgado says. “He told me: ‘You’ve reminded me why I’m here.’” If there were ever a time since the Space Race when Nasa needed to maintain, rather than create, high public interest – it’s now. Goods gives some credit to movies like The Martian that seem to say, “The future is here.” The technology looks more attainable; the concepts of space tourism and colonization mirror efforts that are really taking place from Nasa to SpaceX. The Studio team has seen the same enthusiasm for their own public campaigns, like a series of exoplanetary travel posters. But they are readying for big changes in the next year. Elachi, whom Goods credits with “taking a leap of faith” on him 13 years ago, retired at the end of June. In 2017, Nasa is due for a new decadal survey, a report from the National Research Council that outlines what the agency’s priorities should be in the next 10 years. Not to mention, the new president of the United States can also dictate America’s space priorities for the next four years. “When I first got here, we were going to go to Jupiter with nuclear power, create big telescopes in space to look for planets around other stars,” Goods says. “When George W Bush came in, he wanted to go to the moon and to Mars. Those other things got canceled. You can have an idea and then it’s no longer important for a decade. You just have to decide how you can best help.” As Goods and I stood watching beams of light shoot from Voyager 1 in building 180, two VIP visitors entered the building – guests of Elachi. The visitors stood admiring the sculpture as their guide greeted Goods. “Dan is the guy who created this,” she told the guests, as a staccato stream of light erupted from the column – data from Mars. Just another small wonder at the JPL."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/feb/10/trident-renewal-labour-corbyn-unilateralism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-10T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"Trident really is a destructive weapon – just look at the Labour party | Rafael Behr","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/10/trident-renewal-labour-corbyn-unilateralism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/10/trident-renewal-labour-corbyn-unilateralism","fields":{"headline":"Trident really is a destructive weapon – just look at the Labour party","bodyText":"A debate about nuclear weapons and national security should be hard to trivialise, yet Labour is somehow managing it. For a party that recently governed the country to look so ridiculous in the handling of something so serious demonstrates virtuosity in self-defeat. It is an ensemble performance, with some especially inept solos. On Monday night, Labour MPs heard Emily Thornberry, the shadow defence secretary, set out her position on Trident. A cold reception turned increasingly hostile, with murmurs and heckles of dissent. Some were appalled by what they judged to be her flimsy technical grasp of the brief; most were unpersuaded by the suggestion that a third way between renewal and unilateral disarmament might be available. Thornberry’s deployment of the Spitfire as an analogy for obsolescent military technology attracted particular scorn. Her defenders say she was making sensible points about clever new anti-submarine drone capability, that she was wilfully misinterpreted and discourteously treated. To the latter charge, MPs reply that the greater discourtesy was expressed in the absence from the room of Jeremy Corbyn, whose dogged insistence on changing Labour policy on this issue is the reason there is an issue at all. It is not surprising that Corbyn missed the meeting. He does not like conflict. But his engagement elsewhere did not help persuade MPs that dialogue or compromise were available. In any case, on Trident, talk of compromise is specious. Corbyn believes that Britain should not, as a point of principle, control the means to unleash atomic Armageddon. A large section of Labour members agree with him. The bulk of the party’s MPs do not. They see the maintenance of a nuclear deterrent as a cornerstone of national defence and a duty in accordance with Britain’s international alliances. There is no middle path between those positions, and efforts to navigate one lead to absurdity. David Cameron has made great sport in parliament sinking the notion, briefly floated by Corbyn, that new submarines could still be built – thereby avoiding dockyard redundancies – and put to sea without their monstrous ballistic payload. The launch of this cockamamie idea, even for a fleeting excursion in the open water of public debate, revealed two things about the Labour leader’s position on Trident. First, his ambition to be rid of it has little to do with cost savings. Naturally, when global peace has been achieved, defence budgets will be reallocated to build hospitals and schools. But in the meantime the Labour leader can be persuaded to buy expensive military hardware, as long as it fires blanks. Second, Corbyn listens a lot more keenly to trade union leaders than to Labour MPs. The only argument that appears to have moderated his passion for scrapping Trident is the one delivered by GMB and Unite, whose members’ jobs would be sacrificed, and whose donations keep Labour solvent. None of these calculations really explains why Trident is causing Labour such deep internal trauma. As with so many points of conflict between Corbyn and his MPs, the underlying tension is over the question of who Labour is meant to represent in opposition. The parliamentary “moderate” caucus considers itself mandated by general election voters and measures Labour’s performance according to their verdict. That was harsh last May and getting harsher if opinion polls and MPs’ accounts of constituency door-knocking are any guide. But Corbyn takes his mandate from Labour members, whose number has grown as a direct consequence of his election. So where MPs think about arresting a decline, their leader sees himself building on a success. Many MPs see scrapping Trident as something more than a bad defence policy. They see it as a wilful surrender of any ambition to engage with voters who abandoned the party in 2010 and 2015. They see it as a symbolic recantation of changes that Neil Kinnock and then Tony Blair made to bring policy closer to the instincts of the electorate; weird atonement for the sin of caring what people who have voted Conservative might think about Labour. By contrast, Corbyn’s supporters justifiably expect their views on nuclear disarmament to be expressed as policy. It is, after all, their party. Some may not care that this risks alienating nonaligned voters, believing that submission of principle to electoral arithmetic is intrinsically corrupt and that honourable defeat is worthier than tainted victory. Others believe it is possible to assemble a winning coalition of people who already lean left – Greens, Liberal Democrats, nonvoters who are just one more anti-austerity march away from political awakening– thereby obviating the need to proselytise the heathen Tory. This is not a factional or even an ideological division. It is a rivalry between two different conceptions of what a political party is supposed to be. In that contest Labour’s pro-Trident MPs are snookered. They may have some residual support in the membership, but that is hard to measure and the opposing camp is much more vocal and better organised. They have arguments about electability and the views of the median voter. Those claims are meretricious without a grounding in principle. They could marshal principled arguments about Britain’s status as a global power and deterrence as a guarantor of peace for generations, but that puts them on side with the Tories, and so compromises their integrity in the eyes of left purists. When the Commons votes on Trident, possibly within weeks, a comfortable majority will back renewal. If Corbyn tries to whip his MPs against, many will rebel. Shadow ministers may resign. The battle will then move to the terrain of whether the party should commit to unilateralism in its next manifesto. And everything about the conduct of that debate will accelerate Labour’s spiral away from power because it won’t really be a big, new strategic argument about the future of national defence, and whether Britain should be a nuclear power. It will be an old, parochial little bicker about the party’s torrid history and whether Labour really cares what the majority of people in Britain think. Watching the spectacle unfold from the outside, most people will fairly presume that it doesn’t."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global/2016/apr/19/guardian-weekly-letters-refugees-tax","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-19T10:59:22Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 22 April 2016","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/apr/19/guardian-weekly-letters-refugees-tax","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2016/apr/19/guardian-weekly-letters-refugees-tax","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 22 April 2016","bodyText":"Refugee crisis: for whom? The Guardian Weekly has been exemplary in reporting on the refugee crisis (15 April). But does that mean that it is the refugees who have caused the crisis? Or is it a European crisis? Or hands up who has not muddied the waters in this crisis? I have a simple equation for working out which countries should take the refugees. Take the number of refugees – say roughly 4 million – and divide it by the number of countries who have bombed Syria; supplied arms to the regime, rebels or Isis; harboured any of the protagonists; or allowed other countries’ military to operate in their territory. Let’s say 20 countries are involved. That’s 200,000 refugees each. If the refugees are genuinely horrified by being sent to any of those countries, then such countries should simply foot the bill for their sanctuary in another country. This would be a huge relief for Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, who between them have around 2 million refugees. What about independent arms suppliers? I am pretty sure that most refugees would not want to live with them, so how about they foot the bill for refugees in the poorest countries – one supplier per country. What a great deterrent this could be. Gaynor McGrath Armidale, NSW, Australia • I note that UN officials and representatives of organisations such as Amnesty International are quick to declare that the EU plan to return “refugees” to Turkey “could be” illegal (8 April). It is also the case that these opinions could be nonsense. A refugee is defined in law as someone who is afraid to reside in their country of citizenship because of the probability of persecution arising from various prescribed forms of discrimination. The so-called refugees in this case have travelled to Greece from Turkey, not from their country of citizenship, and therefore have passed through a country that is a signatory to the UN convention relating to the status of refugees. Their attempt to enter the EU from what should be a safe country (Turkey) is not therefore motivated by fear of persecution but by a desire to seek a better life. If there is a problem with Turkey returning genuine refugees to their country of origin (something that is absolutely prohibited by the UN conventions), then the UN and Amnesty International should be venting their wrath at Turkey to force it to live up to its obligations, and not at the EU. Alan Williams-Key Madrid, Spain We must share tax burden In the feature on the minimum wage increase in Britain and its probable effect on the shadow economy (Middle class cash-in-hand employers ‘unlikely to pay minimum wage’, 8 April), you also refer in the last paragraph to the “shadow work and pensions secretary, Owen Smith”. Is he, I wonder, tasked with oversight of the shadow economy? Irony unintentional I’m sure, but it raises an issue widely ignored in such discussions: to what extent is such economic activity hidden both from the taxman and the public? A parallel issue: to what extent do many western economies depend on a largely hidden and often illegal migrant workforce? In the light of the current revelations about the level of tax avoidance practised by a great many major corporations, perhaps the question we should all be asking is: how can we ensure that the burden of taxation is shared equally between all sectors of society? Clearly the load falls mainly on the middle-income employee who has little or no opportunity to hide his assets. With the ever-increasing burdens of an ageing population, rising healthcare and education costs and a tottering infrastructure in dire need of replacement, the time is approaching when the traditional milch-cow will run dry. A total re-examination of the taxation structure, one that ideally aligns with those of other nations at a similar level of development, is the only possible answer. Tax havens must be eliminated, and the international lawyers and accountants who prosper by promoting them ruthlessly pursued. The common fallback of a desperate government – to increase the rate of their goods and services tax – is no longer an adequate response. Noel Bird Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia Gut reactions to terror threat I read Aidan Foster-Carter’s piece, North Korean rhetoric has reached new heights (1 April) and found myself applauding his final sentence where he says that this [kicking] “is a gut reaction, not a policy”. Indeed, I remember a previous time when Kim Jong-un was on the verge of destroying civilisation. That threat miraculously disappeared when the Boston Marathon bombing occurred. So should we conclude that Kim is simply the caretaker baddie who fills in while we wait for another Islamist attack? And, taking the conclusion from your editorial on Ireland’s Easter Rising (1 April) that summary execution of the leaders was “not only wrong [but] pre-eminently foolish”, maybe we should consider our drone-strike strategy against Isis to also be pre-eminently foolish. Or maybe some of our leaders really do want us to carry on prodding the hornets’ nest so that citizens are pacified by a permanent status of fear – be that a fear of Kim Jong-un, of Isis or of whatever else happens to be conveniently available. Indeed, that was one of Naomi Klein’s conclusions in her book The Shock Doctrine. Yes, we somehow seem to have a massive disconnect between key policy and simple common sense. Alan Mitcham Cologne, Germany Worth of second languages Shortly after reading Tracy McVeigh’s piece on the hidden value of a second language (25 March), I attended a lecture given by Manfred Spitzer, a German professor of neuroscience. He is of the opinion that the use of digital media in early years inflicts irreversible damage on our children’s brains. An average German child spends nearly a third of the day in front of a screen; the child does not learn what is most important: namely, social interaction, physical education and coping with real-life problems. Unless we do not learn this as a child, it is too late and we will struggle all our lives. According to Spitzer, learning a second language or a dialect alone in early childhood is crucial for our ability to put up with difficult situations later in life. Just as it is easier for you to learn a new type of sport when you have already mastered another, it is easier to learn a new language when you know the pattern of others. He quite vividly pointed out how all this contributes to a higher developed brain, which, in turn, crucially prolongs our brain functions in old age. Just as McVeigh put it, “the bilingual brain is better equipped to cope with damage.” I can only endorse McVeigh’s opinion that bilingualism supports our children’s chances of a fulfilled and successful life. Henrike Krüger Michelfeld, Germany Briefly • In maintaining that “a new plant at Hinkley, Somerset is badly needed”, your item is not stating fact but quoting Tory dogma (11 March). Why “a new plant” and why Hinkley? Why not invest the billions earmarked for this nuclear power project in decentralised, clean, free renewables instead? Anne Humphreys Agethorst, Germany • Mandeep Dhaliwal’s piece on how one can minimise the effects of antibiotic resistance (18 March) makes a lot of sound points. However, we need not be so pessimistic, as antibiotics are not the only means to deal with serious infections. Research in the US and elsewhere is looking at making new antimicrobial drugs. Use of bacteriophages (“phages” or phage proteins) has been shown to greatly increase the effectiveness of antibiotics. It seems as if the serious threat of antibiotic resistance has revived interest in these protein phages. Simon Baguley Schliersee, Germany • The hole in the ozone layer means that here winter days can be very hot, while the nights are cold, and the intensity of the sun is greater than in Australia, hence the high rates of melanoma (8 April). Edward Black Pauanui, New Zealand • Patti Smith’s use of her own snapshots of NYC sites as an aide-memoire for her M Train (1 April) is reminiscent of Gustave Flaubert’s pioneering Calotypes (a process similar to the daguerreotype, but with paper as medium), hundreds of which he made in and around Carthage in 1858; it was from these – upon his return to France – that he constructed the landscape descriptions in his novel Salammbô .

The study commissioned from the Fabian Society suggests that spending cuts under the coalition have undermined essential services in health and education, lengthened NHS waiting times, deprived half a million adults of social care and brought the closure of hundreds of Sure Start centres for children. Released before the autumn statement and spending review on Wednesday, the report also argues that the effects of George Osborne’s austerity drive, by suppressing demand in the economy, have led to the UK having its slowest economic recovery on record. Additional spending cuts would risk reducing economic output again. The report warns that if the chancellor does not rethink his strategy, the public sector will face major recruitment and retention problems. More years of pay restraint will mean that hospitals, schools and other essential services will struggle to hold on to their best staff, it says. In the years leading up to the financial crash, UK public spending was in line with other countries including Germany, the report points out, adding that many economically successful countries spend more on services and social support than the UK. However, cuts since the crash have meant that local authorities in England provided social care to around 500,000 fewer adults in 2013 than in 2009, a fall of 29%, the report says. The number of people waiting for a week or more to see a GP rose by almost 50% between 2012 and 2014 as health spending slumped to the lowest rate since the NHS was founded. Reductions in local government spending reduced the number of Sure Start children’s centres to 3,019 in June 2014 from 3,631 in April 2010. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “This government’s fixation with reducing the size of the state is the wrong political choice. Public spending is essential for sustainable long-term growth and for maintaining a cohesive society. A high-productivity recovery needs world-class public services, which means local authorities, hospitals and schools need to be properly funded, not run into the ground.” The report also warns that cuts to services and benefits will reverse past improvements made on reducing inequality and poverty. In the decade before the financial crisis, public spending in the UK moved from a very low base in the 1990s to levels similar to Germany, but still well below the Nordic countries. This increase in funding helped reduce NHS waiting times, which had risen by 50% between 1988 and 1998, and drove up educational standards. The report argues that for every £1 spent on infrastructure, economic activity is boosted by £2.80. In a separate report, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) has said the UK’s biggest infrastructure programmes could grind to a halt unless the government adopts new measures to tackle the skills and funding crisis. The country needs investment in transport, broadband networks and energy infrastructure, Rics said, but faces a £400bn funding crisis and the worst skills shortage in construction for 20 years. Jeremy Blackburn, Rics’ head of policy, said: “It is clear that we need to attract greater levels of foreign investment, but the chancellor is shortsighted if he believes that Chinese cash alone will address our investment needs.” The government recently agreed an £18bn deal with China’s main nuclear operator and the French energy company EDF to build the first nuclear power plant in Britain for 20 years. But with smaller infrastructure projects struggling to get investment, Blackburn is calling for a central register to attract international investors.During the recession, an estimated 400,000 people left construction – one of the highest rates of redundancy across any sector – and the loss of expertise will worsen when those left in the workforce retire. The Rics survey found that 43% of surveying firms are turning down new business opportunities due to a lack of skilled workers, each passing up an average of five contracts a year. By 2019, this is set to rise to 54%. Rics recommends introducing incentives such as reduced national insurance contributions for employers and tax relief for local investment in construction colleges, academies and school programmes. Local government should co-invest with industry in construction-focused technical colleges and school career programmes to encourage diversity, it says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2015/jul/24/monsanto-1bn-herbicide-bias-hi-tech-solutions","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-24T07:00:19Z","webTitle":"Monsanto's new $1bn herbicide shows our bias towards hi-tech solutions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jul/24/monsanto-1bn-herbicide-bias-hi-tech-solutions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2015/jul/24/monsanto-1bn-herbicide-bias-hi-tech-solutions","fields":{"headline":"Monsanto's new $1bn herbicide shows our bias towards hi-tech solutions","bodyText":"Every week brings news of the latest world-saving technological breakthrough, from electric cars to superfoods and energy miracles. Global agrochemical firm Monsanto just announced a $1bn investment in its new herbicide, dicamba, part of Roundup Ready Xtend, its system for genetically engineered crops such as soya beans and cotton. But, as we consider which paths to go down to solve the world’s food, energy, climate and health problems, are we spellbound by hi-tech answers over less glamorous, but potentially better, low-tech approaches? In discussions on global food and energy systems there seems a system-bias toward “shiny” solutions, creating a loaded and revealing default setting for both debates. Underlying, systemic problems to do with poverty, failed markets or overconsumption are glossed over when these solutions are publicised and resolve into arguments over whether you are for or against a particular technology. In the case of energy it becomes about support for nuclear power, and in global food systems about whether you do or don’t favour the genetic modification of crops. It is understandable that for public consumption, big complex debates get simplified, echoing former US president George W Bush’s binary doctrine of “Either you are with us or with the terrorists” in reference to the “war on terror”. But there’s more going on than that. The media seems like a moth to the flames of novel technologies, giving them seemingly disproportionate airtime compared to, say, sustainability options that grow from local, small scale roots that often build on indigenous practices. The former is usually cast as modern, progressive, objective and scientific; the latter is seen to be the opposite – regressive, romantic and an obstacle to progress. When reported, magic bullets rarely, if ever, get assessed alongside other strategies to achieve similar ends. What is the trade off, for example, in terms of jobs, costs, risk, security, speed of introduction and broader economic benefits of a single nuclear power station against the equivalent in generating capacity of small-scale, community-based renewable schemes? Instead, each time, the potential human development benefits of the hi-tech solutions get compared to the purely “ideological” concerns of environmentalists, as happened in recent debates about crops modified to carry the nutritional equivalent of fish oil. Criticism of magic bullet solutions often gets dismissed as ideological, overlooking the fact that magic bullets are typically designed to work with existing large-scale energy, transport and farm infrastructure, allowing the status quo to be maintained. This was seen with some of the early genetically modified crops. Monsanto caused a furore in the 1990s by considering a controversial crop technique dubbed the “terminator technology” that could have prevented timeless agricultural practices such as seed saving that are key to crop resilience and farmers’ livelihoods. While this technique was not commercialised, a similar outcome was achieved by Monsanto having its customers sign an agreement that states they will not save seed to plant the following year, ensuring the purchase of new seed every season. Several crops such as cotton and soy beans depend on proprietary pesticides and herbicides such as Monsanto’s controversial glyphosate-based Roundup brand. New technical innovations also benefit from the media coverage of being easily reportable. More complex approaches that look for better ways to do things at the level of the whole ecosystem, such as agroecology, which may answer more problems and represent more durable solutions, find it harder to grab the imagination. GM crops get about 30,000 news hits on Google, agroecology around 3,000. But to find the best rather than just the shiniest solutions, and ensure these get the right support, we would benefit from moving beyond a simple for or against mentality to properly assessing the range of options that give the fullest answers to a problem or range of problems. We can ask what is the problem to which GM crops are the only or best solution? There are almost always choices to consider. If weeds are a problem you can modify a crop for herbicide resistance, as Monsanto has done, or you can use a combination of unglamorous but effective ground cover, mulching, soil management, rotation, weeding or even use weed crops in other constructive ways. Or, while you might engineer a crop for added vitamin or mineral content, you could increase crop diversity, use other techniques like varietal selection and breeding for nutrition, or improve the buying power of communities and develop a wider range of locally available, nutritious food. Lacking official support or awareness, less shiny approaches don’t get the focus they deserve. The Wall Street Journal reported, for example, that less than 2% of the budget for research, extension and education from US Department of Agriculture goes toward certified organic farming. The danger of a focus on magic bullets is that, where hunger is concerned, it conveys the message that feeding the world is a technical problem, when decades of analysis show it to be a profoundly political and economic one. When it comes to transport should we prioritise the electric car or redesign cities for mass transit, cycling and walking? Or in energy, do we keep a big centralised system reliant on nuclear and carbon capture for fossil fuels, or move to a decentralised, distributed, renewables-based model. We face multiple, profound challenges to create thriving economies, generate mass employment, increase wellbeing and maintain our environmental life support systems. Technologies we choose have different effects on the economy and society they serve. It is not a case of simply substituting one for another. Variously they create more or fewer jobs, give people more or less control over their lives and livelihoods and are more or less prone to democratic control. They also differ hugely in terms of full cost accounting and the environmental, economic and security risks they generate. Instead of being constantly spellbound by leaps in technology, we need a bigger debate to assess their strengths and weaknesses to find those that will best support the type of world we want to save and create."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2015/sep/18/nuclear-environmentalists-scrap-hinkley-c-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-18T14:03:38Z","webTitle":"Pro-nuclear environmentalists in call to scrap Hinkley C plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/18/nuclear-environmentalists-scrap-hinkley-c-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/sep/18/nuclear-environmentalists-scrap-hinkley-c-plans","fields":{"headline":"Pro-nuclear environmentalists in call to scrap Hinkley C plans","bodyText":"Three leading environmentalists who broke ranks to give their support to a new generation of nuclear plants have now urged the government to scrap plans for Hinkley Point C. The call comes as George Osborne and Amber Rudd, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, head off to China, where they will discuss Beijing’s proposed investment in the new nuclear plant in Somerset. George Monbiot, Mark Lynas and Chris Goodall say the soaring cost and delays to the Hinkley project leave ministers with no option but to pour the estimated £24.5bn worth of investment into other low-carbon technologies. “Hinkley C bears all the distinguishing features of a white elephant: overpriced, overcomplicated and overdue. The delay that was announced recently should be the final straw. The government should kill the project,” they write in a comment piece for the Guardian. “The new delay should not surprise anyone who’s aware of the technological issues,” said Tony Roulstone, who runs the masters programme in nuclear engineering at Cambridge University. He argues that the plan for Hinkley C is like “building a cathedral within a cathedral”. It is, he concludes, “unconstructable”. Most environmentalists are opposed to nuclear power on the grounds of safety fears and the difficulties of dealing with atomic waste. But Monbiot and others broke the consensus by arguing that climate change was a greater threat. This delighted the nuclear industry and successive UK governments that have supported nuclear, partly as it contrasts with the intermittent nature of wind and solar power. EDF, the French energy group, promoting Hinkley, has already won a generous financial aid package from the government through its “contract for difference” mechanism but has yet to sign the definitive deal it needs with Beijing investors. This is expected to happen when the Chinese premier visits the UK next month, leaving EDF in a position to finally give the green light to the first nuclear plant to be built in the UK for 20 years. But the energy company and its French engineering partner, Areva, have been beset by problems, leaving a growing number of former supporters from the world of energy and the City to question the viability of the whole project. Monbiot and his colleagues are particularly worried that a failure to build a new nuclear plant on time will force more gas and even coal to be burned, a move that would exacerbate global warming. They write: “The greatest problem Hinkley C imposes is energy blight. As the project is delayed, the power it would otherwise have generated is likely to be supplied instead by fossil fuel plants. If it does indeed turn out to be unconstructable, the result is likely to be a panicked scramble back into gas and even, perhaps, coal.” In response, EDF said: “Britain will benefit from the lessons of previous EPR projects and we are ready to deliver the Hinkley Point C development once a final investment decision is made. Investing in new nuclear is the key for Britain to meet its climate change commitments while securing our energy needs at an affordable cost. The Hinkley Point project will provide enough secure and low carbon electricity to power 7% of the UK’s homes, at the time when it is needed. Furthemore, the agreement between the government and EDF has been scrutinised by numerous authorities, including the European Union, and judged to be fair and balanced.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/nov/18/the-guardian-view-on-paris-terror-and-climate-change-shaping-the-future","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-18T19:38:15Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Paris, terror and climate change: shaping the future | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/18/the-guardian-view-on-paris-terror-and-climate-change-shaping-the-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/18/the-guardian-view-on-paris-terror-and-climate-change-shaping-the-future","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Paris, terror and climate change: shaping the future","bodyText":"While Europe is on high alert against another murderous terrorist attack, it will be hard for Paris to look beyond the next 24 hours. But soon delegates start arriving in the French capital for preliminary meetings ahead of COP21, the United Nations climate change summit which will be launched on 30 November with all the grandeur attendant on a gathering of global leaders. There is a certain symmetry to the two events that goes beyond the nightmare task facing France’s overstretched security forces. As the UK foreign secretary Philip Hammond pointed out in an important speech in the US only days before the Paris attacks last Friday: “Unchecked climate change … could have catastrophic consequences – a rise in global temperatures … leading in turn to rising sea levels and huge movements of people fuelling conflict and instability.” There are reasons to be optimistic about a useful outcome from these negotiations, not least the determination of President Barack Obama’s team to deliver a deal with some kind of legal force. But any deal will mark the start rather than the end of the process. The world has learned from previous failures. The innovation of asking every country for its own intended nationally determined contributions in advance of COP21 is that they reduce the wriggle room, at least for the time being. Wednesday’sbig speech from the UK energy secretary Amber Rudd, setting a cut-off date of 2025 for coal-fired power stations, will underline that sense of commitment and should help to build some momentum ahead of the talks, even though it is only a small advance on the policies she inherited. It is also a necessary reaffirmation of the Conservatives’ pledge to green the electricity supply which had begun to seem questionable after its widely criticised decision to end subsidies to wind and solar power unexpectedly early. Ms Rudd said she was resetting UK energy policy and if she didn’t quite do that, she did make a more or less coherent pattern from the fragments that have emerged since the election in May. It is a plan. Yet with its contradictions and conditional undertakings, it did not quite add up to a clear path through the so-called energy trilemma: the balance to be struck between security, sustainability and affordability. Take the commitment to phase out coal over the next 10 years: it came with the caveat that it would not happen unless there was a clear and reliable alternative. Given the continuing uncertainty over new nuclear (which, in the Rudd plan, is what stands between decarbonisation of electricity supply and the lights going off), that means new gas-fired power stations – less dirty than coal, but still a finite fossil fuel. The plan will also entail exploiting shale gas, which is so far entirely untested in the UK and already politically neuralgic. And if gas is to be the core of energy supply beyond 2030, when electricity is supposed to become carbon free, then serious money needs to go into developing carbon capture and storage. CCS merited just one mention in Ms Rudd’s speech. As for the decision to phase out subsidies for renewables, it was defended as part of a necessary move towards making green energy competitive with other fuels, even though that is something nuclear power will not be for the foreseeable future. However, there was a little good news for renewables: there will be subsidy for new offshore wind, when it can compete with the cost of new nuclear. The bad news is that although off-shore generation costs have fallen by a fifth in two years, there is still a distance to travel. Decarbonising power supply is proving hard enough. But it poses a lesser challenge than weaning the nation off its gas-fired heating, and luring it out of its diesel- and petrol-powered cars. That puts the greatest burden of reducing carbon emissions on electricity generation. The cheapest way to get there, the way that would make most difference to consumers and shrink their energy bills by the greatest amount, is to increase energy efficiency. Ms Rudd seems to have left that part of her plan in her pending tray. Britain does have a positive message to deliver in Paris, and that can only be good news. But the world has not yet come up with a way of holding global warming below the critical 2C. The serious negotiation in Paris will be about monitoring and enforcing compliance and setting a formula to ratchet up commitments into the future. For the UK, the Rudd plan, heavy on gas and light on efficiency, will make the next step in carbon emission cuts harder than it needs to be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/video/2013/oct/21/david-cameron-edf-nuclear-power-station-video","type":"video","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-21T10:47:00Z","webTitle":"David Cameron hails EDF deal to build new UK nuclear power station - video","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2013/oct/21/david-cameron-edf-nuclear-power-station-video","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/video/2013/oct/21/david-cameron-edf-nuclear-power-station-video","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron hails EDF deal to build new UK nuclear power station - video","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/jan/12/air-pollution-generation-quality-motor-trade","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-12T17:16:22Z","webTitle":"Air pollution at this level for 10 more years will put a generation at risk | Justine Thornton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/air-pollution-generation-quality-motor-trade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/12/air-pollution-generation-quality-motor-trade","fields":{"headline":"Air pollution at this level for 10 more years will put a generation at risk","bodyText":"When I was eight years old, I used to hold my breath when I walked to school. My route was along a busy road, and I had been told that lead in petrol hurt children’s brains. I stopped worrying as the years went by and there was a successful campaign to ban it. But now I sometimes find myself coughing as I wait on my bike behind a London bus and its fumes catch in my throat. The science is clear: nitrogen dioxide from road traffic is seriously bad for our health – particularly for children and elderly people, because it can inflame our lungs and lower our resistance to respiratory infections such as bronchitis. So much so that 23,500 people in the UK are expected to die prematurely every year because of this air pollution. Imagine if knife crime or terrorism were killing people in these numbers – it would be described as a national crisis. In the old days we could at least see the smog. But this is an invisible killer, hidden from sight and sheltered from political controversy. Great swaths of the UK have nitrogen dioxide levels that are considered unsafe for human health. One of the main culprits is emissions from diesel vehicles. As we now know from the Volkswagen scandal, the emissions from diesel vehicles are often much higher than predicted in lab tests. Public disquiet about all this is, at last, beginning to stir. There is concern about the impact a third runway at Heathrow would have on already shockingly bad air pollution levels in the capital. The House of Commons environment committee recently said Heathrow should not be allowed to expand unless the government can demonstrate that air quality is within legal limits. What has not been talked about much is the role of the courts in forcing the government to take action. As a barrister specialising in environmental law, I regularly see the tension between the courts and governments of different colours over environmental issues. In 2007 I watched with interest as the high court told the then Labour government that its public consultation on nuclear power was seriously flawed. Now inaction over air pollution means it is the turn of the current Conservative government to face sanction. Last year the supreme court reached its judgment in a long-running legal challenge by the campaign group ClientEarth over UK breaches of European air pollution law. Britain is not alone in breaching EU law: a number of other member states are in a similar position. Here, the supreme court has ordered the government to produce a plan to reduce nitrogen dioxide levels to safe levels in as short a timescale as possible. It gave the government six months to do so, and allowed ClientEarth to return to court in the event it is not satisfied with the response. Forcing the government to act in this way was an unusual move because courts usually accept Whitehall’s word that it will take steps to meet its legal obligations. In doing so, the court said it had been influenced by the seriousness of the legal breach and the way air pollution had continued to worsen over the last four years, during which time the litigation has been running. The courts recognise that reducing air pollution will not be easy. In the ClientEarth case, the high court judge referred to the “heavy burden of expenditure” on taxpayers and individuals “which would require difficult political choices to be made”. The government published its revised air pollution plans in the runup to Christmas. Given the legal backdrop, it may not be entirely coincidental that shortly before the plans were published the decision on a third runway at Heathrow was delayed to enable a further look at air pollution and other environmental concerns. Judicial pressure appears to be having a direct effect on the government. At the court hearing in April 2015 the government told the supreme court that parts of London, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire would still be at illegal limits in 2030. Under the plan produced in December, the timescales for compliance have shortened. The West Midlands and Yorkshire are expected to be in compliance with legal levels in 2020, London in 2025. That is not good enough for ClientEarth, which accuses the government of still putting short-term political priorities ahead of public health and people’s lives. The revised plan soft-pedals on pollution by private motorists while the government appears intent on watering down EU legal limits for vehicle emissions. The stage is set for a fascinating tussle between law and politics. The British court will have to roll up its sleeves and decide whether this government is doing what it can to make our air as safe as possible. No matter how tough the political choices, EU law has consistently made clear that financial and political difficulties are no defence for countries that fail to comply with their legal obligations. The European court has said it is up to national courts to call their governments to account for air pollution failures. I hope the courts closely scrutinise the government’s plan. Ten more years of dangerous air pollution in the capital puts a whole generation of children at risk. Judicial review can assist in identifying the political choices made on our behalf in the plan, to better inform public debate about the difficult decisions ahead. Securing the proper boundary between the role of unelected judges in determining legality, and elected government in determining policy and priorities, is never easy. The supreme court will be fully aware of the sensitivities involved, but equally the court is clearly determined not to allow the government to duck its legal duties to citizens. The quality of the air our children breathe is too important to be decided behind closed doors by the government and vehicle manufacturers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/jan/27/big-shortfall-uk-taxpayers-cheated-business-lobbyists","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-27T20:36:02Z","webTitle":"The Big Shortfall: how UK taxpayers are cheated by business lobbyists | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/27/big-shortfall-uk-taxpayers-cheated-business-lobbyists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/27/big-shortfall-uk-taxpayers-cheated-business-lobbyists","fields":{"headline":"The Big Shortfall: how UK taxpayers are cheated by business lobbyists","bodyText":"What’s wrong with big business all of a sudden? The latest revelations of malpractice at Tesco, Sports Direct and Volkswagen are now capped by Google’s grand larceny of British taxpayers. There is of course “no wrongdoing”, that motto of modern business. But Google executives are behaving like medieval penitents, wandering Europe’s confessionals to buy remission of fiscal sins for as little as they can get away with. The idea that the internet would herald a new, clean-limbed, egalitarian corporatism is dead. Some sacred compact between capitalism’s producers, consumers, shareholders and regulators appears to have snapped. If it’s legal, goes the cry, then it must be moral. If it’s greed, it’s good. Only fools get caught and, if caught, they just apologise and go on as before. There is no policeman, no court. It is not just multinationals. The once noble sports of football, athletics and tennis are now mired in corruption allegations. Privatisation has brought the incentives, and the ethics, of big business to public service. The NHS is a cooperative of purchaser/provider rackets. Electricity prices are revealed each month as a conspiracy against the poor. The Hinkley Point nuclear power deal is close to meltdown. Common themes run through these scandals. One is the huge sums available to their participants, an incentive to misdemeanour. A sign of guilt is the speed with which press disclosure leads to remorse, as at Volkswagen and Tesco. Another is the vulnerability of state regulators and ministers to pressure. Political lobbying in Britain has blossomed under David Cameron, for the simple reason that it works. Cameron once promised to curb it, but it proved its worth by lobbying for its own survival and winning. The industry now raises an annual £2bn in fees. Tesco could persecute its suppliers with impunity because it was powerful, a bully and unregulated. Agency staff could be underpaid by Sports Direct, keeping one step ahead of its unions and the law. Volkswagen appeared to have no clue that its bureaucracy contained nerds out to cheat pollution inspectors. As for Britain’s tax authorities, they could win a role in the Keystone Cops. The American management guru Peter Drucker used to present the modern firm as an ethical construct, bringing the community goods and services in return for taxed profits. What was good for General Motors was good for America. That held for half a century. But even Drucker warned against untrammelled monopoly and the “economic rent” it offered those who could manipulate it. What Drucker failed to take on board was the message of his fellow American, the philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr. He was fascinated by the contrast he saw between interwar Germans’ behaviour as decent individuals and their appalling behaviour as a group. It was the difference between “moral man and immoral society”. I assume the directors of Tesco and Volkswagen were shocked to discover what was being done in their name. I am sure the tech giants of Silicon Valley tell their children they should always pay their taxes. Yet when they enter their offices, they take on the immorality of the herd. They are ethically neutered – as depicted in the current film The Big Short. When communism collapsed across Europe and Asia it did not, of course, collapse. It never existed. It operated as a covert barter economy run by a network of local mafias. Collapse legitimised these mafias but did not police them. They became thieves. The robber barons of 19th-century America became the oligarchs of today’s Russia. We thought contact with western capitalism would make honest businessmen of Russian oligarchs. The reverse appears to be the case. Contact with oligarchs has turned western capitalists into dodgy businessmen. Big corporations have developed morally impermeable skins. They outsource their dirty work to subcontractors, consultants and lobbyists. The most sinister aspect of the scandals has been the ease with which government is wound round the little fingers of these corporations. Since 2009 the big banks have hurled lobbyists at the Treasury to ward off any retribution (or even inquiry) after the banking collapse, and to maintain their freedom to do the same again. They still pay out billions for mis-sold insurance. Tesco had been bullying farmers for years. On energy prices, hardly a month passes without the regulator, Ofgem, slamming firms for overcharging, while the companies laugh all the way to the bank. When, as with the benighted Financial Conduct Authority, a regulator tries to say boo to the City goose, the chancellor obediently sacks its chairman. Britain now parades the world with a Treasury, a tax authority and a chancellor who can describe as a “major success” just £130m in back taxes paid by Google on an estimated UK turnover of £6bn. It has to be one of the biggest sweetheart deals of all time. At present the only real expression of public outrage is through the unsteady columns of the press. Governments, parliaments, regulators and ombudsmen occasionally wail and gnash their teeth. But in the cases cited it was often media investigation, aided by whistleblowers, that brought malpractice to light and forced government action. Throughout its history, capitalism has stumbled through regulatory evolution. Limited liability, bankruptcy and competition law have had to be constantly updated. So have protocols on governance, pricing, pay and the handling of customers and suppliers. The discipline of the market is never enough. Britain’s Treasury should have no interest in appeasing international corporations for the sake of a few thousand jobs in the City. It should be collecting taxes. The irony of the Google deal is that, in most respects, London is already a tax haven, a refuge for the world’s money-laundering, tax-evading classes. It is also responsible for the most ludicrous offshore havens, such as Bermuda, the Caymans and the Virgin Islands. It is their accomplice in stripping the treasuries of the world of trillions of dollars a year. The best argument for Britain staying in the EU is to help formulate some supranational authority to police global capitalism and tax its profits. The trouble is that Britain, in this respect, is one of the worst offenders."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/nov/18/coal-gas-costly-nuclear-same-energy-mix","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-18T18:47:36Z","webTitle":"Will the UK ever get a truly free market energy model?

Pull the other one","bodyText":"Amber Rudd’s “new model” for the UK’s energy market looks very like the old model. It is a mix of the legally necessary, the uncertain and the expensive. At least it was served with an amusing garnish – the idea that government will one day be able to step back and let market forces supply the nation’s energy needs. Pull the other one. In the age of nuclear, renewables and internationally binding targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, energy infrastructure only gets built when the government agrees subsidies and sets economic incentives. Energy secretaries will be in the “reset” game for years. The necessary part of Rudd’s policy was the headline-grabber: the closure of the UK’s fleet of coal-fired stations by 2025, with restricted running to operate from 2023. Coal is a dirty fuel and stopping its use is the surest way for the government to meet its carbon-reduction targets without breaking the law. As Peter Atherton, analyst at Jefferies, pointed out, closure in the middle of the next decade has been assumed in government planning for years. The uncertain – or, more generously, ambitious – element is building enough gas-fired power stations to replace coal and ensure security of supply. How will it happen? “We need to get the right signals in the electricity market,” said Rudd. “We are already consulting on how to improve the capacity market. And after this year’s auction we will take stock and ensure it delivers the gas we need.” Those vague sentences hint at many government interventions. The capacity market is the mechanism via which suppliers are paid to be there, regardless of whether their power is required (for example, on days when wind or solar are supplying more of the mix). The problem is that the current payments, and current wholesale power prices, are too low to prompt mass construction of gas-fired stations. A commitment to close coal stations should, as Rudd argued, encourage more investment in gas but it will not guarantee it. Higher capacity payments – and thus higher bills for consumers – will have to be agreed. But that is not the most expensive part. That is nuclear. Hinkley Point in Somerset, as everybody knows by now, will be the most expensive power station built anywhere in the world, with its output priced at twice the current wholesale price and linked to inflation for 35 years. One fears Hinkley has set a benchmark for the financing of all the other new nuclear power stations Rudd envisages. If her line about being “tough on subsidies” applies to nuclear, and not just renewables, it will be astonishing. Ladbrokes merger isn’t everyone’s favourite Dermot Desmond, the Irish billionaire, has left it very late – probably too late – to whip up a rebellion among fellow Ladbrokes shareholders against the proposed merger with Gala Coral. But he makes some excellent arguments for why this is “the wrong deal” for Ladbrokes. First, both companies can’t know how much damage will be inflicted by the Competition and Markets Authority, whose predecessor body blocked the same transaction in 1998. The internet, and mobile apps, have changed the betting landscape since then but Ladbrokes and Coral are still the second and third largest players on the high street. Thus there will be forced disposals of shops – Desmond quotes estimates of between 400 and 1,000 – and Ladbrokes will likely have to sell at less than the implied purchase price in the Coral deal. The buyers will be direct competitors. Second, Coral brings £2.2bn of debt, which will bust Ladbrokes’ traditional borrowing thresholds. With some justification, Desmond says the real winners are Coral’s private equity owners. Third, the merger triggers a £75m payment to Playtech, partner for both companies’ digital operations. In one swipe, a year’s planned cost savings will be consumed, and Playtech gets to negotiate a new technology agreement. The case for the defence is that greater size brings greater opportunity to invest, not least in Ladbrokes’ perennially misfiring online business. That’s one reason why the board will probably win next week’s vote. Another is that Desmond’s call for Ladbrokes to explore “strategic options ... in a very active mergers and acquisitions market” sounds too wishy-washy. During the long descent of Ladbrokes’ share price under chairman Peter Erskine and former chief executive Richard Glynn, no bidder emerged. Yet, on the pure analysis on the deal, the market seems to share Desmond’s low opinion. A 16% drop in Ladbrokes’ share price since the merger announcement is damning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/dec/07/david-cameron-is-treating-the-symptoms-of-flooding-but-not-the-cause","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-07T12:29:37Z","webTitle":"David Cameron is treating the symptoms of flooding, but not the causes | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/dec/07/david-cameron-is-treating-the-symptoms-of-flooding-but-not-the-cause","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/dec/07/david-cameron-is-treating-the-symptoms-of-flooding-but-not-the-cause","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron is treating the symptoms of flooding, but not the cause","bodyText":"Record rain, flooded homes, evacuations, power cuts, Red Cross centres, mobilised soldiers and emergency Cobra committee meetings: this is what climate change looks like for the UK. Flooding is the nation’s number one threat from global warming: five million homes are already at risk, and the number is rising as temperature rises. Just as after the severe floods of the winter of 2013-14, David Cameron has pledged to do all he can to help the many thousands of people affected. But he is treating the symptoms, not the cause. Since Cameron became prime minister, the government has ignored one warning after another and overseen serious under-investment in flood defences. After taking office in 2010, annual funding for flood defences was slashed by 27%. When heavy summer flooding hit in 2012, I revealed that almost 300 planned flood defences had not been built due to the cuts. Global warming means weather records are more likely to be broken and the wettest winter for 250 years in 2013-14 caused huge floods. At that point I revealed that flood-stricken communities, including those visited by Cameron in the Somerset Levels and Yalding in Kent, had been left without planned defences following funding cuts. Undelivered defences also included schemes on the stretch of Devon coast at Dawlish where the mainline railway fell into the sea and near the nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The Thames Valley also saw flooding, in a region where planned defences had been delayed and downsized. The current flooding across Cumbria includes places where new flood defences have actually been built, but the extraordinary downpour overwhelmed them. Nonetheless, the defences delayed the flooding, allowing vital time to prepare and evacuate those most at risk. More downpours are inevitable, so imagine the impact on places where defences have not been upgraded or funding for maintenance is not sufficient. The government has been warned many times. The Pitt Review after the 2007 floods concluded much more funding was needed. The surge in funding under Labour was halted by the coalition in 2010. In 2012, the government’s own research showed increased flooding is the greatest threat posed by climate change in England. The government’s own climate change advisors then told ministers there was a £500m hole in their flood defence plans, even to just to keep pace with the rising risk driven by climate change. The shortfall would result in £3bn of damages, the Committee on Climate Change said. Adapting to climate change, principally flooding, is the responsibility of the environment department. But in May 2013, under then environment secretary Owen Paterson, the number of officials working on the national adaptation programme fell from 38 to six. In November 2014, a damning report from the National Audit Office (NAO) found the risk of flooding was indeed rising as a result of government funding cuts. Furthermore, half the nation’s flood defences had been left with “minimal” maintenance, according to the spending watchdog. The NAO also contradicted Cameron’s claim that his government was spending more than ever before on flood defences. Funding had fallen by 10% in real terms, said the NAO, when £270m of one-off emergency funding after the 2013-14 floods was excluded. Spending on maintenance had fallen by 6% in real terms in the five years of the coalition, the NAO said. Flood defences are big ticket items and hard to fund when the nation’s finances are tight. But not finding the money is a clear false economy. The NAO report said every £1 spent on flood defences prevented almost £10 in damage. It noted that Cameron’s £270m bail-out was poor substitute for sustained spending: “Ad-hoc emergency spending is less good value than sustained maintenance.” Cameron is set to visit Cumbria and will see the immediate devastation wrought by storm Desmond. What he won’t be around to see is the months and years of anguish caused by floods: precious belongings lost forever by sewage-tainted waters, months in temporary accommodation and feelings of panic at every future rainstorm rattling the windows. Cumbria’s floods struck at the halfway point of the crucial two-week UN climate summit in Paris. Cameron’s statement at its opening contrast starkly with his government’s long record of cuts and delays to flood defence spending. Cameron told his fellow world leaders: “What I’m saying is that instead of making excuses tomorrow to our children and grandchildren, we should be taking action against climate change today.” For the UK, today’s action means fighting floods and there was a suggestion from Cameron during Monday’s visit to Cumbria that this is finally sinking in. “After every flood the thing to do is to do is sit down, look at the money you are spending, look at what you are building, look at what you are planning to do in the future, and ask is it enough. That’s exactly what we will do,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/nov/16/fukushimas-radioactive-wasteland-turns-into-art-gallery","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-16T00:49:11Z","webTitle":"Fukushima's radioactive wasteland turns into art gallery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/16/fukushimas-radioactive-wasteland-turns-into-art-gallery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/nov/16/fukushimas-radioactive-wasteland-turns-into-art-gallery","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima's radioactive wasteland turns into art gallery","bodyText":"When Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant went into meltdown on 11 March 2011, thousands of people jumped in their cars and fled north. Some had second thoughts. They stopped to check the direction of the wind, then drove in the opposite direction, away from the plume of radiation spreading from the stricken plant. “It was an everyday form of knowledge that can be extraordinarily important in times of crisis,” said Jason Waite, one of the curators of an art project that has opened, without fanfare, inside Fukushima’s nuclear exclusion zone. It was also the inspiration for the project’s title, Don’t Follow the Wind, a collaboration between 12 Japanese and foreign artists who have put together what might be the most inaccessible art exhibition in the world. Their platform is an area that, for almost five years, has largely been left to nature. Untended gardens stand waist height, wild boar roam the streets, and every other porch seems to be home to huge spiders, motionless in their webs. Don’t Follow the Wind wasn’t marked by launch events and media previews. Visitors to its website, www.dontfollowthewind.info, are greeted with a blank page and a brief audio clip explaining the artists’ determination that the exhibition – like Fukushima’s radiation – remain invisible. For months, the installations, prints and photographs spread over four venues remained off limits to all but the artists and the residents who had allowed their homes and workplaces to be used. The Guardian was given rare access to the exhibition, which includes contributions by Ai Weiwei, Taryn Simon, Ahmet Öğüt and Trevor Paglen. The Japanese artists include Aiko Miyanaga, Nobuaki Takekawa and the six-member collective Chim-Pom. The artists have turned ordinary spaces – a farm, a private home, a recreation centre and a warehouse – into an artistic response to the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. Chim-Pom initiated the project in 2012, determined to bring art to officially designated “difficult to return” zones, where pockets of high radiation could rule out permanent resettlement for years. “We encountered lots of difficulties, but funding was the most serious,” said Chim-Pom artist Ryuta. As word spread, other artists chipped in and Chim-Pom sold work to raise the money. The only access to the project is via a touring exhibition of “descriptions, impressions and data” that began last month with the opening of a “non-visitor centre” at the Watari Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo. Visitors will not even be able to buy a catalogue. “By it’s very nature, this will be a long exhibition, and the artworks will change over time,” said Ryuta. “We didn’t think having a catalogue of photographs would do it justice.” Not everyone appreciates their efforts. The Guardian’s Jonathan Jones accused the artists of “feasting, once more, on the apocalyptic image of nuclear disaster” and suggested they would do more good “starting a discussion with science about the pros and cons of nuclear energy as a solution to global warming”. But Franco Mattes, a curator and contributor to the exhibition, dismissed criticism that the project was a stunt. The Fukushima nuclear accident has made normal human life in the most contaminated areas impossible, he said. Keeping the exhibition out of the public realm mirrored the fate of the land, unseen and unmaintained. “People will only be able to access the works when the venue itself is livable again and homeowners can return,” said Mattes, who has contributed glass installations with his partner, Eva Mattes. All of the exhibits will be left untouched, to change with the passage of time. On the ground floor of an abandoned home, Öğüt’s Once Upon a Time is an eerie amalgamation of Fukushima’s venerable history and its poisoned present: a Level A hazmat suit incorporating pieces of centuries-old samurai armour donated by the homeowner, a local horseman who traces his ancestry back to Japan’s feudal warriors. Ai Weiwei’s two contributions – a Ray of Hope light installation and Family album, a collection of 22 framed photographs, are reminders of the toll on Fukushima’s families. In the first, a solar panel on the roof of a farmhouse powers two naked light bulbs inside for two hours every morning, and three hours in the evening. “There is no electricity here,” said co-curator Kenji Kubota, an associate professor at Tsukuba university near Tokyo. “This is the only place around here where you can see light seeping into the darkness – a ray of hope.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2015/apr/10/greenpeace-bank-accounts-frozen-by-indian-government","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-10T05:32:52Z","webTitle":"Greenpeace bank accounts frozen by Indian government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/10/greenpeace-bank-accounts-frozen-by-indian-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/apr/10/greenpeace-bank-accounts-frozen-by-indian-government","fields":{"headline":"Greenpeace bank accounts frozen by Indian government","bodyText":"The Indian government has frozen bank accounts of Greenpeace after accusing the international environment campaign group of encouraging “anti-development” protests in the emerging economic power. The Union Home Ministry on Thursday suspended the official registration for foreign funding of Greenpeace India for six months and froze seven bank accounts connected with the organisation, The Hindu, a local newspaper, reported. Samit Aich, the executive director of Greenpeace, said the move was “an attack on democracy”. “They don’t like the questions we are raising. We are environmental activists asking questions about the environment. There has been intimidation, illegal attacks for some time now,” he said. Campaigners believe that authorities have been upset by campaigns to highlight the environmental consequences of India’s increasing use of coal to generate massive amounts of power needed by the growing economy. “We have evidence to prove that Greenpeace has been misreporting their funds and using their unaccounted foreign aid to stall crucial development projects,” a senior government official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. Aich said the group was waiting to see the exact charges against them but was confident it would be able to rebut them all. The exact trigger for the move is unclear. The Hindu quoted a Ministry of Home Affairs official saying that one reason for the new moves this week was the invitation last year from the British parliament to Greenpeace India to “testify against the Indian government”. In January a Greenpeace campaigner was stopped by Indian officials from travelling to the UK to deliver a talk to MPs about the impact of mining on a poor communities and the environment in central India. Government agencies had also found that “in the past couple of years, several UK nationals, including cyber experts and activists, had visited Greenpeace’s offices in India allegedly to help it organise protest activities”, the newspaper said. In January the Indian government was told by judges to unblock funds received by Greenpeace which have been frozen by authorities since June. The high court in Delhi, the capital, ruled that the previous freeze on funds that Greenpeace India had received from abroad was “arbitrarily illegal” and “unconstitutional”. Over the past year, there have been a series of measures targeting Greenpeace and several other international NGOs working on similar environmental issues in India. An intelligence report prepared for the incoming government of Narendra Modi, which took power after a landslide electoral win in May, accused several foreign-funded NGOs of stalling major infrastructure projects at the behest of unidentified foreign powers. The report, which was leaked to the press, claimed that “people-centric” campaigns organised by NGOs blocked projects in seven sectors – nuclear power, uranium mining, thermal and hydroelectric power, farm biotechnology, extractive industries, and mega industrial projects – were aimed at keeping India in “a state of underdevelopment”. In June, the government barred Greenpeace from receiving funds from Greenpeace International and Climate Works Foundation – some 30% of its funding. The remaining 70% is raised from local supporters in India. About £180,000 was frozen, before courts ordered its release. Modi’s predecessor, Manmohan Singh, had complained that foreign-funded NGOs were blocking the expansion of nuclear power and the introduction of genetically modified products."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2015/oct/27/the-simpsons-couch-gags-only-things-left-worth-watching","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-27T09:29:10Z","webTitle":"The Simpsons: are the couch gags the only things left worth watching?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/27/the-simpsons-couch-gags-only-things-left-worth-watching","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/27/the-simpsons-couch-gags-only-things-left-worth-watching","fields":{"headline":"The Simpsons: are the couch gags the only things left worth watching?","bodyText":"No one seems that bothered by celebrity guests on The Simpsons these days. This year alone, even the presence of such luminaries as Pharrell Williams, Elon Musk and most of the cast of Girls have barely been deemed newsworthy or surprising enough to shake viewers or press out of their blank-eyed conviction that the show is “not as good as it used to be.” But there is one element of the show that’s reversing that downward trend; the guest directors, animators and artists like Banksy who have been given free reign to tackle the couch gag or title sequence that starts every episode. These welcome interlopers deliver a dollop of personality, a variation on the show’s limited animation and artwork style, some unexpected turns and, most importantly, some joy. John Kricfalusi John K, the creator of Ren and Stimpy and Spumco supremo followed up his 2011 couch gag with last weekend’s Treehouse Of Horror special. In order to get the best of Kricfalusi’s talent, full control was handed over to him. The result is vibrant and violent, full of wildly expressive movement and grisly humour as Frank Grimes (one of Homer’s former co-workers at the nuclear power plant) returns from the grave. Full of great details too: Bart’s Huckleberry Hound mask is red instead of the correct blue as that’s the way it was on the cheapo Halloween costume Kricfalusi had as a kid. Don Hertzfeldt The truly independent animator Don Hertzfeldt is a deceiver. His drawings look simple, even perhaps crude, but he’ll have you in fits of laughter, befuddled by narrative complexity or reduced to a blubbering wreck; he does all of these things in a mere 17 minutes with his recent World Of Tomorrow, one of the best films of this year. For the opening to The Simpsons’ 26th season in 2014, he propels us into a future world where the characters have either evolved or mutated into unsettling blobs. The onscreen notes reveal that viewers can now have the show beamed directly into their exo-skulls and merchandise can be rubbed onto their flippers. In this strange new world it’s reassuring that the catchphrases are, more or less, intact and, more importantly, Homer and Marge are still in love. Guillermo del Toro While he didn’t draw this intro for Treehouse of Horror XXIV, horror director Guillermo del Toro’s handwriting is all over his intro – with plenty of his design work evident too. We get imagery from all of his movies, plus plenty of nods to Mario Bava, Stephen King, HP Lovecraft, Ray Harryhausen, Hitchcock, etc. Del Toro is a serial recommender, his newly arrived Twitter account is like a gateway drug into a world of fantastic art, cinema and literature. For The Simpsons he fills the screen with stuff he thinks we should all know (the classic Universal horror movie creatures) as well as things well worth checking out (such as Brian de Palma’s outlandish horror musical The Phantom Of The Paradise) and things he just plain loves (the big black car is from the enjoyable horror oddity The Car – del Toro drives himself around LA in a replica he had made). Bill Plympton Another independent talent, animator Bill Plympton has toured his work around the US with Hertzfeldt as “The Don and Bill Show”. Plympton was the first animator to hand draw a feature film on his own, producing some 30,000 drawings for the brilliant musical The Tune. As animation, by its very nature, gives movement and character to immobile art or objects, Plympton decided to turn the Simpsons’ couch into a member of the family in this 2012 sequence for Beware My Cheating Bart. In almost 600 episodes no one had ever thought to do this, which is another reason why the outside influence of guest animators is such a wonderful thing. Michal Socha You don’t get more mainstream than The Simpsons, so it’s particularly satisfying that they can introduce viewers to artists like Polish animator Michal Socha. It’s hard to imagine most of the show’s audience ever coming into contact with the work of people like Socha, so it’s worth remembering they provide this valuable service when you hear The Simpsons casually written off as a spent force. When has Family Guy ever done anything this interesting or cool?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2013/oct/17/china-buy-uk-nuclear-power-stations-george-osborne","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-17T08:50:27Z","webTitle":"China will be allowed to buy UK nuclear power stations, George Osborne says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/17/china-buy-uk-nuclear-power-stations-george-osborne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/oct/17/china-buy-uk-nuclear-power-stations-george-osborne","fields":{"headline":"China will be allowed to buy UK nuclear power stations, George Osborne says","bodyText":"China could play an instrumental role in Britain's future nuclear power generation after George Osborne said companies in the world's second largest economy would be allowed to buy into the sector. The decision would pave the way for Chinese companies to take a stake in or own 100% of new British nuclear power stations. The chancellor made the announcement at the Taishan nuclear power plant on the final day of his trade visit to China, which was aimed at strengthening the UK's business ties with the country. Chinese investment would likely begin with a minority stake in a power project, but majority ownership of subsequent new power stations was a possibility, the government said. Osborne said it would pave the way for lower energy costs for British consumers. \"Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China – the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power,\" he said on Thursday. \"It means the potential of more investment and jobs in Britain, and lower long-term energy costs for consumers.\" The move followed an agreement reached earlier in the week which would see civil nuclear collaboration between the UK and China on investment, technology, construction and expertise. The government said that as well as supporting Chinese investment in the UK, the agreement would make sure that British companies including Rolls-Royce, International Nuclear Services, and engineering companies such as Mott MacDonald would be part of China's multibillion-pound new nuclear programme. The energy minister, Ed Davey, said over the weekend that Britain was \"extremely close\" to agreeing a deal with France's EDF Energy to build a new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset, with a Chinese company also expected to take part in the project. During his trip to China, Osborne also unveiled a new visa system to make it easier for Chinese business leaders and rich tourists to visit the UK. He also made a surprise decision to allow Chinese banks to set up more easily in the UK, which raised eyebrows among the cross-party Treasury select committee of MPs. Led by its chairman, Andrew Tyrie, the committee is seeking assurances that the chancellor consulted the City's regulatory bodies over the proposal to relax rules, and that they are satisfied with the plans."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/mar/14/hinkley-point-costly-mistake-france-britain-edf","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-14T07:00:10Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point is a costly mistake, but only France can pull the plug | Simon Taylor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/14/hinkley-point-costly-mistake-france-britain-edf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/14/hinkley-point-costly-mistake-france-britain-edf","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point is a costly mistake, but only France can pull the plug","bodyText":"Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy, once boasted that British customers would be cooking their Christmas turkeys in 2017 with electricity from the proposed new Hinkley Point nuclear power station his firm is contracted to build. That was a time of optimism, and a grandiose claim in keeping with the £18bn grandiosity of the project itself; equivalent in cost to Heathrow Terminal 5 and the Olympics combined. De Rivaz was wrong about that deadline and optimism is now in short supply. Business situations are often described as zero-sum, or win-win. Hinkley Point, already the site of a power station in Somerset, is a rare case where the project could be damaging to both customers and investors. It would saddle British taxpayers with highly expensive power, and risk bankrupting a major French company, whose finances are already shaky. The government should cancel the deal. In theory it could do that, but in practice it cannot – not without damaging its reputation for consistent policymaking, and scaring off the other nuclear consortia it will need to build future plants; and they are needed, in order to meet Britain’s climate change obligations. So this is the dilemma: Britain needs the project cancelled, but that cancellation must come from France. We are relying on the French and EDF, which has already spent £2bn on the project, to do the right thing. But will they? Hinkley was to be the first new nuclear reactor in the UK for 20 years, providing 7% of the nation’s electricity. But it has been undermined. The first is that the European pressurised water reactor (EPR) planned for Hinkley has turned out to be an engineering disaster. The first to be built was at Olkiluoto, in Finland. Originally scheduled to start operating in 2009, the station is now tentatively to be finished by 2018. Costs have trebled and are the subject of a multibillion-euro lawsuit that has pretty much bankrupted the EPR’s French developer, Areva. The second station, built by EDF itself at Flamanville in Normandy, is also in deep trouble. Intended for completion in 2012, it now looks unlikely to start before 2018 and is also running at about three times the original cost. On top of that, the French nuclear regulator is investigating potentially fatal problems in the fabric of the station that could lead to it being abandoned or rebuilt at even greater cost. Two EPRs being built in China are also behind schedule, despite China’s expertise in nuclear construction. As the evidence grew that the EPR for Hinkley would be far more costly than expected, the talk of allowing private investment was replaced by promises of government support. The UK government will guarantee at least £2bn of debt. And it has promised that we, the electricity customers, will buy the power produced by Hinkley for 35 years at a price of £92.50 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in 2012 prices. The price would now be about £99/MWh (and will increase further with inflation). Contrast that with the current wholesale price of power in the UK, about £35/MWh. No one knows what the price of competing power sources will be in 2025 (when Hinkley is supposed to start generating). But it would take a dramatic rise in oil and gas prices to match the Hinkley contract price. And offshore wind, the main source of renewable energy in the UK, is already coming in below £90/MWh, with a good chance that it will fall further. So the contract was flawed. But consider too the state of EDF. The firm has seen its market value cut to under £20bn. This is little to do with the Hinkley project: it reflects falling power prices in France, its home market. Utilities are normally financially strong companies, with steady cash generation and relatively low risk. But EDF now has a level of debt greater than its market value. It has had to borrow to pay its dividend for the past four years, something healthy companies do not do. Belatedly EDF’s domestic constituency seem to have woken up to the enormous risk it would be taking with Hinkley. The UK deal promises a high fixed price of electricity but leaves the construction risk with EDF and its Chinese partner, CGN, which has a one-third share of the project. Given the dreadful construction record of the previous EPRs, one would need to be wildly optimistic to assume Hinkley would go smoothly. The estimated cost has steadily risen from £8bn (in today’s money) to £16bn (plus £2bn that has already been spent). But the stakes are higher than that. In its 2014 state aid report, the European commission required EDF and other investors to make available up to £24.5bn as extra “contingent equity” – to reduce the risk to the UK government, which would be guaranteeing some of the project debt. EDF’s stock market value is about £18bn. For it to contemplate a single investment that could cost £16bn (its two-thirds share of £24bn) is astonishing. No normal company would consider such a risk, even if it hoped to make a high and predictable return in the future. But EDF is not a normal company. Although privatised and listed on the Paris and London stock exchanges, it remains 85% owned by the French state, and has a major trade union (CFE-CGC) represented on its board. The latter is significant, for it was the union that first realised the risk of Hinkley. In January, it forced the EDF board to postpone a decision on committing fully to the project, fearing the cost and risk would jeopardise French jobs. Last week Thomas Piquemal, the firm’s chief financial officer, resigned, reportedly in protest against the refusal of the board to delay the project by at least three years, until the French reactor is finished and a proper cost audit can be done. EDF’s board is, of course, answerable to its shareholders. But there is a major conflict of interest between the private shareholders and the main one, the French government, for it would be embarrassing for the French state to have to delay or cancel the Hinkley project. And doing so could end the prospects of its EPR reactor being sold anywhere else in the world. Jean-Bernard Lévy, chief executive of EDF (EDF Energy’s parent company), is in a difficult position. It was revealed this weekend that he told staff he wants further financial support from the French government before proceeding with Hinkley. In effect, he is asking his major shareholder to protect him against future lawsuits from the minor shareholders. So there is a mess on both sides of the Channel. In Britain the 2008 Climate Change Act makes future cuts in UK greenhouse gas emissions legally binding. In theory, if the government fails to hit the carbon budgets the energy secretary (currently Amber Rudd) is in breach of the law. The budget for 2023-27 depends on Hinkley going ahead, as well as a full contribution from offshore wind. And after this, Britain will need at least three other new nuclear stations to replace old ones that will have closed. The British government must also consider its “golden” relationship with China. For, once it became clear that EDF couldn’t fund Hinkley on its own, the UK turned to its longstanding Chinese partners – an arrangement reaffirmed during president Xi Jinping’s state visit to the UK last October. How embarrassing would it be for David Cameron to have to explain to the Chinese that we were now cancelling the project? Too embarrassing, perhaps. He needs the French to pull the plug. We all do."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/2015/oct/27/open-government-partnership-conference-make-deals-with-business-more-transparent","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-27T14:00:05Z","webTitle":"More transparency is needed over public contracts, if the UK is to do business with China | Jane Dudman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/27/open-government-partnership-conference-make-deals-with-business-more-transparent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2015/oct/27/open-government-partnership-conference-make-deals-with-business-more-transparent","fields":{"headline":"More transparency is needed over public contracts, if the UK is to do business with China","bodyText":"Just across the road from the imposing headquarters of the African Union in the centre of Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, is a block of housing and several Chinese cafes. This is where the Chinese workers live who maintain the Union’s huge conference centre and 20-storey office building, opened in 2012 amid controversy about why it had been built by a Chinese company with Chinese labour, rather than by locals. With the UK government claiming £40bn of new business as a result of last week’s state visit from China, there are similar questions for British civil servants about the role of this undemocratic nation, with a poor record on human rights, in building and controlling parts of the UK’s infrastructure. This includes seven potential HS2 contracts, worth almost £12bn, which the chancellor, George Osborne, opened up to Chinese investors on his recent trip to China, and the controversial billion-pound deals agreed last week for a Chinese state-controlled company, with a minority French state partner, to build nuclear power plants at Hinkley Point, Bradwell and Sizewell. There’s more, too: a UK/China cybersecurity deal that could pave the way to closer security cooperation between the two countries; and UK/Chinese work in the technology and creative industries. Details of these deals are likely to remain opaque under the auspices of commerical confidentiality. On the other side of the world, however, Cameron’s government tells a very different story. Mexico City is the venue for this week’s annual conference of the Open Government Partnership – the alliance, set up in 2011 of countries committed to more open and transparent government. China does not belong to the OGP. The UK is a founding member and co-hosted the annual OGP conference in London in 2013. Eleanor Stewart, the UK government’s head of transparency, will be in Mexico City to consider progress on the national plans set out by all member countries. One of the key elements in making governments more open is finding out more about the deals they sign and who they work with. Every year, trillions of dollars are spent around the world on deals between governments and businesses; deals that result in roads, schools, hospitals – tangible assets that citizens really care about. “When government and business meet, rules need to be clear and deals made public,” say Georg Neumann, senior communications manager, and Gavin Heyman, executive director of the Open Contracting Partnership, both of whom will be at the Mexico conference to push through ideas to make all governments more accountable. Open contracting – knowing more about how governments work with business and the kinds of deals they do – is one of the most vital aspects of open government. Neumann and Heyman say in a blog ahead of the conference that corruption could see up to 20% of government procurement budgets being wasted. “Corruption … hurts those who do not have a choice over which road to travel, where to be treated when sick or in which school to enrol their children.” Open government campaigners in the UK have long called for the Freedom of Information Act to be extended to private companies delivering public services. But despite the apparent commitment to openness and the UK’s membership of the OGP, the Conservatives seem barely committed to preserving FOI, let alone extending it. A review of the FOI Act, out next month, is expected to suggest ways to curb public access to government information. In Mexico City, global open government campaigners calling for sweeping changes in order to shine a light on the too often murky relationship between government and business, are making three basic demands: government deals should be open by default, as in the case in Slovakia, where a government contract is not legal until it is published; governments should provide standard, open data on public procurement, for ease of comparison; and governments should get everyone – citizens, businesses, experts and journalists – more involved in monitoring public procurement. Three simple steps to make public contracts open and accountable. Three simple steps that seem further away than ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2015/may/11/indian-point-nuclear-reactor-shut-down-blast-fire","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-11T19:49:49Z","webTitle":"Indian Point nuclear reactor remains shut down after blast and fire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/11/indian-point-nuclear-reactor-shut-down-blast-fire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2015/may/11/indian-point-nuclear-reactor-shut-down-blast-fire","fields":{"headline":"Indian Point nuclear reactor remains shut down after blast and fire","bodyText":"A reactor at the Indian Point nuclear power plant upriver from New York City remained temporarily out of operation on Monday, following a debilitating transformer failure and fire late on Saturday. The failure happened at Indian Point 3, one of two operating reactors at the Indian Point Energy Center in Westchester County, New York, 38 miles north of New York City. It caused an explosion and a fire, which led to thousands of gallons of transformer fluid – or oil – overwhelming a containment moat and seeping into the Hudson River. The fire happened in the non-nuclear part of the facility, said Diane Screnci at the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Deployed governmental agencies and Entergy, the corporation that owns and operates the Indian Point Energy Center and its two reactors – Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 – have yet to ascertain the exact amount of oil released into the Hudson. Charles Rowe, a US coast guard spokesman in New York, said personnel from his agency were dispatched to the scene late on Saturday and observed a “light sheening” on the water, a telltale sign of the presence of oil. Observing a “sheening” as opposed to a “slick” of oil on the water was a reassuring finding, Rowe said. He said it meant the oil quantity was relatively small and had already started to break down in the water. By the time a new coast guard team was dispatched to the scene of the spill on Monday morning, a sheening was no longer noticeable, Rowe said. Tests revealed that the oil leaked into the river was unthreatening to the environment as it was mineral oil, he added: “Something you can buy at the grocery store.” No traces of a much more threatening and toxic fluid used to operate nuclear transformers – polychlorinated biphenyl, also referred to as PCB – was found in the water, Rowe said. Indian Point 3 could be closed for the next few weeks. According to information made available by the Nuclear Energy Institute, the shut-down section of the plant provides energy to the equivalent of just over one million residents in New York. A total of 1,000 workers are employed at the plant. Screnci with the NRC said this kind of incident was not a cause for concern, describing it as something that “would be considered a day-to-day event”. The fire and oil leak would in no way affect the NRC’s decision in terms of reissuing licenses to the two reactors, Screnci said. Indian Point 3’s operating license is due to expire at the end of this year. Indian Point 2’s license expired in September 2013, NRC online records show. It appears to be functioning under a period of extended operation, pending an official renewal. The NRC has three resident inspectors permanently assigned to the plant site. But Jim Riccio, Greenpeace’s nuclear policy analyst, says the NRC’s track record shows it to be more concerned with the industry’s economic survival than full-throttle regulation. While this weekend’s transformer failure left the actual nuclear reactor intact, Riccio called the decision to have a power plant so close to New York City “abysmal” – both because of the number of people potentially exposed to a nuclear disaster and the enhanced threat of terrorist attacks. Speaking before the press on Sunday, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, expressed serious concern for safety, security and environmental impact. “This plant is the nuclear plant that is closest to the most densely populated area on the globe,” he said. “If something goes wrong here, it can go very wrong for a lot of people.” During his first term in office in 2011, Cuomo advisers met Indian Point administrators and expressed the governor’s determination to close the plant down. Riccio at Greenpeace dismissed arguments from energy advocates who describe nuclear power as a solution in the battle against global warming, because it produces no carbon emissions into the atmosphere. Instead, he pointed to the fact that the world has averaged one nuclear catastrophe per decade. “Every single reactor has the potential to be a Fukushima or Chernobyl,” he said. “I fail to see why we continue to put our public at risk for the benefit of these corporations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/aug/05/liberal-democrats-agenda-tuition-fees","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-05T21:54:00Z","webTitle":"Lib Dem agenda: embrace nuclear power, tuition fees and fracking","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/05/liberal-democrats-agenda-tuition-fees","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/aug/05/liberal-democrats-agenda-tuition-fees","fields":{"headline":"Lib Dem agenda: embrace nuclear power, tuition fees and fracking","bodyText":"Liberal Democrats will next month be offered the chance to take up the role of an unambiguous party of the centre by embracing nuclear power, tuition fees, a limited replacement for Trident nuclear submarines, backing for shale gas and broad support for the coalition's macro-economic policies, a conference agenda released today shows. Nick Clegg is trying to guide his party to the centre, committed to a tough economic policy combined with a vision for social justice, but he is likely to face resistance from the grassroots at the conference in Glasgow over significant aspects of his new prospectus. The party's election manifesto will largely be drawn from many of the decisions made by the party conference, and it is likely to be the most important of Clegg's leadership. The conference agenda suggests the Lib Dem hierarchy is intent on staging clarifying debates that will show the party has changed since it joined government, abandoning its longstanding opposition to nuclear power and tuition fees. Clegg is determined to go into the next election unencumbered by \"unrealistic\" policies such as its past opposition to tuition fees. , a policy that he rapidly had to aAbandoningWhen he quickly abandoned that policy once in government, it led to a large drop in his personal trust ratings and damaged the party's appeal on the left. A motion to the party conference baldly states: \"The current system of higher education funding represents the best deal for students and taxpayers currently available. \"Further, that alternatives such as a graduate tax have a number of obvious failings, which would place an additional burden on low and middle income students and graduates, as well as a substantial extra cost to the state.\" It proposes retaining the current system of university finance with a review in the next parliament to \"examine its impact on access, participation and quality – this review should consider both the pressure on the public sector borrowing requirement from unpaid loans and progress made on widening and increasing participation\". The conference is also to be offered a straight choice on whether to retain civilian nuclear power. It will be asked either to reject the construction of a new generation of nuclear plants, or to accept that in future, nuclear power stations could play a limited role in electricity supply, provided concerns about safety, disposal of radioactive waste and cost (including the cost of decommissioning) are adequately addressed and without allowing any public subsidy for new build. The energy secretary, Ed Davey, will back the qualified support for nuclear power. The same motion will also give cautious support for shale gas, saying limited shale gas extraction should be allowed, provided that \"regulations controlling pollution and protecting local environmental quality are strictly enforced, planning decisions remain with local authorities and local communities are fully consulted over extraction and fully compensated for all damage to the local landscape\". The conference will also be given a choice over whether to reinstate the 50p rate of income tax for those earning £150,000 a year or instead keep the additional rate of 45% for income over £150,000 a year. The return to a 50p rate would be subject to an independent review concluding that the additional income from this change would be likely (on the balance of probabilities) to exceed the costs of introducing it. On the issue of a replacement for Trident, the Lib Dems are set to reject continuous at-sea deterrence following the Cabinet Office-led review under the chairmanship of Danny Alexander, the Treasury chief secretary. The party will instead call for a credible \"contingency posture\". This would involve: \"Construction and maintenance of fewer Successor submarines, and a reduction in crewing levels accordingly; a declaratory policy of going to sea only with unarmed missiles and storing a reduced stockpile of warheads for redeployment within a specified time frame, surging to more constant, armed patrols only during limited periods when a deteriorating security picture demands this. \"In the long term, the Liberal Democrats will propose construction of a single class of multipurpose submarines to succeed the Astute and Successor classes, to perform all submarine roles we may need, including the capability to re-role from conventional to nuclear missions within a specified time frame.\" The motion, almost certain to be adopted, claims the measures represent \"the greatest single act of de-escalation ever undertaken by one of the established nuclear powers, would send a powerful signal of Britain's commitment to multilateral disarmament and would be a significant step towards our ultimate goal of a world free of nuclear weapons\". Proposals have also been tabled to soften the impact of the bedroom tax. The motion suggests there should be no reduction in housing benefit for those who temporarily do not need a home of their current size owing to a change in their circumstances, but whose need will predictably return to a higher level. There is also likely to be a bitter debate over plans to block internet pornography along the lines proposed by the government. Linda Jack, chair of the Liberal Left group of activists, said Clegg was \"staking his leadership\" on the motion about the economy, which is likely to be opposed by some of the grassroots. \"The economy motion will be the most interesting,\" she said. \"He is staking his leadership on this. There's quite a lot in there that people will agree with but the argument will be over whether we'll be tied into Osbornomics and a Tory agenda.\" She said it seemed to be part of his case for moving to the party towards the centre. \"If this motion gets passed as it is, he will have been able to do this,\" she added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/23/iea-report-on-benefits-of-coal-is-deeply-misleading","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-23T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"IEA report on benefits of coal is 'deeply misleading'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/23/iea-report-on-benefits-of-coal-is-deeply-misleading","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/23/iea-report-on-benefits-of-coal-is-deeply-misleading","fields":{"headline":"IEA report on benefits of coal is 'deeply misleading'","bodyText":"A coal industry report due to be published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) on the benefits of new coal-burning technology has been heavily criticised by experts. The report, seen by the Guardian, is “deeply confused and deeply misleading” and a “litany of errors and false assumptions, clearly written ultimately as a disinformation tool”, according to two financial experts. They said the legitimacy conferred by the respected IEA on the report raised serious questions. The report, the Socioeconomic Impacts of Advanced Technology Coal-Fuelled Power Stations, was produced by the IEA’s Coal Industry Advisory Board (CIAB), a group of coal industry executives that “provides advice to the IEA”. Peabody Energy, which says global warming is “an environmental crisis predicted by flawed computer models”, RWE and Shenhua were directly involved in the report while Anglo American, Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton, E.ON, Arch Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and Eskom all provided input. The report states it is “a complete and current set of facts, as well as a full and unbiased accounting of effects”, but fails to mention climate change at all. “Coal itself is not the cause of China’s air quality problem,” the report states. “What matters is not what goes in, but what comes out.” The report then analyses the social and environmental benefits that may be offered by new, cleaner coal-fired powered stations. But the report is “deeply confused and deeply misleading”, according to Richard Denniss, chief economist at the Australia Institute: “The paper pays scant attention to the health and social costs associated with coal mining and coal burning. The quality and quantity of analysis of the negative [effects] associated with coal mining and burning is fundamentally inadequate.” Denniss said the report confuses the benefits to people of electrification and grid expansion with the economic benefits of building new generation coal-fired power stations: “The benefits of grid expansion are unrelated to the source of the electricity that flow along that grid.” The report also compares the economic benefits that flow from significant investment in coal-fired electricity with the economic benefits of investing in nothing at all, he said. “An honest evaluation would focus on the additional benefits [of coal investment compared] to similar sized investments in other forms of infrastructure.” An IEA spokeswoman said the CIAB reports are not official IEA publications: “The CIAB represents the views of its members. The IEA’s views on coal are clearly presented in our Special Report on Energy and Climate published in June 2015.” Tim Buckley, at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis and who has 25 years of financial markets experience including 17 years at Citigroup, said: “The report is a litany of errors and false assumptions, clearly written ultimately as a disinformation tool. The CIAB is actually a formalised lobby group to the IEA but somehow such a report is entitled to utilise the logo of the IEA to give it a sense of legitimacy. Some serious questions need to be raised within the IEA itself.” Buckley’s criticisms include the report suggesting benefits from more coal burning for India without mentioning or evaluating the 175GW renewable energy plan announced in 2015. He also flagged its criticism of nuclear power when it says “the risk of cancer is higher among uranium miners” without mentioning the “black lung” lawsuits underway in US coal-mining communities. Buckley also said the CIAB had cherry-picked its case studies in China, India and Germany, which have little or no domestic gas. “There is no evaluation of domestic coal versus domestic gas, such as is transforming the US, with tens of billions being invested in gas with the consequent near weekly announcements of coal-fired power plant closures,” he said. “There is [also] no evaluation of any of the increasingly viable investment alternatives being implemented at scale in each of China, India and Germany – namely wind, solar, hydro, nuclear and energy efficiency.” The title page of the CIAB report seen by the Guardian says “International Energy Agency, Insights series 2015” and the final page says “IEA publications”. The IEA spokeswoman said: “The IEA cannot comment on a report that is not ours and has not been released.” Note: The IEA did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian by the time of publication.

Nuclear power produces nearly 20% of Germany's energy, but in July 2011 (only three months after Fukushima) the German government vowed to shut down its nuclear capability within 10 years. Not just that, but to replace it with renewable energy, cut greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by 40% by 2020 and 80% by 2050, ensure renewables contribute 80% of Germany's energy by 2050, and ensure energy consumption drops 20% by 2020 and 50% by 2050. It even has its own word: 'Energiewende', or 'Energy Transformation'. And Angela Merkel, not known for hyperbole, has described it as a 'Herculean task'. Energiewende: persuading the public But Professor Dr Manfred Fischedick is not a casual observer. As vice president of the Wuppertal Institute, he is scientific adviser to both policy makers and industry. Energiewende, he says, didn't simply fall from the sky in 2011. \"Discussions about Energiewende had started already in the 1980s\", says Fischedick. \"There is a long tradition here in talking about alternative energy transformation. We had a lot of good scientific background and a very good basis for the government to come to such decisions in a very short timeframe... Just three months' discussion for such an ambitious energy concept would not have been possible without that.\" Discussions are one thing. The reality, however, is proving quite another. \"Now we have to construct new power lines, now people will see new biomass facilities very close to their houses, they will see new wind farms... the [crucial] social challenge is really to get public acceptance for all these many new investments.\" The sight of thousands of kilometres of power cables slicing through the German countryside, and the costs involved, are beginning to bite. A renewable energy surcharge has already seen the average family's energy bill increase by 47% in the past two years. There are also question marks over the transportation and storage of intermittent wind energy. However Fischedick argues that, \"90% of the technologies are already available... our analysis is we [will need] more long-term storage systems after 2030. That's not a short-term challenge it is more of mid-to-long term. The short-term challenge is how to realise appropriate infrastructure on the electricity grid side... the main question at the moment is how we will be able to construct and get public acceptance for new power lines.\" The prosumer model While a lot of the media attention has been focused on large-scale wind farms (and Fischedick expects wind power to contribute half of the 80% renewable energy target by 2050), one of the most fascinating aspects of Energiewende is how it embraces micro-generation and micro-ownership. Public acceptance is, says Fischedick, much easier to maintain if it is paralleled with levels of individual ownership. Also known as a 'prosumer' model, over 50% of renewable-energy capacity is owned by individuals or farmers in Germany; the Big Four energy companies own just 6.5% (according to 2010 figures). \"This is PV, co-generation... really small facilities,\" says Fischedick. \"The prosumer aspect is vitally important... if you only have the chance to look from outside at the changes then you are much more [likely to be] complaining about what is going on.\" This in turn is causing the big utility companies to reassess their role. Rather than continuing to rely on business-as-usual, they are significantly ramping up investment in biomass plants, offshore wind and large-scale photovoltaic plants, informs Fischedick. \"In addition we have some utility companies looking at becoming a sort of service provider for the prosumer; RWE for instance provide a new service for the typical house owner to help them construct their own PV system on the roof, and to combine it with a small-scale battery. They have really changed their business portfolio in the last two years, just to be part of the game.\" Changing mindsets Despite the vast scale of the infrastructure and investment challenge, it is perhaps smaller than the more abstract task of changing people's lifestyles – which, Fischedick argues, has so far been avoided by the government. Reducing energy consumption by half cannot be done without changing consumer behaviour. This, says Fischedick, involves individuals being \"more motivated to look at their own consumption of energy, because many people are not really aware of that... we have to explain that it is not enough to only invest in new insulation of buildings, but to combine it with appropriate and smart behaviour. That's a little bit connected with education... But also you have to discuss new forms of incentive systems, such as ecological taxes. It has not been discussed so far but I think it will be on the table in the next couple of years.\" The rising cost of energy – in a country that already has the second highest energy bills in Europe – need not be the insurmountable barrier to Energiewende that some have suggested, says Fischedick. \"The final energy bill is the most important aspect, not the increase in a specific price of kilowatt hours or cubic meters of gas. In combination with more investment in energy-efficient technologies, it is not necessarily the case that the energy bill will increase. It is that context that we have to really teach consumers\". That message is currently failing to reach consumers by being too meekly conveyed, says Fischedick. If there is a barrier to Energiewende, he believes it is perversely the very politicians that initiated it. \"In the context of the EU directive for energy efficiency, it was the German government who tried to make this directive weaker than it was proposed by the Commission... we have specific goals and a concept, but the real behaviour of the government is at the moment quite different.\" Perhaps the politicians could be forgiven a little wobble. To describe Germany's energy transformation as Herculean also serves to highlight its potential heroism – doing with urgency what most of the rest of the world is only saying is urgent. This could well see other countries playing catch up once again to the economic powerhouse of Europe. But with only seven years left to decommission 17 nuclear power plants, cut GHG emissions by 40% and energy consumption by 20%, it has a lot to do. And fast.

Most countries have already made voluntary pledges to roll out clean energy and cut carbon emissions, and Prof John Schellnhuber said the best hope of making nations keep their promises was moral pressure. Schellnhuber is a key member of the German delegation attending the Paris summit and has advised Angela Merkel and Pope Francis on climate change. He said there was reason for optimism about the Paris talks, where at least 80 heads of state are expected. “That is a very telling thing - a sign of hope - because people at the top level do not want to be tainted by failure,” he said. If a critical mass of big countries implement their pledges, he said in an interview with the Guardian, the move towards a global low-carbon economy would gain unstoppable momentum. “If some countries really honour their pledges, including China, Brazil, South Africa, US and Europe, I think we will get a dynamic that will transform the development of the century. This is not sheer optimism – it is based on analysis of how incumbent systems implode.” In July, Schellnhuber told a science conference in Paris that the world needed “an induced implosion of the carbon economy over the next 20-30 years. Otherwise we have no chance of avoiding dangerous, perhaps disastrous, climate change.” “The avalanche will start because ultimately nothing can compete with renewables,” he told the Guardian. “If you invest at [large] scale, inevitably we will end up with much cheaper, much more reliable, much safer technologies in the energy system: wind, solar, biomass, tidal, hydropower. It is really a no-brainer, if you take away all the ideological debris and lobbying.” India, for example, aims to deliver 350GW of renewable energy in the next 10 years, the equivalent to 300 nuclear power stations, he said. “That is mind boggling and would be the final nail in the coffin of coal-fired power stations,” Schellnhuber said. “If India delivers on that pledge, it will be a tipping point for that country.” He said the approach taken for the Paris talks, asking each nation to put forward a pledge, had resulted in half the emissions cuts needed to avoid more than 2C in warming, the level widely considered as dangerous. “These are pledges only, but nevertheless this bottom-up approach is driving change, and that is amazing as it is the weakest approach,” Schellnhuber said. The key, he said, was that these pledges are honoured and future reviews deliver the rest of the cuts needed. But he warned there will be no international force to check and enforce carbon cuts, as nations would not allow such a challenge to their sovereignty. “The verification will not be delivered by an international scheme,” he said. “You will not send in emissions inspectors like people wanted to send to Iran [for nuclear technology inspections].” Instead, he said: “It is prestige, it is image, it is a moral issue, it is how you appear to the world. If the Chinese, for example, make a pledge, they want to keep it. They do not want to lose face.” Public pressure is “really holding the key to this”, said Schellnhuber, who has attended most of the 20 previous UN climate summits. “The last, best hope we have is moral argument.” He said that Germany’s aim to cut carbon emissions by 40% by 2020 was a tall order, because dealing with its lignite coal-fired power stations will be “very expensive and difficult”. But he said: “Merkel will do everything to achieve this or it will be seen as a national failure.” The biggest danger for the Paris summit, he said, was the $100bn a year from 2020 promised by rich nations help poorer countries cope with climate change, which has yet to be delivered. He said the sum was “peanuts” in the context of global investment flows, but that a failure to deliver would “make countries in the global south very angry”. “We can afford $100bn across the world, but it seems the OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] countries are still very reluctant,” Schellnhuber said. “It will divert attention from the serious work – making sure the pledges are honoured.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/nov/09/hugh-fearnley-whittingstall-rejects-morissons-pathetic-wonky-veg-trial","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-09T06:30:05Z","webTitle":"Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall rejects Morrisons' 'pathetic' wonky veg trial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/09/hugh-fearnley-whittingstall-rejects-morissons-pathetic-wonky-veg-trial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/09/hugh-fearnley-whittingstall-rejects-morissons-pathetic-wonky-veg-trial","fields":{"headline":"Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall rejects Morrisons' 'pathetic' wonky veg trial","bodyText":"Supermarket Morrisons’ efforts to encourage customers to buy wonkier-shaped vegetables have been branded “pathetic” by the chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. The BBC show Hugh’s War on Waste last week saw the broadcaster giving away oversized and curvy parsnips outside a Morrisons branch in Wimbledon, to highlight the food waste he says is caused by supermarkets’ excessively exacting cosmetic standards. In response the supermarket undertook a trial of selling wonky courgettes alongside so-called ‘class one’ courgettes, but found the ‘ugly’ ones sold much more slowly. “When you see the frankly pathetic little trial that Morrisons did with those courgettes, where they put some really substandard squashy ended ones in one pile next to some gleaming perfect ones at the same price, would you believe, people went for the really lovely ones? That’s not what we’re asking supermarkets to do,” Fearnley-Whittingstall told the Guardian in an interview. Morrisons rejected the chef’s criticism, saying some of the wonkier veg were only older because there were selling more slowly than the normal ones. The wonkier veg were sold at the same price as the class one courgettes, and labelled class two. A Morrisons’ spokesman said customers had “voted with their feet”, and the only wonky veg that sold well in a trial in its Milton Keynes store was when bagged up and sold at a reduced price as a ‘value’ option. However the company told the Guardian that before the end of the year it would begin permanently selling lines of wonky potatoes, carrots, onions and parsnips at cheaper-than-normal prices across its stores. Fearnley-Whittingstall was also critical of supermarkets’ increasing use of anaerobic digestion (AD), where their food waste is sent to plants to capture the gas released as it breaks down, for use as electricity. Sainsbury’s has previously said it’s the biggest user of AD in the UK. “When we know there are hungry people, the idea of making electricity out of food when we could be feeding people, feels wrong. But actually scientifically it’s the wrong thing to do, because the energy recovery from AD is pathetic, compared to the energy recovered by people eating food.” He said that while AD was better than landfill and did have a place – for food scrapped off plates in the catering industry and an inevitable small amount of waste at supermarkets – it was being used as a way to justify the overproduction of food. “You’re in a dangerous situation where overproduction of food is something that, if it suits them, big corporations can do almost with gay abandon, without fear of consequence.” Sainsbury’s said that it only sent food to AD after it had exhausted other options, such as donating it to to charities or using it as an animal feed. It said that, for example, less than 2% of surplus bread is sent to AD. Fearnley-Whittingstall admitted that the challenge of tackling food waste was a bigger one than his previous ‘Fish Fight’ series. He said the government had not helped by slashing the budget for its food waste agency in half. “Of course I think they were wrong to slash the budget on communicating about this problem. This government’s done one bizarre thing after another recently. Slashing all the tariffs for renewable energy and putting out a big red carpet for China to build nuclear power stations all over the country, I don’t think that’s the smartest thing they’ve done either.” But the chef said that consumers had to take responsibility for food waste too, and said some people took “use-by” dates too literally. “We’ve lost the sense of responsibility for our actions, and of trusting our own resources, our nose and our common sense.” He said he did not want use-by labels scrapped but for people to understand them better. “Use-by sounds like an order. It sounds like an instruction. It makes people think that at midnight on the 29th, something’s going to go from a perfectly safe food to a deadly poison, and of course it isn’t like that.” Fearnley-Whittingstall said that while he was very frugal and wasted little food at home, his one food waste vice was apples. “My guilty secret is that I can’t eat an apple core. My wife can eat a whole apple and then she eats the core. She bites one end off and then the other, and then the middle, and is left with a tiny stalk in her hand. I can now bite it down to a pencil-sized core.” Episode two of Hugh’s War on Waste is broadcast on BBC One at 9pm on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/the-northerner/2015/aug/17/how-happy-britain-live-north-hamptons","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-17T16:21:20Z","webTitle":"How to be happy in Britain: live in the north","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/the-northerner/2015/aug/17/how-happy-britain-live-north-hamptons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/the-northerner/2015/aug/17/how-happy-britain-live-north-hamptons","fields":{"headline":"How to be happy in Britain: live in the north","bodyText":"For a happier life and an affordable home, leave London and head to the north of England or remotest Scotland, research suggests. Parts of Cumbria and Teesside – as well as Eilean Siar, the Scottish Western Isles – manage to best combine affordability with life satisfaction, topping a list compiled by a firm of estate agents. Londoners, meanwhile, suffer the depressing combination of being unable to afford to live well in a city that doesn’t make them happy, according to the analysis by Hamptons International. Using house-price-to-income ratios and the Life Satisfaction Index from the Office of National Statistics, Hamptons worked out which areas of Britain have the cheapest homes and cheeriest inhabitants. Allerdale in north Cumbria came top of the list. Though boasting more than its fair share of beaches, lakes and mountains, it is not necessarily the most obvious utopia, containing towns such as Maryport and Workington, home to some of the most deprived neighbourhoods in Britain. But Allerdale’s poetic mayor, Len Davies, was unsurprised. “I was born and raised in Liverpool and now I live in paradise,” he said on Monday. “Crime levels are remarkably low and the house prices would make people in the south faint. You can get a three-bed semi for £89,000 in a place that’s absolutely stunning. I’ve seen salmon spawning in crystal clear water and herons catching fish; I’ve been up close to a kingfisher.” He admitted the research may have been skewed somewhat by the high salaries earned by some Allerdale residents down at Sellafield nuclear power station in neighbouring Copeland, which came third on the list after the Ribble Valley in Lancashire. “If Sellafield went down, we would be in serious trouble,” said Davies. The average weekly gross salary for a full-time worker in Allerdale is £511.04, compared with the national average of £520.80. In fourth place was the Staffordshire Moorlands, where an average two-bed property costs £115,000 – compared with £375,000 in the most miserable place, Haringey in north London. Six of the 10 areas deemed the least happy and most expensive places are in the capital. These include Hammersmith and Fulham, where a two-bed property costs £618,000, along with Lewisham (£298,000), Brent (£326,000) and Ealing (£360,000). There is a seven-bed house with heated swimming pool currently on the market for offers above £280,000 in Stockton-on-Tees, which came fifth top for happiness and affordability. To compile the list, Hamptons identified the most affordable and least affordable areas, where the house-price-to-income ratio was either within the lowest 25% or highest 25%. “We then ranked these areas by happiness and life satisfaction ratings from the ONS,” said Johnny Morris, head of research at Hamptons. “Overall it’s housing markets close to areas of outstanding natural beauty that top the list as happiest and affordable places to live. Life in the country, a good view and not too many neighbours seem to be some of the secrets to happiness.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/oct/01/netanyahu-israel-isis-iran-nuclear-deal-palestine-middle-east","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-01T19:39:48Z","webTitle":"Netanyahu predicts Arab countries will align with Israel against Iran and Isis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/01/netanyahu-israel-isis-iran-nuclear-deal-palestine-middle-east","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/oct/01/netanyahu-israel-isis-iran-nuclear-deal-palestine-middle-east","fields":{"headline":"Netanyahu predicts Arab countries will align with Israel against Iran and Isis","bodyText":"The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has claimed that shifting alliances in the Middle East are drawing Arab countries closer to the Jewish state in confronting the common enemies of Iran and Islamic State. In a lengthy speech to the UN general assembly, punctuated by long pauses in which he glared at delegates after denouncing them as “obsessively hostile” to Israel, Netanyahu said he hoped the shared threat posed by Tehran and Islamic State would remake the politics of the region. “Common dangers are clearly bringing Israel and its Arab neighbours closer and as we work together to thwart those dangers, I hope we’ll build lasting partnerships,” he said. But Netanyahu spent much of his speech re-fighting the lost battle over the US-led nuclear deal with Iran. He attempted to tie the agreement, which sees the lifting of sanctions in return for Iran committing to peaceful use of nuclear power and UN monitoring, to the west’s conflict with Isis by saying that easing the embargo on Tehran will only lead to more terrorism. “Many in our region know that both Iran and Isis are our common enemies and when your enemies are fighting one another, don’t strengthen either one, weaken both,” he said. He accused Iran of setting up new terror cells in cities around the world. “This deal doesn’t make peace more likely. By fuelling Iran’s aggressions with billions of dollars in sanctions relief, it makes war likely,” Netanyahu said. “Unleashed and unmuzzled, Iran will go on the prowl, devouring more and more prey ... You think hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief and fat contracts will turn this rapacious tiger into a kitten?” Netanyahu said Israel will not allow Iran “to break in, to sneak in, or to walk into the nuclear weapons club”. “Make sure Iran’s violations are not swept under the Persian rug. One thing I can assure you: Israel will be watching closely,” he said. The Israeli prime minister painted much the same apocalyptic vision to the US Congress this year and in earlier addresses to the UN. But with the Iran agreement sealed, his lengthy denunciation came across more as venting frustration than a serous shot at changing minds. “It’s not easy to oppose something that is embraced by the greatest powers in the world,” he acknowledged. But he added: “I refuse to be silent.” After his lengthy criticism of President Obama’s signature foreign policy achievement, Netanyahu sought to smooth the waters with the Americans. “Our differences about the nuclear deal are a disagreement within the family,” he said. But the US delegation sat silently during applause, most of which came from Netanyahu’s supporters who packed the gallery and clapped with unusual vigour. The Israeli prime minister only got around to speaking about the Palestinians more than half an hour into his speech. On Wednesday, the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, said Palestinians are no longer bound by the two decades old Oslo peace accords because Israel is not serious about the creation of an independent state out of the occupied territories. Abbas accused Netanyahu of imposing a form of apartheid on the West Bank and appealed for the UN to provide protection for the Palestinians. Netanyahu said, as he has in the past, that he is “prepared to immediately resume peace negotiations with the Palestinians without any preconditions whatsoever”, and he made a direct appeal to Abbas. “President Abbas, I know it’s not easy, I know it’s hard, but we owe it to our people to try, to continue to try,” he said. The Palestinians say that Netanyahu’s assertion that peace talks should be “unconditional” is so that Israel can continue to expand settlements in the West Bank and effectively annex land under the cover of talks. The Palestinians want an immediate halt to settlement growth and early agreement about the borders of a state."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/nov/11/india-could-push-world-into-climate-change-danger-zone-warn-scientists","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-11T13:15:01Z","webTitle":"India could push world into climate change danger zone, warn scientists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/india-could-push-world-into-climate-change-danger-zone-warn-scientists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/nov/11/india-could-push-world-into-climate-change-danger-zone-warn-scientists","fields":{"headline":"India could push world into climate change danger zone, warn scientists","bodyText":"India’s growth in emissions could tip the world over the threshold to dangerous climate change, experts have said. The alert comes as the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, prepares to visit the UK on Thursday for talks on issues including the environment. India is due to ask the UK and other rich nations to share breakthroughs in renewable energy and other “clean” technology, and for help financing a huge expansion in efficiency and solar and wind power. It is unclear whether British officials will pressure Modi to consider a tougher emissions target. Before the UN climate summit in Paris in December, India has pledged to increase carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions more slowly than the economy grows. The latest analysis of India’s plan calculates that if it expands as it hopes – by more than 8.5% a year – emissions will reach 9bn megatonnes by the end of the next decade. This is about one-fifth of the total annual emissions that scientists calculate the world can emit in 2030 and still have a more than a 50% chance of avoiding the global temperature rising more than 2C, considered a dangerous threshold. Although India would rank second behind China for total emissions, unlike China and other large emitters it has not set a date by which they would peak, while new coal-fired power and other new infrastructure would commit the country to relatively high pollution levels for decades. “If India’s plans to burn coal go ahead, it will make it hard for us to make the two degree target,” said Bob Ward, policy director of the Grantham institute on climate change and the environment, at the London School of Economics, which carried out the study. “The chances are growth will be lower, but it’s hard to imagine we’ll get down to a pattern consistent with two degrees.” Further pressure has been put on India by the International Energy Agency, which on Tuesday published it’s annual report on global energy use, and considered the Indian case to be so critical that it devoted several chapters to the country’s rapidly rising use of coal and oil in particular. “Meeting India’s energy needs requires … constant vigilance as to the implications for energy security and the environment,” the IEA said. Although India has so far failed to meet its hopes for growth, its population is expected to rise from 1.2 billion to 1.5 billion by the middle of this century – overtaking China as the world’s largest – and it is pursuing aggressive expansion of industry and energy production to lift an estimated 300 million people out of poverty. “It is estimated that more than half of [the] India of 2030 is yet to be built,” the government has said, citing “exponential” growth in demand for housing, energy, transport, water and waste disposal. The risks posed by India’s rapid growth are at the heart of ongoing tension between rich and poor nations, with developing and emerging economies arguing that countries that have already become rich on fossil fuel energy should make deeper cuts in emissions rather than curb poorer countries’ growth. India’s emissions per person are 1.7 metric tons a year, compared with nearly 17t in the US and more than 7t in both China and the European Union. “India’s argument is that they have development challenges which must take priority, and currently the cheapest route to development is through high-carbon infrastructure,” said Diarmuid Torney, author of a new book on China and India’s climate policies. “They don’t have time to wait for the cost of renewable energy to fall “But if India’s emissions increase at the projected rate and developed country emissions don’t decline rapidly over the short to medium term, then the maths does get us into trouble.” Climate Action Tracker, which has analysed 26 emissions pledges covering 53 countries (including the EU) ahead of the UN-hosted Paris meeting (these account for 80% of the global total) estimates that India’s emissions would reach about 5bn tonnes, based on lower external forecasts of the country’s growth. India has made a potentially more ambitious promise to generate 40% of electricity from renewable sources – including nuclear power – by 2030, but this depends on external help. Alongside the US, EU and China, Cat ranks India’s plans as “medium”. It adds: “It is not consistent with limiting warming to below 2C, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort.” • This article was amended on 13 November 2015. An earlier version quoting research from the Carbon Action Tracker said that India’s emissions would reach 5bn mega-tonnes and that the CAT had analysed 131 climate pledges, covering 158 countries. These have been corrected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/nov/26/will-the-uk-be-the-joker-in-the-pack-at-paris-climate-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-26T10:44:14Z","webTitle":"Will the UK be the joker in the pack at Paris climate talks? | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/nov/26/will-the-uk-be-the-joker-in-the-pack-at-paris-climate-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/nov/26/will-the-uk-be-the-joker-in-the-pack-at-paris-climate-talks","fields":{"headline":"Will the UK be the joker in the pack at Paris climate talks?","bodyText":"If the crucial Paris climate summit is the highest stakes poker game of international diplomacy ever held, David Cameron will sit down on Monday with little but bluff. The UK has thrown away trump card after trump card, with the latest being £1bn of support for carbon capture and storage, dumped by the chancellor, George Osborne, on Wednesday. Trust is the vital ingredient in the UN climate negotiations, because they are built on voluntary pledges. Each nation has to believe that every other nation will honour its pledges to cut carbon emissions or provide green funds. But the UK government’s actions since it won the general election in May will make other countries think the UK is not good for its stake in the game. Just six months ago, the Conservative party manifesto promised £1bn for CCS. Last September, Cameron trumpeted the funding at the UN. On Wednesday, that promise was broken. When the goal is as challenging as beating an existential threat to civilisation by re-engineering most of the world’s economy, broken promises are toxic. The Paris summit will succeed if the world is left in no doubt that a low-carbon planet is an inevitability. That means believing that governments will meet their carbon targets. Yet virtually everything done by the Conservative government since May has made meeting the UK’s carbon targets less likely, not more. CCS is seen as essential to meeting carbon targets cost effectively yet Osborne prefers to save £1bn now at the expense of many billions later. (He’s also sending €300m of CCS funding back to Brussels.) With a new dash for gas underway, no CCS means either busting carbon targets or shutting plants before they have paid for themselves. On Thursday, the folly of abandoning the requirement for new homes to be zero-carbon was exposed by the government’s own advisers, the Committee on Climate Change. To meet carbon targets, all the new homes Osborne has promised will have to be expensively retrofitted later. The UK’s homes are the source of about one-third of the nation’s carbon emissions, but are among the leakiest in Europe. Energy efficiency is the cheapest way to cut carbon, as well as help poorer households and save lives in winter, yet Osborne cut funding by 83%. A big green heating scheme was cut by 40%. Like the CCS fund, the green investment bank (GIB) is constantly cited by Cameron as evidence of the UK’s green credentials, a “world first” he told the UN. The GIB has used its government ownership to turn £2.3bn into green infrastructure projects worth £10.1bn - ministers are now selling it off. There’s more, much more. Support for solar power, biomass and biogas are being slashed. Onshore windfarms, the cheapest green energy, are being blocked. All this just as the fast-falling cost of renewables means subsidies are close to no longer being needed. The chancellor is also tilting the playing field by ramping up subsidies for oil and gas, the only G7 nation doing so, and imposing a carbon tax on renewable energy (no, really). Tax breaks for clean cars have gone too. “The UK’s security and prosperity is vulnerable to climate change,” said Osborne’s spending plan on Wednesday. Yet actions speak louder than words. “Do as I say, not as I do,” is a feeble hand for him to give Cameron to take to Paris. A few decent cards remain. The UK’s commitment to foreign aid, and particularly climate aid, has been resolute and substantial: £5.8bn. But, for example, “kick-starting a solar revolution” abroad while ending a promised one at home is a contradictory message. The UK is committing many billions of billpayers’ money to a new nuclear power station, and wants more to follow. Nuclear is low-carbon, but whether it can arrive in time is another matter. The same applies to Osborne’s favourite new technology, small modular reactors, which will be incentivised by a new competition - just as the CCS competition is abandoned. Offshore wind is being strongly supported and the UK is a world leader. But onshore wind is far cheaper, and only opposed by a vociferous minority. When Cameron stands up to speak at the UN summit in Paris on Monday, he may reprise his previous UN climate speech: “Climate change is a threat to our national security, to global security, to poverty eradication and to economic prosperity.” He is right. But with the UK heading back to a 20th century world of gas (without CCS) and nuclear, while cutting the 21st century options of energy efficiency and renewables, will anyone trust his commitment to halting global warming? If not, the UK will be left as the joker in the pack, and saving the planet will be harder than ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/oct/20/david-cameron-xi-jinping-promises-chinese-government","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-20T12:08:27Z","webTitle":"My advice for David Cameron – treat Xi Jinping’s promises with caution | Mark Kitto","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/20/david-cameron-xi-jinping-promises-chinese-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/20/david-cameron-xi-jinping-promises-chinese-government","fields":{"headline":"My advice for David Cameron – treat Xi Jinping’s promises with caution","bodyText":"When Xi Jinping, the president of China, makes his state visit to the UK this week, he will bring a message of forgiveness – for Britain’s now forsworn attempts to “interfere with China’s internal affairs” such as human rights and Tibet – and hope. President Xi will offer David Cameron life-saving investment in the British economy and an increasing share of the emerging Chinese domestic market for Britain’s exports. The Chinese delegation is expected to sign off on a multimillion-pound investment in Hinkley Point nuclear power station, and a number of other infrastructure projects. The images of Xi being honoured by the Queen, when they are broadcast in China, will bring a massive boost to the sale of British goods to the imminent Chinese “consumer-led” economy. In a nutshell, President Xi Jinping is going to rescue Britain. The Chinese government once offered to rescue me too. It was about 10 years ago, in China, when I ran a media business worth $4m a year in sales. I published print magazines and websites. All media in China is controlled by the Communist party, via the State Council Information Office. After seven years of political and commercial battles, during which I was obliged to work with various levels of government and the party, an official from the Information Office told me my troubles were over. His precise words were: “Mark, now that you are working with us, you have nothing to fear. Everything will be fine.” The Information Office proceeded to subvert my brand and disrupt my business. We had a dispute, which ended in the Beijing court of appeal. In the final hearing, a provincial government official I had worked with for many years took the stand and read out a letter he had received. It was signed, and it was from the man who told me I had nothing to fear. “You are to create a back-dated document so we can secure the rights to the trademark,” it said, and concluded: “It is your duty to help us teach this foreigner a lesson.” My lawyer was summoned to court to collect the decision, which we had been told was in our favour. He never made it. Stuck in traffic, he took a call on his mobile. “The decision has been cancelled.” He called the judge. “It is impossible for me to discuss this,” she said, and hung up. The government official who had told me I had nothing to fear took my business and my trademark, and went on to destroy my career. He made it impossible for me to work in the media in China. When I tell this story, the standard reaction is: things have changed for the better; that would never happen in China today. And now: “Xi Jinping is going to make reforms that will liberate the Chinese market and economy, so everything will be all right.” They are incorrect. The commercial environment in China, especially for foreign companies, but also domestic ones, has worsened. Ask a member of any foreign chamber of commerce there. Xi has not implemented reforms. He has clamped down on political dissent, and where he has attempted to solve economic problems, he has been at best cack-handed. Note the third-person singular. Xi has concentrated personal power in a way no Chinese leader since Mao Zedong has done, which goes expressly against the legacy of Deng Xiaoping, the only truly reforming party leader (and he had little choice). Nor is China “about to become a consumer-led economy”, as observers have been repeating for years. There will be no such thing in China until the party makes reforms to society that will affect its own grip on power, and it cannot do that. I wonder if, in London this week, Xi will say: “David, now that you are working with us, you have nothing to fear. Everything will be fine.” That will certainly be the message. David Cameron should be wary of it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2015/oct/19/uk-china-concern-derision-west-cameron-economic-benefits-strategic-costs-beijing","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-19T18:29:00Z","webTitle":"UK's wooing of China met with concern and derision in rest of west","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/19/uk-china-concern-derision-west-cameron-economic-benefits-strategic-costs-beijing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/oct/19/uk-china-concern-derision-west-cameron-economic-benefits-strategic-costs-beijing","fields":{"headline":"UK's wooing of China met with concern and derision in rest of west","bodyText":"Britain’s eager courtship of China, which will reach its peak on Tuesday with the start of the state visit by the country’s president, Xi Jinping, is viewed in other western capitals with a mixture of concern and derision. Critics argue that the Cameron government may be overestimating the economic benefits of its “golden decade” strategy on China, and grossly underestimating the strategic costs, in terms of dependence on Beijing for critical infrastructure and alienating Washington and other western allies. “I think there is obviously going to be concern from the administration that there is too much of a gap between the US approach to China on a whole basket of issues, of which cybersecurity is the most pressing, and the messaging from the UK government during the visit,” said Heather Conley, a former US state department official now with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. The contrast in the mood music of Xi’s stay in Buckingham Palace this week and his visit to US last month is marked. Just before his arrival in Washington, Barack Obama threatened to impose sanctions on China for cyber-attacks on US companies, and withheld them when Xi pledged to avoid “knowingly” hacking American firms. A report issued on Monday, however, suggested the attacks were still going on. “What I think Washington is seeking from the UK is a balanced approach to Beijing,” Conley asaid. “We appreciate the economic importance of the relationship but if there is no balance with the values promoted by the western community, then the policy is not going to be durable. There is growing concern the UK approach doesn’t have that balance.” Philippe Le Corre, a French expert and the author of a forthcoming book on Chinese investment strategy called China’s Offensive in Europe, said Britain was not alone in its courtship of Beijing. Germany’s Angela Merkel will be going to China next week, and France’s François Hollande will be following in her wake next month. But he said the UK was going further than other major European states in terms of opening up sensitive infrastructure such as national railways and nuclear power stations. “It could be that expectations are too high and there will be fewer deals than expected. The financing part is always a bit more complicated than people think. Chinese banks will have to get their act together,” Le Corre, now a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said. “The key question is infrastructure and whether the UK has given away too much of its stakes and assets to a country like China,” he added. “In the long run David Cameron is taking a risk both in terms of the infrastructure assets and Britain’s long-term relationships by trying to be China’s best friend when China has a very different way at looking at the world. That is especially true when there is tension between the US and the China over the Pacific.” If those Pacific tensions worsen, the UK could be forced into a situation where it has to choose between the US and China. “The biggest threat to international security is in Asia, the rise of China and the possibility of a great power confrontation. That’s what Britain should be thinking about,” said Hans Kundnani, a fellow of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, based in Berlin. Germany has hitherto seen itself as China’s most important trading partner in Europe and Kundnani said “some people in Berlin see this a rather pathetic British attempt to compete”. He said Germany had been criticised previously for downgrading human rights and political issues in its dealing with China, but added: “I find it quite shocking that Britain is not just doing the same thing but going much further. It is doing it even more dramatically and even more embarrassingly. “I used to say that the UK is different in that its foreign policy is based on the premise that the UK is part of the security council. If you’re a permanent member of the security council you have to be provider of security not just a consumer. Britain seems to be jettisoning those responsibilities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/mar/12/spain-security-law-protesters-freedom-expression","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-12T20:38:48Z","webTitle":"Spain puts 'gag' on freedom of expression as senate approves security law","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/12/spain-security-law-protesters-freedom-expression","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/mar/12/spain-security-law-protesters-freedom-expression","fields":{"headline":"Spain puts 'gag' on freedom of expression as senate approves security law","bodyText":"The Spanish senate has voted to push forward with controversial changes to the country’s public security laws, cracking down on Spaniards’ rights of freedom of assembly and expression despite opposition from activists and human rights groups. Recent years have seen millions of Spaniards take to the streets to voice their dissatisfaction with the rightwing People’s party government, protesting against crippling austerity measures and attempts to roll back the country’s abortion laws. Now the government has hit back with legislation, dubbed the “gag law” by critics, that seeks to limit protests by laying out strict guidelines on when and where they can take place and penalising offenders with steep fines. The legislation includes fines of up to 600 euros for failing to notify authorities about demonstrations in public areas, even in the case of peaceful protests. Once approved, marches that veer from the approved itineraries could face fines of up to 600 euros. The fines climb to 30,000 euros for protests that result in “serious disturbances of public safety” near parliament and Spain’s regional government buildings. Unauthorised protests that take place near key infrastructure, such as transportation hubs, nuclear power plants, refineries and telecommunications installations could result in fines of up to 600,000 euros. The legislation will now head to Spain’s Congress of Deputies, where the legislation is expected to be ratified by the end of the month. Greenpeace, whose members were recently hauled into court over a 2011 demonstration held at a nuclear power plant in Valencia, has spoken out against the legislation. “It’s our right to express our opinion, to march to parliament, to go to nuclear power plants to say that they are dangerous or unfurl a banner on a building or street,” said Miguel Ángel Soto of the group. Recent months have seen thousands of Spaniards pour into the streets of more than 25 cities and towns to voice their discontent with the bill, tying bright blue cloths over their mouths to demonstrate the chilling effect the law would have on free speech. A December poll by Metroscopia for Avaaz.org found that 82% of the 600 people queried thought the legislation should be modified or abandoned. The legislation is both disproportionate and unnecessary, said Virginia Pérez Alonso of the Platform in Defence of Freedom of Information. “This is one of the worst attacks on liberties that we’ve seen in Spain since the times of Franco.” In a country where home evictions took place at a rate of 95 families a day in 2014, the proposed laws take aim at groups such as the Mortgage Victims’ Platform whose spontaneous rallies in front of homes seek to physically block police from carrying out court-ordered evictions. The legislation stipulates fines of up to 30,000 euros for those who prevent government employees from enforcing administrative or judicial orders. “The law will criminalise and penalise the actions of the movements for the right to housing “ said Carlos Macias of the Mortgage Victims’ Platform. “These are actions that are simply being carried out as a form of self-protection,” he added. As the legislation also includes fines of up to 30,000 euros for disseminating images of police officers “that would endanger their safety or that of protected areas or put the success of an operation at risk”, the proposed laws have evoked fears of self-censorship among some journalists, said Susana Sanz Guardo. An activist who often live-streams protests, focusing on interactions between police and protesters, she said the legislation would result in a “total block of the type of journalism I do”. The ultimate result, she said would be diminished accountability of law enforcement officers for their actions during protests. As the Spanish government faces mounting criticism over the actions of its authorities at the borders of its enclaves in Melilla and Ceuta, the legislation also seeks to formalise the practice of summary returns to Morocco of migrants who are caught attempting to jump the triple razor wire fence at the borders. The legislation has been widely criticised outside Spain, including by a panel of five UN human rights experts who, in a statement, noted that the reforms “unnecessarily and disproportionately restrict basic freedoms”. The Spanish government has repeatedly defended the bill, insisting it will improve public security by targeting the protesters who are prone to violence. “It’s a law for the 21st century,” Spain’s interior minister, Jorge Fernández Díaz, said recently. “It provides better guarantees for people’s security and more judicial security for people’s rights. The legislation is expected to be finalised later this month. As the PP holds a majority in both houses of parliament in Spain, the legislation is certain to pass. The bulk of measures included in the legislation are expected to come into effect in July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2015/sep/29/guardian-weekly-obama-putin-un-development-goals","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-29T15:22:04Z","webTitle":"Inside the 2 October edition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/sep/29/guardian-weekly-obama-putin-un-development-goals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2015/sep/29/guardian-weekly-obama-putin-un-development-goals","fields":{"headline":"Inside the 2 October edition","bodyText":"The glacial handshakes, the abstracted facial expressions, the excruciating drinks toasts … it could only be a meeting between those old buddies Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin. Yet as the two leaders convened for a rare discussion on the fringes of the 70th United Nations general assembly, it appeared there were signs that the US and Russia might be able to work together on a solution to the Syrian conflict. There’s a rundown of the details, not to mention the barbed comments, inside this week’s edition. Our cover story focuses on another aspect of UN business. As the international millennium development goals were officially wound down last weekend, Guardian reporter Sam Jones asks how far the 15-year UN plan “to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanising conditions of extreme poverty” has achieved its original objectives. At times it was hard to keep up with the breakneck pace of international developments last week. In Germany, car manufacturer Volkswagen admitted to a software scam to rig emissions tests on millions of its diesel engines. Saudi Arabia’s government was criticised after a crowd stampede at the hajj pilgrimage killed upwards of 760 people in Mecca. Colombia’s government made significant progress with Farc rebels in clearing the way to a peace deal. And in Spain, a coalition of Catalan separatists restated independence claims after victory in regional elections. You’ll find reflective coverage of these significant stories in this week’s paper.

On Friday, the campaigners were convicted in a court in suburban Seattle of misdemeanor trespassing relating to a September 2014 protest in which they blocked railway tracks used by crude oil trains in Everett, Washington. They were acquitted of a second count of misdemeanor obstructing a train. The so-called “Delta 5” – Michael LaPointe, Patrick Mazza, Jackie Minchew, Elizabeth Spoerri and Abigail Brockway – had hoped that their trial would mark the first time that a US jury was allowed to consider the “necessity defense” in a case of climate activism. The defendants intended to argue that their acts, though illegal, were necessary to prevent the greater harm of catastrophic climate change. But after allowing two days of expert testimony on topics ranging from the Paris climate talks to railway safety standards and the health impacts of particulate matter, Judge Anthony E Howard ruled that the defense had failed to present sufficient evidence to show that the defendants had “no reasonable legal alternative” to trespassing on a private rail yard and blocking trains. The case is a blow to environmental campaigners but marks the furthest defendants have managed to go in an American courtroom using the so-called “necessity” defense that argues such actions are justified to combat catastrophic climate change. The activists progressed unusually far because Howard allowed them to call expert witnesses to testify to the harms of climate change, even though he later felt compelled to instruct the jury to disregard their evidence. The judge appeared to do so reluctantly, expressing some sympathy for the activists in a court on Thursday. “Frankly the court is convinced that the defendants are far from the problem and are part of the solution to the problem of climate change,” Howard said from the bench. But, he added: “I am bound by legal precedent, no matter what my personal beliefs might be.” That precedent, including a per se ban on necessity defenses in cases of indirect civil disobedience by the ninth circuit court of appeals, is overwhelmingly against the idea that such an argument should be available to defendants. After his ruling, the judge directed the jury to disregard the expert testimony on climate change, public health, and the dangers of transporting crude oil by train. In an act of judicial consolation, Howard added that he hoped the defendants, whom he described as “tireless advocates of the kind that we need more of in this society”, would find “some value in having been able to present their beliefs in a public forum”. He also allowed an extra 10 minutes for lunch on Thursday, in recognition of the fact that he had “just crushed your hopes and dreams”. Though the necessity defense dominated the proceedings in the courtroom, it is something of a legal oddity that MJ McCallum, Bridge Joyce and Evelyn Chuang – three of the four lawyers on the defense team – recalled learning about in law school through a case of sailors lost at sea who resorted to cannibalism when one of their fellow castaways died of natural causes. (The defendants in Regina v Dudley and Stephens were found guilty when they admitted that they actually murdered the child they ate, but trust a defense team to put a different spin on it.) Robert Goldsmith was the sole attorney on the defense team to have argued for necessity, which he did successfully, once, in the 1979 case of 20 protesters who blocked the entrance to the Zion nuclear power plant in Waukegan, Illinois. Despite the odds, however, the necessity defense remains the holy grail for some climate activists. “We’re going to keep working with folks to keep pushing these defenses,” said Tim DeChristopher, a climate activist who served 21 months behind bars for a civil disobedience action after a judge refused his attempt to employ the necessity defense. DeChristopher’s organization, Climate Disobedience Center, is supporting the efforts of another group that was arrested attempting to block a fracked natural gas pipeline in Westchester County, New York. According to DeChristopher, the protesters will try the necessity defense during a bench trial today, 15 January, in New York. The defense has been used successfully in the UK, where a jury acquitted six Greenpeace protesters in 2008 after they argued their occupation and damage to a Kingsnorth coal-fired power station in Kent was justified by the threat of climate change. Beyond the necessity defense, some climate activists are looking at other strategies in the US to challenge the limitations of statutory law and push for urgent governmental action to limit climate change. “Our legal principles have to account for the clear, imminent danger perpetrated by the fossil fuel industry,” said Mary Wood, a professor of environmental law at the University of Oregon. Wood is an advocate for applying “public trust doctrine” to climate change, arguing that a government has a fundamental responsibility to preserve crucial resources like the land, water, and air that “predates statutory law”. Michael Foster, who attended the Delta Five trial each day, works with Seattle youth who adopted Wood’s theory and sued the Washington state government for failing to adequately protect the environment for their generation. “The system is broken enough that we have to pursue every other avenue,” Foster said. In December, a judge issued a ruling in the case, which Foster described as “kickass poetry about the constitutional rights of these kids to air, land, and water”. Though the loss of the necessity defense in this case was a disappointment, DeChristopher remains hopeful that the law will be pushed to take a different view of climate change civil disobedience. “We understand that precedent is not in our favor,” he said, “but we also understand that people’s consciences are hard to oppress.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/sep/03/theresa-may-g20-china-britain-stronger-relationships","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-03T22:06:07Z","webTitle":"Theresa May to seek stronger relationships with G20 countries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/03/theresa-may-g20-china-britain-stronger-relationships","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/sep/03/theresa-may-g20-china-britain-stronger-relationships","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May to seek stronger relationships with G20 countries","bodyText":"Theresa May will tell the leaders of the world’s most powerful economies that the United Kingdom wants to strengthen its economic ties with countries beyond the European Union, as she lays out her vision of a post-Brexit Britain at her first big international summit as prime minister. Attending the G20 meeting in Hangzhou, China, May will address the opening session saying that, as the UK heads out of the EU, it remains “open for business” and is seeking to build new and stronger trade relations with countries across the globe. But diplomats past and present warned that she faces a huge test as a novice on the world stage, and will have to perform a delicate balancing act as she seeks to sell the UK to global leaders, while avoiding giving the impression that Britain is about to become a marginal player on the European stage. In a sign of her determination to show that the UK is embarking on a new phase in its diplomatic and economic relations, May will hold four bilateral meetings with the leaders of the US, China, Russia and India, but none with EU leaders. British officials have denied that she is cold-shouldering the Europeans, and stressed that since becoming prime minister she has already met the leaders of France and Germany to address the challenges of Brexit. The G20, they said, is her chance to convince other world leaders that the UK is a “dependable” partner which will “continue to play a bold confident and outward-looking role as it leaves the EU”. Speaking on BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday morning, recorded before she left for the G20, May said the economic figures were not as bad as some had predicted after the EU referendum vote. “What is important for us now is that we maintain that policy of ensuring economic stability and a strong economy for the future. Part of that is going to be, as we come out of the European Union, ensuring we’ve got trade deals around the world. I want the United Kingdom to be a global leader in free trade. “One of the things I’ll be doing at the G20 is emphasising the role that we will be playing in the world, but also in a number of the discussions I’ll be having, with President Obama, for example, prime minister Modi, prime minister Turnbull … ” A bilateral meeting with President Xi Jinping of China, after the official summit proceedings close on Monday, will arguably be May’s sternest test. Her decision, shortly after entering Downing Street, to delay a go-ahead for the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset, on which China has committed to spend billions of pounds, has severely strained relations with Bejing. The former UK foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told the Observer that the G20’s Chinese hosts would be “surprised and puzzled” by the UK’s vote to leave the EU, but would probably be more attentive to May as a result. “Although they will think that we are slightly barking for wanting to leave the EU, they will in some way see us as more interesting and needing more of their attention. We will be the second biggest economy in Europe, a permanent member of the UN security council, and a strong military power with the willingness to use that power.” However, Rifkind said the Hinkley Point issue would hover over the summit. “Whatever the wider and longer-term issues, Hinkley is the immediate test. The Chinese president and UK prime minister will be sizing each other up. Hinkley Point is directly relevant to China’s global economic ambitions. “If we drop Hinkley Point, and even if we stress that this is for economic reasons alone, the Chinese will see it as a major defeat for their ambitions. We will be seen as joining with the US and Australia in rejecting China as a partner, and that will not be helpful for relations. This may be the right decision for the UK to take, but there will be a price to pay.” May told Marr: “I’m looking at the Hinkley decision, but it’s about how I actually approach these things. I look at the evidence, I take the advice, I listen to that. That’s what I’m still doing. I’ve said there’ll be a decision in September.” Lord Wood of Anfield, a former senior adviser to Gordon Brown, said May would be thrown in at the deep end of international diplomacy at a crucial moment in the UK’s history. There was a risk of being seen as a bit player in Europe. “Theresa May has a tricky combination of challenges this week. In the wake of Brexit, she has to show that Britain’s relationship with Germany, France and Italy is not suffering,” Wood said. “She has to show that European ‘caucusing’ prior to and during the G20 is still alive and well. Any hint of Franco-German-Italian cosiness that excludes her risks suggesting we are on the way to becoming a second-tier G20 country. She will also need to consider the appropriate mixture of robustness and conciliation to adopt in her dealings with Vladimir Putin.” On her meeting with Barack Obama, Wood added: “She will have to show that Britain still matters to an outgoing president who has been increasingly speaking his mind, and whose advice on Brexit was conspicuously rejected by the British electorate.” Before boarding her plane for China, May insisted that UK-China relations have a bright future. “This is a golden era for UK-China relations, and one of the things I’ll be doing at the G20 is obviously talking to President Xi about how we can develop the strategic partnership that we have between the UK and China. But I’ll also be talking to other world leaders about how we can develop free trade around the globe and how Britain wants to seize those opportunities.” Global security and the fight against terrorism will also be high on the prime minister’s agenda. Margaret Thatcher’s former foreign policy adviser Lord Powell of Bayswater said he expected May to approach the G20 in a much more cautious manner than his former boss, who would have piled in with her demands and views. May would be more concerned with “signals” than substance. “In one day to be seeing Obama, Putin, and Xi Jinping is quite a scorecard. She will want to show that she believes the UK can make a success of Brexit. It will be a case of signals more than getting down to any definitive business.” ENEMIES ABROAD? Xi Jinping China’s president said on a state visit to London last year that he hoped Britain would be a “gateway to Europe” for his country. George Osborne, the then chancellor, talked of the UK being China’s “best partner in the west” and of a golden era of British-Chinese relations. Now, with Britain heading out of the EU and doubts over whether Theresa May will go ahead with the Hinkley Point C nuclear power project, into which China has agreed to pump billions of pounds, relations are tense. China has already made clear that it would regard abandonment of the project as a snub. After the summit, May will have a bilateral meeting with Xi at which she will make clear that the decision will be for the British government alone. Xi will view the eventual decision by the prime minister later this month as a test of how dependable the UK is and of its wider willingness to be a partner in China’s developing global economic ambitions. Vladimir Putin May will have a bilateral meeting with Putin on Sunday at which difficult security issues, including Russia’s role in Syria and actions in Ukraine will be raised. The Russian president is almost certainly the only G20 leader who will have welcomed and seen overall benefits for his country from Britain’s intended departure from the EU. Russia sees it as a sign that the bloc on his doorstep is no longer such a cohesive force and threat to his interests. Putin will also see potential for closer economic ties with the UK and may be looking for indications that the EU’s resolve behind sanctions against Russia will now weaken. But May will not want to risk angering the US or her EU counterparts, with whom she must negotiate Brexit, by cuddling up too much to Moscow. François Hollande With Hollande facing presidential elections next year, he is sending a tough message to the British prime minister about future relations with Europe. France is adamant that the UK cannot expect special favours from the European Union - in terms of an exit deal - that undermines the founding principles of the EU. Hollande fears that this would merely encourage backing for anti-EU campaigner Marine Le Pen and the Front National, who will say that the French would also be better off out of the EU. France’s Socialist president’s message will be that there is a stiff price to pay for Brexit. Concerns over immigration and the future role of UK border guards in Calais may also be discussed. RELATIONSHIPS TO WORK ON Angela Merkel Theresa May has already been to Berlin for a meeting with Merkel since becoming prime minister and relations between Europe’s two most powerful women were reasonably warm. No bilateral has been planned for the G20, however, signalling the UK’s wider ambitions post-Brexit. As the EU’s power broker, the German chancellor, who like Hollande is facing elections next year, has a balance to strike between remaining close to the UK while preserving the EU intact. Germany fears that the UK will try to bolster its economy post-Brexit by trying to lure in foreign investment through low corporate and other taxes. Berlin wants to make clear that if this is the route it chooses then its access to the EU single market, particularly for the sale of financial services, which represent more than 10% of the UK economy, will not be possible. King Salman Saudi Arabia has spent £3bn on arms from the UK since the start of 2015, with critics voicing concerns that weapons may have been used against civilian targets in Yemen. The UK government would take a dim view if that were the case, but as it heads into a uncertain future outside the EU, May will not want to turn her back on what the UK government has identified as one of its priority markets abroad. Narendra Modi Theresa May has a bilateral meeting arranged with the Indian prime minister on Sunday, another sign that the UK is looking increasingly outside Europe for economic ties and trade deals as it heads for Brexit. India is an obvious choice for trade talks, with its huge developing markets. Modi will have his own concerns, however, about UK plans to tighten border controls and curb immigration, and will want reassurance that there will be continued access for skilled workers and students from his country into the UK. SPECIAL FRIENDS Barack Obama May has a bilateral meeting with Obama early on Sunday. The American president will want to sound out the new British prime minister about Brexit and what it means for the “special relationship”. The US always valued the UK as a route through which to convey its views to Europe, and is fearful of Brexit. It is also concerned that with the UK outside, EU support for sanctions against Russia over Ukraine will weaken. Obama said before the Brexit vote that the UK would go “to the back of the queue” in trade talks if it left the bloc. With the impending likely collapse of the US-EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, however, could there be more of an opportunity now for the UK to jump to the front of the list of countries seeking bespoke deals with Washington? Justin Trudeau There has been much talk of the UK, after Brexit, striking a trade deal with the EU similar to the one Canada is finalising with Brussels after years of intensive and difficult negotiation. The Canadian prime minister and May will no doubt exchange notes on how possible and desirable a similar arrangement will be for the UK, and how they could work together on the shape of future world trade. One problem is that Canada’s deal does not cover financial services, which contributed £126.9bn in gross value added to the UK economy in 2014. So the Canada model is no panacea. It has also taken almost a decade to strike and has yet to come into force. Malcolm Turnbull Australia has already called for a free trade deal with Britain following its exit from the EU – a move that May described as “very encouraging”. She insisted it showed Brexit could work for Britain. The Australian prime minister said he urgently wanted to open up trading between the two countries as soon as possible, and the G20 meeting will be a good opportunity to reaffirm their joint interests. While trade with Australia will not replace access to the single market, it will be a sign of the British willingness to look far and wide as it seeks new trade arrangements across the globe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/mar/19/china-uranium-nuclear-plants-smog-thorium","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-19T19:42:23Z","webTitle":"China working on uranium-free nuclear plants in attempt to combat smog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/19/china-uranium-nuclear-plants-smog-thorium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/mar/19/china-uranium-nuclear-plants-smog-thorium","fields":{"headline":"China working on uranium-free nuclear plants in attempt to combat smog","bodyText":"China is developing a new design of nuclear power plant in an attempt to reduce its reliance on coal and to cut air pollution. In an effort to reduce the number of coal-fired plants, the Chinese government has brought forward by 15 years the deadline to develop a nuclear power plant using the radioactive element thorium instead of uranium. A team of researchers in Shanghai has now been told it has 10 instead of 25 years to develop the world's first such plant. \"In the past, the government was interested in nuclear power because of the energy shortage. Now, they are more interested because of smog,\" Professor Li Zhong, a scientist working on the project, told the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post. An advanced research centre was set up in January by the Chinese Academy of Sciences with the aim of developing an industrial reactor using thorium molten salt technology, the newspaper reported. According to the World Nuclear Association (WNA), China has 20 nuclear plants in operation and another 28 under construction, all uranium-fuelled reactors. China has been importing large quantities of uranium as it attempts to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. However, according to the WNA, thorium is much more abundant. The researchers on the project said they had come under considerable pressure from the government for it to be successful. Li said nuclear power was the \"only solution\" to replace coal, and thorium \"carries much hope\". \"The problem of coal has become clear,\" he said: \"if the average energy consumption per person doubles, this country will be choked to death by polluted air.\" \"China has an ambitious nuclear-generation programme. It plans to have almost 60 gigawatts of nuclear energy by 2020 and up to 150gw by 2030, so the Chinese have plans to get a significant amount of nuclear into the energy mix,\" said Jonathan Cobb of the WNA. There is a lot that is still unknown about thorium but a lot of research is being carried out worldwide. Cobb said: \"Other countries around the world are looking at thorium. There is a fair bit of research going on at the moment into the use of thorium. And technology-wise, using thorium would not be too much of a leap. It is certainly something that is well under way in terms of research,\" said Cobb. The researchers on the project told the South China Morning Post their work would be likely to face some opposition from Chinese citizens after the nuclear disaster at Fukushima, in Japan. However, the national nuclear safety administration said the safety of China's nuclear power plants could be assured, and checks had been stepped up since Fukushima to avoid a similar accident."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/jan/28/greenland-narsaq-uranium-mine-dividing-town","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-28T10:00:52Z","webTitle":"‘You can't live in a museum’: the battle for Greenland's uranium","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/28/greenland-narsaq-uranium-mine-dividing-town","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jan/28/greenland-narsaq-uranium-mine-dividing-town","fields":{"headline":"‘You can't live in a museum’: the battle for Greenland's uranium","bodyText":"It is a beautiful morning on the southern tip of Greenland; the sun is high in a cloudless sky, but there is a tang of cold in the air. A crowd of Spanish tourists in red parkas has gathered at the small jetty in Narsaq, to watch boatmen who have just returned from hunting a minke whale in the open sea. From the shoreline, the Spaniards watch the men below busy themselves, slicing the whale meat into slippery rectangular chunks. They work swiftly, as if cleaning up the scene of an emergency, deferring to one young man in orange overalls. As word spreads that a catch has landed, local people arrive with carrier bags and choose from the cuts laid out on the bloodstained floor of the little boats bobbing in the water. The bags are slung on handheld scales; today, whale meat costs 80 Danish kroner a kilo, about £9. A woman pushes a wheelbarrow down the jetty, loaded with what looks like a ribcage. The whale hunter is a symbolic figure in Greenland but the flurry the Spaniards are observing is humdrum, devoid of ceremony. Sebu Kaspersen, the hunter in orange overalls, explains that there was a calm sea and they could see a lot of whales; they shot one with a rifle and then fired a harpoon to finish it off. It is, he says, the second minke whale he has killed this year, the limit of his quota. His living largely comes from fishing halibut, and hunting seals for their skin; mostly, he works alone, without a crew. Soon the Spaniards get bored and put away their cameras. Their Argentine guide, fresh from Patagonia, gets them into their kayaks for a day’s paddling in the fjord, giving instructions on how to avoid colliding with the icebergs glimmering in the sun, lest a dangerous shard come crashing down. In the evening, when they return, they will probably have dinner at Hotel Narsaq, the only hotel in this town of 1,500 people, sharing the restaurant with four Americans from New Jersey, two fathers and their sons who have come to Greenland by private plane to shoot musk ox, and who are loud in their approval of President Trump. When the whale meat has been sold, the town settles back into a pleasant torpor. The paved road through the green, yellow, red and ochre wooden houses is mostly empty; a zigzag of smoke rises from a chimney against a sky streaked with contrails. Women and men carry shopping and push prams up the hill toward the hotel. Occasionally, the tranquillity is broken by a Volvo tractor roaring jerkily along. In the afternoon, teenagers gather on a hill, while men and women sit drinking on benches. In the square near the supermarket, two teenagers are selling hotdogs and chips from a van parked in front of a little police station. Not far away, on the edge of town, the shadows lengthen on the dusty football pitch that sits beneath the mountains overlooking Narsaq. From here, you can look straight up the glacial valley to the Kvanefjeld plateau six kilometres away. In the past few years, the townspeople have become used to the helicopter taking off and landing near the football pitch, ferrying drill rigs and other supplies; there, men are working hard to find the mineral riches buried in Greenland’s mountains. When he visited Narsaq in July 1957, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr was probably the most famous scientist in the world. A Nobel prize winner, he had worked on the Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. But by the mid-1950s, he was a proselytiser for the peaceful use of atomic energy. There is a photograph of Bohr accepting honorary citizenship of Narsaq, bending over a lectern set up on a patch of grass, speaking into a microphone. Behind him are officials from Denmark, which had run Greenland as a colony since the 18th century; at the edge of a crowd gathered some distance away, three Inuit children watch him with indifference. In the weeks before Bohr arrived that summer, Danish geologists had taken samples from Kvanefjeld containing promising levels of uranium. His dream was that Greenland’s uranium could support a nuclear power programme in Denmark. Sixty years later, the dream is that it will provide the key to Greenland’s independence. Since 2009, the island has been an “autonomous administrative division” within Denmark, giving its 56,000 inhabitants control over local resources. The idea of full independence within a generation or two is the dominant theme of local politics – even if the price of breaking free would be an annual Danish subsidy worth some £7,500 a head. There are few options when it comes to replacing that money: fishing already accounts for more than 90% of Greenland’s exports. But in the last decade, mining has emerged as the means to industrialise Greenland, creating a financial base for independence. Government delegations have toured Australia and Canada, armed with geological surveys, aiming to convince the world’s leading mining communities that Greenland is a rich source of minerals – potentially the 21st century’s new frontier. As interest has grown – in 2013, the government granted four times the number of exploration licences approved in 2003 – so has the pressure to repeal a 1988 ban on uranium mining: this prevented the extraction of uranium, as well as any minerals that might have uranium as a byproduct. In 2013, after a debate that divided the country, Greenland’s parliament voted narrowly to repeal the ban. Kvanefjeld, near Narsaq, is one of many potential mines. Last month, an Australian company was given the green light to begin construction of a zinc and lead mine on the northern coast; there are currently 56 active licences to explore mining for gold, rubies, diamonds, nickel, copper and other minerals elsewhere. But uranium has made Kvanefjeld the most controversial project, and the focus of a debate about whether this is the economic path that Greenland should pursue. (The most common argument raised against is the danger that radioactive dust will fall on neighbouring settlements and farmland.) An Australian-owned company, Greenland Minerals and Energy (GME), has spent nearly £60m developing a plan for an open pit mine here. It was due to submit an environmental impact assessment by the end of 2016, but the deadline has been extended. Last September, a Chinese company took a 12.5% stake in GME, with an option to increase that to 60%. On the one hand, this suggests strong faith that the project will go ahead; on the other, the deal is now under investigation by Greenland’s government, concerned that they may eventually be dealing with a Chinese mining company, not an Australian one. In a move that sounds counterintuitive, GME is promoting its mine as a contribution to the new global green economy. According to the company, 80% of the commercial deposits in Kvanefjeld are rare earth minerals, commonly used in wind turbines, hybrid cars and lasers; uranium accounts for only 10%. “The market for rare earth minerals is deciding this,” says operations manager Ib Laursen. “Everybody is looking for them. Instead of Greenland being a passive receiver of global warming from the western world, it could contribute to green technology.” It is a clever pitch. Greenland’s ice sheet has become the benchmark measurement for the march of global warming; research published in September showed that ice loss is accelerating more rapidly than previously feared. Greenland is also the emblematic victim of climate change: Inuit hunters and fishermen are called on in international conferences, to describe how their traditional lifestyles are being destroyed by warming seas. But what the rest of the world see as creeping ruination, local politicians see as an opportunity. The melting ice sheet will make some minerals more accessible, and reveal others that are so far unknown. The attention that climate change has brought to Greenland has also made the country a more desirable tourist destination. In the last decade, there has been a big increase in the number of cruise ships stopping along the coast, and there are plans to build new airports. Independence may be a distant prospect, but the goal of self-sufficiency eclipses any fear that Greenland may change beyond recognition. “It’s a question of mentality, and whether you decide to be part of a progression or a passivity,” says Vittus Qujaukitsoq, minister of industry, labour, trade, energy and foreign affairs (a wide-ranging brief that reflects both the strategic importance of mining and the intimate scale of local politics). “There are only two choices. Either you sit and wait for the opportunity to come. Or you work to grasp what opportunity brings along.” *** While there have been desultory attempts at mining in the past, Narsaq bears little trace of it. Today, its serenity brings to mind the town of Sulaco, the fictional setting for Joseph Conrad’s novel Nostromo, in which British and American investors extract fabulous wealth from a silver mine in a South American backwater. It is difficult to picture an open pit mine in the mountains behind Narsaq, to imagine the road through the valley busy with trucks and machinery, and ships waiting to be loaded with ore in a new port, built in the little bay where tourists currently meander in kayaks and the only intrusive sound is the occasional boom of ice collapsing into the water. Like the silver in Nostromo, the rare earths and uranium in Kvanefjeld would turn the town into “the blessed province of great opportunities and of largest salaries”. And like Conrad’s English administrator, Charles Gould, whose faith in the mine was contagious, the Kvanefjeld mine has its booster in Ib Laursen, the operations manager who has become the public face of the project. A Dane who has lived in Narsaq for over a decade, Laursen is promising 2,000 jobs during the construction of the mine and a new harbour, and a further 800 permanent jobs (300 for locals) over the next three decades. Revenue from taxes and royalties will help Greenland’s economy take off, Laursen says: instead of driving away tourists, the mine will fund the development of airports, roads and hotels to attract them. Most of the world’s rare earth minerals come from China (six state-owned enterprises control nearly 90% of the planet’s supply), and the scale of environmental degradation there has given open pit mining a bad reputation. Concerned locals in Greenland invoke images of wasted landscapes and pools of toxic and radioactive waste, gleaned from a Google search. Similarly, the history of uranium mining has been one of blithe disregard for the environment – though the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) claims that growing awareness makes it “the most regulated and one of the safest forms of mining in the world”. Laursen presents his mine as an environmentally friendly alternative to Chinese mines, modelled on international standards of best practice. He says the fears of radioactive dust floating over south Greenland are groundless. The crushed rock discarded once the minerals have been extracted, known as tailings, will be turned into slurry and carried in a pipeline to the bottom of a nearby lake. “It would never surface as dust,” Laursen says: the lake will be sealed in perpetuity by an impermeable dam. Laursen is dismissive of Greenlanders opposed to the mine: “It’s like windmills in Denmark – everybody wants sustainable energy, but they don’t want a windmill in their backyard.” And he challenges those in the rest of the world horrified by the prospect of large-scale mining. “You cannot live in a museum – you have the right to sustain your people. Is it OK for Europe to cut down forests, but object to one project in Greenland? It’s not a banana republic. This country is huge – one or two mines will not destroy its purity.” He claims to be unfazed by the lengthy approval process GME has been required to undergo. “Greenland is occupied by doing this right, and I am sympathetic to doing a thorough job. You don’t want to rush an industrial revolution.” The very idea of an industrial revolution, speedy or cautious, is not reassuring to many living in and around Narsaq. Enough green fields have been carved from the hillsides in this part of Greenland to make sheep farming profitable. Klaus Frederiksen and Aviaja Lennert have 600 sheep on 67 acres an hour’s boat ride from Kvanefjeld. Tractors and pieces of machinery are left haphazardly on the grass around their house overlooking the fjord; three sheepdogs scamper and bark. Their business became more expensive because of a long summer drought they blame on climate change; with their neighbours, they had to rent a ship to import hay from Denmark. Frederiksen and Lennert first heard of plans for the mine six years ago, when they went to a local school to watch a presentation by four scientists – three women and an elderly man – who had come from Denmark, and who they now think had been hired by the government in Greenland. The scientists told them that the mine would make south Greenland more prosperous and increase demand for their lambs. But Frederiksen was alert to the dangers of radioactive dust because he had studied sheep farming in Norway in the mid-90s, when animals there were still affected by the fallout from Chernobyl. The scientists said they would remove dust from the mine by sprinkling it with water. “Well, water is usually frozen here in the winter,” Frederiksen tells me now, “so I asked them, ‘How are you going to have water to sprinkle then?’ And they said they would answer that when the environmental impact assessment arrived. When someone asked if it was possible to have no pollution in a mining area, the elderly man told us there had never been mining without pollution.” Frederiksen and Lennert believe most of the sheep farmers oppose the mine, but they avoid too many conversations about it just in case: polarisation risks harmony, and they might need each other in difficult times. Fridrik Magnusson, the Icelandic owner of the Hotel Narsaq, is in a similarly delicate position and tries to stay neutral. “I don’t want to be selfish – I know half the town wants the mine for work, but I would rather keep the tranquillity of the place and the beauty of it,” he says. His wife, Katti, grew up in Narsaq, and they moved here from Reykjavik so that their children could be close to nature. “It’s the calmness. You know you can go and sit and watch the icebergs for half a day, a whole day.” After putting a lot of work into starting the hotel and opening a little brewery, they were initially worried by the prospect of a mine that might drive tourists away. But they also know it will bring a lot of people here. “The hotel will be full all the time, the restaurant will be busy the whole time – and the beer will be running in every direction. We don’t know how things will be. They talk about uranium dust over the village; they talk about the water being polluted. I don’t want to believe any of it: how are you going to have a thousand people working here if it’s all going to be polluted? I don’t know.” In the last decade, Narsaq’s population has fallen by 10%; it suffers the highest unemployment of any town in Greenland. In the 1970s, Katti’s uncle Jorgen Olesen and his three brothers made a very good living filling their boats with shrimp, delivering their loads to the factory where the shrimp were peeled, frozen and shipped to Denmark. The factory worked from dawn to dusk, each of their boats keeping 15 people in work. But just as cod disappeared in the 1970s, the shrimp moved away, and the government backed profitable factory trawlers at the expense of the independent fishermen. The shrimp factory closed six years ago, and is now a slaughterhouse where sheep farmers bring their lambs. Until his sudden death last month, Olesen made his living ferrying tourists around the fjords. This streamlining of the fishing industry was accompanied by a squeeze on public expenditure. Many municipalities around Greenland were merged. Narsaq lost its social services, which were transferred to a bigger town nearby. “People just lost hope or interest in being here, because it’s become more difficult,” says Paninnguag Lind Jensen, a tattoo artist and sometime tourist guide who divides her time between her home town and the capital, Nuuk. “Only people who really care about Narsaq will stay here. People can’t get work, and they stay here and start drinking.” Six of the 30 pupils in her graduating class at school have killed themselves. The opening of a new primary school, after a quarter of a century of campaigning, has brought some relief from the gloom. The principal, Ivalo Motzfeldt, tells me how even walking along the shiny corridors and using the new workbenches has increased the children’s motivation. But she knows that those who want to go to university will go to Denmark, while the others will leave for Nuuk or bigger towns: Narsaq has nothing to offer them. In the 11-year-olds’ science class, the children have been set the task of researching uranium. Their opinions about the mine are divided, and Motzfeldt suspects they are echoing their parents’ views. The unemployed tend to believe that, if the mine opens, there will be jobs for everybody. “Money is the driving factor and it makes them blind,” she says. She is outspokenly opposed: yes, the town needs money, but the land should not be sacrificed. “When the last fish is caught and the rivers are polluted, you can’t eat money.” From his powerful position in Nuuk, Qujaukitsoq would most likely regard such talk as homespun philosophising. He is confident that Greenland will follow best international practice. There will be a limited number of highly regulated projects; his country will not become another Congo. “It is a democratic society that the mining companies will have to operate in. I see no danger of being overrun – we have the resources to prevent corruption or misconduct.” In the past two elections, the people have decided, by voting for parties that support the uranium mine. Now, Qujaukitsoq says, it is a decision for the government. “Are we hesitant? No. We have no reservations about creating jobs.” For him it is the only way of saving Narsaq from stagnation. Whatever image the rest of the world cherishes, one thing is clear: Greenland will make its own way in the age of climate change. • Maurice Walsh travelled as part of the Arctic Times Project, an international team exploring the transformation of the Arctic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/nov/25/uk-cancels-pioneering-1bn-carbon-capture-and-storage-competition","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-25T16:07:41Z","webTitle":"UK cancels pioneering £1bn carbon capture and storage competition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/25/uk-cancels-pioneering-1bn-carbon-capture-and-storage-competition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/25/uk-cancels-pioneering-1bn-carbon-capture-and-storage-competition","fields":{"headline":"UK cancels pioneering £1bn carbon capture and storage competition","bodyText":"The UK government has cancelled its £1bn competition for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology just six months before it was due to be awarded, breaking a pledge in the Conservative party’s election manifesto. The abandonment of a technology championed by David Cameron and seen as vital in tackling global warming will be an embarrassment to the UK, just days before a major UN climate change summit in Paris. Industry figures called the move “devastating”, while experts said it would make meeting the UK’s binding carbon cuts “almost impossible” and more expensive. Two projects had been in the running to build plants demonstrating CCS at commercial scale. One was backed by Shell and SSE at Peterhead. The White Rose consortium was based at Drax, the UK’s largest power plant, but was in trouble after Drax halted its investment in September. The government informed the London Stock Exchange at 3pm, stating: “Following the chancellor’s autumn statement, HM government confirms that the £1bn ring-fenced capital budget for the CCS competition is no longer available. We will engage closely with the bidders on the implications of this decision for them.” The decision was not mentioned in Treasury documents. “This is devastating,” said Luke Warren, chief executive of the CCS Association. “Moving the goalposts just at the time when a four-year competition is about to conclude is an appalling way to do business. It is a real blow to confidence for companies investing in CCS. This technology is critical for the UK’s economic, industrial and climate policies.” Shell said the Peterhead project was now dead and its CCS work would be focused in other countries. “Shell remains committed to CCS – as our involvement in demonstration projects in other parts of the world shows – and we view it as an important part of a low-carbon energy future,” said a spokesman. CCS traps the carbon dioxide from coal and gas power plants and buries it underground so it cannot warm the climate. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded CCS is hugely important to tackling climate change in the most cost-effective way. Without CCS, the costs of halting global warming would double, the IPCC said. The UK government’s own advisors, the Committee on Climate Change, agreed and said in October: “CCS is very important for reducing emissions across the economy and could almost halve the cost of meeting the 2050 target in the [UK’s] Climate Change Act.” The Conservative’s 2015 general election manifesto said: “We have been the greenest government ever ... committing £1bn for carbon capture and storage.” Lisa Nandy, Labour’s shadow energy secretary, said: “CCS offers huge economic opportunities for Britain. Year after year the prime minister has personally promised to support CCS, so this is a huge betrayal.” Claire Jakobsson, at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, said CCS could save the UK £32bn a year by 2050 and abandoning the competition was a false economy: “In choosing to save a relatively small sum of taxpayer money in 2015, the government is unnecessarily committing vast amount of future energy consumers’ money.” The UK’s energy policy was reset on 18 November and aims to build many new gas-fired power stations. To meet carbon targets, any new stations would have to stop generating by 2030 unless CCS is fitted, but the cancellation of the CCS competition makes this less likely. “If we are serious about building a clean and secure energy sector we need a diverse energy system, and CCS is central to this,” said Jenifer Baxter, at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. “Without CCS this will mean we are locking ourselves into relying on unabated fossil fuel power for generations to come.” George Osborne’s autumn review and comprehensive spending review also cut spending on home energy efficiency by £132m - an 83% reduction - on the same day that over 40,000 excess deaths were announced for the last winter. The UK has some of the worst housing in the EU and improvements in efficiency are needed to meet carbon targets. Another £700m - 40% - was cut from a scheme supporting green heating. The chancellor announced a doubling of investment in energy research and technology over five years. He singled out mini nuclear reactors - called small modular reactors (SMRs) - as a promising technology for the UK. Foreign SMR companies have been courting the UK in recent months. The spending review pledged “at least £250m over the next five years in an ambitious nuclear R&amp;D programme that will revive the UK’s nuclear expertise ... This will include a competition to identify the best value SMR design for the UK. This will pave the way towards building one of the world’s first SMRs in the UK in the 2020s.” A new large nuclear power station at Hinkley Point is set to receive billions in subsidies. “The chancellor is slashing renewables and energy efficiency investment, and eliminating CCS funding, making it almost impossible to meet our carbon budgets,” said Sepi Golzari-Munro, at climate policy thinktank E3G. “Rather than building the low-carbon infrastructure fit for the future, he has doubled down on building the infrastructure of the past.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/dec/10/to-destroy-human-civilisation-we-just-need-to-continue-with-business-as-usual","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-10T19:08:17Z","webTitle":"To destroy human civilisation we just need to continue with business as usual | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/10/to-destroy-human-civilisation-we-just-need-to-continue-with-business-as-usual","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/dec/10/to-destroy-human-civilisation-we-just-need-to-continue-with-business-as-usual","fields":{"headline":"To destroy human civilisation we just need to continue with business as usual","bodyText":"China’s strategy for dealing with air pollution is a cosmetic exercise cynically timed to coincide with the Paris summit on climate change (Airpocalypse now: factories and schools in Beijing shut by unprecedented smog alert, 9 December). The 24-hour WHO limit for small particulates is 25 microgrammes per cubic metre of air, though recent studies have demonstrated adverse effects on foetal development at levels well below this. During recent pollution episodes, levels as high as 900 have been recorded in Bejing and other large cities such as Baoding. China’s ruthless determination to grow its economy has therefore rendered its cities wholly unfit for human habitation, and especially dangerous for pregnant women. Despite all the fine speeches in Paris, China has 368 coal-fired plants under construction, and is planning a further 800. It may be investing in renewables but this does not alter the fact that China is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gases worldwide. It has also admitted understating its emissions of CO2 by 14%. To destroy human civilisation it is not necessary to send in an army. We just needs to continue with business as usual. Dr Robin Russell-Jones Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire • Neither James Hansen and his colleagues (Nuclear power paves the only viable path forward on climate change, theguardian.com, 3 December), nor Paul Dorfman and his (Letters, 7 December), have given a full picture of the challenge that faces us to decarbonise energy. To drive an electric economy, there must be some forms of energy generation that are flexible enough to be adjusted to meet fluctuations in demand. Nuclear isn’t one of these, being suitable for providing a steady baseload output but not rapidly adjustable. This is why France doesn’t generate all its power from nuclear, only about 75%, with much of the rest being from hydro and gas that can be adjusted almost instantaneously. Wind and solar provide constantly fluctuating outputs, solar with peaks that are severely out of phase with both seasonal and diurnal cycles of demand. To make fullest use of these abundant but non-nuclear forms of energy we will need another flexible form of generation to complement their fluctuations and match the changing demand cycles. Gas has been touted as the answer to this but fossil fuel gas will only make the climate problem worse, whether conventional or from fracking. The sustainable alternative would be to store energy generated at times when renewables provide a surplus, and use it when they fall short. Storage is thus a vital component, now almost completely missing from our energy systems. Only pumped storage hydro schemes currently have any role and their contribution to overall use is small. We need a clear vision of how energy storage might be incorporated alongside nuclear and renewables, research into viable technologies, and the political, societal and commercial will to implement them. Hydrogen from electrolysis of sea water and methane generation from organic waste could both form part of the mix, but how will they be stored, distributed and used to meet high demand whenever wind neither blows nor sun shines? On this issue we have hardly begun, despite years of promises to phase out fossil fuels and adopt renewables and the beginnings of a worldwide movement to do so. Tim Atkinson Norwich • I cannot help but feel that Mary Robinson’s complaint about gender inequality at the COP21 negotiations (Opinion, theguardian.com, 1 December), though well meant, is irrelevant at the present moment. Surely the priority in Paris, even for the most politically correct bien-pensant, is securing an agreement that will allow our species to continue to exist sustainably on this planet. Whether this agreement is reached by women or men is beside the point. Steven Jouanny Sheffield • I feel that your coverage of climate change doesn’t pay enough attention to reducing greenhouse gases by curbing the amount of energy wasted in poorly insulated and inefficiently heated buildings. Local renewable energy production and storage can play a huge role in reducing harmful emissions. A 7kWh battery charged by renewable power during the day can meet the demands of any well-insulated family home on even the darkest and coldest of winter nights. This also goes a long way to solving the problem of energy peaks. Millions of buildings must undergo retrofitting work. Oil prices are falling, and are set to continue on a downward trajectory. Governments can maintain high duty on fuels, and use the windfall to provide subsidies and incentives for home and business owners to upgrade insulation to achieve maximum heat retention. Not only will emissions fall, but thousands, if not millions, of jobs will be created. Climate change ranks low on the list of voter interests; changing this desperate reality depends on making a global issue relevant to local people on a local level. By creating more out of less in the built environment – warmer homes and offices, lower energy bills, and the community spirit of local energy generation, not to mention the boost to jobs and local economies – energy and climate change can become a voter priority, and re-enfranchise those whose faith in democracy is currently lost.

February 2003 As the invasion of Iraq by coalition forces looms, President Khatami acknowledges the existence of the Natanz facility. He claims Natanz was only intended to produce low-enriched uranium fuel for nuclear power plants. Iran agrees to a request from UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to visit the Natanz site. IAEA visits in late February and Iran promises to submit to inspections. May 2003 Iran allows IAEA to visit the Kalaye Electric Company but refuses to allow IAEA inspectors to take samples. June 2003 IAEA report concludes that Iran has failed to meet its obligations under the safeguards agreement. June 2003 Following the IAEA report, the UK, Germany and France (the EU-3) launch a joint diplomatic effort to address Iran’s nuclear policy. The US refused to be involved in the talks. October 2003 Under threat of referral to the UN security council, Iran reaches an agreement with the EU-3, known as the Tehran Declaration. Iran agrees to cooperate fully with the IAEA and suspend all uranium enrichment. August 2005 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is elected president of Iran. He is seen as supportive of the country’s nuclear programme. August-September 2005 EU-3 deal begins to fall apart as Iran resumes the conversion of uranium at the Isfahan facility. Ahmadinejad gives a speech at the United Nations stating that Iran has the right to develop a nuclear power programme. February 2006 The IAEA votes to report Iran to the UN security council. After the vote, Iran announces it will resume enrichment of uranium. April 2006 Ahmadinejad announces Iran has joined the group of countries that have nuclear technology, but adds that this is purely for providing power, not producing weapons. June 2006: China, the US and Russia join the UK, Germany and France to form the P5+1. The term refers to the five permanent member states of the UN security council, plus Germany, which is one of Iran’s key trading partners. July 2006 The UN security council passes its first resolution demanding Iran stop its uranium enrichment and processing activities. 2006-2010 The security council adopts a total of six resolutions and imposes gradual sanctions on Iran, including freezing assets of individuals and companies related to the enrichment programme and banning the supply of nuclear-related technology to the country. September 2009 The US president, Barack Obama, reveals the existence of an underground enrichment facility in Fordow, near the Iranian city of Qom. The US begins talking seriously about air strikes against Iran, and Israel threatens to take nuclear action. March 2013 The US begins a series of secret talks with Iranian officials, which are kept from its partners in the P5+1. June 2013 Hassan Rouhani is elected president of Iran. He is considered more moderate, pragmatic and willing to negotiate than Ahmadinejad. September 2013 Obama telephones Rouhani, the first contact between leaders of the US and Iran since 1979. The phone call, as well as a meeting between the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, a day earlier, is seen as the beginning of a new era of cooperation between the countries. November 2013 Iran and the P5+1 reach an interim agreement, known as the joint plan of action. The agreement limits Iran’s nuclear programme. Production at the Arak heavy-water reactor ceases and Iran depletes much of its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium. Sanctions against Iran are partially lifted and assets are unfrozen. July 2014 Deadline for a comprehensive agreement to be reached between Iran and the P5+1. The deadline is not met and is extended to November 2014. November 2014 Deadline is not met, and is extended to the end of June 2015, with the target of reaching a framework understanding by the end of March. March 2015 World leaders meet in Lausanne, Switzerland, to finalise agreement. 2 April 2015 Iran and world powers announce framework deal to restrict Iran’s nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief and commit to finalising a comprehensive deal by the end of June. Federica Mogherini, EU foreign policy chief, describes the deal as a “decisive step”. Iranians celebrate in the streets at the prospect of a deal and the lifting of sanctions. June 2015 Talks resume between the P5+1 and Iran in Vienna ahead of 30 June deadline. 30 June 2015 No deal is struck as the deadline looms. Diplomats suggest that the real deadline is 9 July, the latest the deal can go to US Congress if sanctions are to be lifted as quickly as Iran would hope. Obama warns that he will walk away from a deal if Tehran does not stick to the outline agreed in April. 6 July 2015 Kerry says negotiations “could go either way”, 48 hours before the deadline for an agreement, as foreign ministers from the P5+1 meet again in Vienna. 8 July 2015 Talks are extended by three days amid disagreements over the lifting of an arms embargo, but western diplomats say they remain hopeful that an agreement can be reached by the end of the week. 10 July 2015 A senior member of the Iranian delegation criticises the P5+1, accusing them of putting forward multiple agreements and dragging their feet on a deal, after Kerry says there is “no rush” to conclude negotiations. 11 July 2015 The deadline to reach agreement is pushed back to Monday 13 July, the third extension in two weeks. 12 July 2015 President Rouhani says Iran has “managed to amaze the world” in the talks. 13 July 2015 The Iranian president’s office is forced to delete a premature tweet in his name that appears to welcome a nuclear agreement which has yet to materialise. Zarif tells journalists he is feeling “sleepy and overworked” as the new deadline is missed, but talks continue late into the night. 14 July 2015 After 17 days of almost uninterrupted negotiations, a historic deal is reached in Vienna. It brings to an end a 12-year stand-off and potentially marks the beginning of a new era in relations between Iran and the west. Attention turns to the US, where Barack Obama has promised to veto any attempt by Republican opponents to undermine the deal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/dec/08/britain-climate-change-green-economy-david-cameron-paris","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-08T18:09:46Z","webTitle":"Britain can’t preach on climate change while it dismantles its green economy | John Ashton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/08/britain-climate-change-green-economy-david-cameron-paris","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/08/britain-climate-change-green-economy-david-cameron-paris","fields":{"headline":"Britain can’t preach on climate change while it dismantles its green economy","bodyText":"Rule one of diplomacy is, walk your talk: otherwise people stop listening. In Paris last week David Cameron called for “action today”, not excuses tomorrow, on climate change. Back home, his ministers are already making excuses for what looks increasingly like a systematic repudiation of 10 years of successful action to build a prosperous low-carbon economy in Britain. The Green MP Caroline Lucas is right to have called this a “spectacular display of cognitive dissonance”. Not surprisingly, the world is beginning to notice. “On eve of Paris climate summit, Britain pulls plug on renewables”, read a recent headline in the Washington Post. The job of government on climate change is to ensure attractive and stable conditions for investment in the low-carbon transition. In recent months our government has hit the brakes on onshore wind and solar energy, on energy efficiency and on community renewable schemes. Its plan to sell off the Green Investment Bank will destroy a crucial financing mechanism. Its trashing of a 10-year effort to make the UK a leader in carbon capture and storage blew away more than £100m in imminent investment from China. Its surreptitious edging away from its 2020 renewables target casts doubt on all its climate promises. Meanwhile our energy secretary, Amber Rudd, has invited a new dash for gas. If implemented at the scale apparently intended, this will kill the Climate Change Act by steadily undermining our capacity to stick to its legally binding carbon pathway. The government’s unnecessary and undeliverable obsessions with disruptive fracking and expensive nuclear energy will further chill investment in renewables and energy efficiency. And as camouflage for her boss in Paris, Rudd has claimed credit for a phase-out of coal that her predecessors had already made inevitable. Our government claims to want coherent policies. So why did it slap a carbon tax, the climate change levy, on carbon-neutral renewable energy? Our government claims to want value for money. So why is it signing up for a nuclear power plant that will make our electricity needlessly expensive for 20 years while putting obstacles in the path of onshore wind, the cheapest form of carbon-neutral energy? Our government claims to want local people to decide on local infrastructure. So why is it desperate to force fracking on unwilling communities while obstructing the renewables schemes they desire? Recent dismay from the Scottish government is a warning that these policies may sow new divisions between London and Edinburgh. Scotland needs more, not less, ambition nationally to realise the potential of its abundant renewable energy resources and escape from its unhealthy dependence on North Sea oil and gas. Privatisation of the Green Investment Bank will weaken the attraction of Edinburgh, where it is based, as a centre for low-carbon finance. When our leaders speak, we should not only listen to what they say but read their lips. Reading the lips of Rudd and the chancellor, George Osborne, it is hard to escape the conclusion that these incoherent, unconvincing policies seem driven more by ideology and casual expediency than by a serious assessment of what Britain needs. Any incoming government is entitled to make changes. There were gaps and contradictions in the energy and climate policies this government inherited. But in its response there is little sign of real intent to make sure that our country does at home what our prime minister has just urged on the rest of the world. Every step it has taken has been a step backwards. Conditions for investment are now less attractive and less stable. That imposes extra risks on investors – risks consumers will be asked to pay for. That is, of course, on top of the growing risks to our people arising from climate change itself. The floods that have brought death and suffering to Lancashire and Cumbria are just the latest reminder of those. As for diplomacy, the world’s governments will probably agree this week on a new basis for global action on climate. It will be a step forward. But it will only take us, at best, to the end of the beginning. Whether we can achieve the sustained effort that this challenge really demands will depend less on deals about to be done in Paris and more on choices made globally over the next five years as governments strive to turn their promises into action and push up levels of ambition that are still inadequate. The UK’s backward lurch has, thankfully, come too late to damage prospects at Paris. But it is nonsense to claim, as our ministers have, that the choices they are making will not cut our diplomacy off at the knees. And it is rich for them to accuse other parties of weaponising climate policy when it is they who have broken the cross-party consensus that gave our diplomacy a special edge. No country has done more than Britain to spur global progress on climate. We have done that by walking our talk, with strong diplomacy based on a strong domestic base. It would be a tragedy and a betrayal of our national interest if, just as our competitors pick up the pace, we start giving succour to those nations and industries that want to slow down an endeavour on whose success all our destinies depend."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2016/mar/24/brussels-police-attacks-identify-man-suicide-bomber-accomplice","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-25T07:56:16Z","webTitle":"Brussels attacks: Belgium police arrest six people after suicide bombings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/24/brussels-police-attacks-identify-man-suicide-bomber-accomplice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/mar/24/brussels-police-attacks-identify-man-suicide-bomber-accomplice","fields":{"headline":"Brussels attacks: Belgium police arrest six people after suicide bombings","bodyText":"Police in Brussels have made six arrests following Tuesday’s airport and metro suicide bombings, after a day in which two Belgian government ministers offered to resign amid mounting criticism of the country’s failure to foil the attacks. With prosecutors releasing more evidence that the attacks were carried out by the same Islamic State network responsible for November’s carnage in Paris and two suspects still believed to be on the run, several police raids were carried out across Brussels on Thursday evening. The operation involving Swat teams and armoured cars with helicopter support began soon after 9pm. RTBF, the state broadcaster, cited police sources as saying it had targeted “people suspected of taking part in the attacks” that killed at least 31 people and injured 300. Federal prosecutors confirmed six unidentified people were arrested, including three who were detained outside the prosecutors’ own office in the centre of Brussels. Two others were arrested in the Belgian capital, and one person was arrested in Jette, on the city’s outskirts. The names of those arrested are expected to be announced by prosecutors on Friday. The US Secretary of State, John Kerry, arrived in Brussels on Friday for talks with counter-terrorism officials. Special police units, supported by the army, also carried out a separate raid on Thursday in Schaerbeek, the north-eastern Brussels suburb where explosives were discovered in a separate operation in the immediate aftermath of the attacks on Tuesday. No arrests were confirmed in this raid. Further police raids took place on Thursday in the Argenteuil suburb of Paris, where a French national in the “advanced stages” of a plot to attack the country was arrested. But Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, said: “At this stage, there is no tangible evidence that links this plot to the attacks in Paris and Brussels.” The heightened activity came amid unconfirmed reports that the extremists may initially have been planning an attack on a nuclear site in Belgium but decided to change targets after police raids in Brussels last week. Earlier on Thursday the country’s interior and justice ministers conceded security errors had been made and offered to stand down. The DH newspaper cited police sources as saying the two Bakraoui brothers, who blew themselves up Zaventem airport and the Maelbeek metro station, had filmed 10 hours of video of the daily routine of the head of Belgium’s nuclear research and development programme using a concealed camera. Police have confirmed the existence of the footage, but not who shot it. Other reports suggested an attack may have been planned for Easter Monday. The high-security inner areas of a nuclear power station would almost certainly have been beyond the reach of militants such as the brothers, security experts told Belgian media. But 140 soldiers were dispatched to guard the country’s three nuclear sites earlier this month, and after Tuesday’s bombings the sites were sealed and non-essential staff evacuated as a precaution. Turkey has accused Belgium of ignoring warnings about Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, one of the two suicide bombers who detonated suitcase bombs at Zaventem airport killing themselves and 11 other people, saying he was twice deported from Turkey last year and flagged as a suspected foreign jihadist. Prosecutors also confirmed on Thursday that Ibrahim’s brother Khalid, who exploded the bomb that killed 20 more people at Maelbeek metro station, had rented a flat used as a hideout for the Paris attackers and was named in an international arrest issued on 11 December. A fourth attacker, caught on CCTV cameras with the two airport bombers, is still being sought and a fifth suspect, thought to have been involved in the metro attack, could be dead or alive. Belgian officials have rejected Turkish allegations of inaction following Ibrahim el-Bakraoui’s deportation last July, saying foreigners suspected of fighting in Syria cannot be detained without evidence they have committed a crime. Bakraoui was on parole after serving half of a 10-year sentence for armed robbery. But the interior minister, Jan Jambon, admitted there had been “errors at Justice and with the Belgian liaison officer in Turkey,” adding that “if you put everything in a row, you can ask yourself major questions” about the government’s handling of the Islamist threat. Jambon said the prime minister, Charles Michel, had refused to accept his resignation with the words: “In time of war, you cannot leave the field.” The justice minister, Koen Geens, also offered to go. In further evidence of connections between the Brussels and Paris attacks, police sources have said they believe the second dead suicide bomber at the airport was Najim Laachraoui, 24, a veteran Belgian Islamic State fighter and bombmaker whose DNA was found on two of the explosive belts used in Paris. The third man caught on airport security cameras, wearing a cream jacket and pushing a baggage trolley into the departures hall alongside Laachraoui and Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, is now the subject of a manhunt. The federal prosecutor, Frédéric van Leeuw, has said the man fled the airport leaving behind a third suitcase bomb. French and Belgian media have said a man carrying a large bag was also seen on CCTV in Khalid’s company just before the metro station explosion: the possible fifth attacker. It is not clear whether the man, pictured in a computer-generated image with hollow cheeks and a small goatee beard, was killed in the blast or escaped. EU justice and interior ministers were holding an emergency meeting on Thursday in the wake of the attacks, and the French president, François Hollande, said France would “speak loud and clear” for better intelligence sharing between EU member states and tougher measures against weapons trafficking. All the Brussels attackers so far identified by police and prosecutors have links to Salah Abdeslam, the sole survivor of the 10 jihadis who killed 130 people in Paris last November. Laachraoui travelled to Hungary with him last year, while the Bakraoui brothers rented – as well as the Belgian safe house used by the Paris killers – an apartment in the Schaerbeek district of Brussels where Abdeslam himself hid for three weeks after the attacks. Abdeslam, 26, who is suspected of buying materials, renting cars, booking rooms, scouting locations and moving people into place for the Paris attacks, appeared briefly in court on Thursday and was remanded in custody until 7 April. His lawyer, Sven Mary, said Abdeslam no longer opposed extradition to France, but “wishes to leave … as quickly as possible” in order “to explain himself”. Mary said Abdeslam was due in court in Brussels on 31 March to face a European arrest warrant issued by France and that his extradition could take place in a matter of weeks. The accumulating evidence that Belgium’s police and intelligence services were aware the extremists were members of the Paris attacks cell, but were unable to prevent Tuesday’s bombings, has drawn heavy international criticism and highlighted the scale of the country’s security problem. With about 300 locals who have fought in Syria, Belgium is the biggest European supplier of foreign jihadis in relation to its national population of 11 million. The country’s foreign minister, Didier Reynders, has insisted security always had to be balanced with civil rights. The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, defended Belgium, telling the Flemish-language daily De Standaard: “Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. There was terrorism in Britain and in Germany in the 1970s and 1980. There was terrorism in Spain, in Italy and much more recently in France. People should stop lecturing Belgium.” Brussels airport is likely to remain closed until Saturday, with passengers diverted to Antwerp, Liège and Lille in France. Another minute’s silence was held across the country on Thursday, the second of three days of national mourning. Michel, the prime minister, said everything was being done to determine who was responsible for the attacks, which he described as targeting the “liberty of daily life” and “the liberty upon which the European project was built.” Belgium and its people had been “hit at our heart,” he said. Islamic State released a video on Thursday calling on its followers to wage jihad after the Brussels bombings for which it claimed responsibility on Tuesday. “The crusaders’ aircrafts, including Belgium’s, continue to bomb … night and day,” the video said. “Every Muslim who is well aware of the history of Islam, knows that the holy war against infidels is an integral part of Islam.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2015/oct/11/letters-bbc-volcano-storm-faked-justice-british-sport-science-hs2","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-10T23:05:13Z","webTitle":"Don’t be surprised the BBC faked its volcano storm | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2015/oct/11/letters-bbc-volcano-storm-faked-justice-british-sport-science-hs2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2015/oct/11/letters-bbc-volcano-storm-faked-justice-british-sport-science-hs2","fields":{"headline":"Don’t be surprised the BBC faked its volcano storm","bodyText":"I am with David Attenborough, who said, when it was revealed that the filmed interior of a polar bear den supposedly in the Arctic was actually in a European zoo: “Come on, we were making movies.” (“BBC shots of lightning over volcano looked fantastic but were faked”, News). His bear cubs were real and so was all of this volcanic smoke – it was just footage of two eruptions digitally stuck on top of each other – in Patagonia. Ever since American civil war photographer Andrew Gardner pulled a corpse around the Gettysburg battlefield, re-dressing it for different shots as he went, photographs have been faked – and more seriously than in this incident. Wouldn’t it make better sense for the press to insist that photographic images are, if not actually untrustworthy, then certainly no more trustworthy than are other communications? Would it be such a tragedy if television documentaries were no more automatically believed than, say, printed journalism? Professor Brian Winston University of Lincoln Criminal justice must be free Katharine Whitehorn (Magazine) notes how nasty some charities have become, but is “glad that so many other things – roads, police, firefighters and judges – are simply financed by taxes”. Sadly, we can no longer include judges (or magistrates) in this list. Since the introduction in April of the aptly titled criminal courts charge, guilty defendants now face a charge ranging from £150 to £1,200 for the privilege of having their case heard in a court. The government feels that it is right that wrongdoers should meet the cost of bringing them to justice, and that they should pay this charge on top of their fine, costs, compensation and victim surcharge. We need some action from Mr Gove to right this serious wrong. Anthony Young Chidham West Sussex Don’t ignore sporting success Andrew Anthony’s article entitled “Nervous, leaden, paralysed by expectation: it’s the English way” (News), pursued themes discussed in an Observer Sports Monthly article in 2007, claiming that “major setbacks are… the rule in English sport”. In 2007, Anthony conflated “English” and “British”, claiming both lacked the qualities for sporting success. Now he focuses on the English; Britain’s Davis Cup success is apparently due entirely to “the Scotsman” Andy Murray. Anthony’s analysis is perplexing. Evidence shows that, in 2007, Britain was on the way to surpassing continental Europeans in Olympic medal tables. Why does a women’s football bronze weigh heavily in his scale of judgment and piles of English gold count for little? Bizarrely, in 2007, he argued that the English were inherently less competitive than other people, but also that enhanced funding would lead to more success for English/British athletes! Feature writers persist in claiming that the English/British have “losers’ mentality”. This stems from the “declinist” ideology identified by Robert Tombs. Pessimism is fashionable; optimism is beneath the dignity of intellectuals. Tom Callaghan London N6 Politicians should know science Scientific illiteracy is widespread (lettersk), and when policy-makers hold no understanding of even basic concepts, it is no surprise that there is no support for environmental initiatives, but, instead, unquestioning enthusiasm for fracking and nuclear power and weapons. Policies framed in purely free-market economic terms, which take no account of simple but hugely significant chemical reactions and biological and physical processes, have led us to the brink of planetary environmental catastrophe. Perhaps there should be a requirement that cabinet members are tested on basic scientific ideas that are relevant to the policies they decide upon? Max Fishel Bromley We must stop HS2 rail link Frank Field (“Tax credits and trains can help Corbyn outflank the Tories”, News) argues that it is too late to stop the huge white elephant HS2, which he rightly compares to the Millennium Dome and correctly believes will benefit the south. He thinks Labour should focus on building “HS3”, the desperately needed links between cities in the north, which the Tories have “paused”. The cities of the north can better be linked without HS2. Field neglects the fact that building HS2, which will now take at least until 2033, will suck away all the money that will be needed for HS3, and will damage the rest of our railway network into the bargain. Labour can and must stop HS2 if it wants a sane transport policy.

The Liberal Democrat party, once one of the champions of opposition to nuclear power and weapons, has just voted at its conference to accept the \"limited\" use of nuclear power plants. This came as Japan, once a world champion of the technology, prepared to switch off its last operating nuclear power plant. This reflects what is happening elsewhere around the developed world: Germany has promised to phase it out by 2022; in the US you \"can't even come close to making the maths work on building new nuclear plants\"; even France, with its remarkably relaxed attitude towards nuclear risks (a cause of concern for its neighbours) is planning a partial phase-out of nuclear power, closing 24 reactors by 2025. So why is Britain heading in a radically different direction to the rest of the developed world? There's one argument that we can dismiss quickly. Yes, this government did pledge to be the \"greenest government ever\", but surely even its greatest fan couldn't continue to make that claim with a straight face, when they are spending not a penny on insulating our leaky, expensive-to-heat homes, when they are refusing to include \"decarbonisation by 2030\" in the energy bill, despite widespread support not just from green campaigners but also the business community. So it's not that Britain's government is \"greener\" than all the others. Is it because we have a confused, directionless energy policy that's marked by inaction, confusion and the lack of an evidence base? Well that's probably part of the explanation. A large, mass-generating nuclear plant looks like a comfortingly solid solution to a hole – a large lump of concrete in the dyke. Is it because the nuclear industry still has a lot of cash, a lot of lobbying power (as does the oil and gas industry with fracking), unlike the alternatives – energy conservation and renewable energy? We're definitely on to something there – this is a government that's remarkably prone to sway before the push of a well-funded lobbying campaign – whether it's on plain cigarette packets, alcohol minimum pricing or banking regulation. Yet it's really quite simple to dismiss the arguments for nuclear. There are the traditional arguments of the green movement: safety and waste. Britain is a physically small country, as is Japan, where the Fukushima crisis is far from under control and some areas will be left uninhabitable for decades. The thought of a similar scenario, however unlikely it might be claimed to be, at Hinkley, with Cardiff, Bristol and many more population centres in close proximity doesn't bear thinking about – but does have to be considered. Fukushima became far worse than it might have been because the waste was stored on site for want of an alternative solution. We have no waste solution in Britain. The government is attempting to twist the planning system to try again for Cumbria – but the fact is that part of the reason why the county council stepped back from offering long-term storage was expert advice that the geology is unsuitable. The government might be able to change the planning system, it can't change the geology. However, safety and waste are long-running arguments on which people often have fixed views unlikely to be shifted. But we don't need them to rule out nuclear. We can simply look to two issues – cost and timescales. The fact that the Hinkley C plant project has stalled is entirely due to cost issues. Nuclear is now simply prohibitively expensive when compared to renewable alternatives. Going nuclear means, in a nation already struggling with a massive burden of fuel poverty, more expensive consumer bills in future even at the same level of carbon emissions. The other is timing: the last two plants like that planned at Hinkley C have taken respectively 14 years to build and 17 years to bring online. We do have to take large-scale, committed action to cut carbon emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. But we have to take it now to make a significant impact. Nuclear is too slow and would arrive too late. So the arguments for nuclear don't stack up. There's some explanation for why the government still has it as policy, but it remains puzzling that Liberal Democrat party policy should have been changed to back it, reversing one of its trademark stances. Perhaps all we can see as an explanation is that this is no longer the same party that its activists, members, and voters, have known over the years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/jan/18/labour-tories-britain-trident-eu-nation","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-18T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"In Britain, global debates sound more like squabbles | Matthew d’Ancona","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/18/labour-tories-britain-trident-eu-nation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/18/labour-tories-britain-trident-eu-nation","fields":{"headline":"In Britain, global debates  sound more like squabbles","bodyText":"In his memoirs, Tony Blair admits that he and Gordon Brown were less certain about the renewal of Trident than might be assumed. “Spend the money on more helicopters, airlift and anti-terror equipment?” he writes. “Not a daft notion.” In the end, Blair recalls, he and his chancellor let the practicalities of political theatre settle the matter: “As I said to [Gordon]: imagine standing up in the House of Commons and saying I’ve decided to scrap it. We’re not going to say that, are we?” No, indeed. They weren’t going to say that. An integral part of the New Labour settlement was a very public decision not to tamper with Britain’s geostrategic position: we would remain closely allied to the US; an EU member state (on course to join the euro, if Blair had his way); and an independent nuclear power. These, Blair believed, were lapidary assumptions, which a mainstream party challenged at its peril. Yet, nine years since MPs backed plans to renew Trident by a heavy margin, these assumptions have slipped their moorings. Labour is conducting a defence review headed by an opponent of Trident; the party’s leader is fiercely opposed to nuclear weapons and has done nothing to correct the impression that, as prime minister, he would never press the button. Whatever Emily Thornberry’s inquiry decides, the two-decade bipartisan agreement on Britain’s independent deterrent has already collapsed: a major victory for CND and the peace movement, and one that has not gone unnoticed beyond these shores. No less significant to Britain’s place in the world is the prospect of its exit from the EU. During any negotiating process, it is wise to reserve judgment until the final communique is signed off. But there is undoubtedly a sudden spring in the step of the British deal-makers, suggesting that an agreement may indeed be reached next month, and its clauses will include enough substance to keep the spectre of “Brexit” at bay. In particular, there is renewed confidence about an agreement on migration, including the possibility of an “emergency brake” – a procedural device enabling the UK government to halt EU immigration if Britain’s public services lack the necessary capacity. This would represent a constitutional milestone in the history of free movement within Europe. Let’s wait and see what the deal says, and what price – financial or otherwise – our 27 partners exact for the concessions that they do make. But what is clear enough is that the negotiations have entered the final act and that David Cameron is (to use his favourite cricket metaphor) “pitch-rolling” for the referendum promised in 2013. So it is at least conceivable that, a little more than three years hence, a newly elected Labour prime minister will be dismantling Britain’s nuclear deterrent while managing the remaining, manifold consequences of its exit from EU. To adapt Dr Johnson: this possibility should focus the mind. Yet precisely what is missing from these two parallel arguments – over Trident and the EU – is a sense of scale. The geostrategic implications of what is at stake ought to induce a sort of collective vertigo: what sort of country do we want to be? Do we want to withdraw from the largest single market in the world and the top table of the continent? Do we wish to leave the nuclear club unilaterally and, in Aneurin Bevan’s words, “send a British foreign secretary naked into the conference chamber”? How we answer these and related questions defines much more than our collective self-image. It decides how we are seen in a globalised planet, and whether we merit a second glance. You wouldn’t think it, though. Both issues have been summarily relegated to matters of party division and tribal disagreement. Hence: the prospective renewal of Trident has become more symbolic than real, a test of Labour’s continued commitment to the centre-ground and to electability. In the four months of Corbyn’s leadership, it has also given shape to the divisions within his own shadow cabinet: Maria Eagle, who is pro-Trident, was replaced in the defence portfolio by Thornberry; while Michael Dugher was sacked from the culture brief for declaring that failure to support the weapons programme’s renewal would lead to “electoral disaster”. To add to the internal complexity, Ken Livingstone’s sidelining from the defence review showed he is not quite the Thatcheresque “backseat driver” he assumed. It also acted as a reminder that the unions have a powerful vested interest in Trident’s renewal. Paul Kenny, the general secretary of the GMB union, said last week that it was not going to “surrender responsibility to defending members’ jobs”. In sum, Corbyn is faced with a dilemma that not only divides Labour’s parliamentary wing but pits some of the most powerful unions against the anti-Trident faction. This internal debate is being conducted primarily with reference to electability and the protection of jobs. At some stage, one hopes, the argument will get round to an audit of Britain’s strategic interests. But don’t hold your breath. On the Tory side of the house the dispute over EU membership is beginning to resemble a game of paintball played by executives on an awayday. From behind a tree emerges Chris Grayling, leader of the Commons, to declare – kersplat! – that staying in the EU under the current terms would be “disastrous”. Next – pow! – Nick Herbert, a former minister who led the campaign to keep Britain out of the euro 15 years ago, surprises his erstwhile “out” colleagues hiding in the shrubbery by agreeing to head the Tory campaign to stay in the EU. Then – kerpow! – the chancellor himself fires a warning that there will be no second vote – an apparent shot at Boris Johnson who has toyed with the idea of a double referendum. Conservative discipline is a dam about to burst and David Cameron knows it. Why do you think he is pressing so hard for a deal next month? It is an unexpected confluence. Britain’s EU membership is no less symbolic for the Tory party than Trident renewal is for Labour, and both issues are suddenly live. But the debates have so far been skewed, misshapen, the wrong size. They look like mere party disagreements when, in fact, they are national in every sense of the word. Whether or not we realise this in time is an open question."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2016/aug/21/miles-teller-i-felt-extremely-misrepresented-war-dogs","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-21T10:00:13Z","webTitle":"Miles Teller: ‘I felt extremely misrepresented’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/21/miles-teller-i-felt-extremely-misrepresented-war-dogs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2016/aug/21/miles-teller-i-felt-extremely-misrepresented-war-dogs","fields":{"headline":"Miles Teller: ‘I felt extremely misrepresented’","bodyText":"There are a few ways you might know Miles Teller, a 29-year-old actor who is pretty universally thought to be the future of Hollywood. For chin-stroking cineastes, he is the Whiplash kid. That film, which tells the story of a virtuoso jazz drummer and his sadistic orchestra leader, was so out-of-the-blue brilliant that, after seeing it, it was hard not to become its personal publicist, imploring friends, even strangers to see it. Made in 19 days, for just $3 million, it won three Oscars, though not for Teller. For teenage readers, Teller is Peter, the much-needed comic relief in the wildly successful Divergent series, or Mr Fantastic in the much less successful 2015 reboot of the Fantastic Four. And then, for cruisers of the Mail Online’s Sidebar of Shame, Teller is clickbait notorious as “a dick”. This suggestion came from an American Esquire cover story that went viral last August. The article mocked his swaggering confidence and the way he talked about the actors he had in his sights: Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and Joaquin Phoenix. It was a savage, career-jarring take-down and – the modern world for you – was forwarded around to many more people than have ever seen Whiplash. The question is: is Miles Teller the new Ryan Gosling or even the next De Niro or Pacino? Or is he, excuse the bluntness, a dick? On a Saturday afternoon in August, Teller strides into a swanky hotel suite on the 39th floor that’s just about eye level with the clouds. He is in town to promote his new movie, War Dogs, directed by The Hangover’s Todd Phillips, but he has shazzy blond hair from a film he’s currently shooting with Josh Brolin and Jennifer Connelly, about firefighters tackling a wildfire that raged through Arizona in 2013. The Teller story really begins in the summer of 2007, when, as a 20-year-old Grateful Dead fan, he was travelling home to Florida from a Deadhead festival called Gathering of the Vibes. His friend was behind the wheel, another was in the back seat, every inch of space was jammed with camping equipment. Then, at 80mph, the car skidded, jumped three lanes of traffic and flipped eight times. Teller was knocked unconscious and woke up 30ft from the vehicle, his face covered in blood. “The guy driving, he was fine, my buddy he was sleeping in the back,” Teller recalls. “I even had a bag of tomatoes that were fine. Everything was fine except for my face.” He laughs, though not with much enthusiasm. At the hospital he was told he was actually pretty lucky: 99.9% of people ejected from a car at that speed would be dead. They fixed his broken wrist and put 20 staples in his shoulder; his face would require numerous laser surgeries, the kind also used for removing tattoos, to make the cuts, he says, “mitigated in a certain way”. The scars on his throat and chin still catch the eye and two rocks remain in his face, embedded deep in scar tissue. When Teller first went to acting school, he used to joke that if his dog died, that would be the most emotionally wrenching experience he’d had to endure in his life. He comes from a stable, well-to-do family: his father was an engineer on a nuclear-power plant; his mother sold real estate. He grew up mostly in a small town in Florida with a modest claim to fame as the manatee capital of the world. He was effortlessly strong academically, and excelled at sports, especially baseball. He started acting because his drama teacher was “pretty hot”, and landed a place at New York University’s prestigious Tisch School. Then the crash. “I got in my car accident at 20, that was in August,” says Teller, sucking on an e-cigarette. “Then February that next year, I turned 21 and seven of my best friends from Florida flew up for my birthday. Then in June, one of those guys, Nick, passed away in a motorcycle accident: a car ran a stop sign and T-boned him. I was at the hospital, he was on life support, they pulled the plug the next day. A month after that, one my closest friends, my buddy Beau, passed away, again a car accident. And I was actually sitting next to Beau at Nick’s funeral. So at my 21st birthday, seven of my buddies are there, five months later, two of them are gone.” Teller recounts these experiences without histrionics, but the really incongruous part is that car crashes have subsequently been pivotal in five movies in his short career, perhaps most chillingly in Whiplash, where he is sideswiped, arrives late for a key rehearsal and then bleeds all over his drum kit. The run started with his break, 2010’s Rabbit Hole, where he played a teenager who accidentally runs over and kills the son of a couple played by Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart. “When I was first auditioning for projects, they’d say, ‘Miles is a good actor but it doesn’t make sense for this character to have scars,’” says Teller. “But John Cameron Mitchell, the Rabbit Hole director, he loved it. He was like, ‘It’s your character’s secret!’ I remember him being like, ‘Miles, I really need you to think about your buddy Beau right now.’ And this is in the middle of a take, and you’re already as nervous as shit because you’re working with Nicole Kidman and it’s your first movie and she’s not talking to you because she’s in character.” Isn’t it traumatic to relive these experiences on camera? “It’ll definitely impact on me for the rest of my life for sure,” Teller replies. “I’ve dealt with that shit. If I’m in a movie and the guy’s dealing with the death of his buddy when they were overseas at war, or I’m dealing with a guy now who lost 19 of his friends all at once in this firefighter movie, it does give you a certain level of truth that, if you hadn’t gone through it, you would have to imagine what it would be like. But obviously if you went through it, you are closer to it than somebody who hasn’t.” Teller’s early career, Rabbit Hole excepted, did not obviously herald future greatness. He tended to be cast as a friend of the lead character; the offbeat, cocky, fast-talking foil in mostly silly films like 21 &amp; Over and Two Night Stand. But he showed uncommon depth in the superior 2013 romantic comedy, The Spectacular Now, sharing the Special Jury Award for Acting at Sundance with his co-star, Shailene Woodley. Then came Whiplash. Teller had done some drumming at school, in a church choir and a band called the Mutes, but for once, no one could accuse him of playing a version of himself. Andrew, his character, was tortured and self-destructive, mercilessly hazed by a bullying teacher (JK Simmons, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor). “I’m a pretty light-hearted person,” says Teller. “So how Andrew carried himself physically, how he related to people, his temperament, all those things couldn’t be further from me. But what I liked about that kid was the fact that he was an underdog, you’d look right past him, but he’s got the heart and the perseverance as big as anyone.” Teller’s favourite scene was when Andrew charges from behind the drums to flatten his tormentor. “JK cracked a rib,” he laughs. “I’m not proud of it, but after a guy’s slapping you and yelling at you for three weeks straight, it’s nice to finally… as a character, I’m speaking! I always dug that scene because he just finally snaps.” And at least Simmons can take comfort from his Academy Award. Teller exhales a plume of smoke, “He owes me one, for sure.” The sense that Teller gets by on charm and wisecracks still pervades. Todd Phillips, his director in War Dogs, says, “I think Miles is a world-class actor. It’s almost as if he doesn’t have to try. I don’t mean that in a negative way; he’s just naturally gifted. It’s amazing to watch.” When I read this compliment back to him, Teller squirms at the “doesn’t have to try” part. “That’s frustrating!” he says. “It’s frustrating when people say that because an actor’s greatest tool is his preparation and I’ve always felt like I do as much prep as anybody.” War Dogs, though, is something of a departure for Teller. The film tells the jaw-dropping true story of two stoner 20-somethings from Florida who become arms suppliers for the US government. It is set in 2007, and as conflicts rumble on in Iraq and Afghanistan, the friends – one a high-school dropout, the other who not long before had been a massage therapist – win a $300m contract to kit out the Afghan National Army. The deal does not exactly go to plan, which makes it rich comic territory for Phillips, whose Hangover trilogy grossed more than $1.4 billion globally. Jonah Hill hogs most of the best lines as Efraim, the charismatic, larger-than-life dropout, while Teller is more understated and morally compromised as David, the masseur-turned-gunrunner. “David came from Miami, which could not be more different from where I grew up, like the sticks in Florida, out in the woods,” says Teller. “But in some ways we were in very similar circumstances at that age. Like he plays guitar, I play guitar. I smoked a ton of pot, as did David. I don’t know if I’d have been able to go into meetings like David did. I did not do that shit when I was high. That was not my entertainment.” With his languid delivery and sleepy eyes, it’s not hard to imagine Teller as a caner. “I was smoking multiple times a day every day – you’re in theatre school in New York, do it!” he exclaims. “But I slowed down on it and really stopped for a while because my career started going and I didn’t want to mess it up when I was high. If someone sent me an email, I didn’t want to respond and obviously you can’t do that shit.” But now things are going well, surely he can knock himself out? “Yeah,” he smiles, “I’m kind of easing back into it.” If Teller could have been forgiven for being crotchety with journalists, post-Esquire, he isn’t – at least not today. He is engaged, wry and opinionated, especially on gun control in the States and the mental health of soldiers returning from war. “We’ve known how to send guys to war forever, but we really don’t know how to bring them back yet,” he says, citing a statistic that there are 22 veterans committing suicide every day in the US. He’s clearly self-confident about his work, which could be interpreted as dickishness, but then he is an ambitious and versatile performer, as gifted as anyone in his age range. I’d also note that quotes that can read a little bald in print are often more archly and winningly expressed in person. Teller might act bulletproof, but it’s obvious that the Esquire story really stung him. “Oh, I felt frickin’ helpless, I felt extremely misrepresented, I felt a little angry,” he says, his voice almost cracking. “For the average person, they are reading this article, they haven’t met you, they’re like, ‘Oh Miles is an asshole. You didn’t hear it? You didn’t read that Esquire? Yeah, she said he was an asshole – he must be!’ “I’d say that you get a little more guarded but I’m actually not,” he goes on. “Certain times I’ll choose my words very carefully and maybe come off a little more boring. But I also think that’s why people – certain people – do relate to me: because there is no agenda, honestly. I was raised middle-class in a small town. I have all my same friends from high school. I’m close with my family. I’m dating a normal girl. So I want to feel people think I’m a man of the people. Because I feel that way.” The “normal girl” is a bit of a stretch – Keleigh Sperry, his girlfriend of three years, is a model – but the point stands. Teller is compared to a lot of great actors; the one whom he calls to mind for me is Tom Hanks. Hanks, too, started in lightweight comedies, before growing into more mature everyman-ish parts and advocacy: both men are outspoken on the debt they owe to the US military. Teller’s forthcoming roles – a boxer who recovered from a broken neck suffered in yes, a car crash; a soldier with PTSD; a hero firefighter; an Elvis Presley biopic down the line – hint at the direction he’s taking. Time’s up; Teller has wildfires to put out. He smiles warmly, clasps my hand and goes to leave the room. At the door he stops and turns back: “If I read this and you call me an asshole, I’m going to be so pissed off.” War Dogs is out on 26 August"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/oct/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-chinese-presidents-visit-a-big-gamble","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-19T18:58:34Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the Chinese president’s visit: a big gamble | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-chinese-presidents-visit-a-big-gamble","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/19/the-guardian-view-on-the-chinese-presidents-visit-a-big-gamble","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the Chinese president’s visit: a big gamble","bodyText":"President Xi Jinping’s three nights under the Queen’s roof, his address to both houses of parliament, his ride in a royal carriage, and his trip to Manchester with David Cameron this week are indications of much more than the usual ceremonial buttering up of foreign leaders at which Britain so excels when it is looking for favours from abroad. They suggest, instead, a fundamental shift in British foreign policy, and one with profound implications. It is a shift that has not been preceded by the full public discussion it deserves, and one that could constrain us and commit us for decades to come. Put simply, it is proposed to hitch Britain’s economy to the Chinese wagon, with all that may mean in the future in terms of Chinese ownership of key British industries, a growing Chinese presence in our financial sector, and growing Chinese influence over our economic decisions and over our approach to critical human rights issues in China. The Chinese president has called this “a visionary and strategic choice that fully meets Britain’s own long-term interest”. The question for Britain is whether he is right. It would of course be foolish not to engage with China. Every country in the world does so. Indeed, France and Germany have been ahead of Britain in recent years in seeking “special” relations with China. But the pursuit, particularly by the chancellor, George Osborne, of best friend for ever status with China has gone beyond the usual jockeying for advantage between European states in Beijing. The Cameron government appears to have something much more comprehensive and long-term in mind. The shift toward China, gradually taking shape under this government and its coalition predecessor, reflects a growing sense that the British economy, although the headline figures at the moment may look respectable, is vulnerable in a competitive age, and could become more exposed in the future. Our manufacturing will never again be what it was, our productivity is no more than middling, and the City, along with the sale of London property as a safe haven for the world’s rich, and, in some cases, for the world’s crooks, does not generate enough to fill the gap, even if British prowess in arts, culture and entertainment, which earns us a lot, is taken into account. We need long-term investment, the British government has apparently reasoned, and the Chinese have the biggest pot of ready-to-invest money in the world. The model for the long-haul relationship they have in mind is the nuclear power station deal expected to be signed and sealed during President Xi’s visit. In return for renewing and sustaining British infrastructure for years to come, the Chinese get a platform within the City for their own equity offerings, and their global investment and currency dealings, as well as increased influence over Britain and, assuming Britain stays in the EU, over Europe. Such a deal will undoubtedly strain our relations with the United States. From Washington it may well look like they get the hard job of dealing with a militarily pushy China in the Pacific, coping with Chinese cyber attacks, and sticking up, as much as they do, for human rights, while Britain and, to a lesser extent, other European countries seek economic advantage and downplay everything else. It will not endear us to our European partners either. Apart from those considerations, this China policy represents a bet on the Chinese economy’s future that is by no means a sure one. That country’s grave internal debt, its difficult labour relations, its huge overbuilding, as well as the very evident slowing in its growth, combined with overly tight political control, suggest big troubles could lie ahead. Finally, liberals in China look to western countries, not least Britain, for the pressures and publicity that help them survive and ultimately to have a chance to shape their country’s future. How much would we forfeit in this area in an ever closer economic embrace of China? True, it is a difficult call, but Mr Osborne’s misjudged trip to Xinjiang in September suggests we are already getting the balance between profit and principle wrong. We have been frightened before about overdependence on foreign economic power – about the US, oil sheikhs, Japan – and in retrospect the risks were less than they seemed at the time. But China could be different. The former business secretary Vince Cable wrote recently that the visit is “something of a gamble”. Many will be less sure than he that the risk is worthwhile."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sustainable-business/nuclear-power-uk-future-energy-mix","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-18T10:32:00Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power can play a part in UK's future energy mix, says Davey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/nuclear-power-uk-future-energy-mix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/nuclear-power-uk-future-energy-mix","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power can play a part in UK's future energy mix, says Davey","bodyText":"The secretary of state for energy and climate change, Ed Davey, used a key fringe meeting at the Liberal Democrat conference to launch a stout defence of the continued use of nuclear power as a key part of the country's energy mix. Davey argued that backing a new generation of nuclear power stations was the green option. Facing down environmental campaigners who do not believe in nuclear, Davey insisted that nuclear power was crucial to stop climate change. \"A lot of environmentalists who were anti nuclear in the past have changed their view because of climate change,\" Davey said. \"There are some environmental groups who would have you believe that, because you are in favour of nuclear, you have undermined your green credentials. I think they have to look very carefully about what they are saying about climate change, they are losing credibility on climate change.\" Davey said he did not believe in nuclear on its own but was adamant that it should be used in a sensible mix with renewables as the UK moved towards a low-carbon future. The secretary of state was talking to a fringe meeting, sponsored by the National Grid and the Crown Estate, on energy security. Davey argued that Britain was doing well in the short, medium and long terms to make sure there was security of supply and he was confident the government's mixed-use plan would work. However, Jo Butlin, the managing director of energy advisory company Utilyx, urged caution. She warned that the issue of electricity security did not feature in the public consciousness at the moment because \"they are used to flicking the switch and the light comes on\". But, she added, it would become a very real and pressing issue for everybody if that did not happen and the light stayed off. \"When it becomes real, that is when the attitude will shift,\" she said. Butlin told the audience that an increasing number of large UK companies had become aware of the potential dangers to electricity supply in the future so had started sorting out their own electricity generation. \"They are taking control of security of supply themselves,\" Butlin added. While there was some unhappiness in the audience about Davey's defiant backing of nuclear energy, much of the discussion centred around the costs – environmental and financial – of transferring electricity from the outlying areas where renewables were often based, to the areas where the electricity was needed. Rob Hastings, the director of energy and infrastructure at The Crown Estate, argued that the amount of electricity generated in the north of Scotland, for example, more than outweighed the costs of transmitting it to population centres. \"It makes sense to connect something that is quite remote to the consumer and invest in the connection,\" he said. Hastings was criticised by some members of the audience who wanted to know why new \"1950s style\" pylons were still being erected to scar the landscape and why more cables were not buried underground, to keep the landscape intact. But Janine Freeman, the head of UK and EU public affairs at the National Grid, insisted that efforts were being made to soften the effect of transmission lines. \"Our approach is to look at each project on a project-by-project basis. We are very mindful of the impact on these communities and the plans can involve a significant amount of undergrounding,\" she said.

Even in the Palace of Westminster, where members of the Lords and the Commons had gathered for the official address by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, Anglo-Chinese relations have plenty of room for improvement. Perhaps more than elsewhere, even. The tone had been set earlier in the day when John Bercow, who was due to give the official welcome, had made a snarky remark about human rights during a Commons question comparing the Chinese visit with next month’s one by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. There were few smiles as MPs and Lords dragged themselves into the Royal Gallery: attendance was a matter of duty – “England expects ... several large cheques” and all that – rather than pleasure. Tim Farron couldn’t believe he had been relegated back to the fourth row now the Lib Dems are more pressure group than political party, and Jeremy Corbyn looked as if he was having an existential meltdown at finding himself sitting next to the prime minister at an official function for the Chinese president. The only exception was David Cameron. Dave is a natural wedding usher and is a master of the artificial smile and fluent small talk with people he isn’t quite sure he doesn’t know. Xi Jinping had arrived mob-handed with coach loads of advisers and security detail and, after a brief panic when it was realised there weren’t nearly enough seats for them all, the Chinese president walked in escorted on one side by the speaker of the Commons and on the other by Baroness D’Souza, the speaker of the Lords. It’s possible that Bercow had read somewhere that the Chinese don’t respect people who brown nose too obviously, but he was certainly keen to carry on where he had left off in the Commons. “Your visit is the latest in a recent line of Asian leaders that began with Aung San Suu Kyi, that champion of human rights in Burma,” he said. A look of panic crossed Dave’s face as he imagined billions of pounds worth of trade deals being cancelled by the end of the day, but President Xi didn’t let slip a flicker. He’s heard far worse from more important people than Bercow and he was more than capable of giving as good as he gets. It was lovely to visit Britain’s quaint little modern parliament building, he said, but he would just like to serve notice that the Chinese had a democracy and a culture that went back 4,000 years. Presumably the terracotta army must have voted to bury itself. After the stick, the carrot. “China and the UK are drawn together by friendship, support and ... ” Xi continued, tactfully omitting “desperation on Britain’s part to buy up any dumped steel and sell off their nuclear power stations.” Xi went on to list some of the great moments of cross-cultural unity that had existed over the centuries between China and the UK. An English lord had once repaired a Chinese radio, China had sent Britain some Ebola drugs and Lord Bates – the husband of the flag-carrying Lady Bates – had done a long walk in the sun to promote peace. It wasn’t exactly a roll call of honour. Who says the Chinese don’t do irony. Xi did give those literary arrivistes William Shakespeare and Francis Bacon a quick mention but his overall tone was of just going through the motions. He knew Britain was desperate to do business and he was happy to oblige if the terms were right. He didn’t even feel the need to offer a couple of pandas as a sop. There was only one country in charge of these negotiations and it wasn’t Britain. Not that Bercow would have picked up on any of this as he hadn’t bothered to put on his headphones to listen to the simultaneous translation. Perhaps his Mandarin is better than he has previously let on. Sensing the afternoon was heading for disaster, Baroness D’Souza tried to save the day with a final bit of flattery. She loved China, she blustered desperately. We all loved China. We do, don’t we, everyone? “And I do hope you have time to eat some fish and chips while you’re here.” Xi turned to one of his team on the way out and whispered: “Dim and then Sum”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
