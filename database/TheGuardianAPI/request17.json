The warning from Chris McIntosh, a former lieutenant colonel in the Royal Signals and current chief executive of ViaSat UK, follows an invitation from George Osborne to Chinese companies to run UK nuclear reactors. \"What we have done in Britain is to have identified parts of our infrastructure as critical but not invested in them … Outsourcing to someone else not just makes them more vulnerable to cyber-attacks but allows the new owners to either invest or switch systems off. Would we consider outsourcing the army to China, or Germany or France?\" McIntosh said it was \"ridiculous\" to spend billions of pounds on building up an arsenal of frigates and fighter aircraft only for Britain to neglect an equally vital job of keeping the lights on in the home ports. He believed that ministers should look at different funding models for ensuring the UK had enough nuclear or other power stations under local control. McIntosh, whose ViaSat group is stock-listed in the US, also raised serious concerns about the threat of cybercrime from abroad, saying some foreign countries had seen their power systems damaged or temporarily shutdown. The planned introduction of smart meters would potentially allow a power company to turn off the lights in any home at any time. \"We need to have new regulations that dictate that energy companies introduce security systems that protect operational networks from attack. It is not strong enough to have guidelines suggesting the way … Utilities have taken action to protect their IT systems, but this work needs to be extended. It is not cheap to do it and the government needs to commit to an extensive cost benefit analysis.\" Announcing the agreement with Beijing that Chinese firms could take a minority stake in the planned new Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset alongside EDF, Osborne said a majority stake might also be allowed in future. But a Treasury statement added: \"Any investment from any country has to comply with rigorous regulatory standards for safety and security.\" Awareness of the power of computer bugs or malware to cripple facilities was heightened after revelations in 2010 that a destructive system called Stuxnet had been developed in the US and inserted into the Iranian nuclear fuel factory at Natanz to contaminate uranium fuel supplies and slow the project. Meanwhile a report published by the Zpryme Research &amp; Consulting group earlier this year included a poll in which 63% of energy companies said they were \"very concerned\" about the prospects of cyber or network attacks. A further 33% said they were moderately concerned and 5% slightly concerned. Almost half of the respondents said they were most worried about the possibilities of a full power outage. Nick Butler, a former Number 10 energy policy adviser, has raised concerns about China and its links with cybercrime. In a blog last year he said: \"They will be inside the system, with access to the intricate architecture of the UK's National Grid and the processes through which electricity supply is controlled, as well as to the UK's nuclear technology.\" The unease inside the industry was reflected this week in a comment piece from Stuart Nathan, an editor on The Engineer trade magazine. He wrote: \"With continuing concerns about Chinese cyber-attacks on foreign governments' computer systems, should we really be inviting companies which many believe to be effectively arms of the Chinese government into our critical infrastructure at all?\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/sep/12/jeremy-corbyn-philip-hammond-leader-len-mccluskey-says-he-would-back-illegal-strikes-over-public-sector-pay-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-12T18:09:42Z","webTitle":"Hammond says he wants EU transition that looks 'a lot like the status quo' – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/12/jeremy-corbyn-philip-hammond-leader-len-mccluskey-says-he-would-back-illegal-strikes-over-public-sector-pay-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/12/jeremy-corbyn-philip-hammond-leader-len-mccluskey-says-he-would-back-illegal-strikes-over-public-sector-pay-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Hammond says he wants EU transition that looks 'a lot like the status quo' – as it happened","bodyText":"The government is to lift the longstanding 1% annual cap on public sector pay from next year, and has confirmed higher rises for police and prison officers immediately, Downing Street has announced. Theresa May will face multiple rebellions over her EU withdrawal bill next month, as Conservative MPs table amendments aimed at softening the government’s Brexit plan. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has said the government wants a Brexit transition deal that would looks “a lot like the status quo”. (See 5.59pm.) Britain has played one its strongest cards in the EU negotiations by offering to put its defence, security and aid assets at the disposal of the European Union in the hope of getting concessions on future trading and economic relations. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, has urged Theresa May to rethink her snub to MEPs and give a public address to the parliament. The next round of Brexit talks are to take place in the week of September 25, seven days later than expected, in order to give negotiators “flexibility to make progress”, the government has said. As the Press Association reports, the new date for the talks was jointly agreed by officials from the UK and European Union sides to allow “more time for consultation” before they return to the negotiating table. Reports from Brussels quoted EU sources as saying that the delay was agreed to fit in with the UK’s political calendar, with a major speech on the subject expected by Theresa May on September 21. Labour is to force a parliamentary vote to scrap the government’s latest rise in university tuition fees. Jeremy Corbyn has given a very strong defence of trade unions. Speaking to the TUC conference in Brighton, he said: Trade unions are far and away the biggest voluntary and democratic organisations in the country. They are the roots and the lifeblood of our party. You are abused by the powerful and your rights are attacked -including by this government - but the trade union movement represents the best of Britain and is a vital engine of progress in our democracy. He also urged everyone to join a union. If you want a job that pays a decent wage, gives you the chance to get on in life, live independently and enjoy your work, then join a trade union. Do it today. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, and one of Theresa May’s strongest backbench critics over the EU withdrawal bill, has defended a government plan to change Commons rules to give the government a majority on key legislative committees. He said the minority Labour government in the 1970s did the same thing. (See 11.42am.) A Commons library briefing note shows that the 1974 minority Labour government eventually accepted it should not have a majority on those committees. (See 12.01pm.) MPs will vote on the plans later. Originally the debate on the measure had been expected to start soon after 7pm, but that has been pushed back because Tory MPs are dragging out the finance bill debate in what appears to be an attempt to ensure the committee selection changes are debated in a low-profile, late night “graveyard slot”. Boris Johnson, the UK foreign secretary, has bowed to political pressure to fly to the Caribbean to visit the British territories devastated by Hurricane Irma amid continuing criticism of the government’s response to the disaster. The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, has mounted an unabashed defence of Britain’s arms industry on the opening day of one of the world’s biggest weapons trade exhibitions. The squeeze on Britain’s living standards worsened last month after the increased cost of importing fuel, clothes and food pushed inflation back up to 2.9%, from 2.6% in July. The general secretary of Unite has said the prospect of mass industrial unrest over public sector pay is becoming very likely and that his union could be willing to break the law to go on strike. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Open Britain, the group campaigning for a “soft” Brexit, has put out this statement from the Labour MP Wes Streeting in response to what Philip Hammond said about how leaving the EU in 2019 without a customs deal in place could clog up ports like Dover. (See 5.59pm.) Streeting said The chancellor has today blown apart one of the biggest delusions of the hard Brexiteers by admitting there is a real chance Brexit will create a worse trading environment between the UK and the EU. And he has made clear that leaving the customs union could cause significant disruption to our customs system, meaning chaos for our ports, exporters and businesses, if a good transitional deal is not agreed. Businesses and international investors are beginning to lose confidence in the government’s attitude to Brexit. Jobs and growth are on the line. It is vital that the ideological Brexiteers in the cabinet wake up to reality and put membership of the single market and customs union back on the table. Bloomberg’s Rob Hutton points out that the transition plan set out by Philip Hammond in his evidence to the Lords committee sounded very like Labour’s proposals - which the Tories described as “a weak attempt to kick the can down the road”. Here are the main points from Philip Hammond’s evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee. Hammond, the chancellor, said the government wanted a Brexit transition deal that would look “a lot like the status quo”. He said: There is general agreement that it would not make sense to ask business to face two sets of changes and that implies that a transition or interim period would need to look a lot like the status quo, otherwise businesses will be making one set of changes at the beginning of the interim period and another set towards the end of it. He said Dover would not be able to cope if it had to start imposing customs checks from March 2019. Explaining why it was preferable to have a transition deal that involved no new customs checks at the EU border (ie, something akin to be being in the customs union), he said Dover would struggle even if it only had to carry out relatively quick checks. He said: Anyone who’s visited Dover will know that Dover operates as a flow-through port and volumes of trade at Dover could not accommodated if goods had to be held for inspection even, I suspect, if they were held for minutes, it would still impede the operation of the port. Roll-on, roll-off traffic at Dover is predicated on trucks rolling off a ferry immediately, out of the port and the ferry reloading and departing pretty rapidly – Ryanair style turnaround times. Anything that caused delay in vehicles exiting the port, delay in vehicles offloading, would cause significant disruption to patterns of movement. He said, although Britain wanted to be able to negotiate new trade deals during the transition period, it accepted it would not be able to implement them if it retained a customs arrangement with the EU similar to the status quo. He said: When we leave the European Union, we will leave the single market and the customs union as a matter of fact. What we would hope to be able to do is negotiate an arrangement with the European Union that would allow us to operate across borders between the UK and the EU, our trade in goods and services, in much the way we do today. The obvious impediment to such an arrangement is the desire to conclude third party trade agreements with other countries. We have been clear during such a period we would want to be able negotiate with third countries but we would not expect to be able to implement them. That clears the way to have a harmonised customs agreement. He also said he thought agreeing not to implement new trade deals during a transition deal would not be a great sacrifice, because it would take quite a lot of time to negotiate these deals anyway. He said that negotiation with fellow EU customs authorities about post-Brexit arrangements were being held up because the EU was refusing to open talks on a future trade deal. He said: In terms of level of engagement with our nearest neighbours at the customs service level, that has been limited and it has been limited because the view of many of our neighbours is that, until such time as the commission, or the council of ministers, has declared sufficient progress, they are not authorised to engage with us on post-exit planning and post-exit arrangements. We have had less engagement than we would like with our customs counterparts with our immediate neighbours both at a technical level and to discuss possible deal scenario technical challenges and no deal scenario technical challenges. He said the Home Office document leaked to the Guardian about the government’s post-Brexit immigration plans did not reflect current government thinking. When it was put to him that, if those plans were implemented, they would prevent the UK negotiating a transition deal that involved accepting free movement, he denied it. He said the government’s offer to EU nationals was set out by Amber Rudd, the home secretary, in July. That involved EU nationals being free to continue to come to the UK for a period after Brexit provided they registered - a requirement that was allowed under EU law, he said. Referring to the proposals in the Guardian document, which were incompatible with the principle of free movement, he said: I would advise the committee to listen to what the home secretary said, rather than what some document that somebody has dug out from somewhere, which I certainly don’t recognise as our current state of thinking, purports to say. He said the budget would be held on Wednesday 22 November. He said the government wanted to make a “value-for-money” offer to students. He confirmed that the government was looking at how the tuition fee system works, although he refused to confirm reports it will cut the interest rate students pay. He implied there would be an announcement in the budget. But he stressed that it would not just cover fees. He said: I don’t think it would be helpful to look only at the financing side of the equation. I think we need to look more broadly at the range of products offered to students, the way in which we offer them, the information that we provide to students to enable them to make value for money assessments about what they are buying and what it is going to cost them. And I think our focus should be satisfying ourselves that as government, as a responsible body, what we are offering, the package in the round that we are offering to would-be students, represents a value-for-money offer. He suggested there should be more variation in tution fees. He said: I do think there’s a significant difference between a graduate who leaves university with a, perhaps, quite significant level of debt and a well-recognised degree in an area which is known to provide strong employment opportunities, and a graduate on the other hand who perhaps has a very similar level of debt but who may not have a degree that is going to enhance his or her employment opportunities in the same way. I think we have a responsibility to look at the way the system is working in practice because I think it is probably fair to say the original expectation was that there would be a bigger range of outcomes in terms of fees charged than has actually turned out to be the case. He said he was concerned that the current tuition fees system could incentive universities to priorities teaching arts course not science courses. (See 3.53pm.) He said artificial intelligence would quite soon be able to generate some real productivity improvements in the delivery of government services. He said: There are very significant areas of government activity which involve relatively low level decision making which will be highly susceptible to the application of artificial intelligence, probably over a relatively short period of time, which does present the tantalising possibility of being able to drive some real productivity enhancement in the delivery of government processes. The Scottish Tories have offered to help end the deadlock between the Scottish and UK governments over Brexit after ministers in Edinburgh again refused to authorise crucial Brexit legislation. In an unexpected change of tone at Holyrood, the Tories said they wanted to act as an honest broker between the two governments after weeks of verbal sparring over the types of new powers would come to Scotland after Brexit. That conciliatory tone was matched by Mike Russell, the Scottish Brexit minister, who did not repeat his previous claims that the UK government were plotting a “power grab” by withholding those powers from devolved governments. Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Tories deputy leader, said he and Adam Tomkin, the Scottish Tories constitution spokesman, would welcome bilateral talks to ensure both governments could strike a deal which Nicola Sturgeon’s government would accept. Time is running out for the UK government, which needs the Scottish government to table a legislative consent motion accepting the EU withdrawal bill before it reaches its final stages at Westminster early next year. Carlaw said: Brexit isn’t politics as normal. If there’s a genuine concern [in the Scottish government] matched by equally genuine resolve to address and overcome this, then the Scottish Conservatives here at Holyrood will play our part. Russell published a draft memorandum on Tuesday that confirmed the Scottish government would not agree to the EU withdrawal bill until it was substantially rewritten to guarantee Scotland would automatically get former EU powers after Brexit. Along with her Welsh counterpart Carwyn Jones, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has repeatedly accused the UK government of planning that “power grab” because the EU withdrawal bill says all existing EU powers will first return to Westminster. The Welsh and Scottish governments are due to jointly publish amendments to the Brexit bill next week. Several hours before Russell spoke, Damian Green, the UK government’s deputy prime minister, wrote to the Scottish government offering a date for a long delayed joint ministerial committee meeting between the UK government and the devolved administrations in mid-October. Hammond’s session has now wrapped up. I will post a summary shortly. Q: What is the rationale for keeping students in the immigration target? Hammond says that including students is consistent with the UN definition of immigrants. He says the prime minister’s view is that, if the UK were to exclude students from the immigration figures, members of the public would think the government was trying to minimise the figures. Q: But 95% of foreign students return? Hammond says if all foreign students return, their overall impact on the migration figures will be zero. Q: When you were foreign secretary, you said having foreign students at British universities enhanced Britain’s soft power. You were in favour of removing them from the immigration target? Hammond says a myth has grown up in India that there is a cap on the number of foreign students allowed into the UK. The government is trying to dispel that notion, he says. Turning away from the Hammond hearing for a moment, this is from the Times’ Bruno Waterfield. This would confirm a prediction originally made by Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman. Hammond is now being asked about energy. He says it remains the government’s view that the price being paid for energy from the new Hinkley Point nuclear power station will be good value for money. Q: So the government wants a transitional agreement during which we can negotiate trade deals that will come into effect when the new relationship with the EU comes into effect. But presumably there will be new immigration rules in place. So if we agree a deal with a country like India, or Australia, and they demand greater access for their citizens as part of a trade agreement, won’t there be a clash between our trade policy requirements and our immigration policy requirements? Hammond says he does not think that is the case. There is no reason why we should not have one regime for Australia, and another for the EU, he says. Q: But the EU will be our main partner. What will happen if we want to offer India immigration rules that are more favourable? Hammond says it is normal in bilateral agreements to accept terms, and let the other party make agreements with other countries on different terms. He says it is “unlikely” that the UK will agree more liberal immigration agreements with third party countries than with the EU. He says he thinks agreeing not to bring into force new trade deals during a transition won’t be onerous, because in practice it will take some time to finalise these agreements anyway. Hammond says the Swedish/Norwegian border is of great interest to the UK, as an example of a border between an EU and non-EU country. But engagement with customs agencies from other EU countries has so far been limited, he says. Hammond says, if there is no transition, government agencies in Europe (like customs agencies) will end up spending quite significant sums. Q: How can something be as frictionless as it is now on trade? Hammond says he is talking about goods. No one is looking for a better arrangement than now. And it may be that the outcome is not as good as the status quo. But “the design challenge is to minimise the friction to a level that is acceptable to business”. Hammond says David Davis, the Brexit secretary, inspected customs arrangements on the US/Canada border recently. For traders leaving the US, the normal border delay was a minute. For those using the trusted trader system, it was about 30 seconds, he says. Hammond says the government wants a transition period similar to being in the customs union. The obvious problem is that, if the UK were in the customs union, it would not be able to negotiate trade deals. He says its proposal is that it should be able to negotiate trade deals and sign them, but not implement them. When we leave the European Union, we will leave the single market and the customs union as a matter of fact. What we would hope to be able to do is negotiate an arrangement with the European Union that would allow us to operate across borders between the UK and the EU, our trade in goods and services, in much the way we do today. The obvious impediment to such an arrangement is the desire to conclude third party trade agreements with other countries. We have been clear during such a period we would want to be able negotiate with third countries but we would not expect to be able to implement them. That clears the way to have a harmonised customs agreement. Q: So you hope, while you are negotiating with other countries, people would be able to import and export to and from the EU with no restriction? Yes, for the interim period, says Hammond. Q: And do you think the EU will accept that? Hammond says the EU is clearly contemplating such an arrangement being possible. Alistair Darling is now asking the questions. He turns to Brexit. Q: During the summer you said there would have to be a transition period of up to three years. But last week’s Home Office leak in the Guardian suggested everything would end on March 2019. What is the government’s policy in relation to the movement of people, and the transition period? Hammond says he can say three things. The home secretary said in late July that EU nationals would be able to continue to come to the UK as they do now, but with the requirement that they would have to register. That is compatible with EU law. Q: So the new system would not start in March 2019. Hammond says the government’s aspiration is to have a transition. And it expects the EU to agree that. He also says he does not comment on leaks. Q: We know that. But what is the policy? Hammond says a transition would have to be negotiated. But listen to what the home secretary says, not some document, which he says he does not recognise as current thinking. Hammond says Home Office immigration plans leaked to Guardian do not represent current government policy. He says there is general agreement that it would not make sense to ask business to make two sets of changes. So the transition period should look much like the status quo, he says. There is general agreement that it would not make sense to ask business to face two sets of changes and that implies that a transition or interim period would need to look a lot like the status quo, otherwise businesses will be making one set of changes at the beginning of the interim period and another set towards the end of it. Hammond says he wants EU transition to be similar to status quo. The questioning turns to the state of the economy. Hammond says in 2015 the economy was in good shape. But it has “inevitably” been overshadowed by the uncertainty generated by Brexit, he says. Hammond is talking about artificial intelligence. There is the “tantalising possibility” that it might be able to push through significant productivity gains in the public sector, he says. This is from the BBC’s Norman Smith. Q: Would not it be better to call tuition fees a tax? Hammond says it is not a tax. He says it is well understood that there is an element of redistribution in the system. Lower earners are forgiven some of their loan after a number of years. It does not work in the same way as a loan from a bank. That is well understood. Q: It has been reported the government is reviewing how student loans work? Hammond says he can confirm this is under review. In the run-up to the budget, this is being considered. But there are large sums involved. As Jeremy Corbyn has shown, it is easy to talk about getting rid of student debt - but much harder to deliver. It is right to look at the range of products offered to students, and at what information they get. He says it is important to be clear that what is offered to students is a “value for money” offer. That takes into account how much extra they might earn, and how much they have to pay. Hammond says government wants to ensure students get a “value for money” offer on tuition fees. Hammond says he thought there would be a wider range of outcomes in the tuition fees universities charge. Q: Why is the rate at which students have to start paying back tuition fees lower if they are abroad, for example studing in Antarctica? Hammond says people should only have to start paying back when they have a reasonable standard of living. If they are living in a country where living standards are cheaper, that might be equivalent to a lower wage. Q: Do you think funding changes are encouraging universities to offer low cost subjects, not high cost ones like Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects? Hammond says it is a matter of concern that universities incur significantly higher costs teaching some subjects, but not others, but that the funding system does not reflect that. Some have argued that there is a perverse incentive in the system to allow them to generate surpluses by teaching humanities subjects, which are cheaper, he says. Hammond says he is concerned the student funding system could incentive universities to priorities teaching arts not sciences. Philip Hammond says the government is looking carefully at the student loan system. Hammond has arrived at the committee. The budget will be on Wednesday 22 November, Hammond says. Hammond is going to announce the date of the budget. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, is about to give evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee. It is his first appearance before a parliamentary committee since the general election. The committee is conducting an inquiry into post-school education funding and wants to ask about the following topics in connection with that. Expansion of higher education Underemployment of graduates Sustainability of the student loan system Proposed sale of the pre-2012 student loan book Funding of further and technical education But the committee says it wants to ask about these topics too. Current state of the economy Brexit and transitional arrangements Post-Brexit immigration policy International students and the net migration target Hinkley Point C As Corbyn finishes, some delegates chant “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn.” Corbyn says rightwing papers don’t like trade unions. But the power of billionaires who control great chunks of the media is not what it was, he says. They tried to sway the election. But millions of people ignored them, he says. He says he is not in control of when the next election will be. But people are in control of their lives, and they can organise, and join a trade union. He says he does not know when the election will be. But this government will be prised out of power, he says. And that’s it. Corbyn says winning a Labour government is not enough. The most important thing any worker can do is join a union, he says. And he says he wants young people to get this message. More young people are getting involved in politics, and they are voting in higher numbers than they have for a generation. If you want a job that gives you a decent wage, and allows you to get on, “join a trade union”. And he urges those watching to do the same today. “You’ll never regret it,” he says. Corbyn says we must not allow ourselves to be duped. It is not migrants who drive down wages, but unscrupulous employers, supported by the government. Corbyn says technological innovation is crucial. But it does not represent real progress if it takes people back to 19th century employment practices, or if it leads to deregulation leaving workers without dignity or security. We need policies that are not stuck in some “1980s timewarp of neoliberal dogma”, he says. He says the Bank of England says 15m jobs could be at risk from automation over the next decade. The low paid are most at risk, he says. He says the Tory way of running the economy has widened inequalities. And the Tory approach to Brexit will accelerate that further, he says. They want a race-to-the-bottom with Donald Trump. The Tory Brexit would drive down standards, he says. Labour would pursue a jobs-first Brexit, he says. Corbyn says rights have to be defended. That is why Labour is opposing the EU withdrawal bill. It would give the Tories the power to rip up workers’ rights without MPs having a say, he says. Corbyn says TUC research found that workers asking for flexible working often get penalised for it. Corbyn says privatisation is about transferring wealth and power from the many to the elite few. When public sector workers are having to use food banks, you know something is deeply wrong. He says the government’s pay policy changes by the day. At the weekend the government said the pay cap would go. Yesterday, at the lobby briefing, Downing Street said it was staying. Today the government is getting rid of it for some. But a below-inflation pay rise is not a pay rise, he says. And he accuses the Tories of “divide and rule”. Labour would get rid of the pay cap for everyone, he says. Corbyn says Labour would get rid of pay cap for all public sector workers. Corbyn starts with a tribute to the union movement. Then he moves to pay, and criticises McDonald’s for their low pay. He raised this at PMQs last week, he says. The Conservatives claim to be the workers’ party, he says. But Theresa May was unable to condemn McDonald’s pay policy. Jeremy Corbyn is about to speak to the TUC. If you are so minded, you can read the full 59-page Commons document setting out all the amendments to the EU withdrawal bill tabled so far here (pdf). But, to make life a little simpler, here are five key amendments worth focusing on. These could be five of the most awkward for the government, the ones where defeat, or wholesale concessions, are most likely. Four of them are Tory backbench amendments and one has been tabled by a Labour backbencher. That is not because the official Labour amendments (see 9.39am) are without merit. It is because the government will only be defeated if Tory MPs vote against and they are more likely to vote for their own amendments, or backbench ones, than for Jeremy Corbyn’s. 1 - Amendment 7, tabled by Dominic Grieve, saying MPs would have to pass a law approving the EU withdrawal deal. This is one of several amendments signed by a cabal of nine Tory pro-Europeans. Apart from Grieve, the others are: Kenneth Clarke, Nicky Morgan, Anna Soubry, Antoinette Sandbach, Stephen Hammond, Dr Sarah Wollaston, Jeremy Lefroy and Bob Neill. The government has promised parliament a vote on the final Brexit deal, but it will simply be a yes/no vote - or a take-it-or-leave it vote. Forcing the government to enact EU withdrawal by statute would almost allow MPs and peers to demand changes; in other words, they would get the “meaningful” vote that Labour has been demanding. Ministers are likely to resist this ferociously, on the grounds that giving parliament a vote of this kind would result in the final Brexit deal being re-written in London, at a time when further renegotiation could be impossible. With the DUP MPs supporting her, Theresa May has a working majority of 13. That means just seven Tory MPs can trigger a defeat if they line up with the entire opposition. Grieve has got nine (including himself) already. But in practice May probably has a slightly larger majority on Brexit because a handful of strongly pro-Brexit Labour MPs (seven last night) have been voting with the government on Brexit legislation. 2 - Amendment 3, also tabled by Grieve, proposing a “triage and scrutiny system under the control of parliament” for deciding how the new laws passed by ministerial order (the “Henry VIII” powers) under the bill will be scrutinised. This amendment has been tabled by the “Grieve nine” (see 1 above), plus fellow Tories John Penrose (who is firmly pro-Brexit), Vicky Ford and Tom Tugendhat. Labour and the Lib Dems have both tabled amendments that are broadly similar, and some version of this proposal will almost inevitably be added to the bill. 3 - New Clause 9, tabled by Labour’s Chris Leslie, saying the government should not leave the European Economic Area (EEA) until ministers have published a white paper on the costs and benefits. Various amendments have been tabled intended to keep the UK in the EEA, but they don’t seem to have attracted signatures from Tory pro-Europeans. Leslie’s amendment makes a relatively modest demand - it is hard to argue against publishing a white paper - which could make MPs more likely to support it. 4 - Amendment 8, tabled by Grieve, saying the charter of fundamental rights should continue to apply domestically in the interpretation of retained EU law. Another amendment from the “Grieve nine”, this addresses an issue raised in the debate yesterday by Tory MPs like Maria Miller, who is not one of the Tory pro-European “usual suspect” troublemakers. In the debate on Thursday, in response to a question from the SNP’s Joanna Cherry, the Brexit secretary David Davis said he would find a way of accommodating this point, so some form of concession on this is highly likely. 5 - Amendment 2, tabled by Grieve, limiting the conditions in which ministers can use the “Henry VIII” powers given to them by the bill. This is just one of many amendments addressing this issue, and some form of concession seems inevitable. Like amendment 3, this also has the support of John Penrose, a significant figure in this context because, unlike Grieve’s other allies, he is a member of the European Research Group, the Tory caucus pushing for a hard Brexit. If that has not satiated your appetite for key EU withdrawal bill amendments, HuffPost’s Owen Bennett has his own list of 11 important ones here (some of which overlap with mine). This is from my colleague Graeme Wearden. Here is my colleague Graham Ruddick’s story on the Bradley announcement. Back in the Commons Watson says Bradley has “shot her fox” with the Murdochs. They don’t like her, he says. He says he knows what it is like. He says she has nothing to lose, and he urges her to go ahead and order phase two of the Leveson inquiry, the one intended to investigate in detail phone-hacking at the News of the World. (David Cameron promised this during the coalition government, but the Conservatives proposed dropping this in their election manifesto.) Bradley laughs. In response, Bradley says she has taken her decision purely on the evidence. But Bradley complains about how leftwing campaigner harassed her and her family over the summer over the Murdoch issue. On a point of order, Watson intervenes to say, if Labour members were involved in that, he will make sure action is taken against them. MPs should not be harassed for doing their jobs, he says. This is from my colleague Mark Sweney. And this is from the FT’s David Bond. Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader and shadow culture secretary, says Bradley is the first minister in the government to stand in the way of what Rupert Murdoch wants. “Well done,” he says. She is, as they say in the Black Country, “a good ‘un”, he says. Bradley says if she does decided to refer the bid to the CMA on the grounds of media plurality and standards, as she is currently minded to do, that would lead to a full investigation. Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, is now making a Commons statement on the bid by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox for Sky. She says she is still minded to refer the deal to the Competition and Markets Authority on media plurality grounds. That has been her position for some time. But she announces that she is now also minded to refer the deal to the CMA on the issue of Fox’s “genuine commitment to broadcasting standards”. Bradley says Murdoch’s bid for Sky could be referred to CMA on standards grounds as well as plurality grounds. Q: If you want to hold on to staff, you could give public sector workers a pay rise now. Truss says pay awards for 2017 have been settled. There are different issues for different professions, she says. And that’s it. The Truss interview is over. Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, is being interviewed about the pay announcement on the World at One now. She says the government decision on prison service officers reflects the recommendation from the pay review body. Now the government is looking at a new approach for 2018-19. Q: But that’s too late. The public sector is finding it hard to recruit. Truss says the government is giving pay review bodies more flexibility. She says the government is making sure its policy is targeted to where there are specific issues. Here is my colleague Peter Walker’s story on the public sector pay announcement The cabinet has agreed to end the public sector pay cap, Downing Street announced this morning. HuffPost’s Paul Waugh says Tory MPs are planning to delay the vote on giving the government a majority on key committees until the early hours. Theresa May should be phoning the head of plane maker giant Boeing rather than Donald Trump if she wants to save more than 5,000 aerospace jobs in Northern Ireland, the Unite union said today. Responding to a Times splash (paywall) saying that the prime minister telephoned the US president seeking help to save a key Bombardier contract with Delta Airlines, Unite pointed out that Trump has no input into Boeing’s decision to take the Canadian owned aircraft manufacturer to court. The jobs at Bombardier’s plant in East Belfast are under threat if Boeing can convince a US court that a subsidy from the Quebec regional government enabling them to build 125 C-Series passenger jets for Delta was unfair state support. Unite’s regional co-ordinator Davy Thompson had this advice for the Prime Minister in her bid to save the Bombardier Belfast jobs: Bombardier benefited from state investment from the UK, Canada and from Invest NI all of which was entirely lawful and legitimate – a fact that the UK government should clarify. Boeing’s attempts to link this public investment to the allegation of unfair competition are unsustainable; indeed, in the case of the sale of planes to Delta airlines which has been raised, Boeing did not even make a bid. Prime Minister Theresa May is reported to have had a phone conversation with President Trump on the matter but it is our understanding that the president can have no input into this decision. What is needed is for the prime minister to phone the head of Boeing and direct them to end their corporate bullying. The UK government is the second largest purchaser of Boeing products. These present ample leverage to end this damaging course of action. The biggest rail workers union has pledged to continue campaigning to keep guards on trains as it received support from the trade union movement, the Press Association reports. The RMT union is embroiled in bitter disputes over the role of guards and driver-only trains at Southern Railway, Merseyrail and Arriva Rail North, which have led to a series of strikes. The dispute is set to spread to other train operators. The union won backing from the TUC Congress in Brighton, which criticised government transport ministers for backing the train operators. Dominic Grieve argued on Sky earlier (see 11.42am) that there was precedent for the government giving itself a majority on key committees dealing with bills. The House of Commons library has this morning published a briefing (pdf) on the new selection committee ahead of tonight’s vote. It explains what happened in the 1970s in some detail, and it suggests that Grieve’s account of what happened in the past is rather partial. Here is an excerpt. There have been three occasions in relatively recent history when the government had no majority. After the February 1974 election, the government did not have a majority. Even number of government and opposition members were appointed to committees. In October 1974, the Labour government secured a narrow majority at the election. Having lost its majority by April 1976, in May 1976 it accepted that it was no longer entitled to a majority on committees. In January 1995, following the suspension of a number of members, the Conservative party technically lost its majority but argued that as it had not lost seats at by-elections or as a result of defections, it should continue to have a majority on committees. The full story is complicated - do read the whole paper if you are interested; it’s only five pages - but the briefing does show that it is not true to say that minority governments in the recent past have always given themselves a majority on standing committees. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, is one of the government backbenchers most critical of the EU withdrawal bill. (He politely accused the justice secretary David Lidington of talking nonsense in the final minutes of the debate last night.) But, in an interview on Sky’s All Out Politics this morning, he told Adam Boulton that he supported the government’s motion saying it should have a majority on key Commons committees that is being put to a vote tonight. He said: I think it’s inevitable that the government should seek to take this power. It has happened before. When there was a minority Labour government in the 70s, exactly the same thing [happened] ... There came a point where [the Labour government elected in 1974 with a tiny majority] started to to lose their majority and they were still able to maintain majorities in committee. Ultimately the majority is the majority you have on the floor of the House, and where you have effectively the government enjoying [a majority] - you saw it last night, the government was able to enjoy a reasonable majority with the help of the DUP - then I don’t think it is wrong for the government to try to ensure that there isn’t a complete logjam. Otherwise what is going to happen is that the bill committees will constantly be amending bills which will then have to be re-amended on the floor of the House. And I just don’t think that’s a very productive place to be. Nick Timothy, Theresa May’s former co chief of staff and her most influential policy adviser until he resigned after the general election, has used his new column in the Sun to propose some potential Brexit compromises. He argues that the government should realise the key decisions are taken in Berlin, not Brussels. We must respect the process and negotiate with Michel Barnier, the French commissioner designated to deal with Brexit. But we must also remember where the big decisions in Europe are actually taken, and that is in Berlin. (This seems to be a re-run of the “Angela Merkel will help us out” fallacy that stymied David Cameron’s renegotiation, although Timothy insists otherwise.) Timothy suggests that the UK should barter security cooperation for a good Brexit deal. Berlin does, though, remain Europe’s most important decision maker. In order, its priorities are to safeguard the euro, keep the remaining 27 members together, protect Europe from security threats and improve the EU’s trading links. Brexit must do nothing to jeopardise those aims, and Britain should help Germany to achieve them. We could, for example, make a generous offer to a select few member states on intelligence-sharing and counter-terrorism co-operation. And he suggests Britain should offer EU citizens preferential post-Brexit access to the UK. We should continue to insist on restoring our ability to control European immigration, but we could still establish a preferential system for Europeans who want to work in Britain. This proposal would disappoint the British Asians who voted leave in the referendum after being told by Vote Leave that it would stop Commonwealth migrants being treated as less welcome than EU migrants. There are two Commons statements today. The latest Guardian/ICM polling figures are out. The state of the parties figures are almost identical to what they were two weeks ago, showing the two main parties tied on 42%. Labour: 42% (no change from Guardian/ICM two weeks ago) Conservatives: 42% (no change) Lib Dems: 7% (no change) Ukip: 4% (up 1) Greens: 3% (no change) With Brexit putting strain on the union with Scotland, and also emboldening those calling for a referendum on a united Ireland, we also asked people what they would feel if they saw parts of the UK breaking away. The question said that some people think Brexit could lead to the break-up of the UK over the next 10 to 20 years and asked people if they would be pleased or disappointed if these outcomes occurred within the next 20 years. Here are the results. Scotland voting for independence Pleased: 24% Disappointed: 51% No view: 25% Ireland voting to join the Republic Pleased: 22% Disappointed: 42% No view: 36% Wales voting for independence Pleased: 15% Disappointed: 56% No view: 30% Wales voting for independence in that time scale is not seen as at all probable, but we included it for the sake of fairness. These figures represent the views of British voters, and obviously the overwhelming majority of those are English. The figures show that there is no desire to see the UK break up, but equally that support for the union is perhaps weaker than people might expect. Only 42% of British voters would be disappointed to see Northern Ireland vote to join the Irish Republic after Brexit at some point in the next 20 years, a poll suggests. There would be more concern about Scotland voting for independence, but only a slim majority of Britons (51%) would be disappointed by that outcome, the poll suggests. ICM also asked its regular tracker questions about Brexit. We asked exactly the same questions in February and in July. People were asked if Brexit would have a positive or negative impact on the British economy, on their personal finances and on life in Britain generally. Here are the results. Impact on the British economy Positive: 32% Negative: 42% No difference: 14% Net: -10 (up 3 from ICM in July) Impact on your personal finances Positive: 13% Negative: 30% No difference: 41% Net: -17 (up 3) Impact on life in Britain generally Positive: 35% Negative: 34% No difference: 18% Net: +1 (up 2) Voters are more likely to think Brexit will a negative effect than a positive effect on the economy and on their personal finances. But they are slightly less negative in their assessment they were two months ago, and, by a very narrow margin, they think Brexit will have a positive impact on life in Britain generally. I will post a link to the ICM tables here when they are available on the ICM website. UPDATE: Here are the ICM tables (pdf). ICM Unlimited interviewed a representative sample of 2,052 GB adults aged 18+ online, on 8 to 10 September 2017. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules. Here is the full list of amendments to the EU withdrawal bill (pdf) tabled so far. This is from my colleague Graeme Wearden. BREAKING: Britain’s inflation rate has jumped to 2.9% in August, from 2.6% in July. That equals the four-year high struck in May this year. It means British households are still facing a cost of living squeeze, as wages are currently rising by around 2.1%. Graeme has more on his business live blog. The Evening Standard’s Joe Murphy says the Labour amendments (see 9.39am) are among 136 that have already been tabled to the bill. The Labour party has published details of the first amendments it has tabled to the EU withdrawal bill, which passed its second reading at about 12.30am this morning. Here are details of what the party is proposing from the Labour news release. The party describes this as its first tranche of amendments. More will follow, it says. The amendments include action on: Delegated Powers. Labour’s amendments would remove the most extensive and unaccountable ‘Henry VIII’ powers. For example, one Labour amendment deletes the bulk of clause 17, which as drafted would enable government ministers to amend any primary legislation affected by our exit from the EU. This is the clause the Hansard Society described as “in effect hand[ing] the government a legislative blank cheque”. A further Labour amendment would ensure that any withdrawal agreement that comes out of the article 50 process has to be implemented in separate primary legislation. At present the bill would enable government ministers to implement a withdrawal agreement through delegated powers. Labour’s amendments would also establish a new independent and cross-party parliamentary committee to decide which level of scrutiny each government proposal is subjected to. Devolved powers. Labour has tabled an amendment to clause 11 of the bill that would ensure devolved powers returning from Brussels go directly to the devolved legislatures in Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast. At present the bill would hoard these powers in Westminster. Labour’s proposals would ensure there is a clear presumption of devolution in this bill. Safeguarding rights and protections. Labour’s amendments would ensure there can be no watering down or drop in EU-derived rights as a result of this Bill. This protects a wide range of rights, including workplace rights, environmental standards, consumers’ protections and equalities laws. A further Labour amendment would ensure that important EU-derived rights can only be changed by primary legislation and not through the use of other delegated powers. EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Labour’s amendment would ensure that the charter is incorporated into UK law. Without this amendment this bill could lead to a weakening of human rights and weaker protections for UK citizens. Transitional Arrangements. Labour’s amendments would put the timing and basic terms of any transitional arrangements in the hands of parliament, not ministers. This would mean the government had to consult and get the agreement of parliament on one of the central issues in our exit from the EU. In a statement Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: Labour amendments would give greater control to parliament and take power back from the hands of ministers. They would protect key rights and environmental safeguards and ensure that the government does not have a legislative blank cheque. They will go some way to improve what is a deeply flawed bill. Many Conservative MPs expressed reservations about the bill during the second reading debate, and, in theory, there is probably a majority in the Commons for quite a few of these proposals. But MPs are also tribal creatures, and even pro-European Tories will think twice before voting for amendments tabled by Jeremy Corbyn. In reality the amendments most likely to be passed may turn out to be the backbench ones that overlap with what Labour and the other opposition parties support. Jeremy Corbyn is addressing the TUC later, and this morning the BBC has been leading with the news that Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary and Corbyn’s most powerful union ally, has been floating the prospect of trade unions holding illegal strikes against the public sector pay cap. Last year the government passed the Trade Union Act, banning strikes in some areas of the public sector unless 40% of members have voted in favour. Speaking to the BBC, McCluskey said his members were willing to defy this new law. He said: We will always stand shoulder to shoulder with our members. If the government have pushed us outside the law then they will have to stand the consequences. Asked if he would back a strike that did not meet the threshold requirements in the Act, he replied: If they haven’t managed to hit an artificial threshold that this government have foolishly put onto the statute books, then I will stand by our members and we will all live, including the government, we will all live with the consequences of that. He also said that the prospect of “co-ordinated public service workers action” was “very much on the cards”. Asked about his comments on the Today programme, Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, said McCluskey’s comments were “hypothetical”. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.20am: Theresa May chairs a political cabinet (ie, one devoted to party political matters). It will be followed by a normal cabinet at 10am. 9.30am: Inflation figures are published. 9.50am: Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman, holds a press conference. 12.30pm: The department for exiting the European Union (DExEU) publishes its paper on defence. As Rowena Mason reports, it will say that Britain will offer to agree positions on foreign policy with Brussels and contribute to joint military operations after leaving the EU. 2.30pm: Jeremy Corbyn gives a speech to the TUC conference. 3.35pm: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, gives evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee. Later tonight MPs will vote on the government motion giving the government a majority on key committees. The two-hour debate will come after the vote on the finance bill, but there is no time-limit for that debate. Yesterday one MP speculated that the key vote may be delayed until 3am. I will be focusing in particular on the Corbyn speech and on Hammond’s evidence to the Lords committee, but, as usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

President Xi Jinping’s two-day trip has been dubbed a “fate-changing visit”, given the importance of the series of agreements he is expected to sign that are intended to turn Pakistan into a crucial trade route for China. The huge sums being offered dwarf the billions spent over the last decade by the US in its attempts to stabilise a fragile nuclear power and enlist its support for the war against the Taliban in neighbouring Afghanistan. The Chinese are not just offering to build much-needed infrastructure but also make Pakistan a key partner in its grand economic and strategic ambitions. Under the proposed China-Pakistan economic corridor, strengthened rail and road networks will allow Chinese goods to flow the length of the South Asian nation from its northern mountains to the Arabian Sea port of Gwadar. For China it would provide a shorter, alternative route to major oil-producing countries than south east Asia’s strait of Malacca, an overcrowded, relatively shallow sea lane troubled by pirates. Islamabad hopes the transit trade, in addition to lavish Chinese investment in new power stations, will provide a once-in-a-generation boost to a sluggish economy that has fallen far behind that of Pakistan’s regional competitor, India. Pakistani officials claim the total investment comes to $45bn (£30bn), with the bulk of it going on efforts to double the country’s current electricity output. Ahsan Iqbal, Pakistan’s planning minister, said the trade corridor project would tie the two countries’ economies together. “The real opportunity of this China-Pakistan economic corridor is that it changes the scope of the relationship from geopolitics to geoeconomics,” he said. Sceptics have queried whether such vast sums are realistic for an unstable nation that is battling terror groups and has struggled to attract significant foreign investment. Plans to link China to the waters of the Arabian Sea via Pakistani territory have been around for decades, and engineers began the task of carving a road through one of world’s toughest mountain ranges in the 1960s. But traffic and trade remained light and in recent years a large section of the Karakorum Highway has been submerged under a lake formed when a landslide blocked a river. Security will be one of the biggest challenges, not least in Balochistan, home of the Gwadar seaport and a decade-old separatist insurgency. The army says it has plans to raise a special force to protect the large numbers of Chinese engineers and workers who will help to build up the province’s infrastructure. China also wants to see Pakistan tackle Jihadi militants and help end the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, given the links they have with Muslim separatists in China’s westernmost Xinjiang region. Xi has never visited Pakistan before, but he lavished praise on his hosts before his two-day trip began. “I feel as if I am going to visit the home of my own brother,” said a newspaper article in his name, published on the first day of his visit. He also reprised the now-cliched phrase of Pakistani-Chinese relations, that the two nations’ friendship was “higher than mountains, deeper than oceans and sweeter than honey”. China has long regarded Pakistan as an unflinchingly loyal ally, rewarding it with arms sales and assistance with its nuclear programme. For its part, Pakistan puts enormous store by its relationship with a giant neighbour with which it has little in common. Where Pakistan sees itself as a leader in the Islamic world, China is officially atheist and has been regularly accused by human rights groups of oppressing its Muslim minority. Despite their differences, however, Islamabad sees China as a vital ally in its struggle against India and as a foil to US dominance. Xi was welcomed to the country with full military honours, including a flypast of fighter jets. Pakistani officials have expressed disappointment he declined an invitation to attend the country’s national day celebrations last month. US largesse to Pakistan, including payments of $1.5bn a year since 2010 under the so-called “Kerry-Lugar” act, has failed to elicit anything like such a warm relationship. Even though much of the cash was funnelled to the Pakistani army, the country’s most powerful institution, relations were often tense and the US polled among the least loved nations in opinion polls. Amerian officials ultimately concluded the payments were too scattered and failed to dissuade Pakistan from secretly backing its old allies, the Taliban."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2015/jul/16/hs2-chairman-sir-david-higgins-north-south-rail-divide","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-16T19:12:43Z","webTitle":"HS2 chief hits out at ‘unjust’ division of rail assets between north and south","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/16/hs2-chairman-sir-david-higgins-north-south-rail-divide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2015/jul/16/hs2-chairman-sir-david-higgins-north-south-rail-divide","fields":{"headline":"HS2 chief hits out at ‘unjust’ division of rail assets between north and south","bodyText":"Britain has lacked, according to mild-mannered Sir David Higgins, a proper sense of outrage. Not the kind of anger that anti-HS2 protesters vent at the £50bn high-speed rail project Higgins leads, but outrage at the injustice that sees one half of the country routinely look down upon the poorer. The chairman of HS2 Ltd, whose CV includes running Network Rail and heading the Olympic Delivery Authority, says doom-mongering over high-speed rail brings back memories. He said: “There were the same headlines on the Olympics, smack up to the opening – we’re going to be embarrassed by the opening ceremony, we’re not going to win medals, and we’re wasting all this money. “My response was: ‘You’ve sat here for decades and watched them dump rubbish, from sewage to fridges to contaminated waste, in east London and expected people to live there. You live in your privileged areas of west London and you expect the public to put up with this in east London, and it’s a national disgrace.’ “People didn’t care about it. There was no groundswell of anger. It was unjust and unfair. There should have been an outcry.” Higgins said the story of transport is not much different. “It’s the same sort of divide. I believe the north has been shortchanged. I look at expenditure per head, the pass-me-down process – the offcuts from rolling stock always end up in the north. Two hours from Birmingham to Leeds on a chugger, old crappy trains on poor railway lines. We would not accept that from London to Swindon, and we don’t: we insist on a huge amount of money going into commuter services.” HS2 will attempt to address this divide, with a first leg that runs from London to Birmingham, then a second phase linking to Manchester and Leeds. People in the north have been, Higgins said, “taken for granted. It is a disgrace, the lack of investment in transport, and they deserve better. The result is this divided country.” Events of recent weeks have made many dubious that things will soon change. The chancellor’s northern powerhouse was dubbed the northern powercut after the government announced that rail upgrades, including the electrification of the Midland mainline and the Transpennine railway, were to be “paused”, citing cost overruns at Network Rail – despite manifesto pledges made just weeks earlier. Yet the commitment to HS2 survives. Buoyed by the addition of Lord Adonis to the HS2 board, Higgins is unworried by political scepticism, including doubts expressed by the Labour leadership frontrunner, Andy Burnham. Higgins said: “Labour local authorities are 100% behind this. They realise how critical it is for skills and jobs in the north.” He stressed that it “is essential this project is bipartisan” but suggested Adonis, whom he describes as “a big thinker, a good strategist”, will help ensure that. Higgins’ faith has been freshly vindicated in the East Midlands, where the location for a new HS2 interchange at Toton has been nailed down with local authorities, which drew up plans for links and neighbouring regeneration. “They own the solution now. The more you get local ownership, the better.” HS2, he has insisted, must be part of a broader national strategy. Three decades of major infrastructure projects lie ahead: “HS2, Crossrail 2, HS3, the substantial investment in ground support and transport for a third runway at Heathrow, the highways programme, the National Grid, nuclear power stations.” It sounds a tall order, but Higgins insisted: “It’s going to happen. It’s not a question of will we, won’t we.” What about the money? “These are assets – not a cost to the nation.” Ministers have reaffirmed their backing for HS2, and final plans and funds for rebuilding London Euston should be approved this year, which in time will likely see a huge underground superstation combining Euston and St Pancras with a Crossrail 2 station in between. Higgins’s team is still reviewing options for a direct rail link from HS2 to HS1, but his enthusiasm sounds muted. He scrapped the original plans to help cut costs from HS2’s £50bn budget, which is still on target – though the second phase “is much less certain in terms of design, and even the final route hasn’t been determined – but we should work to deliver phase two in £25.5bn, in 2011 pounds”. That qualification might ring a few alarm bells with opponents of HS2, who have pointed out that Higgins, as well as the HS2 chief executive, Simon Kirby, were at the helm of Network Rail when it signed off the recent £38.5bn five-year plan whose budget proved insufficient. Higgins retorted: “That was the team that delivered £20bn of projects in time and budget, you should remember.” He reels off a list of Network Rail achievements from Blackfriars station (“an unbelievable engineering challenge”) to Birmingham New Street. He added: “There’s capacity to do major, complex projects, that’s for sure.” The problems Network Rail has since had with electrification are “utterly different” from what HS2 has to face, Higgins insisted. “What we’re essentially building is a new highway. You know exactly what’s [there] and you’ve got 24-hour access. Upgrading these existing assets is nightmarishly difficult.” But should he not have known that, as the chief executive of Network Rail, when signing off its budget? “The scope was very much in flux. The plan was that the regulator would determine what was fair value when it was fully scoped and Network Rail would then borrow on the markets to fund its asset.” Then, though, came accounting changes that made Network Rail’s £37.9bn debt part of the nation’s balance sheet. The game changed and a cap was put on the credit card. “Once it came on balance sheet all that flexibility’s gone. That’s the most fundamental change. That’s not anyone’s fault. It’s just a change the ONS [Office for National Statistics] in its great wisdom came out with.” Higgins wrote to warn the ONS of the likely results but it “ploughed on”. Instead of talking of a crisis in the railways, Higgins said, “people need to stop and identify that as a cause”. Higgins said too many people are “beating up on the railways”. At chaos-hit London Bridge station, for example, he said: “The grim reality is what we should say to people is, don’t use it. Stay away, make other plans. We’ve not been as blunt with the public as we should have been.” Otherwise, “it becomes complete chaos and everyone starts pointing fingers”. For all that, Higgins compared Britain’s attitude towards rebuilding its railways favourably to his native Australia and elsewhere. He added: “It’s really encouraging that this country has the courage to face up to these issues. I look at some of the infrastructure issues in America and think, good God.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/nov/13/fukushima-11bn-cleanup-will-take-another-40-years","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-13T13:03:38Z","webTitle":"Fukushima £11bn cleanup progresses, but there is no cause for optimism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/13/fukushima-11bn-cleanup-will-take-another-40-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/nov/13/fukushima-11bn-cleanup-will-take-another-40-years","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima £11bn cleanup progresses, but there is no cause for optimism","bodyText":"The man in charge of cleaning up the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has admitted there is little cause for optimism while thousands of workers continue their battle to contain huge quantities of radioactive water. The water problem is so severe that the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], and its myriad partner firms have enlisted almost all of their 6,000 workers in the 2tn yen (£11bn) mission to bring it under control, almost four years after a deadly tsunami sparked a triple meltdown at the plant. But Fukushima Daiichi’s manager, Akira Ono, said he believed workers had turned a corner in the long road towards decommissioning. “For three years we were dealing with the aftermath of the accident, so there was no way we could plan ahead. “Even though I have no intention of being optimistic, it’s possible to say that we can now start to look forward,” Ono told the Guardian. Each day about 400 tonnes of groundwater streams from hills behind the plant and into the basements of three stricken reactors, where it mixes with coolant water being used to prevent melted fuel from overheating and triggering another major accident. Most of the contaminated water is pumped out and stored in tanks, but large quantities find their way to other parts of the site, including maintenance trenches connected to the sea. So far, the plant has accumulated about 500,000 tonnes of contaminated water, which is being stored in more than 1,000 tanks occupying a large swath of the Fukushima Daiichi complex. By comparison, the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in the US in 1979 produced 9,000 tonnes of toxic water. “The contaminated water is the most pressing issue – there is no doubt about that,” Ono said. “Our efforts to address the problem are at their peak now. Though I cannot say exactly when, I hope things start getting better when the measures start taking effect.” Previous versions of Tepco’s Alps [advanced liquid processing system] water treatment unit were plagued by technical hitches. In addition, tanks used to store the contaminated water were poorly assembled and suffered serious leaks, while plans to freeze water that has gathered in a trench near the damaged reactors are eight months behind schedule. Work has begun on a 1.5km frozen barrier to prevent groundwater from reaching the reactor basements, but some experts, including Dale Klein, a former chairman of the US nuclear regulatory commission who now advises Tepco, have questioned its viability. Despite doubts about its effectiveness, Tepco officials say the wall should be finished by next March, and completely frozen by May. Along with the underground “ice wall”, the utility is pinning its hopes on a new version of its Alps water treatment system that can remove more than 60 radioactive elements. Recent “hot testing” of the apparatus has been successful, raising hopes that a solution to the water problem may not be far off, said Shinichi Kawamura, head of risk communication at Fukushima Daiichi. “This is a high-performance system because it uses only filters and absorbents to remove the contaminants,” Kawamura said. “The old system depended on chemical agents, which caused problems and created a lot more waste. We have confidence in this machinery.” As Japan moves closer to a return to nuclear power after the local authorities on the southwestern island of Kyushu this month gave their approval for reactor restarts, Tepco can claim a significant victory in its efforts to improve safety at Fukushima Daiichi. This month, workers completed the removal of the 1,331 spent fuel assemblies from a storage pool in reactor No 4, which was badly damaged in a hydrogen explosion after the March 2011 disaster. The removal of the unused fuel rods should be complete by the end of the year. Some experts had warned of a potential catastrophe had the fuel rods collided or been damaged during the operation; Japan’s former ambassador to Switzerland, Mitsuhei Murata, went as far as claiming that “the fate of Japan and the whole world” depended on the successful removal of spent fuel from reactor No 4. “This was a risky job, so when we removed the last fuel assembly we were delighted,” said Yuichi Kagami, who oversees fuel removal at the reactor. “This was a big step forward in the decommissioning process.” The most dangerous and difficult jobs lie ahead, however. Tepco has yet to begin removing melted fuel from reactors 1, 2 and 3, where radiation levels are too high for humans to enter. Tepco engineers admit they do not know exactly where the damaged fuel is located. Robots have been used to inspect debris inside reactor buildings, but none have been able to get anywhere near the melted fuel. The dangers posed by this unprecedented operation recently forced Tepco and the government to delay the planned start of fuel removal from reactor No 1 by five years, to 2025. Decommissioning the entire plant is expected to take at least 40 years. The operation, including compensation for tens of thousands of people forced to evacuate their homes, will cost around 10tn yen (£55bn)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/mar/30/nuclear-deal-iran-strategic-security-pro-western","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-30T15:42:31Z","webTitle":"At last a nuclear deal with Iran is in sight.

The chance must not be spurned","bodyText":"It’s hard to see why a nuclear deal with Iran will not be agreed this week. Each of the state representatives taking part in the final round of negotiations in Lausanne has powerful reasons for wanting a successful outcome, while the reputations of key individuals would be enhanced by an agreement. Such pragmatic considerations aside, a deal is positively desirable for strategic, security, and moral reasons. Given a string of past failures stretching back to 2002, when Iran’s covert nuclear programme was first publicly revealed, a continuing impasse after tomorrow night’s deadline may look a safer bet. Diplomats are warning that significant differences remain, particularly over the lifting of UN sanctions and Tehran’s wish to continue nuclear research and development. But the negotiators – from the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia, China and Iran – have been aware of these sticking points for months. It is reasonable to assume they already have compromise formulas up their sleeves, and may yet put them on the table. What is happening now, it appears, is last-minute manoeuvring for advantage. And the bar has been lowered. The aim now is for a “preliminary” deal, not the “comprehensive solution” that was originally sought. Iran wants a deal because sanctions – despite official denials – are hurting its economy and damaging crucial oil and gas export industries. Iranian businessmen and workers interviewed in Tehran last year were unanimous in their hope that relations will be normalised. Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, knows a deal would revive his so far lacklustre presidency and confound his conservative critics. Even Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appears temporarily to have set aside his life-long, visceral distrust of the Americans and British. He recently discouraged criticism of Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s chief negotiator. If Tehran does balk at the last moment, it will most likely be because Khamenei does not feel the timing and pace of sanctions relief are acceptable. He will certainly be consulted before Zarif signs anything. John Kerry, a serial under-achiever as US secretary of state, has a lot riding on these talks. A deal would be a rare personal success in a sea of diplomatic failures reaching from Syria and Palestine to Crimea. Likewise, Barack Obama could certainly use a foreign policy breakthrough. His recent Nowruz address, aimed at Iranians, made clear he is not simply looking to resolve the nuclear standoff. Obama, rightly, sees a chance for an historic rapprochement with Iran after 35 years of estrangement, which could radically change the strategic balance in the Middle East. Already established cooperation in fighting Islamic State terror in Iraq could mark the start of a productive new partnership, as was the case with the shah before the 1979 revolution. Britain and France view matters in much the same way. But by making a last-gasp fuss about disclosing Iran’s past nuclear projects, President François Hollande tried to assuage the fears of Arab allies (and Israel) by showing that France did its utmost to secure a safe deal. Britain is in the process of restoring diplomatic relations. Lucrative markets and business opportunities beckon in a rehabilitated Iran, where Britain, oddly enough, is still respected, and reviled, as a global power. Russia, which has provided valuable diplomatic cover to Tehran over the years, also has important commercial links in terms of nuclear power and arms sales. China simply wants cheap, unrestricted Iranian energy and raw materials. But Moscow and Beijing agree with the western powers that preventing a future nuclear arms race between Iran and the Arab regimes is highly desirable. All that said, bringing Iran in from the cold is a moral imperative too. The US-led ostracism of this proud, talented and historically pro-western nation has lasted far too long. It has been immensely damaging for Iranians, Europeans and the region. It has encouraged political and religious hardliners on all sides, at a time when productive, moderating, cooperative relationships with Muslim countries are badly needed. A deal could be done this week. It certainly should be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2014/dec/08/whats-the-mood-in-japan-ahead-of-the-election","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-08T11:43:35Z","webTitle":"What's the mood in Japan ahead of the election?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/08/whats-the-mood-in-japan-ahead-of-the-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/08/whats-the-mood-in-japan-ahead-of-the-election","fields":{"headline":"What's the mood in Japan ahead of the election?","bodyText":"Japan goes to the polls on Sunday, in a snap election called by the prime minister Shinzo Abe. His Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) are unlikely to lose the election, and instead the question is whether the LDP will increase its number of seats to help increase its mandate for the economic reforms introduced under Abe since 2012. A surprise fall into recession prompted the snap election. It is being framed - not least by the prime minister himself - as a referendum on “Abenomics”, the premier’s flagship economic policies of fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reform. “It’s an election that is asking voters whether to continue with Abenomics, or to put a stop to it,” he said. While it may be the economy, stupid, there are other issues bubbling under the surface, from Japan’s pacifist constitution to the future of the country’s nuclear power generation plants. Which is why we’re looking to you to help us build a picture of the country ahead of this surprise election. Where in Japan do you live, and what’s the mood there? Will you be voting in the election? What do you think are the main issues facing Japan, and do you feel optimistic about the country’s future?

The research, conducted by Cardiff University and the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Japan, showed a marked decrease, from 91% to 72%, in the proportion of people who accepted that the Earth's climate was changing. But nearly two-thirds of people agreed that extreme weather events have become more frequent in Britain in the past 10 years. Of those people, 74% attributed this increased frequency to climate change. Two years after the Fukushima accident in Japan, the study found that support for nuclear power in Britain had barely changed but had reached an all-time low in Japan. The proportion of British respondents who wanted to see nuclear power continued at current levels or increased rose marginally to 43% from 42% eight years ago, although fewer people said they wanted to see it phased out or shut down (50% in 2005, 47% in 2010 and 40% in 2013). The research found that fewer people than in 2005 were willing to accept the building of new nuclear power stations as part of efforts to tackle climate change. In comparison, renewable energy was far more popular than nuclear or coal. Solar power was backed by 77% of people, and wind power by 64%. Across all forms of electricity generation, nuclear (34%), coal (33%) and oil (34%) were the least favoured. Support for wind power had declined significantly since 2005 when very few windfarms had been constructed and 82% were in favour of them. In comparison with Britain, an overwhelming majority of the Japanese people questioned said they had completely lost trust in the safety and regulation of nuclear power after the accident. Some 76% of respondents wanted to see nuclear phased out gradually or immediately Just 17% of Japanese respondents said they were willing to accept the building of new nuclear power stations to tackle climate change, compared to 33% in 2007. \"British attitudes towards nuclear power have been surprisingly robust in the wake of the Fukushima accident, and trust in regulation has held up fairly well. However, in reality, nuclear power remains relatively unpopular as compared to renewable energy sources,\" said lead researcher Dr Wouter Poortinga of the Welsh school of architecture at Cardiff University. \"Our research shows that nuclear power has become very unpopular in Japan after the Fukushima accident. Public trust in the regulation of nuclear power is now at an all-time low. Instead most people would like to see the development of more solar and wind energy to replace nuclear power in the longer term,\" said Midori Aoyagi of the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan. \"The Fukushima accident appears to have had a profound impact on public confidence in future electricity generation in Japan. The Japanese public is now less likely to think that any specific energy source will contribute to energy security in the future.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/nov/07/iran-optimistic-nuclear-talks-geneva","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-07T08:17:47Z","webTitle":"Iran foreign minister optimistic as nuclear talks resume","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/07/iran-optimistic-nuclear-talks-geneva","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/nov/07/iran-optimistic-nuclear-talks-geneva","fields":{"headline":"Iran foreign minister optimistic as nuclear talks resume","bodyText":"Iranian negotiators are entering a new round of nuclear talks with major powers in Geneva, insisting they are optimistic that a deal is possible in the course of the two-day meeting. Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said the negotiators only needed to make \"a few more steps\" to reach agreement, but it would \"not be a disaster\" if a final accord had to be left to a subsequent round. Speaking to France 24 in Paris on his way to Thursday's talks, Zarif said: \"I believe it is possible to reach an agreement during this meeting, but I can only talk for our side, I cannot talk for the other side.\" \"I believe we've come very far in the last three rounds, so we [only] need to make a few more steps,\" said the foreign minister. \"We are prepared to make them in Geneva. But if we can't take them in Geneva, we'll take them in the next round.\" An unnamed senior US official, talking to journalists on the eve of talks, agreed that an interim deal was within reach. \"I do see the potential outlines of a first step,\" the official said. \"I do think it can be written on a piece of paper, probably more than one. I hope sooner rather than later. I would like to stop Iran's programme from advancing further.\" The official said the aim of a first deal would be to \"put some time on the clock\", freezing Iran's nuclear progress and buying time for negotiations on a more comprehensive and enduring agreement. Zarif will be meeting the EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, and senior diplomats from the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China. Ashton's spokesman, Michael Mann, said: \"The nuclear talks are complex and have entered a serious phase.\" \"The E3+3 [France, Germany and the United Kingdom, plus Russia, China and the United States] and Iran have agreed to keep the talks confidential in order to focus on the substance.\" At the previous round of talks three weeks ago – the first since the election of PresidentHassan Rouhani – all sides hailed what they described as a new, positive atmosphere. Sources involved in the October talks in Geneva have said that Iranians were pursuing a short-term deal, involving a trade-off between curbs on the level of its uranium enrichment and sanctions relief, at the same time as negotiating for reassurance that a long-term settlement would guarantee the country's right to carry out enrichment in principle and a complete lifting of sanctions, while Iran would agree to undergo stringent inspections. Iran would stop producing 20%, medium-enriched, uranium – the immediate proliferation concern as it can relatively easily be converted into weapons-grade material – but would not send its existing stockpile out of the country. That could be converted into reactor fuel, which is more difficult to enrich further. \"Clearly the Iranians want to make progress quickly. They want to see tangible results and compensation. This has been a clear theme. They are not prepared to give things away in return for nothing,\" said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \"There is a limit to the patience of the Iranian establishment and Rouhani needs to deliver. He needs to be seen as having achieved something for his own people in return for the concessions he might appear to be making at the bargaining table. And that is the real pressure on him and it has to be delivered soon.\" Negotiators at all sides in Geneva are concerned that the US Congress could sabotage hopes of a deal by approving new sanctions in the midst of talks, and the administration has appealed to senators, currently studying a sanctions bill, to show restraint while the negotiations are under way. Rouhani's negotiating team has meanwhile come under fire from hardliners in Iran, who have criticised the secrecy surrounding Iran's negotiating position. Iran's parliament, the Majlis, has held meetings with Zarif and other members of the country's nuclear negotiating team but details of the session have not been made public. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, threw his weight behind Rouhani's negotiating team on Sunday. \"No one should consider our negotiators as compromisers,\" he said before the anniversary of the 1979 US hostage crisis. \"They have a difficult mission and no one must weaken an official who is busy with work.\" Censorship Many Iranians are not getting a full account of the international controversy over the country's nuclear programme because of severe restrictions on press coverage of the issue, according to the press freedom advocacy group Reporters Without Borders. The group said: \"Ever since the revelations about Iran's nuclear activities at the start of the past decade, any coverage of this issue has been banned by the many government bodies responsible for monitoring and regulating the media. \"Journalists are constantly censored, not only by the ministry of culture and Islamic orientation and its censorship wing, the press authorisation and surveillance commission, but also by the ministry of intelligence, the Revolutionary Guards, the public prosecutor and the high council for national security. \"They are forbidden to cover all nuclear matters such as the signing of an International Atomic Energy Agency protocol, the negotiations about Iran's nuclear programme with the \"5+1\" group [China, France, Germany, Russia, United Kingdom and United States], representing the international community, and even nuclear energy's environmental impact and the cost of building nuclear power plants.\" In October 2003, the newspaper Entekhab was closed down due to the publication of an article revealing the extent of the internal feud among Iran's many political institutions over the question of whether Iran should sign the IAEA additional protocol. The newspaper's editor, Mohammad Mehdi Faghihi, and its political editor, Mohsen Mandegari, were subsequently summoned to the court, Reporters Without Borders said. Other Iranian media organisations have also been chastised for expressing views other than the official line about the country's nuclear programme, including the conservative news website Tabnak. \"Many journalists in different cities have been threatened or arrested on spying charges over the years for referring to nuclear energy issues,\" Reporters Without Borders said. \"This censorship of nuclear coverage violates journalists' freedom to inform and Iranians' right to be informed. \"Journalists have a fundamental role to play as regards informing the public on such sensitive matters, but the Iranian authorities try to suppress all independent coverage of nuclear issues so that only the official version is available.\" Earlier this week, Iran's Nobel peace prize laureate Shirin Ebadi launched an appeal, signed by about 100 Iranian activists and campaigners, calling for a national dialogue on nuclear energy. \"The issue of nuclear energy in Iran has always been left to the government of the day, both before and after the revolution, and for this reason is regarded as a political matter,\" a statement launching the appeal said. \"But it is not just a political issue. It also concerns the economy, society and the environment and therefore affects all Iranian citizens. It adds: \"Iranians do not have enough information about the advantages and disadvantages of nuclear energy for their country, although it is a subject of national concern that directly influences people's daily lives. It is why we are subjected to unprecedented sanctions and why our country has been threatened with war.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2013/dec/09/review-pandoras-promise-doesnt-live-up-to-the-hype","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-09T09:10:29Z","webTitle":"Pandora's Promise doesn't live up to the hype – review | Alice Bell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/dec/09/review-pandoras-promise-doesnt-live-up-to-the-hype","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2013/dec/09/review-pandoras-promise-doesnt-live-up-to-the-hype","fields":{"headline":"Pandora's Promise doesn't live up to the hype – review","bodyText":"As researchers at the University of Nottingham have noted, the film Gasland often comes up in media discussion about fracking. Move to YouTube, and there are many shorter films about the topic available (eg Frack Off’s “top films” page). But what’s especially interesting about the use of film in the fracking debate is that they are not just taken as a piece of media content, but as the basis for a social event from which more complex activism can grow. Put a film night on in a community centre, people who are interested turn up, and even if only a few of them stick around the pub afterwards, you can start to build a movement. You can get a sense of how widespread this approach is because it was mentioned in a risk consultancy’s report on the global anti-fracking movement last year. Those who’d rather control public debate on energy are concerned. And it’s not just anti-frack activists at work here, Gasland and Gasland 2 have been joined by the crowdfunded pro-fracking FrackNation. Enter nuclear. There is a long history of films that reference nuclear technology, from Godzilla and Broken Arrow to the China Syndrome and Silkwood. Hoping to buck the trend of negative images of eerie radiation and corrupt industry, and with an eye on the success of fracking films as an advocacy tool, Pandora’s Promise presents a pro-nuclear documentary. After premiering at Sundance in January, it has been on limited release in several countries over the summer and autumn, and will be available for download through iTunes from 10 December. Built around the narratives of people \"converted\" to nuclear power having previously been sceptical, it manages to hit several key anti-nuclear constituencies. We have environmentalists, old, young and British (Stewart Brand, Michael Shellenberger, Mark Lynas), a Democrat who is also expressly against nuclear weapons (Richard Rhodes) and a woman (Gwyneth Cravens). The result is ever so slightly like being inducted into a cult. I don’t sign up to Robert F Kennedy Jr’s view of the film as \"an elaborate hoax\" and I have sympathy with several of its arguments. But it left me feeling PR-ed. And I think that’s the last thing the nuclear debate needs. There are several strands to the film, many taking a smart spin on tropes used by anti-nuclear activists. We’re told radiation is natural and it’s the green way forward. We’re reminded of the great threat of climate change and of the poisonous impact of coal. We’re told nuclear is safe – compared not just with coal, but the toxicity of solar – and anyway, today waste can be used, framing nuclear a \"renewable\" too. With the use of archive footage, we’re also offered an image of nuclear as traditional, even as an all-American fuel, perhaps even a lost hope. We’re told it’s reformed; it’s not what you thought it was. An especially powerful twist on the association of nuclear power and war comes when Rhodes explains that half of US nuclear power (10% power overall) comes from re-purposed Russian warheads. Another nice passage comes near the start, as we follow Lynas during a trip to Fukushima where he reflects on how eerie and scary it can be, but remains resolutely pro-nuclear. The key problem I had, however, was how politically disempowering their message was, and how they used allusions to science to do this. Clips of news coverage of radiation are used to suggest – oh so sympathetically, but also rather patronisingly – that we normal people can’t possibly understand. We get references from Rhodes about talking to experts, and a few expert witnesses, but very little detail. Explanations are heavily abstracted and stylised. They feel comforting, but scratch the surface and you’re left with many questions. Moreover, as Damian Carrington’s review pointed out, there is a massive hole in its discussion of economics. It also misses a lot from the history of Atoms for Peace. The nuclear story is not just one of images of nature, science and technology, and they shouldn’t be used to obfuscate the politics and economics at play. Because energy policy needs to take it all seriously: science, politics, economics, engineering, culture and more. The film clearly paints anti-nuclear activists as irrationally emotional; carefully juxtaposed with Brand, Lynas et al as calm, silently brooding in deep, wise thought. There’s even a line from Cravens about women being hardwired to protect their families (apparently as opposed to thinking rationally). At one point it shows activists handing out and eating bananas accompanied by a voiceover explanation of how much naturally occurring radiation there is in the fruit anyway. It’s a neat trick, making the activists look stupid, but it’s science communication by way of laughing at others’ ignorance. I don’t like it. The convert narrative is powerful because it implies passage to a secondary level of awareness. Shellenberger reflects on talks about how, as a kid, he thought he knew that the people who believed in nuclear were dupes, but now realises how shallow this analysis was. We’re invited to laugh at such youthful hubris. Cravens explores how she learnt the oil industry had pushed solar power to disrupt the building of a nuclear power plant near where she lived. This, like a lot of the film, is worth discussing, but is rather selective. Because nuclear PR does still exist. Just as solar PR and wind PR and fracking PR and oil and anti-oil and more do too. I also felt the film seems to exhibit a rather depressing lack of faith in social change, especially when it came to global negations and energy efficiency. The concluding message seemed to be that we should give in to the particular idea of growth we currently work by; spread it, fuel it and accept it but don’t question or imagine anything new. The pro-nuclear lobby often presents itself as the hopeful, optimistic end of environmentalism, but with such a lack of belief in people, who exactly are the pessimists? I wanted to like Pandora’s Promise, but it didn’t live up to the hype. At best, it’s an invitation to think about nuclear in a new way. At worst, it’s a worryingly partial take on an important and complex issue. It seems to apply allusions to science and technology more as rhetoric than as an invite to deeper engagement. If people do download the film to run viewing parties with the aim of building a pro-nuclear movement, I hope they find ways to argue with and around it too. Because for all the goods and bads of nuclear, there are a lot of arguments to be had. • Alice Bell is a research fellow at the Science Policy Research Unit, University of Sussex."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/political-science/2015/jun/24/jurassic-world-frankenstein-for-the-21st-century","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-24T10:19:59Z","webTitle":"Jurassic World: Frankenstein for the 21st Century?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/political-science/2015/jun/24/jurassic-world-frankenstein-for-the-21st-century","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/political-science/2015/jun/24/jurassic-world-frankenstein-for-the-21st-century","fields":{"headline":"Jurassic World: Frankenstein for the 21st Century?","bodyText":"Frankenstein is almost 200 years old. It remains the default parable of irresponsible innovation even though it was written in the 1810s, when experiments with electricity and surgery were capturing the imaginations of Mary Shelley, Lord Byron and co. In the early 21st century, hopes and fears swirl around synthetic biology, geoengineering and de-extinction. While scientists stake their claims on various imagined futures, we watch Jurassic World. In 2012, the philosopher and sociologist Bruno Latour, writing for the Breakthrough Institute, explored the Frankenstein story. Why, he wondered, do we persist in confusing the monster with its creator? Langdon Winner had argued in 1978 that the problem was Hollywood. The many films of Frankenstein switched the villain from the scientist to the monster, stripping the human protagonists of their agency and reinforcing the message that monsters are bad and red lines must not be crossed. Latour argues that monsters are normal (in any case, as the scientist Henry Wu says in Jurassic World, ‘monster is a relative term’). The challenge is to find ways to love our monsters. Responsible innovation is about taking care of science and technology, not cordoning it off from society. I think Jurassic World offers three important lessons about responsible innovation. The first is about social learning. Jurassic World is one big déjà vu. We wonder why the lessons of the first theme park, whose relics are hidden in the jungle around the giant new resort, have been ignored. We are told that it is different this time. The science has moved on. Gene-splicing technology has become more precise and the behaviour of the animals is understood well enough to allow trainers to hang out in the velociraptor pit. Whenever a new technology comes along, the public are told that lessons from past examples have been learnt and that any new questions of bioethics, nanoethics, neuroethics etc are being taken seriously. This seems reassuring, but it creates a form of institutional blindness. The technical particulars of the science are rarely the most important thing. Public concerns about science and technology tend to relate to its politics. (It’s worth noting that, in Frankenstein, Shelley says very little about the Dr Frankenstein’s experiments during the story – the scientific context is discussed in the book’s preface). The second lesson is about containment. Technologies are never as predictable as we pretend they are. Nuclear power stations, genetically modified crops and self-driving cars are not just things. They are so tangled up in social relationships that they are a form of social experiment. We don’t need Jeff Goldblum’s chaos theorist to tell us that dangerous technology cannot be perfectly contained. In Jurassic World, the security has been upped considerably. We have concrete dinosaur prisons and a private army. The dinosaurs all have tracking devices, enabling a computerised panopticon in the control room. But, as Charles Perrow describes in his seminal book on the Three Mile Island reactor, accidents will happen and the attempt to prevent them through technological means may paradoxically make them more likely. Jurassic World is isolated. It is in effect an island laboratory. Even if the 20,000 guests of the resort are unwitting participants in the experiment, we are reassured that the experiment has limits (notwithstanding the odd pterodactyl and the T-Rex that rampages around California in the second film). Much innovation cannot so easily be contained, nor does it want to be. In some areas, such as geoengineering, human germline modification and gene drives, a lack of containment is precisely the point. Geoengineering only counts if it takes place at a planetary scale. And gene drives are designed to redraw the DNA of whole populations (of, for example, mosquitos) as they breed uncontrollably. The original Jurassic Park film was made before ‘de-extinction’ had entered our vocabulary. Enthusiasts for real de-extinction are now excited not just by the prospect of seeing a mammoth in a zoo, but also by the idea of recreating ancient ecosystems. Science will work to understand and contain risks, but we should not kid ourselves. Uncertainties will always remain. The final lesson is about the politics of science. It is easy to forget that the key to Jurassic Park’s downfall was old-fashioned personal greed. The dreams of a philanthropreneur, imagined as naïve but pure, were undone by an employee’s plan to steal genetic secrets. In Jurassic World, another billionaire with no wish other than to create joy has unwittingly employed a man who wants to weaponise velociraptors. The lesson for responsible innovation is that we should not ignore the connections between science, profit and power. But we should also question what science is for. Adam Smith (also at the Circling the Square conference) argues in Research Fortnight today that Jurassic World reflects society’s concerns about corporatisation. But neither the film nor scientific institutions are willing to take political questions to the heart of science itself. Smith argues that films provide something approaching a complete picture of public concerns about technology, making public dialogue redundant. As a supporter of public dialogue (full disclosure – I’m a member of the Government’s Sciencewise panel), I would say that dialogue involves more than extracting public opinion. It also invites scientists to consider afresh their responsibilities. In Jurassic World, Wu offers a scoundrel’s get-out: ‘If I don’t innovate, someone else will’. Thankfully, science doesn’t work that way. Scientists and society both have choices about the futures they create. Coda: The film has already made a billion dollars at the box office, bringing to mind a book by techno-optimist Chris Anderson. Watching the infancy of Web 2.0, Anderson reasoned that our ability, through Web technologies, to search through a ‘Long Tail’ of possibilities would lead to the imminent ‘death of the blockbuster’. Jurassic World and the rest would seem that the blockbuster was alive and well, not least because people don’t behave as technologists would like them to. Like velociraptors, we like hunting in packs. Perhaps this is another cautionary tale of the dangers of technological determinism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/dec/14/edf-3bn-windfall-existing-power-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-14T16:15:06Z","webTitle":"EDF stands to rake in £3.3bn windfall from existing power plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/14/edf-3bn-windfall-existing-power-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/dec/14/edf-3bn-windfall-existing-power-plants","fields":{"headline":"EDF stands to rake in £3.3bn windfall from existing power plants","bodyText":"EDF, one of the UK’s big six energy suppliers, could be in line for a £1bn windfall each year for three years from its existing coal and nuclear power stations under a controversial government-designed auction which starts on Tuesday. The scheme has come under considerable criticism because the costs of the new subsidies will be met by consumers paying higher electricity bills, with an estimated extra charge of £14 a year. It has also been attacked by one of the industry’s most respected figures, while UK ministers face a legal challenge in the European courts. EDF, which is largely owned by the French state, has prequalified eight nuclear and two coal plants for the “capacity market” under which payments will be made to companies to guarantee their help in keeping the UK’s lights on. A fifth of any windfall profit on the nuclear fleet would go to Centrica which holds a stake in this part of the EDF business. Rivals SSE and E.ON are also in line for potential subsidies for their coal plants. Tom Greatrex MP, the shadow energy minister, said: “Any policy which adds to energy bills needs to be subjected to the highest levels of scrutiny – consumers must know that they are getting value for money. “The capacity market will levy a £14 charge on the bill of every consumer – every pound spent must deliver enhanced security of supply. Whilst the broad framework of the policy is right, [there are] flaws in the detail of its implementation [which] risk leaving consumers short-changed.” Originally the scheme was expected to be used to encourage the building of new gas-fired plants only but was expanded to include existing coal and nuclear power stations, putting EDF in line for the windfall payments. The price to be paid to the generators will only be known once the auction finishes next week but a maximum – set at £75 per kW hour by government – could secure EDF £3.3bn. The windfall relates to its existing coal plants at Cottam and West Burton in Nottinghamshire, and nuclear plants such as Dungeness B in Kent. the company could earn more if its gas-fired stations also win contracts. Ministers are also offering firm contracts from 2018 of up to 15 years for anyone offering to build new gas power plants but three years for some existing plants such as the EDF stations and only one-year deals for those offering demand reduction under an auction run by the National Grid. Jenny Banks, energy and climate specialist at WWF UK, the environment charity which provided the estimates, said: “When the government has been pushing for stronger climate action at the global talks in Lima, our big energy companies are preparing to bid for billions of bill payers’ money which will be handed to some of the UK’s dirtiest, most polluting power stations. “Instead of propping up dirty and inefficient coal power stations, the government should be focusing on incentives to reduce energy demand and supporting the growth of modern technologies like ‘demand response’ which are far cleaner and could save millions on consumer bills.” Demand response involves the changes in customer electric usage from their normal consumption patterns as a result of price changes. A previous estimate by independent consultant Cornwall Energy predicted that EDF could earn windfall profits of £800m in total over five years from 2018, although that was based just on its nuclear and not coal plants. Both the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) nor EDF declined to comment on the basis that it was impossible to speculate on what the final price of the auction would be and whether all or none of the coal or nuclear plants would win out. However, industry sources pointed out that £400m a year was currently being invested in the nuclear fleet to keep it running. Meanwhile, Volker Beckers, the former chief executive of RWE npower and an ongoing adviser to HMRC, predicted this particular subsidy system paid through customer bills would fail. “I think the capacity market is not necessary if the ministers’ main objective is to attract new investment. I don’t think it will,” he added. Beckers, who has also just been made chairman of Reactive Technologies, a company which offers customers ways of reducing energy use, says demand reduction can be a better way of handling an energy crunch: “Demand side management is much cheaper than building new CCGI [Combine Cycle Gas Turbine plants] or even more expensive ones like nuclear.” Reactive Industries says it supports the legal challenge being mounted by Tempus Energy, which is taking the UK government to the European general court alleging that the new capacity market system violates state aid rules. Tempus claims that the DECC is unnecessarily locking in customers to a possible total of £2.5bn worth of annual costs by prioritising payments to power stations rather than demand reduction schemes. A first auction under the capacity market will start on Tuesday 16 December and could run until Friday with 15-year contracts on offer for power station operators but only one-year deals for those offering demand reduction. Proponents of demand-reduction schemes are particularly critical that the longer-term contracts would encourage the building of new capacity. “The Capacity Market was originally set up to keep the lights on at the lowest possible cost; a format that has been used very successfully in the US. But an engrained, institutional bias in favour of building new assets to boost supply means that cost-effective ‘no build’ technologies for managing demand have been ignored,” said Sara Bell, chief executive of Tempus. “This will push up electricity bills needlessly and commit consumers to paying for capacity that we would not need if we invested in building demand-flexibility, for those who want to use it,” she said. A DECC spokesperson said the government had full confidence in the auction. “The European commission has concluded that the capacity market is within European state aid rules. This challenge will have no impact on the running of the capacity auction.” • This article was amended on 15 December. £75 per MW hour should have been £75 per kW hour"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2013/nov/26/happy-5th-birthday-climate-change-act-dont-forget-the-4th-budget","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-26T14:52:22Z","webTitle":"Happy 5th Birthday Climate Change Act: Don’t forget the 4th Budget | Catherine Mitchell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/nov/26/happy-5th-birthday-climate-change-act-dont-forget-the-4th-budget","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2013/nov/26/happy-5th-birthday-climate-change-act-dont-forget-the-4th-budget","fields":{"headline":"Happy 5th Birthday Climate Change Act: Don’t forget the 4th budget","bodyText":"Happy 5th Birthday Climate Change Act. It would be great to say ‘I hope the next five years see you leading a stronger commitment to climate change mitigation’. But that, unfortunately, is not the situation we find ourselves in. Britain is in a political maelstrom when it comes to the future of climate change mitigation and energy policy, and how to pay for it. At the moment, it would feel like a victory to have the 4th carbon budget – a stepping stone to cutting our emissions and maintaining ourselves on a pathway to an average 2 degree rise in global temperature - agreed relatively easily, and for the Act to continue in force if the Conservatives win the next general election. Both are questionable, although one hopes that both occur. The Climate Change Act is quite clear that the government cannot just change the 4th budget on a whim. There has to be a significant change in circumstances. The Committee on Climate Change – the independent body which advises UK governments on tackling and preparing for climate change, established as part of the Act – has published part 1 of the 4th carbon budget review. There has been no significant change in the climate science, international and EU circumstances on which the fourth carbon budget (2023 – 2027) was set in 2011, so there is no legal or economic basis to change the budget. Furthermore, to not accept the 4th budget would damage investor confidence and the UK’s position in international negotiations. The CCC have made sure that the 4th budget embodies a set of measures that make economic sense, in many ways making it easier for the Government to say that they accept the 4th budget. So why is the 4th budget under threat? Why is the Government beginning to question the CCC; their advisor on climate policy? The CCA came into being as a result of a number of factors (pdf), not least that climate change had to be taken seriously and institutionalised if the Government was to be able to put in place a framework to support nuclear power. The 2008 situation is very different. The recession and austerity has hit. A continuing campaign against renewable energy technologies, combined with increasing concerns of rising energy prices has led to a battering of green issues. The Government, and EDF, now has a risk free policy in place for nuclear policy, so feels no continuing need to voice fears of climate change. Add in the Conservative Party trying to retain voters who might otherwise move to UKIP, and there is very little vocal and political support for environmental concerns. The importance of green and environmental issues is not high on society’s agenda – as shown by MORIs review of issues – and does not therefore exert much pressure on Government to do anything. Wider society, NGOs or even the IPCC seem unable to turn climate change into a big issue. Labour may have divided political parties by demanding a freeze in energy prices, but this does not equate to climate policies in the eyes of voters. All this comes together as a strong pressure to minimise costs of climate change mitigation, and that means that there is minimal pressure to meet the 4th budget, and if it has to be met then it has to be met at minimal cost. A secondary worry for the CCA is the requirement for the Government to make sure that they don’t implement a policy by default which has the unintended consequence of greater carbon dioxide emissions. This requires the Government to remove biases in the current Energy Bill which support higher coal use. A recent study has shown that the complex outcome of the Emission Performance Standards and the Industrial Emissions Directive provide incentives for around 15-20GW of existing coal plants to opt-in to an agreement to upgrade their coal plants in exchange for operating for another decade or so. The report shows that this would not only be bad for the environment and potentially undermine energy security but it would also be very costly to customers. The confluence of low coal prices and high gas prices and the unintended consequences of regulations aimed to reduce coal use has led to higher coal use in the recent past. However, unless these changes to the Energy Bill are made, Britain could well see customers paying hundreds of millions of pounds to enable continuing electricity generation from coal plants, despite it being against the broad energy policy intent since the late 1980’s. This cost would be in addition to the very high costs of nuclear power already widely talked about. Now is the time for Government to hold firm to a progressive climate change policy and support the 4th carbon budget. This is not just because it fits with the needs of the science set out in IPCC AR5 WG1, but because it would also fit with the technological and operational momentum of the global energy system. To not sign up to the 4th budget would reduce British attempts at climate change mitigation via renewable energy and energy efficiency measures and this would undermine Britain’s nascent sustainable energy industry. The last thing that is wanted is for the Government to push Britain into a worse economic and climate position than it currently is.

The Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) were found to have low white and red blood cell levels and low haemoglobin, which the researchers say could make them more prone to infectious diseases. But critics of the study say the link between the abnormal blood tests and the radiation exposure of the monkeys remains unproven and that the radiation doses may have been too small to cause the effect. The scientists compared 61 monkeys living 70km (44 miles) from the the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant with 31 monkeys from the Shimokita Penisula, over 400km (249 miles) from Fukushima. The Fukushima monkeys had low blood counts and radioactive caesium in their bodies, related to caesium levels in the soils where they lived. No caesium was detected in the Shimokita troop. Professor Shin-ichi Hayama, at the Nippon Veterinary and Life Science University in Tokyo, told the Guardian that during Japan’s snowy winters the monkeys feed on tree buds and bark, where caesium has been shown to accumulate at high concentrations. “This first data from non-human primates — the closest taxonomic relatives of humans — should make a notable contribution to future research on the health effects of radiation exposure in humans,” he said. The work, which ruled out disease or malnutrition as a cause of the low blood counts, is published in the peer-reviewed journal Scientific Reports. White blood cell counts were lowest for immature monkeys with the highest caesium concentrations, suggesting younger monkeys may be more vulnerable to radioactive contamination. Hayama noted: “Abnormalities such as a decreased blood cell count in people living in contaminated areas have been reported from Chernobyl as a long-term effect of low-dose radiation exposure.” But other blood measures did not correlate with caesium levels, which vary with the seasons. Prof Geraldine Thomas, at Imperial College London, said the Chernobyl studies were not “not regarded as scientifically validated” and that the correlations between the caesium and low blood counts in the Fukushima study were not statistically strong. “Unfortunately this is yet another paper with insufficient power to distinguish real effects and relevance to human health,” she said. “We know that one of the most damaging health effects comes from fear of radiation, not radiation itself.” She also noted that people, unlike the monkeys, could avoid eating contaminated food from the Fukushima region. Another critic, Prof Jim Smith, at the University of Portsmouth, said: “I am highly sceptical of the claim. The levels of radiocaesium in the Fukushima monkeys are about the same as those found in sheep in some parts of the UK following the Chernobyl accident, i.e. extremely low in terms of damage to the animals themselves. I think it much more likely that the apparently low blood cell counts are caused by something other than radiation.” Prof Hayama said that caesium levels were used as an indicator of the radiation exposure of the monkeys. “The low haematological values in the Fukushima monkeys could have therefore been due to the effect of any radioactive materials,” he said. “We did not conclude the low-blood cell counts are caused by caesium but so far we cannot find other reasons except radiation.” Engineers at Fukushima are currently working to contain thousands of tonnes of irradiated water groundwater by next March by surrounding the four damaged reactors by an underground frozen wall. Other research published on Wednesday showed children, teenagers and young adults living near two UK nuclear power stations since the 1990s are not at an increased risk of developing cancer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/feb/09/eu-energy-consumption-level-falls-to-20-year-low","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-09T17:28:08Z","webTitle":"EU energy consumption level falls to 20-year low","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/09/eu-energy-consumption-level-falls-to-20-year-low","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/feb/09/eu-energy-consumption-level-falls-to-20-year-low","fields":{"headline":"EU energy consumption level falls to 20-year low","bodyText":"Energy consumption in the European Union has fallen to levels last seen more than two decades ago, statistics published on Monday showed. The dramatic drop in annual consumption – in 2013, the year to which the new research applies, it was down by more than 9% from its 2006 peak – reflects in part the continuing economic troubles in the eurozone, but also efforts taken by member states and businesses to cut energy use and improve efficiency. Despite the plunge, Europe remains heavily dependent on fuel imports, with more than half of energy needs supplied by production from abroad, including the Middle East and Norway. Under oil prices at the time, that amounted to a cost of more than €400bn (£297bn) in imports in the year in question, but that figure is now volatile owing to the effects of a sharply lower oil price and the exchange rate of the Euro. The UK was one of the least dependent on imports of the biggest member states, buoyed by its offshore fossil fuel supplies, with 46.4% of primary energy coming from overseas. That relative independence is likely to be eroded further in future years, however, as the North Sea supplies of oil and gas are dwindling fast. France, where nuclear reactors supply the vast majority of electricity needs, was also less dependent than the average, at 48% of supplies imported. By contrast, about 63% of Germany’s energy came from outside, and 77% of Italy’s. Nuclear power accounted for the biggest slice of the EU’s own generation of electricity, with 29% of production. Just behind came renewable sources of energy, which in total generated just under a quarter of homegrown power. The total energy used across the bloc in 2013 was 1,666 million tonnes of oil equivalent, a widely used measure. That was just below 1990’s total of 1,667 Mtoe. The UK used just over 200 Mtoe in 2013, a substantial drop on its 210 Mtoe in 1990, after a rise in the early part of this century to 230 Mtoe. The government has sought to encourage energy efficiency by home insulation schemes and levying a price on carbon for businesses. Some of the EU’s decline in consumption has come from progress made in energy efficiency among newer member states in eastern Europe, which inherited notoriously inefficient infrastructure from their years as part of the energy-rich Soviet bloc. Bulgaria, for instance, used nearly 28 Mtoe in 1990, but only 17 Mtoe in 2013. Lithuania’s use dropped from 16 Mtoe to 7 Mtoe over the same period. Such one-off drops are unlikely to be repeated. The European commission is working on proposals for new legislation to force member states to make their buildings more energy efficient, a leaked document revealed on Friday. Those plans are likely to be brought forward in October, but will take years to come into force, and are geared towards helping meet the EU’s energy efficiency target for 2030. A boost to energy efficiency will also help the EU to meet its international pledge of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 40%, compared with 1990 levels, by 2030. That target is likely to be enshrined in a new global agreement on climate change, scheduled to be signed in Paris in December."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/nov/25/george-osbornes-spending-review-our-writers-verdict","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-25T14:43:50Z","webTitle":"George Osborne's spending review – our writers' verdict | The panel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/25/george-osbornes-spending-review-our-writers-verdict","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/25/george-osbornes-spending-review-our-writers-verdict","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne's spending review – our writers' verdict","bodyText":"Aditya Chakrabortty: Osborne pushes on with his Lesser Awfulism Since 2010, an implicit budget-time deal appears to have been made between George Osborne and the media. I call it the Lesser Awfulism. Beforehand, he promises to do really awful things and the press obediently trail just what these things are and how awful they will be. Then on the day he does something slightly less awful than promised – and the press hail him as a genius. On this afternoon, we’re well into the second stage of this two-step. Today, Osborne has declared that the cuts to tax credits that he deemed absolutely essential just six months ago are no longer essential. A screeching U-turn, you might say, forced on him by an unlikely coalition comprising The Sun, the Lords, the SNP and Jeremy Corbyn’s troops. Already it’s being hailed as proof of his political savvy and towering strength. So much Less Awful! Here’s what actually happened: Osborne was set to save a quick £4.4bn from his tax credit cuts. He’s now waived that immediate saving – and has broken his own self-imposed cap on welfare payments. But he’ll still make £12bn of cuts to social security before this parliament is out. He’ll still hurt the dental nurses, bank clerks and others, but later when tax credits are replaced by a lower universal credit. Not so much Lesser Awful as Later Awful. Lesser Awfulism was the hallmark of today’s announcements. Osborne will still make deep cuts to public spending, but they won’t be as deep – because he is spending something like £27bn given to him by Robert Chote and the Office for Budget Responsibility, who have drastically improved their forecasts for public finances. So the key plank of today’s announcements is improved forecasts from a body that is habitually, reliably wrong on its debt and deficit forecasts. My data colleagues show that here. I can’t wait to see how that one pans out, especially as China slows down, and the world economy goes into what the IMF calls “the new mediocre”. Even with these funny-money forecasts, there’ll still be victims. I wouldn’t like to be a social housing tenant on benefits over the next few years. Nor would I like to live in a poor inner city area, where the council will lose its government grant and be expected to top it up with higher business rates (which prompts the question: where in Liverpool, say, are the prosperous local businesses to pay these higher rates?). But still: isn’t it all so much Less Awful than it looked yesterday? For today at least. Polly Toynbee: Osborne the ‘magician’ still hits the poor hardest Clever? Of course. First of all, brief cuts to political danger zones, such as the police, then whisk them away, just like that. Next, scatter the nation with unexpected good news – no cuts to the arts and sport, no museum charges, the NHS to stay afloat at least for next year. Such largesse! A day ago Osborne was the mad axeman, today he’s the tooth fairy. How did the magician do that? But hold on to the big numbers: his direction is unchanged. The British state will still be cut to its lowest level ever, forever. Margaret Thatcher’s state stood at 46%, but Cameron and Osborne are plunging it down to 36% of GDP. Germany, France and social democratic Europe will soon feel quite foreign to our own American-sized society. So how did Osborne achieve these giveaways? Prestidigitation with the OBR’s useful over-optimism on growth and tax receipts – and by back-loading cuts previously front-loaded. His newly emollient tone moves him nearer the leadership than yesterday: once he’s in No 10, reaching impossible targets by 2020 will be some other chancellor’s nightmare. On essentials he has not wavered: the poorest will still be hardest hit by his £12bn welfare cut, so his tax credit U-turn only delays the pain. Low-earners are his frogs set to boil more slowly, as they shift on to universal credit and take the hit by degrees, while a million of the disabled lose their employment support allowance. Unalloyed good was his 3% stamp duty disincentive to buy-to-let investors. But make no mistake, Osborne rings the death knell of social housing as the great housing association sell-off begins. His “affordable” homes for sale are beyond the reach of all but those above median earnings, the rest of the families consigned to private landlord short-term rentals forever. Don’t expect today’s good news gloss to withstand five years ahead of real-life state-shrinkage. Matthew d’Ancona: A clear pitch for the centre ground “The other side talks of social justice – this side delivers it.” For sheer brazen cheek, George Osborne’s performance could not be faulted. Even as his foes caricature him as a slasher of the state, he seeks – unashamedly – to colonise the political centre-ground and to claim the support of working people. There was relatively little pre-briefing of this, the chancellor’s third spending review, and with good reason. The billowing plumes of speculation that preceded the statement were essential to its dramatic effect. Would he find a way of easing the transition for those afflicted by tax credit cuts? No: he ditched the cuts altogether and raided the piggy bank of improved public finances. How would he handle the inevitable cuts to police budgets? By not cutting them (Andy Burnham’s face at that moment was a study in Labour’s fury and collective paralysis). Let nobody be fooled. There was plenty of spiky austerity in the mix, and it will hurt. The goodies – housing, a boost for the NHS which Osborne claimed was the biggest in its history, spending on infrastructure, sweeteners for science and the arts – should not distract attention from the departmental cuts that are driven by his implacable fiscal conservatism. He wants the state to do fewer things, better. So watch as this chancellor transfers responsibilities from government to other agencies: it is employers that will pay the national living wage and the £3bn apprenticeship levy, just as students already pay for their teaching on tick. We are all in this together – and that cuts both ways. But today’s statement will be remembered for the great tax credit U-turn, which kept alive the guttering flame of the strategy unveiled at the Tory conference in Manchester. However preposterous you think it is, the Conservative claim to be the party of the mainstream and the workers is alive and well. As it all sunk in, Labour MPs looked glum – and who can blame them? Tom Clark: However good the sloganeering, reality will still bite You might have thought George Osborne would have learned the perils of being too clever by half. In the summer, after all, he was briefly hailed for “giving Britain a pay rise” while hacking unloved tax credits. Soon enough, however, it became clear this new deal of high pay and low welfare was not all it seemed: millions of the low-paid grafters he claimed to champion were going to lose out. Today – after pressure from across the spectrum, and defeat in the House of Lords – he has had to U-turn on the tax credit part of his plan. But even while executing his 180-degree body swerve, he continued to spin. He maintained both that this once-unavoidable change was no longer needed at all, owing to his superlative handling of the wider public finances, and – at the same time – that the cut was eventually happening anyway, as universal credit replaces tax credits. Even if universal credit is eventually got up and running, that is only partially true. He then bragged about his “welfare cap”, even as his tax credit reversal saw him breach it. More generally, Osborne spoke in slogans that sounded good – and greatly cheered the benches behind him – but which could yet unravel. The police who “protect us all” were being protected themselves. The NHS would get more money – and soon. Public capital investment, especially in housing, was in for a £12bn boom. Even the traditional Cinderella service of social care was being maintained. The casual listener could have been forgiven for thinking that the great axeman had decided not to chop anything at all. The big picture however did not change that much. A few tax rises, for example on second homes, have eased the arithmetic slightly. But some departments are going to face reductions of the order of a quarter, and that is on top of the quarter or so that they have already absorbed. Osborne never makes it easy to see the consequences on the day, but – in town halls, in prisons and in green energy – those consequences won’t be concealed forever. And when they emerge into the daylight, the chancellor could, once again, be left looking like a salesman who can’t resist overdoing the patter. Anne Perkins: The Osboconomy is full of holes There’s an old saying about putting your shirt on the farm. Today, George Osborne put his shirt on expanding the British economy. He abandoned most of the July budget squeeze – or subtly back-loaded it. That might justify, the experts reckon (with eyebrows raised), his forecast of growth at around 2.5% a year for the whole of the rest of the parliament. If the growth forecasts really are right, then he might even pull off his pledge to balance the budget and slash the debt by 2020. But he hasn’t abandoned that £12bn cut in welfare spending by the end of the parliament, and he hasn’t abandoned his ambition to shrink the state. It will just be a slower tightening of the vice on public spending, bearing down harder and harder on the people that he reckons most voters don’t see: people who are long-term out of work, disabled, or old and vulnerable. These are the non-people of the Osboconomy. There was one part of his autumn statement that gives the lie to the slick new world that he conjures up, and reveals its short-termism and fundamental immorality: unless you count new nuclear power there was nothing, nothing at all, that was positive on greening the economy. So there was nothing more for investment in developing carbon capture and storage, without which Britain will be unable to meet its targets for cutting carbon emissions now that shale gas from fracking is being built into the energy provision landscape. New starter homes will have energy efficiency targets relaxed, new roads will be built, the levy disincentivising diesel is being delayed, and energy-intensive industries like steel are to be tax-exempt. Less than a week before the UN climate change talks begin in Paris, this is no way to green the economy. But it might just make Osborne prime minister."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/commentisfree/2015/jun/02/real-northern-powerhouses-brass-bands-moved-me-to-tears-whit-friday","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-02T19:00:00Z","webTitle":"The real northern powerhouses: the brass bands that moved me to tears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/commentisfree/2015/jun/02/real-northern-powerhouses-brass-bands-moved-me-to-tears-whit-friday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/commentisfree/2015/jun/02/real-northern-powerhouses-brass-bands-moved-me-to-tears-whit-friday","fields":{"headline":"The real northern powerhouses: the brass bands that moved me to tears","bodyText":"When I was the Guardian’s Berlin correspondent back in 2011, I had a private rule: I was going to write about the Nazis no more than once a fortnight. Early on, I made the mistake of telling this to a reporter from the Berliner Zeitung. She outed me in an article under the headline: “Zwei Wochen Ohne Hitler”. In two and a half years as the Guardian’s northern editor, I have also made a conscious effort not to write too much about certain things. Pies, flat caps, mills, whippets – even though Alex and Pam round the corner just got one called Gilbert and he’s a darling. Until last week I probably would have filed brass bands in the same drawer of last resort. Then I went to Whit Friday in Saddleworth and realised that a stirring euphonium solo is as relevant to my patch as George Osborne’s northern powerhouse will ever be. As a coastal Lancastrian, I had not heard of Whit Friday. We don’t really do brass bands in Morecambe. No pits – just two hulking nuclear power stations. Subtitled “the greatest free show on Earth”, Whit Friday is like South By SouthWest for brass bands, only spread out over 11 villages on the Lancashire/Yorkshire border, rather than the dive bars of Austin, Texas. As with SXSW, you can’t hope to see all of the bands on the bill, just as you’ll struggle to visit every venue. Most of the ensembles don’t even make it to each village, which are sufficiently spread out that coaches are needed to ferry the groups up hill and down dale – a low-geared bicycle, incidentally, is the best way to get around Whit Friday (admittedly difficult when carrying a tuba). Going since 1884, Whit Friday this year attracted 126 bands from all around the UK, as well as a few from afar. Each must dash from contest to contest, performing one crowd-pleaser as they march through each village and then one brass classic for the judges. Each performance is scored “blind” by an adjudicator, hidden in some adjacent darkened room or caravan. It’s a Pennine version of The Voice, but without the annoying bit where will.i.am turns round and uses lots of non sequiturs to explain why that massacre of Vanessa Carlton’s Thousand Miles wasn’t quite for him. In the contest we attended in Delph, the mysterious judge was sequestered inside the Methodist hall, opposite the working men’s club. From 4.30pm until well after dark, he judged 77 bands from an open window on the first floor, each introduced to him with just a number rather than a name. For the audience’s benefit, before each performance a solemn chap in a hi-vis jacket paraded around with a white board on a stick on which was written the band’s name, their division in the league, and the march they were to play. “Brass Band Frutigen – Salute to Berne. 3rd” and so forth. Occupying plastic seats on the front row were the unofficial citizens’ jury, who, fortified with Tupperware picnics and flasks of tea, dutifully scored each band by their own individual criteria. After about 10 bands and several pints of local ale, my friend Elizabeth and I felt confident we could tell the wheat from the chaff. Growing up in nearby Milnrow, Elizabeth had the edge on this seaside incomer, whispering that the Brighouse and Rastrick band were said to be one of the best, when they struck up a fabulously regal version of The Wizard. Her grandad, however, always preferred the “Faireys”, she said. Grandad, too ill in hospital to attend this year, was proved right when the Fairey Band from Stockport eventually won the overall first place, shoving Brighouse into second. But Whit Friday is not just a chance for the big guns to fire out their hits; it’s an opportunity for anyone who can get enough players together. We enjoyed the Chav Band (don’t tell Owen Jones), resplendent in tracksuits and baseball hats, who made me punch the air with their rendition of Bryan Adam’s 1984 classic Heaven. They also do a corking version of 2 Unlimited’s No Limit. One band, whose lederhosen-wearing euphonium player had filled his pockets with cans of beer, had brought with them their own Bez-style dancer, a very drunk Jesus carrying a sign saying “He’s not the Messiah … he’s a very naughty boy”. A shout-out too for the equally well lubricated Zoobander, comprising a load of mullered students from Warwick wearing animal-themed onesies, who chose The Animals Went in Two by Two (hurrah hurrah) as their rabble-raiser. Both of us spent half the evening on the verge of tears. There’s something about a searing cornet solo in B flat that causes my chest to heave. For Elizabeth it was the teenage lad banging his bass drum with enormous pride as he provided the rhythm for his youth band’s take on Uptown Funk while strutting down Delph’s main thoroughfare. I had wondered if Whit Friday would feel like an anachronism, preserved for the sake of tradition rather than any relevance to 21st-century life, like the “coconutters” of nearby Bacup, who blacken their faces for their annual morris dancing parade. But it was my favourite night of the year, a demonstration of civic pride and community spirit as much as musical talent. I have spent the last few days welling up at my desk watching YouTube clips – the Brighouse band collaborating with the north-east folk band the Unthanks is a particular favourite, along with the Whit Friday sequence in Brassed Off. Next year, I want in.

All he was saying was that the internet, which in 1999 was still regarded by much of the world as exotic, would one day be regarded as a utility, like mains electricity. Grove was right. What he omitted to say, however, was that the net would never be as important as electricity. This fact appears to have escaped the notice of some folks in the computing business; it certainly escapes many of those who breathlessly report its doings. But it’s obvious the moment you think about it. If we had to choose between the internet or access to electrical power, which one would we go for? No contest. What we have come to accept as civilised life depends utterly on secure supplies of electricity. We would miss the net, of course, and large chunks of our technical infrastructure depend on its continuance, but we could get by without it. Take away electricity, however, and our modern machine, including the net, stops. Those of us who write about ICT sometimes forget that, in the grand scheme of industrial things, it’s small beer compared to industries such as transportation (and its infrastructure), energy, healthcare and biotechnology. Which is why a really smart long-term investor would be more interested in these fields than in what happens to cloud computing, “wearables” and other IT obsessions de nos jours. And even within the IT business itself, some are using the vast revenues accruing from their current mastery of the technology to gain a foothold in the things that will really matter in our collective future. One such visionary is Elon Musk, a South African-born entrepreneur who made a colossal pile from PayPal and has been doing interesting things in non-IT fields ever since. The world knows him most for his creation of Tesla, the company that makes high-end electric cars, and SpaceX, an outfit that specialises in what really is rocket science. But probably the most interesting thing about Musk is that he has focused on solving the problem that keeps us in a world that depends utterly on electricity but lacks a way of storing it efficiently and cost-effectively: the problem of battery technology. For some time, Musk has been building a huge factory to make such batteries and he is widely believed to be planning a major announcement on 30 April. Until recently, most people assumed that his new factory would be making improved batteries merely for powering electric vehicles. But if the rumour mill is correct, Musk has set his sights higher – on new battery technology that would make it possible efficiently to store the quantities of electric power needed to run modern homes. If he has indeed managed to do something like that, then it would be a game-changer on an epochal scale. You don’t need to be a rocket scientist to understand why. Our global future depends on finding a way of generating electricity without burning ever more fossil fuel or building nuclear power stations at an improbable rate. We know how to generate electricity with so-called renewable sources – wind power and solar cells, for example. The problem is that renewable sources have variable outputs and presently don’t provide the stable, baseline electrical supply on which society depends. (Harnessing tidal power or nuclear fusion might do it but they’re still a long way off.) But what if we had a way of storing the power that flows from renewables when they are generating so that we could have it available when they aren’t? The rational response to the rumours about Musk’s announcement is to be sceptical. There’s no pure technological fix for global warming. And a lot of smart people have been trying to design better batteries for decades and progress to date has been agonisingly slow, but maybe things are suddenly changing. Last week, for example, researchers at Stanford reported that they had developed a rechargeable aluminium-based battery that can safely charge a smartphone in one minute, which is good news to this columnist, whose phone ran out of juice the other day when he was using it to navigate the wilds of Scotland. If Musk can do this kind of thing on a larger scale, then things really will be looking up. I say that with feeling because, just as I was typing that sentence, my laptop ran out of charge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2015/aug/09/labour-leadership-jeremy-corbyn-result-partys-democratic-experiment","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-09T16:02:15Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn could be the result of Labour's democratic experiment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/09/labour-leadership-jeremy-corbyn-result-partys-democratic-experiment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/aug/09/labour-leadership-jeremy-corbyn-result-partys-democratic-experiment","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn could be the result of Labour's democratic experiment","bodyText":"Probably the most important story from last week was the fact that Labour is a brand new party. It is a New Labour all over again. Probably only half of those registered to vote when the ballot papers go out next weekend will have been able to vote in 2010 when David Miliband beat his brother in the constituency section, only to fall short in the other sections of the now defunct electoral college. As Sky News’s Sophie Ridge reported last week, there are about 270,000 full members of the Labour party, of which 200,000 were members before the election. Among those 200,000, as many as 50,000 were recruited since 2010. In addition, 70,000 have joined as affiliated supporters (mainly through trade unions) and 50,000 have paid £3 to sign up as a registered supporter. That’s a total of 190,000 people joining up since the 2015 election, and 240,000 since 2010. That means most party members probably did not vote in the 2010 party election. It is likely these figures for registered supporters will rise still further this week, putting yet more pressure on the party headquarters staff as they try to weed out infiltrators from other parties that have decided Labour is now the true “site of struggle”. All parties grow after an election contest – a one-month marketing campaign for party politics – and all parties have a turnover of membership, with any new intake normally reflecting the politics of the leader at the time. But the scale of this Labour increase is unprecedented. Clearly the number of entryists in this impressive increase in membership is likely to be fractional, even if the party is incapable of working at the speed to make all the necessary checks. Instead many of the new members are old activists returning to a party they left in the wake of the Iraq war, and many are young people enthused by Corbyn’s message. Most have no memory of the 1980s or the Tony Benn years, but are fed up with the compromise of established Westminster politics. In some constituencies, especially in university towns, as many as 400 new members are joining. Many see this as a chance to express their values by voting for Jeremy Corbyn. The electability of Corbyn is, for some, subsidiary. The whole episode has been a political disaster for those mainly Blairites that first proposed open primaries on the grounds it would make the party selectorate more representative of the wider electorate. There were two models – the long-established US primary system and the 2011 French socialist party open primary for its presidential candidate. Any French citizen willing to pay a minimum €1 (70p) and sign up to some pretty broad values about justice, fraternity and solidarity could vote for the socialist presidential candidate. Just under 2.9 million French people voted in the final round, raising close to €3m for the party. The French socialist party membership at the time was about 200,000 so the French contest, conducted in less of a rush than Labour and closer to the actual presidential election, appears to have done better than Labour’s at galvanising the wider electorate, even though voters in the contest had to go to the polling stations on the day of the final ballot to vote. Many, such as the Institute for Government thinktank, and the New Labour pressure group, Progress, argued the French model was one that Labour should consider. The aim was to engage the swing voters from Nuneaton as much as the ex-Greens of Norwich. The concept was duly a key ingredient in the Labour internal democracy reforms developed by Lord Collins, and embraced by Ed Miliband at a special conference in 2014 with almost no resistance. Miliband, currently on the other side of the world in Australia, has been silent on whether he thinks the experiment in democracy he engendered is going to plan. His allies admit Labour has not had time to engage with English marginal voters in the election, or to run an effective registration drive. The recruitment push has largely been left to Unite organisers and the extraordinary impetus provided by the Corbyn campaign, including full-page adverts in the Guardian. The politics of the new members cannot be known for certain, or the durability of their commitment to Labour. But the consensus among party officials is that the left is ascendant. Whatever the final result, and a Corbyn victory seems to be weeks away, Labour will no longer be the same party. In the 1981 contest for the deputy leadership between Tony Benn and Denis Healey, the party establishment was saved by an electoral college in which rightwing trade union leaders and Labour MPs – many from Scotland – voted solidly for Healey, defeating the overwhelmingly Bennite constituencies. This time no such 7th cavalry is available. There is one Scottish Labour MP and most trade unions for more than a decade have been run by the left, with the only change coming from the far left. The old forces of conservatism inside Labour are in decline, or no longer exist. That in turn will have permanent consequences if Corbyn wins, as many MPs have said they will not stand in the shadow cabinet elections that Corbyn has said he will reintroduce. But if these MPs refuse to cooperate at all with someone that has been democratically elected leader, they too could face consequences. In the 1980s, the reselection of Labour MPs by local parties, or the threat of it, hung over MPs like a sword of Damocles in the second half of the parliament. If the atmosphere of the 1980s returns with local parties challenging rightwing parties, the task of the deputy leader – likely to be Tom Watson – in keeping the party organisation united will be formidable. A war between local parties and the parliamentary Labour party is not something Corbyn would relish. Unity might not quite be his watchword but his aides made clear he does not want to plunge the party into a further debate about rewriting Clause 4 of the party constitution setting out its aims and values. He knows if he is too confrontational in his own party there is a real risk that, if elected, he will have a limited array of talent on which to draw in the parliamentary party. He has promised to reintroduce shadow cabinet elections, but needs candidates to put themselves forward from across the party if the start of a split is to be avoided. As it stands, Corbyn needs to find a shadow defence secretary willing to advocate British withdrawal from Nato and unilateral UK disarmament. He needs a shadow foreign secretary willing to argue that the UK demand a renegotiation of its place in Europe, and reject war in Syria. He needs a shadow energy secretary to oppose all nuclear power plants and to advocate the possible reopening of some coal mines. He needs a shadow Northern Ireland secretary capable of reaching out to Protestants, given his support for Sinn Féin. Above all, he needs a shadow chancellor willing to put a stronger case against austerity and the City of London than any frontbencher has so far. If he wins, Corbyn can indeed say he has a mandate from the membership, but would need to reach out to his MPs to have any chance of survival. Simple appeals to party loyalty from a man who has defied the whip 500 times will ring hollow. Both sides will have to decide if the ideological chasm is too big to bridge. Either way, the consequences would be momentous."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2015/jul/07/corporate-welfare-a-93bn-handshake","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T20:00:30Z","webTitle":"The £93bn handshake: businesses pocket huge subsidies and tax breaks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/07/corporate-welfare-a-93bn-handshake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/jul/07/corporate-welfare-a-93bn-handshake","fields":{"headline":"The £93bn handshake: businesses pocket huge subsidies and tax breaks","bodyText":"Taxpayers are handing businesses £93bn a year – a transfer of more than £3,500 from each household in the UK. The total emerges from the first comprehensive account of what Britons give away to companies in grants, subsidies and tax breaks, published exclusively in the Guardian. Many of the companies receiving the largest public grants over the past few years previously paid little or zero corporation tax, the analysis shows. They include some of the best-known names in Britain, such as Amazon, Ford and Nissan. The figures intensify the pressure on George Osborne, the chancellor, just as he puts the finishing touches to his budget. At the heart of Wednesday’s announcement will be his plans to cut £12bn more from the social welfare bill. Yet that sum is less than the £14.5bn given to companies in direct subsidies and grants alone. Corporate welfare is part of what David Cameron calls his government’s policy to make the UK “the most open, welcoming, business-friendly country in the world”. He listed the “great incentives” for businesses to come to the UK in a document published last September for UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI) – a government department working to help British businesses succeed abroad and to woo overseas investors. These incentives included, he said, the lowest corporation tax rate anywhere in the G7, tax exemptions for research and direct government support. The Guardian’s analysis shows that while the state is giving private companies an increasing amount in direct handouts, the money repaid in corporate taxation is falling almost year upon year. In the financial year 2012-13, the government spent £58.2bn on subsidies, grants and corporate tax benefits. It took just £41.3bn in corporation tax receipts. In 2012, Amazon was attacked by MPs on parliament’s public accounts committee for avoiding UK tax. Yet in the same period, the online retailer was awarded £16.5m in grants by the administrations of Scotland and Wales to help build distribution centres. To link the Wales plant to the transport network, the Welsh assembly built the mile-long “Ffordd Amazon road” at an additional cost of £3m. Many of the figures, especially on direct payments, are hard to unearth, as they are scattered between various arms of the state. The government admits: “There is no definitive source of data about spending on subsidies to businesses in the UK.” Of the regional development agencies that gave grants to private companies until 2012, only one – for north-west England – gives details on what it gave to whom, and that for just 2009-11. The analysis lends fresh urgency to the debate over what Britons give to business and what they should expect in return. Offering sweeteners to businesses is usually justified by the prospect of extra taxes flowing in, not only in corporation taxation, but also employers’ national insurance. Business groups regularly call for corporate welfare and other “pro-growth” measures on the grounds that they help create jobs. Firms protesting against onerous taxes and red tape will sometimes threaten to move, just as the giant bank HSBC is considering relocating to Hong Kong. The research was carried out by Kevin Farnsworth, a senior lecturer at York University, who has researched and published studies of corporate welfare for more than a decade and who is launching on Wednesday an online database of grants made to companies. To determine how much Britain pays for its businesses, he looked at the figures for the financial year 2012-13 – the last year for which there is a near-complete set of accounts. The elements of the £93bn corporate handout break down as follows: • Subsidies and grants: £14.5bn This includes cash to the train operators to run services, subsidies to defence firms and grants to businesses to induce them to invest. The £14.5bn figure for 2012-13 is used by the Treasury in its own statistical analysis of government spending. • Corporate tax benefits: £44bn Of the 93 major tax reliefs provided by the Treasury, 27 are aimed at business. The largest amount was spent allowing businesses to write off billions spent on plants, machinery and equipment among other items. In 2012-13, the public gave a £20bn subsidy to private investment. The construction industry gained more than £7bn in exemptions on new housing and land duty. A 2009 study by the rich nations’ thinktank, the OECD, found that the UK had more generous corporate tax benefits than the US, Germany or any of the seven other major economies it examined. • Hidden transport subsidies: £15bn Unlike motorists and the petrol levies they are charged, airlines do not pay tax on fuel – support worth about £8.5bn a year, according to MPs on parliament’s transport select committee. Train companies also enjoy lower duty on fuel. • Energy subsidies: £3.8bn Most public handouts to energy firms are not widely acknowledged, according to a recent House of Commons environmental audit committee report. It said: “The variation in definitions of subsidy allows the government to resist acknowledging subsidy in many areas.” Yet the dismantling of Britain’s nuclear power stations cost the public £2.3bn in 2012-13 alone. • Insurance, advice and advocacy services: £406m Includes such vital services as the state’s insurance scheme for trading abroad – the export credit guarantee – of which the defence firm BAE Systems says: “Many of our customers require it.” It also includes government trade advisers and overseas business networks. • Government procurement from the private sector: £15bn Capita, Atos, G4S and Serco alone received £4bn worth of public-sector contracts in 2012-13. While procurement provides the public with services, it is not always about securing value for money for taxpayers, as the business secretary at the time, Vince Cable, acknowledged in 2012. He said: “There is a role for the government using procurement in a more strategic way.” Drawing on the financial accounts of the big outsourcing companies, Farnsworth calculated the direct above-cost element of procurement at £15bn out of a total spend of £238bn. The £93bn sum is, he stresses, “a conservative estimate”. It leaves out invaluable support on which it is nonetheless hard to put a price tag – such as the trade delegations abroad led by Cameron, Osborne and other politicians or the use of foreign aid to help British business win contracts in poor countries. It also does not include the legacy costs of the bank bailouts for 2008-09 and other crisis measures, which are estimated to have cost £35bn in 2012-13."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/nov/16/steven-cru-warns-uk-nuclear-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-16T15:28:30Z","webTitle":"Steven Chu warns UK its nuclear plans risk becoming financial drain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/16/steven-cru-warns-uk-nuclear-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/nov/16/steven-cru-warns-uk-nuclear-plans","fields":{"headline":"Steven Chu warns UK its nuclear plans risk becoming financial drain","bodyText":"A leading energy expert has warned that although the British government is right to proceed with new nuclear plants they risk becoming a “financial drain” unless they can be built on time and on budget. Steven Chu, the former US energy secretary and Nobel prizewinning physicist, believes using a variety of reactor designs – as the UK looks poised to do – is not the best way to keep costs down. “Unless we can learn to build nuclear on schedule and on budget it will be a financial drain. Other countries have learned how to do this: South Korea has built 10 plants exactly the same and the tenth plant was only 60% of the cost of the original one. The cost came marching down because they just kept doing the same thing,” he told the Guardian. “That is true of all industries. If you build exactly the same its get cheaper, cheaper, cheaper. Everything different means it will cost more. You have to understand that. When the United States built its nuclear plants they were all different,” argued Chu who was President Obama’s energy secretary until April last year and is now a professor at Stanford University in California. Atomic plants being built in Finland and France are much more expensive than forecast and are suffering significant delays but EDF, the company planning to build Hinkley Point C reactors in Somerset, says it will learn from those mistakes. While EDF plans to use an “EPR” design at Hinkley and possibly at Sizewell in Suffolk, other developers in Britain are planning different models. Chu, who was in Britain giving this year’s Romanes Lecture at Oxford University, believes a key role for nuclear power will be to provide support for other low-carbon, but intermittent, power technologies such as wind and solar, of which he is a supporter. “In the US, within a decade, onshore wind without subsidy is going to be less expensive than natural gas – even with natural gas staying at its current price which is two-and-a-half times less expensive than natural gas in the UK. “I think England may be a different story in the sense that you have a lot of good wind resources but it’s a small country, and I know England is looking at another generation of nuclear reactors which I am in favour of: perhaps what we need is one more generation of nuclear reactors.” Chu, whose current work includes research into more powerful and effective batteries, says: “Sometimes you will get 100% wind but other times the wind will not be blowing and you do need back-up power and that is going to come from fossil fuel or nuclear. What we will be able to do by mid-century is 50% of electricity from renewables if Europe shares its renewable resources … We would still need to capture carbon from fossil fuel-generating plants, also from cement and steel (manufacturing) plants.” The Stanford professor is still worried that not enough progress is being made worldwide to tackle climate change but remains upbeat about Obama’s attempts to galvanise the US more, not least through the recent bilateral agreement with China. Would a Republican president in in 2016 represent a setback? “A Republican presidency would not necessarily be a setback. It was a rabid anti-communist [Richard Nixon] who opened up China. That same president started the Environmental Protection Agency which is not considered part of the Republican agenda. Another Republican president [George Bush senior] stopped underground nuclear testing in the United States. He also put a cap and trade system in place on some emissions from power plants. “Some leading Republicans support a carbon tax for instance. You start at $10-$15 per tonne and slowly make it rise to $60 or so. But you use those revenues for the people – you do not use those revenues for other government programmes. We have means of doing it, through higher social security cheques or helping the unemployed. You give it back to the American people.” Chu dismisses concerns that a price on carbon could damage energy-intensive businesses pointing out that most oil companies now carry a “ghost price” for carbon on the books. And he says tougher political action on climate change would bring new solutions itself. “As long as engineers know what is happening, if countries know that is happening then people will come up with technical solutions. Historically [solutions] arrive.” As for the chance of a binding climate change agreement between countries at next year’s vital talks in Paris he says: “I think there is forward momentum. I hope [Paris] is better than Copenhagen. Do I have significant hope there will be a binding agreement among all countries, probably not. But my guess is that China will put a price on carbon during this government. Central government knows there is a huge risk [from climate change] their country faces. “That is why they are working hard to diversify their energy supply and are the largest installer of wind and solar in the world as well as building 30-plus nuclear power plants and trying to develop their natural gas resources. So China is moving, major states in the US are moving but … I get nervous. We are not moving fast enough."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2015/feb/26/duke-of-cambridge-to-work-with-east-anglian-air-ambulance","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-26T10:36:43Z","webTitle":"Duke of Cambridge to work with East Anglian air ambulance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/26/duke-of-cambridge-to-work-with-east-anglian-air-ambulance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2015/feb/26/duke-of-cambridge-to-work-with-east-anglian-air-ambulance","fields":{"headline":"Duke of Cambridge to work with East Anglian air ambulance","bodyText":"The Duke of Cambridge is to start work with the East Anglian air ambulance (EAAA) this summer after finishing and passing air transport pilot licence exams. William, a former RAF search and rescue helicopter pilot, sat 14 written exams that ranged from the principles of flight, navigation, flight planning to air law. The second-in-line to the throne will be employed by Bond Air Services, which runs a number of air ambulance and police aviation operations. William, 32, will join the company when he returns from his seven-day tour of Japan and China. He will undergo job-specific training before starting work. “After he returns from his tour to Japan and China in March, he will start working for East Anglian air ambulance and be formally employed by Bond Air Services,” said a Kensington palace spokesman. “He will initially be required to complete another period of mandatory training, involving aircraft training, in-flight skills testing and further written exams.” The full-time role, for which he will donate his salary to charity, will be fitted in around royal duties. The job based at Cambridge airport is convenient for the Cambridges’ new country home, Anmer Hall, a Grade II-listed 10-bedroom mansion on the Queen’s Sandringham estate, recently privately refurbished to accommodate the duke and duchess and Prince George. While in London, the couple will live at their 21-room apartment at Kensington Palace, recently refurbished at a cost of £4.5m to the public purse. The EAAA operates two helicopters and employs three pilots in Norwich and three in Cambridge, covering Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire. Along with a pilot, each helicopter carries a doctor and a paramedic. William’s main duties will involve flying an EC145 T2 aircraft, working alongside medics to respond to emergencies ranging from road accidents to heart attacks. The announcement came as William arrived in Japan for a four-day visit that will see him meet survivors of the 2011 tsunami. He started his first visit to Japan with the tea ceremony at Hama Rikyu Gardens in Tokyo. His wife Kate, who is due to give birth to their second child in April, stayed home. The Edo-era style garden, which once belonged to a feudal shogun, is filled with sculpted pine trees and blossoming plum trees, and features wooden bridges over several lakes. The Japan leg will include a visit to a school in the north-eastern region of Fukushima, where some areas have been closed off around a nuclear power plant that went into meltdown four years ago. William will also visit other areas devastated by the March 2011 tsunami to show support for the survivors and pay his respects to those who died. The tsunami and the quake that set it off killed about 19,000 people, and displaced tens of thousands, including those whose homes were intact but contaminated by the radiation spewed from the Fukushima plant. He will be taken to the area devastated by the waters, but some have claimed he will not meet families whose lives were blighted when the tsunami triggered the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Local leaders have accused Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who wants to restart the country’s nuclear plants, of using the royal visit for his own aims. According to local reports Abe will join William on his visit to a public playground where contaminated soil has been removed – but it is believed he will not meet families driven from their homes by the nuclear disaster. In China, William is to visit Beijing’s Forbidden City and he will launch the three-day great festival of creativity in Shanghai."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/nov/12/iran-nuclear-deal-obama-kerry","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-12T13:15:00Z","webTitle":"How Obama can achieve a nuclear deal with Iran | Tom Rogan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/12/iran-nuclear-deal-obama-kerry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/12/iran-nuclear-deal-obama-kerry","fields":{"headline":"How President Obama can achieve a nuclear deal with Iran","bodyText":"In the cause of peace, the clock is ticking. Western Intelligence services have delayed a nuclear Iran. Still, the evidence on the ground is unmistakable. Iranian nuclear activities increasingly point to a weaponization agenda. Of most concern: Iran's soon-to-be plutonium production facility at Arak. As David Albright and Christina Walrond of the Institute for Science and International Security note (pdf), claims of an inherently peaceful nuclear program cannot easily co-exist with a heavy water reactor. Correspondingly, in last weekend's P5+1 negotiations, the French Foreign Minister suggested that allowing Arak to remain in operation would represent a \"sucker's deal''. He's right. This isn't just about Iran's nuclear claims-capability disconnect. Once Arak reaches nuclear criticality (as things stand, probably at some point next year), any military strike on its reactor would release highly radioactive materials into the atmosphere. In this vein, any deal that fails to address Arak would force the Israeli timetable – making a near-term Israeli military strike much likelier (it would be a grave mistake to take Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's threats lightly). Yet there's cause for hope. Further talks are planned for the near future. In order to reach a deal, Obama must embrace a far more realistic negotiating position. First, the US must ensure that any proposal is serious. We can't have another agreement in the form of the Syria WMD deal (the absurdity of which is rapidly becoming evident). A serious deal would require more than astute eyes. It would need teeth. This means that alongside forthright declarations on their nuclear infrastructure, Iran would have to acquiesce to unannounced IAEA spot checks (unless inspectors have freedom of search, there's no meaningful way to guard against a covert nuclear program). At the same time, any serious deal would have to proscribe robust consequences for Iranian non-compliance – stronger sanctions as a first step and the (credible) threat of multilateral military force as a follow up. In order to persuade a skeptical Iran, US Secretary of State John Kerry should point to the looming prospect of tougher sanctions from Congress. Second, Obama would have to ensure that any deal is perceivably sustainable – offering long term durability. Here, it will be critical to provide deal-enforcement mechanisms that reach beyond Iranian territory. In practical terms, a deal would need the co-operation of P5+1 intelligence officers and law enforcement personnel. Absent the unified resolve of the international community, any deal would quickly wither in face of self-interested agendas. Iranian hardliners would almost certainly pursue a covert weaponization program and unscrupulous business interests would wager the gambit of lucrative black market opportunities. Without a bedrock of sustainability, a deal would only be a pretense. Third, Obama needs to realize that unless a deal is sellable to all parties, it's neither serious nor sustainable. This is perhaps the most important caveat. In order to bridge present gaps, Kerry will have to accept von Bismarck's adage – that ultimately, \"politics is the art of the possible\". This understanding will demand tough choices – a successful deal would be signaled by complaints from hardliners on all sides. In more specific terms, Kerry will have to balance a low percentage cap on enrichment with a closure of facilities like those at Arak. Herein lies the defining challenge. The US must match a respect for Iranian \"prestige\" with the suspension of suspected weaponization activities. Yes, allowing even minimal enrichment would lead to criticism from some quarters. Obama must be prepared to ignore the anger. In the end, recognition of Iran's \"prestige\" will be critical for success. Ultimately, the theocrats don't simply regard nuclear power as a prospective policy tool, but as a theological endorsement; as a vindication of their revolutionary project, as a minimum that cannot be surrendered. For Obama, the key is to bind that belief to a more measured nuclear identity. It's true, where parties lack trust, diplomacy is seldom easy. It's also fair to say that nuclear diplomacy raises these complexities to an unequaled level. Nevertheless, without a realistic deal, figuratively or literally, the Iranian nuclear crisis is heading for meltdown. Israel will launch an attack, or Iran will become an unrestrained nuclear power. Either way, the price for diplomatic inaction is too high. In order to preserve the intersection of peace and security, America must pursue a serious, sustainable and saleable deal with paramount urgency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2015/jun/01/how-renewable-energy-in-south-africa-is-quietly-stealing-a-march-on-coal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-01T11:54:56Z","webTitle":"How renewable energy in South Africa is quietly stealing a march on coal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/01/how-renewable-energy-in-south-africa-is-quietly-stealing-a-march-on-coal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jun/01/how-renewable-energy-in-south-africa-is-quietly-stealing-a-march-on-coal","fields":{"headline":"How renewable energy in South Africa is quietly stealing a march on coal","bodyText":"The howling wind drives the turbines, their blades bent back from the force as they spin in the evening light and send electricity to local villages in South Africa’s Eastern Cape. High up on the top of the turbine, local resident Lungela Vongu, dressed in a safety harness and hard hat leans far out over the 100 meter drop to check that the wind speed detector is working properly. “This wind farm is bringing a lot more jobs into this community for the people, without it there is no future here,” he says. The Cookhouse wind farm is the biggest wind system built in Africa, with 66 turbines generating 138MW of clean power. It started feeding the grid at the end of 2014 and it is far from unique. Although still heavily dependent on fossil fuels, South Africa has been quietly creating one of the world’s most progressive alternative energy plans. Solar, biomass and wind energy systems are popping up all over the country and feeding clean energy into the strained electrical grid. “It is set to completely transform these deep rural communities in terms of healthcare, education, job creation and a raft of other interventions. All this while putting green electricity on the grid at affordable prices,” said Johan van den Berg, director of the South African Wind Energy Association. Like all the projects in the country a percentage of the equity of the Cookhouse wind farm is held by the Cookhouse community trust. The trustees come from the local community and they funnel the profits of 15% of the sale of the energy into health care, education and job creation. But it is low price for the electricity that is really making the difference. Wind energy from new projects now costs 5 US cents per kWh, roughly half the cost of new coal. Renewable energy has a long way to go to overtake South Africa’s reliance on coal though. It is number 11 in the world for total CO2 output from energy use and the fifth largest producer of the climate-changing fossil fuel. The situation seems poised to get worse as construction continues on Medupi, the largest dry cooled coal-fired power station in the world. Meant to be completed by 2013, the station has been mired in delays and cost overruns since construction first started in 2007. Meanwhile, wind power has been quietly piling on capacity. Tina Joemat-Pettersson, the South African minister of energy said in a recent speech that the country has added a total of 4,322MW of renewable energy capacity in less than four years. Medupi, whenever it is finished, is designed to supply 4,764MW. That renewables have almost surpassed the output of such a station in about half the time of it’s still-unfinished construction is a testament to the government’s commitment to alternative energy, the maturity of the technology and the work of hundreds of companies, organisations and partnering governments. “In the last 16 years the best way to describe it is that it’s a rocket launch after a very slow countdown,” says van den Berg. The government is still pursuing other energy types with a plan to open up 20% of the country to shale gas fracking and a controversial deal set up by President Jacob Zuma in 2014 to buy eight new nuclear power plants from Russia for $84bn. But van den Berg sees a step change for renewables. “For the first decade of working in climate change I felt like we were rearranging the deck chairs on a sinking ship and making no real impact.” “In my heart of hearts, I wasn’t convinced there was a technical solution, renewable energy wasn’t as yet affordable. Today, all of that has changed.” It’s not only power that is flowing from the 79 licensed projects underway in the country, the South Africa’s Department of Energy reports that $16.8bn has been injected into the country’s economic infrastructure through the various projects. The numbers have piqued the interest of big traditional energy companies like Exxaro. The company produces 39m tons of coal per year to feed the world’s hunger for energy, but they are now poised to break ground on a $300m wind energy project in the Eastern Cape. “What we are seeing is not only is the technology producing much cleaner power but it’s doing so at a lower cost than traditional fossil fuel technologies,” said Evan Rice, chief executive of Greencape, in Cape Town, a government funded not-for-profit development agency. Three years ago they assisted the city of Cape Town and the national government to partner with Germany to create the South African Renewable Energy Technology Centre in the city’s suburbs. The cutting-edge technology centre will produce around 250 qualified technicians a year to run and maintain the renewable energy systems in the country. A $30m wind tower factory has just been finished outside Cape Town by European multinational GRI Renewable Industries in the township of Atlantis. The area has been severely economically depressed and the massive 12,000 square meter factory will directly employ 200 people building 150 South African wind towers per year. Rice says many more jobs will come as production ramps up. “On the continent, there really is the opportunity to leapfrog the old centralised large scale fossil fuel power and big grid paradigm. With technology and project prices continuing to drop, and rapid breakthroughs in battery and other storage technologies, I have no doubt that renewables will address all of our power needs in time. This will happen sooner than people think,” he said.

Falling oil prices and disappointing results from the likes of Royal Dutch Shell and Lloyds Banking Group also hit sentiment. Investors were nervous ahead of the European bank stress test results due on late on Friday. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 29.37 points or 0.44% at 6721.06 Germany’s Dax dipped 0.43% to 10,274.93 France’s Cac closed down 0.59% at 4420.58 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 2.02% to 16,522.64 on worries about the country’s banks ahead of the stress tests Spain’s Ibex ended 2.1% lower at 8479.2 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.11% to 562.84 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 72 points or 0.4%. On that note, it’s time to close up. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. Markets are in wait and see mode ahead of the Bank of Japan rate decision later, but oil continues to fall on renewed worries about oversupply and weak demand. West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark has now fallen 20% since its June highs, indicating a bear market. Meanwhile in the UK the FTSE 100 is down just 7 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 74 points lower after the Federal Reserve kept US interest rates on hold but hinted at possible rises later in the year. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: An unsurprisingly indecisive session in Europe has seen the likes of the FTSE largely flatlining as traders reduced their risk overnight ahead of the week’s risk event from the Bank of Japan. Commodities have enjoyed a particularly volatile second half of this week, with crude continuing to tumble heavily on a global supply glut alongside evidence that fund managers are heavily shorting crude prices. Tonight’s Bank of Japan meeting has been the focal point of the week despite yesterday’s Fed announcement. One of the main reasons for the post-referendum rally has been the promise of easing from the likes of the ECB, Bank of England and Bank of Japan. With the overnight index swap markets rating the chance of a Bank of England rate cut at 100% next week, it seems like a matter of time until we see some sort of action. However, given that we have seen the post-referendum rally stall after weeks of inaction in Europe, there is a feeling that the FTSE is waiting for some form of stimulus to spark another leg higher. The IMF has been criticised for its handling of the eurozone crisis...by the IMF. Larry Elliott reports: The IMF’s handling of the financial crisis in the eurozone has been criticised by the organisation’s own independent watchdog in a report that says the fund failed to spot the scale of the problem, was guilty of over-optimistic forecasts and left the impression that it was treating Europe differently. While accepting that sorting out the problems of Greece, Ireland and Portugal “posed extraordinary challenges”, the IMF’s Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) said the fund had missed the buildup of banking system risks in some countries and shared the widely held “Europe is different” mindset. The report looked into how the IMF handled the eurozone crisis, which began with the May 2010 bailout of Greece, but subsequently spread to Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus. It found that the “IMF’s pre-crisis surveillance identified the right issues but did not foresee the magnitude of the risks that would later become paramount”. The full story is here: The vast majority of Irish small to medium enterprises believe Brexit is a threat to their business, writes Henry McDonald in Dublin: A survey released today by the British-Irish Chamber of Commence found that out of 400 Irish SMEs 262 of them see Brexit as a threat with far fewer envisaging the post-EU future as an opportunity The research also polled 88 British SMEs who do major business in Ireland. John McGrane, the Director General of the Chamber stressed that the Irish SME sector, which is the largest part of the Republic’s economy, still see the UK as key to their business despite Britain leaving the EU. McGrane said the uncertainty within Irish SME’s over what to do next after the Brexit vote required “joined up support” from both the Irish and British government and their relevant agencies. He added: “Business wants collaborative thinking and the Chamber stands ready to support its members, and Government, to continue to protect and grow the deep trade linkages between the UK and Ireland. We’re ready to join up with likeminded agencies and organisations to ensure all businesses get the most joined-up supports they need to confront the uncertainties, and opportunities, ahead.” The survey was conducted over the weeks following the EU referendum. The expectation of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England continues to put pressure on sterling. The pound has fallen 1% against the euro, hitting a two week low of 84.48p a euro. Against the dollar it is currently down 0.58% at $1.3142. Back with Brexit, and ratings agency S&amp;P Global says the decision to leave the European Union should have little impact on the UK’s project finance initiative. It said: We analyse the effect of Brexit on our U.K. portfolio of over 50 rated transactions, in particular the potential repercussions of a higher inflationary environment, weaker economic growth, and the change in the credit quality of revenues and financial counterparties. While we believe that the risks of adverse economic developments in the U.K. have increased, we expect U.K. private finance initiative (PFI) projects will maintain their credit strength. A day after the US Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold but suggested there could be a possible hike later this year, US stock markets have slipped lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 44 points or 0.22%, while the S&amp;P 500 has slipped 0.29% and Nasdaq 0.14%. Ahead of eurozone GDP figures on Friday, new data from Belgium has shown the country’s economy growing by 0.5% quarter on quarter, despite terrorist attacks and strikes. That compares to 0.2% growth in the first quarter, and analyst expectations of a 0.3% increase. Year on year, the economy grew by 1.4%. Economist Peter Vanden Houte at ING Bank said: According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs the negative impact of the March 22 terrorist attacks in Brussels on hotels, catering and retail trade amounted to about €180m for the first half of this year. This probably shaved off around 0.1 percentage points from second quarter GDP growth. On top of that, the second quarter saw a rather tense social climate, with several strikes, most notably in public transport. This also weighed on growth. While the GDP components have not been published yet, the improvement in sentiment in industry seems to point to a positive contribution from investment and export. Residential construction most likely also contributed positively. With the situation on the labour market continuing to improve, consumption has probably also expanded, though some negative impact of the terrorist attacks seems likely. All in all today’s figure seems hopeful, as it confirms that the Belgian economy still has some underlying momentum, putting in a strong performance despite the terrorist attacks and the strikes. Certainly, with Brexit and potentially a somewhat tighter fiscal policy, there are new headwinds that might hamper growth in the second half, but we believe that even then a quarterly growth pace of around 0.2% to 0.3% should be feasible. We will await further data confirmation in the coming weeks, but on the back of today’s figures we are likely to have to revise our estimate for Belgian GDP growth upwards to 1.4% (from 1.2%). Earlier, US jobless claims rose by more than expected last week, according to the Labor Department. The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits grew by 14,000 to 266,000, compared to expectations of an increase to 260,000. The previous week’s level was revised down by 1,000 to 252,000. Weekly claims have been below 300,000, which is seen as a sign of a healthy labour market, for 73 consecutive weeks. Over in Paris, an EDF board member has resigned shortly before the energy company announce whether it will push on with plans to build a new nuclear plant at Britain’s Hinkley Point. Gerard Magnin said the project was risky, and would undermine France’s efforts to develop renewable energy technology. Magnin’s resignation may be a sign that EDF will stick with Hinkley. An announcement is expected later today. Over in America, tech giant Oracle has swooped on cloud computing pioneer NetSuite in a $9.3bn deal. The deal should boost Oracle’s web services offering; its founder, Larry Ellison, is also NetSuite’s largest shareholder. Newsflash from Germany: the country’s inflation rate has jumped to 0.4% this month, up from 0.2% in June. That’s the highest level since January, which should pleas the European Central Bank in its battle to ward off deflation. The overall eurozone inflation reading is due at 10am BST tomorrow. Alex Stubb, Finlands’s former prime minister and finance minister, has warned that it will take a long time for the Brexit drama to play out. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Stubb said Europe was facing one of its biggest events in decades. It’s a 1952 moment, when the Coal and Steel Community was created, or 1989 when the Cold War ended. This is huge for Europe, there’s no denying it. Stubb, a veteran of the eurozone debt crisis, says Europe is following its usual three-stage approach to Brexit – first crisis, then chaos, and finally a sub-optimal solution. He adds: It’s going to be a long, long process. What we get at the end of the day, I don’t know. Eurozone companies have defied the fall in consumer confidence, and are actually a little more optimistic this month. The EC’s economic sentiment indicator has risen to 104.6 in July from 104.4 in June. Anna Zabrodzka, economist at Moody’s Analytics, says it shows “resilience” to the Brexit vote. Other persistent worries such as the slowing Chinese economy, the immigration wave, and continued tensions with Russia also seem to made little impact on the confidence of consumers and businesses in the euro area. However, risks are skewed to the downside.” Consumer confidence across Europe has fallen this month, driven by a sharp slump in the UK. That’s according to the European Commission’s monthly healthcheck on consumer morale, which fell to -7.9 this month from -7.2 in June. UK consumer confidence, which had been riding relatively high, took a real tumble: The dramatic events of the last few weeks have sent some of us staggering towards the drinks cabinet. But Diageo, the UK-based alcoholic beverages giant, is worried that the Brexit vote may hit sales of its whisky brands overseas, once Britain leaves the EU. Ivan Menezes, chief executive of Diageo, told CNBC that Scotland’s whisky industry is dependent on global trade: Out of Brexit, our focus is really on ensuring that we keep Scotch whisky healthy. The trade agreements in Europe and around the world. You know, Johnnie Walker was in over 100 markets, long before Coca Cola left the shores of America.” As well as Johnnie Walker, Diageo also produces Bell’s whisky, plus several single malts including Talisker and Lagavulin. More Brexit gloom. JCDecaux, the French outdoor advertising group, has said it is likely to cut back its UK investment plans following the decision to leave the EU. JCDecaux, which installs those massive screens at railway stations, airports and London bus shelters, says: Given the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the Brexit decision on the UK economy and advertising revenue, we are reviewing the number of screens we are deploying until we can evaluate the economic conditions and have improved visibility. Union leaders are urging the UK government to act urgently to protect the economy from the impact of the Brexit vote. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady says: “The growing expectation since the Brexit vote of an economic slowdown seems to be a factor. The government needs to act now to secure jobs and investment before thousands of working people pay the price of Brexit with the loss of their job. And Rob MacGregor of Unite is alarmed by Lloyds’s decision to cut an extra 3,000 jobs: “This announcement is very bad news for workers and their families, and more widely it is a further body blow to the UK economy. “These are permanent jobs that are being lost. As a country, we can’t afford to lose these jobs in a challenging post-Brexit world. As well publishing half year results which reveal job cuts and branch closures, Lloyds Banking Group has also admitted it is being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority over the way it handles customers facing difficulty paying their mortgages. There is not much detail but in the results Lloyds said: “In May, the FCA informed the group that it was commencing an investigation in connection with the group’s mortgage arrears handling. At this stage it is not possible to make an assessment of the outcome of this ongoing review”. Lloyds did not take a provision for the payment protection misselling scandal. But in the first six months of the year the bank took a £460m to cover a range of so-called “conduct issues”. This included £215m “in respect of arrears related activities on secured and unsecured retail products, £70m in respect of complaints relating to packaged bank accounts and £50m related to insurance products sold in Germany”. In another worrying sign, a closely-watched survey of consumer confidence has hit its lowest level in three years after the Brexit vote. The monthly index conducted by YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) has tumbled to 106.6, the lowest since July 2013, down from 111.3. That’s the biggest one-month drop in six years. The survey found that the public are concerned about the impact of the June referendum, particularly on house prices (how very British!). Stephen Harmston, Head of YouGov Reports, says: “The public are still absorbing the EU referendum result but it is clear that consumer confidence has taken a significant and clear dive.” Spain is celebrating the news that the country’s jobless rate has hit its lowest level in six years, before the eurozone crisis began. However.... one in five adults are still out of work, and the situation could deteriorate if Europe’s economy suffers from Brexit. Royal Dutch Shell is one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning, down 3% after posting a 70% tumble in earnings. It blamed the recent tumble in crude oil prices, which have eaten into its profitability. CEO Ben van Beurden warned shareholders that “lower oil prices continue to be a significant challenge across the business.” Inchcape, the UK car dealership, has warned that demand for new cars is weakening, due to the Brexit vote. It told shareholders this morning: Ahead of the EU referendum, the second quarter New Vehicle market growth rate moderated to 1.0% from 5.1% in the first quarter. We expect this moderation of the New Vehicle market to persist into the second half of 2016. Building society Nationwide has reported that house prices were stable in July, rising 0.5% month-on-month. The average house cost £205,715, 5.2% higher than a year ago. However.... as mortgages are approved towards the end of the process, this doesn’t whether buyers have been spooked by the Brexit vote. Engineering firm Rolls-Royce is also cutting jobs, after reporting an 80% tumble in profits in the first half of 2016. Today’s losses mean Countrywide has shed a third of its value since the referendum, highlighting how the UK’s property sector will suffer from Brexit. It’s a bleak morning in the financial sector too, as Lloyds Banking Group slashes 3,000 jobs. The bank is speeding up its cost-cutting programme, and closing 200 branches as it enters a “period of uncertainty” following the Brexit vote. Our City editor Jill Treanor explains that Lloyds is also preparing for interest rates to be slashed next week: The bank is blaming changes to customer behaviour and anticipated cuts to interest rates following the vote for Brexit last month. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, signalled a rate cut would take place during the summer and the City now expects rates will be cut from their 0.5% historic low on 4 August. More here: And here’s Reuters’ take: Shares in Countrywide has dropped by almost 5% at the start of trading, following its Brexit-induced earnings warning. Britain’s biggest lettings and estate agent group has issued a stark warning that parts of the country’s property market are weakening, since last month’s referendum, Countrywide, which runs 50 different high street brands, admitted that profits this year will be lower than in 2015. And it pins the blame firmly on the decision to leave the EU. According to Countrywide there was a clear market slowdown in May and June. And since the vote, commercial and London residential transactions have stalled, it says, with a “less pronounced impact” on other operations. The number of homes sold subject to contract in London fell 29% in April-June, compared to January-March. Alison Platt, Countrywide’s CEO, says: As we stated in our last Trading Update on 26 April, we took a cautious view of the months leading up to the EU referendum and beyond. In the event, we saw a slowdown in our Retail and London residential businesses and, since the EU referendum result this has become more marked in London, the South East and expensive prime markets. The rest of the country has fared somewhat better and our Lettings business and mortgage trends have been largely unaffected. Countrywide also posted a 25% tumble in adjusted pretax profits for the first half of 2016, and warned of more challenges ahead. As Platt put it says: This period of uncertainty will inevitably impact the level of transactional activity in the second half of the year and, although it is too early to quantify accurately, we will not meet last year’s result at the EBITDA level. Here’s a round-up of Countrywide’s brands: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Five weeks after the European Union referendum, we’re now seeing signs that the vote to leave the EU is hitting the UK economy. Three influential surveys released overnight have shown worrying signs that Britain’s car industry, retail sector and building companies are all suffering from the Brexit vote. In a worrying cocktail, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said its members were gloomy about the prospects for growth, jobs and investment; the British Retail Consortium said jobs were being shed in the months leading up to the referendum; and RICS – the body that represents chartered surveyors – said workloads for construction had weakened. It’s a clear signal that the uncertainty created by June’s vote is starting to hit demand, confidence and activity. The SMMT’s chief executive, Mike Hawes warned that Britain’s car revival has been underpinned by “tariff-free access to the single market”, so losing that access would be a serious blow. Here’s the full story: This all rather takes the shine off yesterday’s forecast-beating growth figures, which showed the UK’s GDP expanded by 0.6% in the last quarter. Also coming up... Investors are pondering whether the US central bank might manage to raise interest rates soon, despite the Brexit risk. Last night, the Federal Reserve declared that the US jobs recovery had picked up momentum, and the near-term risks to the US economy had diminished. Intriguingly,the Fed also declared that: “Near-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished.” Perhaps a hint that the EU referendum hasn’t caused as much market mayhem as feared. Over in Paris, French energy company EDF is deciding whether to give the go-ahead for an £18bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The rumours are that the project will go ahead, despite concerns over cost and safety: And there’s a blizzard of corporate results this morning, sending my Reuters machine into overdrive as companies clear the decks before the August lull. That include Lloyds Banking Group, BT, Countrywide, Thomas Cook, Diageo, Rolls Royce, Royal Dutch Shell, BAE and Sky.

Now a range of tools are available to help bridge that gap. From initiatives using consumer pressure to tackle complex social issues to tools that aim to encourage investors to put their money into companies with a positive social impact, these projects attempt to measure and benchmark companies’ impact. But measuring issues such as women’s empowerment, land rights and community impacts is far from easy. What’s more, it’s hard to come up with standard, universal measurements. So how do these tools fare? Behind the Brands Oxfam’s Behind the Brands assesses the impact of “the Big 10” food and drink multinationals’ on the wellbeing of farmers, local communities and the environment. It looks at factors such as workers’ rights, women’s rights and land use, and applies a score based on publicly available documents for each brand’s awareness, knowledge, commitments and supply chain management. As a result of consumer pressure stemming from Behind the Brands, companies such as Coca-Cola are now asking suppliers to address land rights issues, says Oxfam’s interim head of policy and campaigns on food and climate justice, Erinch Sahan. “We’ve been engaging with some of those sugar-producing companies to help them do a community consultation. We’ve shared quite a bit of documentation on the principle of free, prior and informed consent, and we’ve seen that being implemented in various areas.” Unilever currently tops the Behind the Brands scorecard, while Associated British Foods comes last. Sahan says the majority of companies care about these issues, or have individuals working within the business who do. “There are others whose internal incentives are the opposite of what we’re trying to achieve because they are measured on how low-cost they can buy their commodities.” There is a danger with these initiatives that industries that do not deal directly with consumers are let off the hook. “That is something that keeps me up at night,” says Sahan. “Some of the most influential companies in the world don’t have that brand that forces them to care about these issues.” He points out, however, that the internet is starting to lift the lid on these companies. Social Stock Exchange Britain’s Social Stock Exchange (SSX) lists stock and bonds from companies deemed pro-social and pro-environmental, and aims to open up impact investing to retail investors. Each member company files an annual impact report with evidence of how its daily operations deliver social impact, including how it collects that evidence. An independent panel studies these reports and determines which companies are admitted to SSX. Launched in 2013, it has been slow getting off the ground, with just 12 member companies to date. Chief executive Tomas Carruthers says this is to be expected: “Planning new stock exchanges is really, really hard. We’re taking the time we’re taking to make sure that we have something viable.” Current member companies have dual listings on the Alternative Investment Market and SSX. As of January this year, companies will be able to float exclusively on SSX and Carruthers expects to at least double the number of member companies, although he is unwilling to say how long that will take. “We are in direct talks with about 20 separate advisers and companies; there’s a lot of interest,” he says. Membership of the SSX may help companies flag up social impact credentials when bidding for contracts. In the UK, legislation requires that any public sector organisation procuring goods or services must consider the social value of the companies they contract. Ashley House, a health and social care property company that is part of SSX, says membership is “an important differentiator in consultations with public decision-making bodies”. Carruthers says it would be impossible to evaluate the influence the SSX has had in terms of encouraging retail investors to trade in impactful companies. “Our aim is to build profile in as many different media and through as many different brokers as we can. We just want to make sure [member companies] are getting their story told and that they are finding the investment that they need.” FTSE4Good As well as a dedicated stock exchange, there are indices within larger stock exchanges to inform impact investors. FTSE launched its FTSE4Good series of indices in 2001 to measure the performance of companies demonstrating strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. The indices exclude companies from tobacco, nuclear power and arms industries, and remaining organisations are assessed against ESG criteria, including human rights and labour standards. In terms of financial performance, they have done well. The FTSE4Good UK Benchmark delivered an average 9.8% annual return over the past five years, compared with the FTSE All-Share, which delivered an average annual return of 9.4% over the same period. Sustainability experts are also relatively impressed with FTSE4Good, with 55% deeming it a “credible” rating in 2013. But Graham Randles, managing director of sustainability group NEF Consulting, is sceptical about its impact on business behaviour. “To what extent are they changing the way businesses behave to make them more sustainable, more focused on social or environmental impact? ... It does give some advantages to the organisations who are leading in their sectors to demonstrate that. But I don’t know if it changes much about how other organisations perform.” The Business and Wellbeing hub is funded by HP.

The prospect of closer co-operation between Putin’s Kremlin and a pariah state with realistic nuclear ambitions will dismay the US, Britain and other countries hoping to pressure Pyongyang into ditching its ambitions to become a nuclear power, and to dissuade Russia from fuelling the war in Ukraine. North Korean state media said the two countries had agreed to make 2015 a “year of friendship” to mark the 70th anniversary of “Korea’s liberation and the victory in the great Patriotic War in Russia” – references to the defeats of Japan and Nazi Germany in 1945. KCNA said the countries would “develop the bilateral relations on to a new higher stage in various fields, including politics, economy and culture under a mutual agreement”. The Russian foreign ministry said the agreement was designed to elevate ties “in the political, economic, humanitarian and other areas to a new level”. The Kremlin confirmed it had invited North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to visit Moscow on 9 May to mark the anniversary of the end of the second word war in Europe. The trip would be Kim’s first outside North Korea since he became leader of regime following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2011. The older Kim visited Russia in August 2011 in his armoured train for a meeting with then Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev. The friendship agreement was announced on the same day that officials in Berlin said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, would not attend the ceremony in Moscow – a snub believed to be in retaliation for Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in Ukraine. The leaders in Moscow and Pyongyang appear to have much in the way of common cause. The UN has targeted North Korea with sanctions since it tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006, and is applying pressure on the Kremlin to end its military involvement in Ukraine. The shift in North Korea’s diplomatic focus towards Russia has been accelerated by tensions with China, Pyongyang’s traditional ally and aid giver. China barely disguised its irritation with Kim after he ordered North Korea’s third nuclear test in 2013 and the execution later that year of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who had been instrumental in forging closer co-operation with Beijing. Chinese President Xi Jinping has yet to meet Kim; significantly, though, he has met South Korea’s president, Park Geun-hye, several times. In an apparent attempt to counter Russian influence, China has approved increased co-operation with North Korea along their border and indicated it would be willing to hold a bilateral summit. Xi and Kim could also find themselves face to face at the war commemorations in May. Putin would doubtless welcome the international opprobrium that would follow a public appearance alongside Kim in Moscow this spring. North Korea, meanwhile, stands to gain financially and militarily from closer ties with Russia. In 2014 Moscow cancelled almost US$10bn, or 90%, of North Korea’s bilateral debt and said it would invest the remaining $1.09bn – to be paid back over 20 years – in infrastructure projects such as a cross-border gas pipeline between Russia and the North, and a rail link to South Korea. Russia has also offered to invest $25bn in North Korea’s creaking rail network in return for access to mineral resources. It remains to be seen how a closer the Putin-Kim relationship will affect international attempts to end the North’s nuclear weapons programme. Talks involving North Korea, Russia, the US, China, South Korea and Japan to reach a nuclear deal have been stalled since 2009. North Korea is believed to possess between 10 and 16 nuclear weapons developed using plutonium or weapons-grade uranium. A recent report by US researchers warned that Pyongyang was poised to expand its nuclear programme over the next five years. A worst-case scenario would see it armed with as many as 100 nuclear weapons by end of the decade, the report said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2014/jul/02/greenpeace-india-narendra-modi-intelligence-report-charities-ngo","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-02T10:01:23Z","webTitle":"Greenpeace India fears charity crackdown under Narendra Modi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jul/02/greenpeace-india-narendra-modi-intelligence-report-charities-ngo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2014/jul/02/greenpeace-india-narendra-modi-intelligence-report-charities-ngo","fields":{"headline":"Greenpeace India fears charity crackdown under Narendra Modi","bodyText":"Emma Gibson, a Greenpeace campaigner from Kent who participated in the Kingsnorth power station protest in 2009, has been worried she could be deported from India ever since an intelligence report accusing several foreign-funded NGOs of stalling major infrastructure projects was leaked this month. The intelligence bureau (IB) report was submitted to Narendra Modi days after he took over as prime minister. Modi won last month's general election on an aggressive development plank. He had risen to national prominence due to his encouragement of big business in his home state, Gujarat, where he acquired the image of a strong, no-nonsense leader. Although Modi has made no comment, the anti-NGO report by the national intelligence agency listing dozens of organisations and individuals was circulated to several ministries, and raised the spectre of a general crackdown on these organisations. Gibson's name is on one of the lists, but there has been no midnight knock. She returned to the UK of her own accord on Sunday. Greenpeace India, however, has been singled out for action. Although it is a registered charity permitted to receive donations from abroad, Greenpeace India must now seek the home ministry's permission before it accepts donations from two sources – its parent international body and the US-based Climate Works Foundation. \"Greenpeace India has clarified that most of its funds (61%) come from 300,00 individual Indian donors, and the rest almost entirely from Greenpeace International,\" Gibson said. \"The IB report is riddled with inaccuracies. It called me a cyber security expert, which is laughable. The report is designed to cause huge damage, but much more than Greenpeace, it's the smaller NGOs that are absolutely terrified.\" Official hostility toward NGOs campaigning on environmental, land rights or anti-nuclear issues is not new. Modi's predecessor, Manmohan Singh, openly complained that foreign-funded NGOs were blocking the expansion of nuclear power and the introduction of genetically modified products. But it is Modi's image as a muscular leader that has raised fears of a clampdown. \"The government is adopting scare tactics,\" said Suhas Chakma, director of the Asian Centre for Human Rights. \"It wants to ensure that nobody comes in the way of big projects.\" The authorities, it appears, are taking no chances – even foreign academics and researchers who have been working for decades to help India's poor and dispossessed have come under suspicion. A day after the intelligence report on NGOs hit the headlines, a British academic from Birkbeck College, London, arriving in Hyderabad to attend a conference organised by the International Federation of Ageing, was turned away at the airport. Penny Vera-Senso, a social anthropologist researching poverty and ageing in India since 1990, was given no reason for the ban on her entry, but was told she could not apply for a new visa until 2016. She was last in India in March, when she attended a Right to Food convention in Gujarat and put up a photographic exhibition on old people at work. \"Penny has a passion for old people, and has done a lot of good work to show that the aged can also contribute to the Indian economy,\" Harsh Mander, head of the Centre for Equity Studies in Delhi, said. \"The Right to Food convention was a very big one, and some speakers criticised the Gujarat model of development, which an intelligence official might have construed as anti-national activity. Penny's presence was obviously noticed at the meeting. But her work is very focused on poverty and ageing, so this is nothing but plain intimidation.\" The intelligence report damning NGOs appears equally slipshod. It claims that \"people-centric\" campaigns organised by NGOs blocked projects in seven sectors – nuclear power, uranium mining, thermal and hydroelectric power, farm biotechnology, extractive industries, and mega industrial projects. The objective was to keep India in \"a state of underdevelopment\". The report then goes on to make the unsupported claim that India's annual GDP growth rate fell by 2-3% because of NGO campaigns between 2011 and 2013. It does not assess the impact of grassroots campaigns in relation to other factors that impacted the political economy – the policy paralysis in government, the corruption and mismanagement, and some keen judicial scrutiny. NGOs have also had some major failures. Despite significant local support, for instance, the agitation to stop the nuclear power project in Kudunkulam, southern Tamil Nadu, state failed. Across the peninsula, in Maharashtra, another nuclear power project has failed to take off due to opposition not so much from NGOs but from a political party, the Shiv Sena, which is part of Modi's government in Delhi. But NGOs are clearly worried. The anti-nuclear campaigner Achin Vinaik said: \"We are fearful that this is a kind of witchhunt with longer term implications to repress all kinds of popular struggles.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2015/jul/29/hillary-clinton-climate-change-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-29T19:50:36Z","webTitle":"Hillary Clinton's climate change plan 'just plain silly', says leading expert","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/29/hillary-clinton-climate-change-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2015/jul/29/hillary-clinton-climate-change-plan","fields":{"headline":"Hillary Clinton's climate change plan 'just plain silly', says leading expert","bodyText":"Hillary Clinton’s pledge on Sunday to support renewable energy and boost subsidies for solar panels was set up as a great unveiling – the Democratic frontrunner’s first public remarks on how her presidency would tackle climate change. “I personally believe climate change is a challenge of such magnitude and urgency that we need a president who will set ambitious goals,” she said in a video posted to her campaign website. It wasn’t difficult to draw a sigh of relief from the progressive electorate that has heard only climate change denial – loud and triumphal – from Republican frontrunners. (Ted Cruz proudly announced in May that he had just come from New Hampshire, where there was “ice and snow everywhere”. Trump took up the issue with typical savoir faire on Monday, declining to call climate change by name: “I call it weather.”) But for many who study climate change, Clinton’s proposal lacked the ambition and sense of urgency appropriate to the scale of the problem. In her initial policy proposal, Clinton pledged tax incentives that would help install half a billion solar panels nationwide within four years of taking office. She also pledged that the US would generate enough renewable energy to power every home in the country by 2027. Environmentalist Bill McKibben said that while Clinton’s support for solar was necessary, it was far from a comprehensive energy policy. “Much of the impact of her climate plan was undercut the next day by her unwillingness to talk about the supply side of the equation,” he said. “Ducking questions about the Canadian tar sands or drilling in the Arctic makes everyone worry we’re going to see eight more years of an ‘all of the above’ energy strategy, which is what we do not need to hear in the hottest year ever measured on our planet.” McKibben is not alone in criticizing Clinton’s energy policy for sounding like too little too late. “It’s just plain silly,” said James Hansen, a climate change researcher who headed Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies for over 30 years. “No, you cannot solve the problem without a fundamental change, and that means you have to make the price of fossil fuels honest. Subsidizing solar panels is not going to solve the problem.” Last Thursday, Hansen, along with 16 prominent climate change scientists, published a discussion paper in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, where it will be publicly peer-reviewed. The paper suggests that previous models for climate change are too conservative and that a sea level rise of several meters might swallow up our coasts in this century, if governments fail to rapidly and substantially diminish fossil fuel emissions. “The economic and social cost of losing functionality of all coastal cities is practically incalculable,” the authors wrote. The paper was rushed to publication in an attempt to get out in front of the Paris climate talks in December, where nations are invited to bring proposals that might curtail global warming. Hansen said the problem climate experts face is that no prominent politician in the US has backed policy that has any shot at preventing an average of 2C (3.6F) of warming in this century, a widely agreed upon point of no return for climate change. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) a global temperature rise of great than 2C would result in irreversible damage to society, including “increasingly dangerous forest fires, extreme weather, drought” as well as other compounding climate impacts. Despite commitments to combat climate change, under Barack Obama the US became the largest oil-producing nation in 2012, overtaking Saudi Arabia and Russia, by producing at full capacity. “We have two political parties, neither one of which is willing to face reality,” said Hansen, who now heads up the Climate Science, Awareness and Solutions Program at Columbia University. “Conservatives pretend it’s all a hoax, and liberals propose solutions that are non-solutions.” Clinton’s outline would put the US on track to supply 33% of the country’s electricity needs through renewables by 2027. That’s a mere 8% improvement over Obama’s plan. It’s not enough, according to Hansen. Renewables are a part of how the US will wean itself off fossil fuels, but the market has to be allowed to determine which combination of renewable fuels – not just solar – makes the most sense in each region. “You can’t just legislate that,” said Hansen. Clinton’s plan “is going to make energy more expensive. You need to let energy efficiency and renewables and nuclear power and anything else that comes up compete.” Hansen emphasized that whatever domestic policy we adopt towards climate change has to have a global reach, a key point absent in the solar proposal. “In places like China and India, they have to move off of coal for electricity pretty rapidly or the world is screwed.” Hansen said a credible candidate on climate change would be talking about policy that would allow the price of fossil fuels to rise gradually. “You have to recognize that as long as fossil fuels appear to be the cheapest energy, we’ll just keep burning them,” he said. Hansen said that a president committed to halting climate change would implement a gradually rising fee for fossil fuel extraction, collected from the fossil fuel companies at the domestic mine or port of entry. In order to keep the policy revenue-neutral, the fee would be evenly distributed back to US citizens in the form of a tax dividend, completely offsetting the rise in energy costs for most consumers. Those with large carbon footprints – like the very rich, with multiple large homes, for example – would bear the brunt. In that way, market forces would be allowed to let renewables compete and lower the cost of clean energy. To incentivize other countries to do the same, Hansen said, the US would have to impose equivalent tariffs on imports from countries without a carbon fee. “It would take a few decades,” said Hansen. “But you could rapidly phase down emissions.” Michael Oppenheimer, professor of Geosciences and International Affairs at Princeton University, who advised the Clinton campaign informally on its energy proposal, said the solar plan has to be part of a larger scheme to “crack the back of fossil fuels”. Oppenheimer took issue with Hansen’s climate change paper in the Washington Post last week for lacking specifics on how rapidly sea levels would rise, but he said there’s no doubt “humanity better get its collective foot off the accelerator”. Oppenheimer, a longtime participant in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said a combination of a strong set of incentives like solar credits have to be supported by regulation: “Just as a solar program, it is very good and it is ambitious. If you look at the bigger picture – which is, what are we going to do on the whole about fossil fuels and reducing and eliminating eventually our dependence on them? – that’s a larger question. “What we don’t have here yet is what is the regulatory scheme going beyond the Obama scheme,” said Oppenheimer. “In fact, we’re going to have to accelerate the downward track if we’re going to beat the climate problem. “That discussion needs to be engaged – and engaged quickly. I hope it’s engaged during the campaign.” Bernie Sanders is so far the only prominent political candidate to oppose the oil pipeline Keystone XL, but he has yet to present an official energy proposal to address climate change. The candidate to keep us from 2C warming? “That candidate has not yet appeared,” said Hansen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/apr/03/uneasy-arab-world-gives-iran-nuclear-framework-a-cautious-welcome","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-03T13:37:01Z","webTitle":"Uneasy Arab world gives Iran nuclear framework a cautious welcome","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/03/uneasy-arab-world-gives-iran-nuclear-framework-a-cautious-welcome","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/apr/03/uneasy-arab-world-gives-iran-nuclear-framework-a-cautious-welcome","fields":{"headline":"Uneasy Arab world gives Iran nuclear framework a cautious welcome","bodyText":"Saudi Arabia has given a qualified public welcome to the US-led nuclear agreement with Iran, saying it hopes a final deal will strengthen stability and security in the Middle East and beyond. Its cautious response suggests it is not convinced that will prove to be the case. State media reported on Friday that King Salman had conveyed the carefully-worded message during a telephone conversation with Barack Obama, maintaining the kingdom’s position of avoiding an open confrontation with the US while warning about, and confronting, Iran’s regional ambitions. The Saudi Press Agency (SPA) also pointedly said that Obama had raised the issue of the crisis in Yemen, where the Saudis are leading a military intervention against Houthi rebels they say are backed by Tehran, with the goal of restoring President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power. The US is supporting operation Decisive Storm, as is Britain. Salman “expressed his hope that reaching a final binding deal would strengthen the stability and security of the region and the world,” the SPA reported. Oman, the Gulf state politically closest to Iran, which brokered secret nuclear talks between Washington and Tehran in 2012, hailed the Lausanne agreement as historic. Riyadh has signalled in the past that it might seek nuclear warheads from its ally Pakistan if Tehran were to develop them. It has had to accept, however, that Obama’s goal is to prevent proliferation and, unlike Israel, has refrained from open criticism of the emerging deal. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the Gulf’s hawks, fear Iran’s international rehabilitation through the nuclear agreement will ease its political and economic isolation and embolden its designs in the Arab world. They will be pressing hard to ensure that Washington keeps up pressure on Iran on other fronts, diplomats say. It is commonly said, with considerable exaggeration, that Tehran now controls four Arab capitals: Damascus, where it is helping keep President Bashar al-Assad in power; Beirut, where its ally Hezbollah is a powerful force; Baghdad, where Iran is helping the Shia-led government fight Islamic State jihadis; and now Sana’a in Yemen. Obama said on Thursday that he had invited Gulf leaders to a spring summit at Camp David to discuss security cooperation, a sign he knows he will need to work hard to keep the Saudis and their partners on side. Another pointer to changing US priorities was that the president called King Salman before speaking to the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. The six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) comprises Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain. Qatar, like Oman, has cordial ties with Iran. Egypt, which is taking part in the Yemeni intervention, shares Saudi views. Sami al-Faraj, a Kuwaiti security advisor to the GCC, expressed unease at the deal. “If Iran ever gets away with possessing a nuclear capability one day, we will consider the international community responsible for that at these negotiations,” he said. “We will feel free to go and look for a counterweight.” Other Arab governments did not comment publicly on the agreement, perhaps because Friday is a holiday. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said he “hoped the parties will reach a final agreement by 1 July”, but said Iran must do more to achieve this objective. Sir William Patey, a former British ambassador to Riyadh, said this week that Saudi Arabia faced a dilemma over the nuclear issue. “They don’t want Iran to become a nuclear power and they will be as sceptical as the Israelis are as to whether this is going to be a real deal. On the other hand they won’t want to be forced into making a difficult decision. “They will be sceptical but they won’t be critical and they will learn to manage. Their worst fears won’t be realised. There will be all sorts of obstacles to the sort of Iranian-American relations that the Saudis fear. If Iran could be brought into a regional security arrangement that’s something they would learn to adjust to.” Obama “said our disagreements with Iran on its political behaviour and its using proxies to destabilise the region, that’s still there,” the Saudi political scientist Khaled al-Dakhil told Reuters. “And the sanctions related to these differences will remain in place. If that’s the case, as it looks now, then I believe the agreement will be acceptable to the Saudis.” Media in the UAE reported that key economic sectors – re-exports, logistics, retail, banking and insurance – are already looking ahead to sanctions easing after June and Iran’s return to business as usual, especially in Dubai."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/mar/30/truth-behind-costa-rica-renewable-energy-reservoirs-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-30T14:16:29Z","webTitle":"The truth behind Costa Rica’s renewable energy | Lindsay Fendt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/30/truth-behind-costa-rica-renewable-energy-reservoirs-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/30/truth-behind-costa-rica-renewable-energy-reservoirs-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"The truth behind Costa Rica’s renewable energy","bodyText":"This month, Costa Rica’s state-run electricity company announced that the country had gone 75 days using only renewable resources for electricity. Costa Ricans are the first in the world to power their country for so long without the use of fossil fuels, and the record-breaking achievement was quickly picked up by news agencies all over the world. Costa Rican residents have certainly benefited from the clean energy, with electricity prices set to tumble between 7% and 15% in April. But despite the world’s congratulatory backslaps for the renowned green country, its clean energy production is not likely to last at this scale, nor is it a model that would work in many other parts of the world. Costa Rica gets most of its electricity from hydroelectric plants and a recent period of unusually heavy rain allowed the country to reach the milestone. This clean power is bolstered by geothermic energy from the country’s volcanoes and a small amount of wind and solar power. Most years, these sources allow Costa Rica to generate approximately 90% of its electricity without burning fossil fuels. The abundance of natural resources, combined with Costa Rica’s strong commitment to environmentalism, spurred policymakers to set a goal for carbon neutrality by 2021. If Costa Rica meets the target, it will likely become the first carbon-neutral country in the world, but there are obstacles. The downside to hydropower is that it requires consistent rainfall. Though the dams in Costa Rica are now full, just months ago the country was suffering one of the worst droughts in its history. This forced Costa Rican utility companies to burn fuel to generate power, releasing greenhouse gases and causing rate rises. This unpredictability in rain patterns isn’t unique to Costa Rica and is considered to be one of the primary effects of climate change. Ironically, this means that the bulging reservoirs that gave Costa Rica its green energy surge are likely to be attributable, at least partially, to climate change. And while there is plenty of clean power today, it could just as easily be gone tomorrow. Even if Costa Rica were able to sustain 100% clean electricity production, the country still relies on petroleum for transportation, and emissions from this sector are the largest hurdle the country faces in reaching its carbon neutrality goal. The environment ministry reports that fuel burned by cars, buses and trains accounted for almost 70% of the country’s carbon emissions in 2014. According to customs there are only 200 or so hybrid cars in Costa Rica to take advantage of the energy produced by renewables on the grid. The fact that even a country like Costa Rica, which has made major investments to produce clean energy, still struggles with these obstacles, shows just how difficult it would be for larger, more industrialised nations to follow in its footsteps. With a population under 5 million and no major industry, Costa Rica uses much less power than most developed countries, and its geography of tightly packed volcanoes, rivers and mountains is more suited to producing clean power than most. Though small, Costa Rica is able to produce enough energy to power itself while leaving much of its wilderness intact. To tap into all of the natural resources in the rest of the world would require environmental loss of a different kind, by altering rivers, displacing people and animals, and destroying vegetation. Solar and nuclear power offer other alternatives for clean energy but need more research and investment to make them cost-effective and safe. Even if it were possible to power the world’s largest countries with renewable energy, the destruction required would be unfathomable with only the current technologies. These limitations, along with a lack of political will, are what has meant the world relied on fossil fuels for almost 90% of its energy since 1999. As admirable as Costa Rica’s feats in energy production may be, its model is not realistic for the world’s largest energy consumers. But what most of the industrialised world lacks in natural resources, it more than makes up for with other assets. To seriously make a difference in global energy consumption would require significant investment in the research and design of new sources of non-polluting energy, a task most easily funded by richer nations. While the world may not be able to tailor its energy programmes to Costa Rica’s geography-specific model, the lesson here is not about science and infrastructure, but about volition and ideals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/blog/2014/sep/01/doomed-earth-science-fiction-climate-reality","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-01T16:50:46Z","webTitle":"A doomed Earth of science fiction may well become a reality","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2014/sep/01/doomed-earth-science-fiction-climate-reality","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2014/sep/01/doomed-earth-science-fiction-climate-reality","fields":{"headline":"A doomed Earth of science fiction may well become a reality","bodyText":"27 months and counting There’s a scene in the newly-restored science fiction classic The Day the Earth Caught Fire (premiered last week in the summer open air cinema at the British Museum) when The Daily Express’s fictional, bull-nosed science reporter, Bill Maguire, barks at a newsroom junior to fetch him information on the melting points of various substances. It’s to illustrate a spread in the paper which is investigating how massive nuclear tests have shifted the planet on its axis, causing chaotic weather and a heat wave to slowly marinate London. The screening launched the British Films Institute’s Sci-Fi season, whose light-hearted tone was set with kitsch alien facemasks given to the audience. A giant promotional selfie was taken before the film began. At the end, the friend I’d watched it with, who works for an official environmental body, went very quiet. “Do you know what I’ve been doing in the last few days?” she asked rhetorically. “Looking into the melting points of various substances in the event of worsening heat waves hitting London.” We both went quiet then. Research into heat thresholds shows what happens when science fiction becomes science fact. At 20C legionalla bacteria start developing in normal drinking water. At 24C London Underground start work to prevent track buckling. Less than a degree more, at 24.7C for a two-day duration, and deaths and hospital admissions rise. An estimated 600 more people died in London than usual during the 2003 heat wave. Even well-insulated houses overheat at 27C. Power cables start getting hit at around 30C and the likelihood of power outages for businesses goes up. At 33C road surfaces begin to soften and melt. For comparison, in the 2003 heat wave, there were air temperatures recorded on the tubes and platforms of 41.5C and 36.2C respectively. The UK’s highest outdoor daytime temperature recorded so far was 38.5C, outside London in Gravesend, Kent. There’s a key moment in the film when the characters realise something serious is happening because the authorities make plans to cut the mains water supply and set up communal drinking and washing facilities. A real 2011 report on adapting to climate change by a group within the Committee on Climate Change looked at the impact of different scenarios for global warming on London’s water supply. The gap between water supply and demand in London is growing regardless. The report shows planned options for compulsory meters, a new reservoir at Abingdon, transferring water at Longdon Marsh and other measures. But in the worst case scenario (and actual global greenhouse gas emissions are indeed jumping off the worst case scenarios), taking account of all the suggested measures, a presentation based on the report notes that, a “combination of the three adaptation pathways do not address the extreme deficit” of water supply. Science fiction’s typical, clever conceit is that it’s not really about fantastical futures at all. Instead, it offers a magnified version of the present that better allows us to see ourselves, and the patterns and implications of our current behaviour and technology. The American author Kurt Vonnegut was masterful at this, but you can see it readily in the work of countless other writers who use the genre from Margaret Atwood to William Gibson and Philip K Dick. In Vonnegut’s satirical Galapagos all that is left of humanity a million years in the future are sleek, furry creatures with flippers and small brains. Civilisation ended, triggered by economic collapse and people becoming redundant as a result of the inventions of their previously large brains. The survivors evolved from a handful who managed to climb aboard a cruise ship, the Bahia de Darwin, embarking on the ‘Nature Cruise of the Century’ to the Galapagos Islands. Our tragic flaw, wrote Vonnegut, is that when we are comfortable we’re slow to acknowledge any trouble we might be in. And, “the people who were best informed about the state of the planet ... and rich and powerful enough to slow down all the waste and destruction going on, were by definition well fed. So everything was always just fine as far as they were concerned.” In Vonnegut’s posthumously published Armageddon in Retrospect he notes that the United States should have had a ‘secretary of the future.’ Back in the film, responding to bland assurances that officialdom will sort things out and realising the impossibility of escape, one character quips with bitter sarcasm, ‘Oh, we’ll all jump in a spaceship and go live on the moon.’ The unreality of our own time in the face of accelerating exploitation of natural resources (this year humanity went into ecological debt around 19 August) is that some see relocation as a serious option, or mining the moon, or asteroids, as a practical way of ignoring Earth’s planetary boundaries. That won’t help when, for example, the latest research shows we have only around a quarter of our primary, life-sustaining, intact forests left – only 5% of which is protected – and when forests are being lost at an astonishing rate. The Day the Earth Caught Fire was made in 1961, in the early days of the consumer age, since then much of the ecological damage from over-consumption and the burning of fossil fuels has been done. It held up a mirror to the nuclear threat (even if to a modern viewer it feels like you’re watching a film about global warming) and, in doing so, became part of the cultural backlash that helped restrain one kind of Armageddon. The actual plot may have been wildly inventive, but it was justified in getting people to see a massive nuclear experiment in perspective and grasp its implications. One extraordinary coincidence could not have been planned. The film’s hard-bitten voice of reason, Bill Maguire, has a real life namesake: Bill McGuire, emeritus professor of geophysical and climate hazards at University College London. The latter, real McGuire, is also a science writer. His latest book, Waking the Giant, provides a factual, scientific case for how global warming can even trigger earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanoes. Who needs science fiction with reality like this? What mirror now will allow us to see and grasp the sheer voraciousness and prejudice with which we are altering the climate and undermining our life-supporting ecosystems? How many in the film’s modern audience left that warm summer evening marvelling mostly at the novelty of the clear archive footage of 1960s London, and how many left with something very different, the prickly unease that they were real, active characters living through an uncannily recognisable scenario to the one they had just watched, in which the outcome is just as precariously balanced? McGuire also writes a column Doomwatch for the science magazine Focus. The film ends with the fictional Bill Maguire having produced two versions of the next day’s paper, depending on the outcome of their efforts to avert catastrophe. One headline reads ‘World Saved’, the other ‘World Doomed.’ We are left not knowing which gets printed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/may/22/manga-fukishima-cleanup-becomes-hit-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2014-05-22T11:27:36Z","webTitle":"Manga about Fukushima cleanup operation becomes hit in Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/22/manga-fukishima-cleanup-becomes-hit-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/may/22/manga-fukishima-cleanup-becomes-hit-japan","fields":{"headline":"Manga about Fukushima cleanup operation becomes hit in Japan","bodyText":"Like many of the thousands of men who have worked at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant over the past three years, Kazuto Tatsuta was driven by a sense of mission. \"I had been looking for work around the time of the disaster and wondered if there was anything I could do to help the region,\" Tatsuta said. After six months working for one of the myriad subcontractors at Fukushima Daiichi, his exposure to radiation was already nearing the legal annual limit of 20 millisieverts, so he resigned. He left with a rare insight into the realities of life at arguably the world's most hazardous industrial cleanup site. Now he has framed his memories in graphic form in 1F (Ichi-Efu), a new manga whose publication comes as Japan debates the future of its dozens of mothballed nuclear reactors. As an insider's account, 1F: The Labour Diary of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, has proved popular among readers seeking an antidote to patchy information from the government and the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), and at times wildly speculative media reports. Drawing on a cast of characters loosely based on his former workmates, Tatsuta leaves nothing to the imagination. There are accounts of workers' early-morning journey to the plant from their digs in nearby towns and cities, and intricate illustrations of the protective clothing they must change into, and remove, every day. The brisk dialogue is replete with vocabulary and work practices only an insider could know. As they start their shifts, workers tell each other to \"be safe\"; the manga's abridged title, 1F, is the little-known nickname given Fukushima Daiichi by workers and local people. Tatsuta says he did not consider his work dangerous and, despite the rigours of spending hours in protective clothing and a full-face mask, he never thought about quitting. His most uncomfortable moments, he said, were being unable to urinate while sheathed in his radiation suit. Although Tatsuta was unable to take notes or sketch scenes while at work, those who have visited the plant will attest to the accuracy of every painstakingly reproduced scene, from the layout of the rest areas where he worked to the abandoned neighbourhoods that encircle the stricken plant. \"I had done some work as a manga artist before then, but I didn't apply for the Fukushima job with the intention of writing a manga,\" Tatsuta, 49, told the Guardian at his studio outside Tokyo. He first considered writing a manga soon after he left the plant in late 2012. He drew and wrote the first chapter and started knocking on publishers' doors, but failed to find an editor who was interested until he approached Kodansha. \"We could see straight away that it was highly original,\" said Kenichiro Shinohara, editor of Morning, a weekly manga magazine in which 1F first appeared in serialised form last autumn. \"It's surpassed our expectations and has obviously caught the attention of people who don't usually read manga.\" The initial print run of 150,000 copies was unusually large for a work by a relatively unknown manga artist, yet sales have been brisk since it appeared in book form at the end of April. Kodansha said there were plans for editions in English, French and German. But readers looking to Tatsuta for confirmation that the Daiichi cleanup has been left largely in the hands of unscrupulous firms with links to organised crime, and that workers are sent into dangerous areas with minimal training and substandard equipment, may be disappointed. \"As a group and as individuals, I found them all to be decent people,\" Tatsuta said. \"I don't have a profound message to give the reader, other than to point out that these are men who are doing their best to get the job done away from the limelight. Politicians and experts are always on TV debating Fukushima, but the workers have no voice. I hope to give them one through my manga.\" Tepco posts regular updates about progress in key areas of Fukushima Daiichi and invites groups of journalists to tour the facility several times a year, yet there is much about the work of the 3,000-plus men who work in shifts at the plant that remains hidden. \"The media have left a gap in people's understanding,\" said Tatsuta, who prefers not to reveal his face or his real name as he hasn't ruled out a return to the plant and wants to show solidarity with his \"anonymous\" workmates. \"We hear a lot about what the media are privy to – the water storage problem, the removal or fuel assemblies and the like – but what I hope to do is to tell people about things that the media never see.\" Drawing entirely from memory, Tatsuta takes the reader on a virtual tour of the areas where exhausted men eat and rest, the filling stations that service hundreds of trucks, buses and cars carrying workers and equipment, and the construction site for yet more tanks to relieve the buildup of contaminated water. He suggests that there is truth, though, in reports that many of the labourers are exploited. Tatsuta answered a job advertisement promising 20,000 yen (£117) a day, yet initially earned less than half that. And he shares concerns that as more skilled workers leave because they have reached their radiation exposure limit, finding enough replacements to push forward with decommissioning will become more difficult. Like the small number of contract workers who have spoken to the media about their experiences at Fukushima Daiichi, Tatsuta recalls his time there as a mixture of drudgery and camaraderie. \"The labourers at Fukushima get a bad press, which I think is unfair,\" he said. \"They're depicted as rough, but they are no different from the workers you would find on an ordinary building site in Tokyo.\""},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2015/jan/05/windfarm-closed-until-cause-of-collapsed-turbine-is-found","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-05T13:59:32Z","webTitle":"Windfarm closed until cause of collapsed turbine is found","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/05/windfarm-closed-until-cause-of-collapsed-turbine-is-found","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jan/05/windfarm-closed-until-cause-of-collapsed-turbine-is-found","fields":{"headline":"Windfarm closed until cause of collapsed turbine is found","bodyText":"A wind farm in Northern Ireland will not re-open until an investigation reveals why an 80-metre wind turbine collapsed on a mountainside. The only previous time that one of the UK’s almost 4,800 commercial-scale turbines has toppled was in 2007 in Scotland. No-one was injured in either case. The turbine which collapsed on Friday evening, in winds of about 25mph, was one of eight in the Screggagh windfarm near Fintona in County Tyrone. The remaining seven have been shut down until the investigation is completed. The turbine, worth over £500,000, appears to have buckled near the base of its 80m tower causing its three 40m blades to hit the hillside. Doreen Walker, director of the £26m windfarm, which opened in March 2011, said: “The wind farm will remain shut down until [turbine supplier] Nordex UK Ltd has completed a full investigation in to the remaining seven wind turbines and confirms that they are safe to operate.” “There were fortunately no injuries and no personnel on site at the time.” Walker said. “We are satisfied that the site’s precautionary health and safety alert processes worked well with local emergency services in attendance within minutes of the incident taking place.” Local reports suggest the rotor blades spun out of control, with the sound of the turbine crashing to the ground heard up to seven miles away. Some people claimed to have heard the sound of metal grinding throughout the day. In 2009, a 20m blade flew off a turbine in Lincolnshire, prompting theories of meteorite strikes and even UFOs. An investigation later showed that bolts attaching the blade to the hub had failed, while lights seen in the sky were probably fireworks. In 2007, a 63m turbine in Kintyre ended up bent in two after a suspected braking problem. The wind industry’s trade body, RenewableUK, said there have also been five recorded collapses of small turbines installed by farmers on their own land. These turbines were on average 25m tall and no-one was injured. RenewableUK’s director of health and safety, Chris Streatfeild, said: “A thorough investigation is already underway into what happened in this extremely rare incident. The wind industry takes health and safety issues very seriously. There’s a rigorous process in place to ensure that installation standards are adhered to strictly, including a detailed risk assessment so that every turbine is sited in a safe place.” The single collapsed Screggagh wind turbine provided annual electricity equivalent to that used by about 1,500 homes. Failures at coal, gas and nuclear power plants take much larger amounts of energy off the grid at short notice. In October, a fire at RWE’s gas-fired power station at Didcot in Oxfordshire led to the near-instant loss of electricity equivalent to 500,000 homes. In August, nuclear operator EDF shut down four of its reactors for months after a crack was found in a boiler."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/jun/28/islamic-terror-france-beheading","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-27T23:08:02Z","webTitle":"French terrorist attack: mystery of ‘calm and gentle’ man who beheaded his boss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/28/islamic-terror-france-beheading","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/jun/28/islamic-terror-france-beheading","fields":{"headline":"French terrorist attack: mystery of ‘calm and gentle’ man who beheaded his boss","bodyText":"“Again,” they were saying in Lyon on Saturday, with an air of incredulity. “It’s happened again.” Just six months after the massacres at Charlie Hebdo and a kosher grocery shop, France finds itself struggling to comprehend another atrocity in its midst. The severed head of a businessman hung on a factory gate on Friday brought the horror of Isis-style beheadings in Syria, Libya and Iraq to a quiet corner of the Rhône-Alpes region. Yassin Salhi, a truck driver with a history of radical Islamic ties, is in custody in Lyon, after allegedly murdering his employer, Hervé Cornara, and crashing a truck into a US-owned chemical warehouse. He isn’t speaking to investigators. One of the other three suspects detained has been released. Paris prosecutor’s office spokeswoman Agnès Thibault-Lecuivre said investigators have not yet established a motive or any link with Islamist terrorist groups. In the centre of Lyon, a Unesco-listed city on the Rhône, there was disbelief that such a grotesque act of terrorism could have been visited on the region. Newspapers carried anguished editorials discussing how France should confront the first decapitation as an act of terrorism on its own soil. “We are not used to seeing this here,” read a headline in Le Progrès. And yet, despite the shockingly barbaric nature of what happened, some things were very familiar about Friday’s attack centred on a chemical plant some 40km (25 miles) from the city centre. As with previous attacks in Europe, Salhi had crossed the radar of the intelligence services. A Salafi – a follower of the radical strain of Islam regularly linked to extremism – the 35-year-old had been on a watchlist between 2006 and 2008. In Saint-Priest, a suburb of Lyon, where he had lived for the past six months in a nondescript flat in a four-storey block, neighbours described him as a typical member of the community who liked to play football in the street with his three children. “They are a very normal family,” said a neighbour who gave her name as Brigitte. “I only talked with madame; he didn’t say hello or goodbye,” the 46-year-old housewife told Reuters. But it now appears that Salhi, who was born in France to immigrant parents, was radicalised before he arrived in Lyon. In the eastern town of Besançon, where he lived for several years, he fell in with a fervently Islamist crowd. A former friend said he started talking about Islamic State “but only to ask my opinion, not to praise them”. Salhi lost weight, grew a beard and started spending time with younger men, mainly teenagers, dressed in khaki and black. They would spend hours discussing Mali, where French troops were stationed on peacekeeping duties. One neighbour became so worried at the change in Salhi she called the police to warn that he was being radicalised. This weekend the hunt was on for those who had turned a man whom a former colleague recalled as “always gentle and calm” into a killer. According to his security services file, Salhi had attended a radical mosque in Lyon in 2006. There is speculation among some Muslims in the city that he had fallen under the influence of “Grand Ali”, an extremist imam of mythical status in the region. If such a character exists, he is not short of recruits. The Rhône region is considered by terrorism experts to be one of France’s top five breeding grounds for radicalisation. Several Muslim men told the Observer that a small group of Salafis had been attempting a “land grab” on the city’s mosques in the past couple of years. “They are trying to take them over,” one man said. “They have targeted four mosques. They are turning people against each other. They are not true Muslims.” Yesterday Salhi’s neighbours were forced to contemplate the unwelcome attention their suburb had brought. “We do not need this here,” said one woman. “This is only going to create fear.” Around her several people nodded, but most refused to talk. Local people were not so cowed online. Many posted messages expressing disbelief that someone known to the security services was not being monitored more closely. The authorities estimate that hundreds of French citizens have gone to fight in Iraq and Syria, and monitoring those who return is stretching them to breaking point. What hope, experts ask, is there of monitoring the lone wolves who show no indication that they will turn murderous? However, the Lyon attack fits an increasingly familiar pattern. In 2012 a spate of attacks carried out by Mohamed Merah, a 23-year-old petty criminal, resulted in the murders of three soldiers and four people, three of them Jewish children, in the south-west of the country. In April, the prime minister, Manuel Valls, revealed that five attacks had been thwarted in the country since the Charlie Hebdo attack, including one on a church near Paris when a man armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle was planning to fire on the congregation. But Friday’s attack marks an alarming new direction. The attempt to blow up a chemicals company may have been clumsy in execution, but it represents a chilling broadening of ambition. This weekend, security at France’s nuclear power plants, electricity substations and other sensitive targets was being stepped up, with thousands of police and soldiers assigned to new protective roles. Meanwhile, Lyon’s Muslim population fears that the attack will exacerbate racial tensions at a difficult time. France has witnessed a rise in Islamophobic and antisemitic attacks in recent months and the far right has been quick to make political capital out of the tragedy. The Front National attacked the government for doing “nothing” to combat fundamentalist Islam and warned that the country was at risk because of an “immigration invasion”. It was difficult to square such alarmism with the scene in Lyon yesterday. In the baking sunshine, people enjoyed long lunches. The parks were full of children laughing. And yet the city’s residents know they must ask themselves how, just the day before, a man from one of their suburbs came to decapitate another human being before turning himself into a human bomb. In a Turkish restaurant on the Rue Pailleron, Jacques sipped a coffee. He was 63 and has lived in Lyon most of his life. Was he concerned by what was happening? He shook his head and repeated what many politicians had said in the previous 24 hours: “We must not give way to fear.” He repeated the phrase several times, rapping his knuckles on the table for emphasis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2015/may/21/tomorrowland-disney-strange-utopia-shaped-world-tomorrow","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-21T18:03:17Z","webTitle":"Tomorrowland: how Walt Disney’s strange utopia shaped the world of tomorrow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/21/tomorrowland-disney-strange-utopia-shaped-world-tomorrow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/may/21/tomorrowland-disney-strange-utopia-shaped-world-tomorrow","fields":{"headline":"Tomorrowland: how Walt Disney’s strange utopia shaped the world of tomorrow","bodyText":"Welcome to the future. Or is it the past? In Tomorrowland, Disney’s new adventure movie, George Clooney and friends risk life and limb to reach the utopian realm of the title, and it looks pretty much like we expected the future to look, at least back in the 1960s: a pristine, shopping-mall sort of place with soaring glass spires and flying trains and happy people of all nations wearing coloured boiler suits. But here in the real world (a relative term, admittedly) you can visit Tomorrowland today. As many millions of visitors know, it is already an area of Disney’s theme parks, devoted to the same type of optimistic techno-futurism Tomorrowland the movie espouses. You do not have to risk life and limb to get there, but it could cost you an arm and a leg. You can see the synergistic synapses firing in Disney’s corporate brain at the prospect of a movie that retrofits a backstory on to its theme parks. What is more, it comes just in time for the 60th anniversary celebrations of the original Disneyland park in Anaheim, California, which kick off tonight with a huge show presented by Mickey Mouse and Oscars host Neil Patrick Harris. All of this serves to highlight the fact that, 60 years on, we are still not sure what to think about Disneyland. It is a place of paradox and contradiction. Both utopian and dystopian. Kind of cheesy, yet great fun. Eagerly forward-looking yet stiflingly conservative. It is neither pure fantasy nor is it quite reality. More like a portal between the two: a place where cinematic dreams take on three-dimensional form, while punters travel in the opposite direction, leaving behind their outside existence to become actors in a giant cartoon. Queuing alongside families to sample the Disney fantasy over the years have been philosophers and cultural commentators of every stripe, all primed to decipher its meanings – and perhaps to suffer a trip on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. Perhaps it was the French theorist Jean Baudrillard who returned the most damning verdict: “Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real,” he pronounced in his 1988 book Simulations, “when in fact all of Los Angeles and the America surrounding it are no longer real, but of the order of the hyperreal and of simulation.” Reality has become a map without a territory, Baudrillard snootily surmised, and it is basically all Disney’s fault. Those contradictions were there from the start. Indeed, the split between fantasy and reality is embodied in the hybrid term Walt Disney coined for the creators of his theme park: “imagineers”. So, too, Disney’s Janus-like ambivalence toward progress is expressed in the plaque he unveiled at the opening in July 1955. “Here age relives fond memories of the past – and here youth may savour the challenge and promise of the future,” it reads. The sentiment was perfectly in tune with postwar America – a time and place of both space-age optimism and cold war uncertainty. More than fantasy, Disneyland provided security or as Karal Ann Marling’s definitive study of Disney design put it, “the architecture of reassurance”. Some have compared the layout of Disneyland to a map of Walt Disney’s own psyche: You start by walking down Main Street USA – a pastiche of 19th-century smalltown life, modelled on Disney’s sentimental memories of his childhood in Marceline, Missouri. Then you can branch off into other “worlds” of Disney’s imagination. Most of them are nostalgic: Fantasyland, with its Sleeping Beauty Castle; Frontierland, infused with the spirits of Mark Twain and Davy Crockett; the exoticism of Adventureland, which was as close to abroad as most postwar Americans got (the Jungle Cruise ride was modelled on Bogart and Hepburn’s The African Queen). And then there’s Tomorrowland, where technology and science point the way to a shiny, happy future of inventions and space travel and nuclear-powered everything. At the time of opening, Tomorrowland was actually barely finished. A great many balloons were needed to fill in the gaps, apparently. It had been hastily cobbled together from the leftover sets of Disney’s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and corporate-sponsored exhibits. There was the TWA “moonliner” rocket ship, the plastic “Monsanto House of the Future” with Jetsons-style interiors and a microwave oven to cook your (presumably GM-free) meal, and the Kaiser Aluminium Hall of Fame, turning kids on to the wonders of … er … aluminium. The “tomorrow” of Tomorrowland was originally set at 1986. At least we got the microwave. But Walt Disney sincerely believed in the future he was selling, possibly even shaping, at Tomorrowland. When it relaunched in 1959, it introduced the first working monorail to the US. Another remodelling in 1967 brought the PeopleMover – a mini electric train system intended to point the way for future urban mass transport (the California original closed in 1995, the Florida one is still in operation). Walt Disney’s futurist credentials led to him designing attractions for the 1964 New York World’s Fair, including the Carousel of Progress and It’s a Small World, both of which he then brought back to Disneyland. By this time Disneyland was a runaway success, and the public were anticipating an east coast sequel, especially when it emerged that Disney had secretly been buying up a vast area of central Florida – twice the size of Manhattan. But building another Disneyland didn’t really appeal to the company’s founder. “I would like to create new things,” Walt Disney told reporters at a 1965 press conference in Florida. “You hate to repeat yourself. I don’t like to make sequels to my pictures. I like to make a new thing and develop a new concept.” What really appealed to Disney about “the Florida project”, as it was then known, was not the theme park but the workers’ town next to it. Visitors to the top floor of the Carousel of Progress would soon see what Walt Disney had in mind. There was installed a gigantic model of “Progress City”, a town for at least 20,000 people, with lights and moving cars and the glow of a nuclear power station in the distance. Progress City is surprisingly in step with current ideas of urban planning. With it, Walt Disney intended to right the wrongs he perceived in Los Angeles: too many cars, no pedestrian access, no civic centre, characterless modern architecture. Progress was a garden city of concentric rings, three miles wide. At its centre stood a 30-storey hotel surrounded by a compact indoor retail and business district, air-conditioned against the Florida humidity. Around that was a green belt with schools and leisure facilities, then a ring of low‑density suburbs, with industrial parks beyond. The roads were all underground. The primary means of getting around would be public transport: a monorail, a system of people movers, and walking. He redubbed it the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow: Epcot. Smarter still was Walt Disney’s idea of how the city would operate: he would invite corporations to test their products on its citizens. If General Electric was developing a new microwave oven, for example, one would be put in every Epcot home for real‑world testing. Visitors would come to see what the city of the future looked like. “It will always be in a state of becoming,” he explained in a promotional film. “It will never cease to be a living blueprint of the future, where people live a life they can’t find anywhere else in the world.” “It was a very clever concept,” says Sam Gennawey, an urban planner and Disney historian, who conducted an unofficial feasibility study of the original Epcot. “Walt was an empirical-data sort of guy. Everything he planned had been tested somewhere else. Everybody thinks of him as this master innovator, but his greatest skill was taking what he saw and knew worked and recombining it in ways that seemed new and novel.” The only downside to Disney’s utopia was the governance. Disney would own everything, and Epcot citizens would only be permitted to live there for up to a year, after which they would have to move on. Thus, nobody would ever acquire voting rights and subvert Disney’s programme. Disney also cut a favourable deal with the Florida authorities, Gennawey explains. “They could go ahead and build a nuclear power plant or an airport without the permission of the state of Florida. They have rights within that property that are generally greater than those of most counties in the US.” For better or worse, Epcot never came to pass. Disney’s utopianism died with its master in 1966, and no one else had the stomach to build his dream city. Rather than the city of the future, Epcot became another theme park, more like a corporate-sponsored World’s Fair. The only surviving vestige of Disney’s prototypical community is the Disney-owned town of Celebration, Florida, a surreally twee place whose orderliness has drawn comparisons to Ira Levin’s novel The Stepford Wives. In the theme parks, too, Tomorrowland ceased to anticipate the real future and instead focused on futuristic attractions: Captain EO, the 3D Michael Jackson musical, directed by Francis Ford Coppola; Star Tours, the Star Wars-themed simulator ride; the Space Mountain rollercoaster (look closely and you will spot it on the skyline of the film version of Tomorrowland). Tomorrowland the movie is a sincere attempt to address this lack of belief in the future, without which humanity could be doomed, it suggests. Looking at the present-day landscape, the real influence on the city of tomorrow was not Tomorrowland or Epcot but Disneyland itself. Many an architect and planner has admired it and borrowed from it. In 1963, Harvard professor James Rouse called it “the greatest piece of urban design in the United States today”. Disneyland is a self-contained, controlled, pedestrian-friendly retail monoculture whose functions are overlaid with a veneer of narrative and fantasy, invisibly serviced and governed by regulations so repressive that employees have only been permitted to sport moustaches since 2000. As such, it has become the model for many an aggressively themed new residential development, shopping mall or casino resort, from Las Vegas to China to Dubai. Baudrillard’s prophesy seems to have been fulfilled. “Disney invokes an urbanism without producing a city,” wrote architect Michael Sorkin in a scathing essay titled See You in Disneyland. “Rather it produces a kind of aura-stripped hyper-city, a city with billions of citizens (all who would consume) but no residents. Physicalised yet conceptual, it’s the utopia of transience, a place where everyone is just passing through.” Umberto Eco agrees. In his 1986 essay Travels With Hyperreality, he writes: “As an allegory of the consumer society, a place of absolute iconism, Disneyland is also a place of total passivity. Its visitors must agree to behave like robots.” Do we still need Disneyland now that the rest of the world has been Disneyfied? Disney certainly thinks so. Walt Disney may be long gone but the corporation is bigger and hungrier than ever. Disneyland’s model has been replicated outside the US in Tokyo, Paris and Hong Kong. The theme park side of Disney’s operation earned nearly twice as much as its movies last year: $15bn versus $7bn. And it is still building. In the past 10 years, under its current chief executive Bob Iger, Disney has been on an unprecedented buying spree, snapping up prime movie properties Pixar, Marvel and LucasFilm for a combined total of more than $15bn. So as well as its menagerie of talking animals, its harem of fairytale princesses and its Pirates of the Caribbean, Disney’s universe now encompasses characters from Buzz Lightyear to Spider-Man and Han Solo. It is remarkable just how much of the popular imagination the company has monopolised. These franchise-friendly properties will doubtless help Disney rule the box office, but they also provide plenty of new material for the theme parks. Already, Iger has promised “a much larger Star Wars presence in our parks globally”, with rides based on as-yet-unreleased movies. After Tomorrowland and Pirates of the Caribbean, itself a ride that inspired a movie franchise, there are plans for another film based on an existing Disney attraction: The Haunted Mansion, directed by Guillermo del Toro and starring Ryan Gosling – a former Mouseketeer returning to the fold. Disney is now working on Shanghai Disney Resort, one of the most ambitious and expensive projects in its history. The corporation has already pumped $5.5bn into the resort, which is set to open next year. That is more than it paid for either Star Wars or Marvel. It will contain the largest fairytale castle yet, a new Pirates of the Caribbean ride, a theatre playing the Lion King musical and a Toy Story-themed hotel. Chinese-themed landscapes will also blend with all the traditional areas and attractions that Walt Disney laid out back in the 1950s. It will probably be the most visited tourist attraction in the world. To shore up the client base, the corporation has been rolling out its Disney English operation across China, which teaches the English language exclusively through the medium of Disney characters, priming the next generation in the ways of Mickey and Donald. This all sounds a long way from its Walt Disney’s vision of the future. It is not yet known whether Shanghai Disney Resort will have a Tomorrowland, or what they will put in it if they do. At the moment, Disney’s tomorrow simply consists of more Tomorrowlands."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2016/jan/24/piers-corbyn-other-rebel-in-the-family-jeremy-corbyn-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-24T09:30:04Z","webTitle":"Piers Corbyn: the other rebel in the family","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/24/piers-corbyn-other-rebel-in-the-family-jeremy-corbyn-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jan/24/piers-corbyn-other-rebel-in-the-family-jeremy-corbyn-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Piers Corbyn: the other rebel in the family","bodyText":"When Jeremy Corbyn won the leadership of the Labour party in September he celebrated in a pub up the road from the Houses of Parliament with a thank you to supporters and a rousing rendition of the Red Flag. On the edge of the impromptu stage that day, beside Len McCluskey of Unite and John McDonnell the future shadow chancellor, was a singular figure singing with particular pride: Piers Corbyn, the new leader’s elder brother, who has, you could say, led a parallel career of stubborn principle to his younger sibling. I was in the euphoric crowd that day, and since then I’ve wondered a bit about the relationship between the brothers, what they have learned from each other. With some of this in mind I called Piers recently and asked if he might like to talk about some of that. He agreed, but typically on the basis that he would happily talk about any subject under the sun – apart from his relationship with Jeremy and the vexed question of how his leadership is going. He shares much of his brother’s mistrust of the press; recently, he suggests, the Independent published an account of an exchange that had taken place over a family Christmas dinner. That wasn’t on. What he will talk about, though, is the thing he has talked about for just about as long as he can remember: the weather. On this very British basis we met last week in a cafe over the road from his office on Borough High Street in south London. You don’t have to speak to Piers for very long to realise that at least a couple of Corbyn family traits are indelible: the first is that intransigent rasp of a voice with faint traces of west country burr; the second is the sense that life, like politics, is best played as a long game. Piers Corbyn has a faith, even at 68, that if he states his beliefs often enough – though it might seem no one is listening – his day will surely come. He takes comfort in this not only from the recent elevation of his brother, but also from the example of Galileo, and of John Harrison and his measurement of longitude. “It is unfortunately not the case that the truth always prevails in the short term,” he tells me, with some conspiratorial conviction, “there are often vested interests to prevent it.” The particular “truth” that Corbyn has in mind is perhaps the least fashionable proposal currently available in enlightened debate: it is the belief that changes in the Earth’s climate and its weather are dictated primarily by cyclical activity on the surface of the sun (and not, pointedly, by the effects of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere). It is a cause even more thankless than the return of 1980s socialism to British parliamentary politics seemed (until very recently). Corbyns have little fear of pariah status, though. What of the “settled opinion” of climate scientists and governments around the world, sealed in the recent Paris accord? “For one thing science doesn’t do settled opinions,” Corbyn says. “And for another they are all wrong.” This contrarian spirit began in Piers Corbyn at the age of five when his father, an electrical engineer, encouraged him to investigate the efficacy of a Victorian dew pond (he found it to be limited); it continued with his construction of all manner of meteorological equipment in the family garden in Shropshire; then through the study of tiny anomalies in the true orbit of the Earth (based, aged 17, on weekly measurements of the elevation of the sun, with findings published in the journal of the Royal Geographical Society) and into academic degrees in solid state physics and astrophysics at Imperial College London. The culmination of this obsession was a personal epiphany: “I was thinking of using the weather to discover what the sun had been doing in the past,” Corbyn says. “But then I thought, that’s just stupid: why not use the sun to predict what the weather will do in the future?” In his mind, the only thing that has got in the way of him making his fortune from that ambition, is politics. To begin with, he says, his solar-based forecasts and calculations were way off, and he had as good as given up, but in 1984 a singular event changed the course of his working life. At the time, Corbyn says, of the year after his brother had first been elected a Labour MP, his own political loyalties were in a certain state of flux. He had been a radical student union president in London and sometime revolutionary socialist (a past that he believes would have prevented him working at the Met Office, still part of the Ministry of Defence, even had he wanted to). In the early 1980s he had been affiliated to the International Marxist Group, after a brief flirtation with the “quasi-Trotsky anarchist group, The Big Flame, for the 11 days it existed”. At the beginning of 1984, knowing his meteorological background, the IMG asked him to forecast what the winter was going to be like at the end of that year. The miners were planning a strike and “they wanted to know whether it was going to be cold enough for the strike to be effective, to bring Britain to its knees,” Corbyn recalls. He said no, but under pressure from his comrades he went back to the data, “looked at a lot of new relationships and correlations” and came to the conclusion that, yes, it was going to be a very cold winter. He presented his evidence to the Miners’ Educational Support Committee (“I think it was called that. We had a lot of committees…”) And it was passed on up to the NUM. As the strike unfolded Corbyn’s prediction proved correct, the winter of 1984-85 was unusually cold. Was the NUM grateful? “Very,” he says. He had phone calls from head office, “not [Arthur] Scargill personally but one of his senior assistants”, asking how long the cold weather would last. He told him he thought it could possibly last long enough to bring down the Thatcher government, but by March the strike had collapsed and he never got the chance to be proved right. All the while Corbyn was assessing the proximity of revolution by monitoring the electricity output at Goldsmith’s college where he was a lecturer in the physics department. “The voltages were below the legal minimum all that winter,” he says. “It is supposed to be 240v, it was below 210v and for safety they are legally bound to turn it off. The government were desperately doing everything they could to conserve power. I called to say I had measured the voltages at the University of London and they were below that minimum. They said, ‘Well, Mr Corbyn you must have faulty equipment,’ and put down the phone.” It was in those weeks and months, Corbyn suggests, that Margaret Thatcher came up with her most devious plan to deindustrialise Britain and defeat the miners once and for all: she would popularise and endorse the science of man-made climate change, as a way of converting Britain from coal to nuclear power. The Hadley Centre, the world’s first dedicated research institution became her pet project. Thatcher, who later recanted her doom-mongering, “probably knew climate change was nonsense,” Corbyn suggests, “she was a scientist. But she was also a politician. The rest is history.” Corbyn sees that moment as the one in which politicians first saw the political capital to be made from prophesying the coming apocalypse. Worse though, in his mind, the most vehement expression of that prophesy was not on the right but on the left. Climate change became a progressive cause. For Corbyn, it answered the crisis on the left created by the fall of the Berlin Wall. “The left needed a new totem pole. Something for the young to dance around and feel good about,” he says, somewhat bitterly. “Revolutions had failed. Russia had failed. Socialism wasn’t dead but it needed a cause. The Red-Green alliance became that cause. It needed massive state spending, which they equated with socialism. In my view the left stopped thinking in 1989. It is only my brother who has started to change the agenda of privatisation and so on.” It is hard to imagine that Piers has not bent his brother’s ear with elements of this analysis at family gatherings for about 25 years. Does he show signs of wavering? “I don’t speak for my brother on any of this,” he says. “I don’t give advice to him where it is not appropriate.” Did Jeremy share his obsession with the weather as a kid? “Not really,” he says. “We were all different. Our eldest brother was into cars. He became a flight test engineer for Concorde. The next brother is a mining engineer, went to Imperial college. Then there is me, scientist. Then Jeremy, who was always politics. I think we all took after different aspects of our dad; while my mother encouraged us to make things all the time. The house was rundown and we boys had to do repairs. Jeremy and I learned how to repoint brickwork and so on. We became pretty good builders.” Piers has had perhaps less convincing success with the construction project that has occupied most of his adult life. After the relative triumph of his forecast for the miners he worked pretty much full-time on his long-range models. By 1989, the first year he heard of the idea of man-made climate change, he was ready to sell his formula to the world. Ignoring the traditional model of publication and peer review, ostensibly to prevent others stealing his ideas, he engaged the bookmaker William Hill to construct some weather bets for him with the help of the Met Office. “That went on for 12 years,” he says. “I had 30 bets at £20 each on long-range aspects of the weather each month; betting the average temperature would be below normal, that kind of thing. We made a lot of money that way.” How much is a lot of money? “I made about 40% profits on stake, overall,” he claims. “I would bet £600; I would get an extra £200 back. It would pay the rent basically.” He and his girlfriend at the time no doubt spent a lot of time looking anxiously at the sky. After this marginal success, a little better than putting a wet finger in the wind, some commercial clients came calling. For a while, Corbyn exclusively told the clothes store Etam the optimum time to sell its T-shirts or its hats and scarves. Some farmers were seduced by his predictions of storm and drought. And then the scientific consensus around carbon dioxide as principal climate-changer hardened, and Corbyn’s company, WeatherAction, which floated on the stock exchange in 1997, went back into private ownership after two years. Adversity has only stiffened Corbyn’s resolve, however. Despite his marginal status he is fighting global opinion on all fronts. These days he does the odd presentation for Texan oil companies, or Russian climate sceptics. And he has not given up on a shift of opinion closer to home. “Whatever you think of it all, the net result of these beliefs has been a deindustrialising of the west and the shift of carbon dioxide production from Britain to India and China,” he says. “Labour under Jeremy are now saying we have got to make a special case for steel and various industries that have to pay all these significant taxations on energy costs, which is the reason a lot of them are closing down.” Piers is whispering in the ear of any MP who will listen: “Graham Stringer, of Labour, is sympathetic,” he says, “Sammy Wilson DUP, a number of Tories, Boris is very sympathetic [Johnson tends to use Corbyn, in an unlikely alliance, as his climate guru]. Now I think we have George Galloway which is significant, because he can be very persuasive…” Inevitably, Corbyn has arrived for coffee armed with graphs and charts; so before I go I try to get him to explain how his calculations work. He talks 10 to the dozen about solar magnetic fields and lunar modulation and stratospheric winds. He outlines his database of 200-year-old German weather maps and solar observation from American satellites. “The principle is that all weather that happens has happened before, all storm systems, the question is finding the closest match…” If the results are as good as he claims, I suggest, why haven’t other people picked up on his system? “We haven’t told them how it’s done!” he says. “We had the Solar Weather Technique, ‘SWT zero’. We now have now got the Solar Lunar Action Technique, ‘SLAT’, and we are on version 12CS – s is for special. We have gone through 20 improvements and understandings on this…” As he talks I have the impression of an army of researchers tracking and calculating, poring over maps in order to compete with the Met Office’s supercomputer. When you say “we…” I ask. “I mean me,” he says. “OK” I say. “And what does the system suggest we can look forward to? “It will get much, much colder,” Corbyn asserts (he has lately suggested that in the longer term we are on the verge of a great cooling cycle, which will vindicate him once and for all). “Next month we have a displaced polar vortex situation. Plenty of snow coming.” We both glance out at the spring-like day on Borough High Street. “It’s got a chance, I guess,” I say. Corbyn grins. As he knows only too well, stranger things have happened."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/dec/05/end-deep-coal-mining-kellingley-colliery-yorkshire","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-05T09:00:02Z","webTitle":"The end of deep coal mining in Britain: ‘They’ve knocked us down’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/05/end-deep-coal-mining-kellingley-colliery-yorkshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/dec/05/end-deep-coal-mining-kellingley-colliery-yorkshire","fields":{"headline":"The end of deep coal mining in Britain: ‘They’ve knocked us down’","bodyText":"“It could be me and 10 others, or we could be 300, it’s always hard to know with a march,” says Chris Kitchen, secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). But Keith Poulson, the union’s branch secretary at Kellingley colliery in north Yorkshire – whose closure later this month is the reason for the gathering planned for 19 December – is thinking bigger. He believes that as many as 2,000 people could attend, “because it’s the last deep coal mine”. He expects a media scrum along with miners and their families, and says: “You won’t be able to move for TV crews on the verge out there. If we’d only had as much attention when we were trying to keep the place open, then it might have been a different tale we’re telling now.” There is so much bitterness here that the Kellingley miners rejected an offer by management to lay on a buffet and a brass band to mark their last day at work. Then, at a 40th birthday party a few weeks ago, two women whose partners are among the 451 men still working at Kellingley decided they would arrange something. They fixed on a march modelled on one held in January, when the local Labour and Conservative MPs Yvette Cooper and Nigel Adams joined calls for the mine – which is in Adams’ constituency but so close to Cooper’s that she, too, is heavily involved – to be saved. Led by the Knottingley Silver Band, and with NUM officials carrying the branch banner, the marchers will process the short distance from Knottingley town hall to the Miners’ Social Club. Tickets are on sale for an event later that evening, billed as “The Last Pit Party” on the poster pinned up in the concourse where the miners clock in and out, and where staff from Jobcentre Plus have set up a temporary surgery to offer advice. Poulson respected union members’ wishes when he agreed that they would just walk away after the final shift. “We didn’t think it was good to mark the end of the industry – you only celebrate a victory, don’t you?” he says. But now the two women have taken the initiative, he says he’s glad. “Their energy is commendable,” he adds. Most of the miners I spoke to at Kellingley this week seemed to think they would join the march – although there were plenty who declined to talk to the handful of journalists allowed in, along with a documentary film crew, to have a look around before the last of more than 50 Yorkshire coal mines is shut. Alan Clasper, a welder, says he hopes the farewells “will be upbeat, though people will be feeling disappointed. Everyone sticks together, don’t they?” Employment prospects are grim for this ageing workforce, some of whom have worked in mines since their teens. A good number had fathers and grandfathers who were miners, and they now face little choice but to apply for unskilled warehouse and driving jobs. A notice invites applications to the new wind-turbine factory in Hull, while pointing out that 1,000 applications were received for 14 jobs. Asked if they have enjoyed working at Kellingley, the men say they will miss the camaraderie, and there is bravado as well as anger among a group who list those they hold responsible – Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair – before one tries a joke: “We’re all off on gap years, aren’t we?” For those closest to retirement, the prospects are better, though Poulson, who is 55, will take away just £13,000 in redundancy pay after 39 years. “I’m hoping the young ’uns do get lucky,” says Andy Anderson, 60, who works in the medical centre. “My son is 27, he’s got a daughter and his wife’s pregnant. When he started here two years ago they told him he’d got 10 years’ work. The young men, with kids and mortgages, they’re not going to have the chance to earn the same money again.” This is the last of several waves of redundancy here: 205 men left in July, and 160 last year. Pay ranges from £30,000 to three times that for men working underground, with bonuses and overtime. From the yard, between the two mine shafts and the conveyor belts leading to the buildings where the coal is washed and loaded on to trains, the eight huge chimneys of Eggborough coal-fired power station are clearly visible. Less than four miles in the other direction is Ferrybridge. Both are set to close next year, long before the government’s recently announced deadline for coal-fired power stations of 2025. For decades, this corner of Yorkshire has been a vital source of electricity, but asked whether people know what is about to happen here, the unanimous answer is “no”. “You live in London. Go and ask your next-door neighbour if they think there’s any deep mines left in Britain,” Poulson tells me. “Everyone thinks mining is already finished,” says Margaret Faull, who recently retired as director of the National Coal Mining Museum after almost 30 years. Colliery manager Shaun McLoughlin, sitting behind the desk in his office, and cable bolter Tony Chappell, in a high-vis jacket covered in black dust, tell versions of the same story: when you go on holiday and get into conversation, people can’t believe you work in a mine. “They don’t know that up this end of the world it’s always been mining,” says Chappell, who is 53. Hatfield colliery near Doncaster was expected to be the last of England’s three remaining coal mines to shut, and the NUM invested £4m of members’ money there in the hope that state aid could further extend its life. But the doubling of the carbon floor price by chancellor George Osborne in April meant that, when the mine’s contracts ended, there was no buyer, leading to its closure in June. Two weeks later, Thoresby in Nottinghamshire closed, too. No one denies British coal is expensive. Labour costs, safety standards, and issues with this mine including the three hours a day miners spend travelling underground, are among the reasons – and a contract with Drax power station is the only reason Kellingley can sell what it currently produces. Local MP Nigel Adams says, “The closure of Kellingley is a tragedy for everyone who works there,” and blames “successive governments’ decarbonisation policies along with cheaper coal imports”, while a spokesperson for energy secretary Amber Rudd cites the “significant role in our energy history” played by Kellingley and looks ahead to “opportunities” in nuclear and gas. McLoughlin says that, as far as politics are concerned, “Everything’s on the back of the environmentalists.” Since the Labour governments of 1997-2010 continued with the pit closures begun by the Conservatives, he doesn’t think the historic antipathy between the NUM and the Conservative party, the strikes of 1972-74 that brought down Edward Heath, or the 1984-85 strike, have much to do with what is happening now. Faull agrees, points to the closure of mines in Belgium and elsewhere as evidence of a wider trend, and believes coal’s reputation as dirty and polluting explains its loss of support. Coal continues to provide around a quarter of British electricity, and many are sceptical about plans to replace it. But even if the government does stick to its timetable, millions of tons of coal will be imported for the next 10 years. McLoughlin says price projections make it clear British coal would remain uncompetitive, but the miners take a different view, citing the billions of pounds of government subsidies and guarantees for the Hinkley Point nuclear power station, along with support for renewables, as evidence of bias against them. They are angry, too, about the profits made by energy companies since privatisation. “They’ve knocked us down and down and down,” says Poulson. “You could understand we’d have to close if there was no market, but we’re seven miles from Drax, the biggest coal-fired power station in Europe.” “This country used to be called Great Britain and coal is part of what put ‘Great’ into that name,” says Kitchen. “When you see what has been done for others, it makes you wonder if this is anything to do with climate change, or even economics, or if it is purely a political stance: ‘Thirty years ago we wanted to kill off the mining industry and this year we’ve finally got the chance.’” In a few weeks’ time, the only deep mine left will be Caphouse, England’s National Coal Mining Museum. I was taken on the underground tour there by former miner John Carrington, who told me how, at busy times, he gets stuck behind men his age pausing in the tunnels to tell their grandchildren their life stories. The museum’s visitor numbers are up this year, though funding is difficult. Carrington was a locomotive foreman before he became a guide, and he has his eye on one of Kellingley’s locomotives as an addition to the collection. Already agreed is the removal to the museum – from its current spot beside the car park, where it can be seen from the canteen – of the Kellingley memorial, a bronze frieze of a bare-chested miner for which the men raised £26,000 following the death of one of their number, Don Cook, in 2008. His was one of three deaths at the mine in the past nine years. At the NUM’s headquarters in Barnsley, the brightly painted banners of closed collieries hang from every wall of the council chamber, which is currently being used for rehearsals of a pantomime. “Some people think we’ll become a museum,” says Kitchen, though he is determined to prevent that. In a few weeks, the future of the union – which will see its membership fall to around 400 open-cast mine and rescue workers after Kellingley’s closure – will be debated. When I visited her at home in Wakefield, Faull was unemotional about Kellingley’s closure, calling it “sad but inevitable”. She was in no doubt about coal’s significance in British history, pointing to the country’s reliance on it over three centuries, but said that, as a historian, she views it dispassionately. She believes the decisions that doomed coal were taken decades ago, when a pre-privatisation National Coal Board programme of fluidised bed burning was cancelled and development of small-scale boilers abandoned. “The NCB was not focused enough on the future,” she says. “They took the view there would always be the need for coal. They were used to selling large-scale to power stations, and they saw marketing as negotiating how much they would get per ton.” Last month, the UK government cancelled its £1bn competition for the carbon capture and storage technology that could yet provide a future for coal globally. There are plans to open a new, community-owned drift mine less than 10 miles from the Caphouse museum. But no one seems to doubt that this is the end of deep coal mining in Britain. After mechanical problems last week, work is two days behind schedule at Kellingley, meaning miners may now be asked to work on 19 December, when they might otherwise have been marching to mark the end of their way of life. This article was amended on 7 December 2015 to clarify that the event on 19 December is a farewell march for the miners, their families and supporters, but not a demonstration."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/dec/06/green-energy-no-go-for-reindeer","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-06T08:00:14Z","webTitle":"Green is good for the planet, but it’s no go for reindeer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/06/green-energy-no-go-for-reindeer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/dec/06/green-energy-no-go-for-reindeer","fields":{"headline":"Green is good for the planet, but it’s no go for reindeer","bodyText":"It’s cold. Minus 10, 12 perhaps, and getting dark; the butter-fingers of a rising moon evident on the eastern horizon. Ill-equipped (the forecasts were for minus five), my ears start to hurt, and I pull in my hood. By the time you read this it will be colder still. And there are still no reindeer to be seen. Olav hands me his binoculars and tells me to focus on a hillside about three miles away across the snowy vastness of Norway’s Forollhogna National Park, a tract of ancient, ice-scoured mountains and mire, three hours’ drive inland from Trondheim. I don’t know what I am looking for really. Nine brown animals, one with a red nose? “No, they are light coloured at this time of year. A pale creamy grey. Just behind those bushes. Perhaps …” I see some lumps, which may be reindeer. Hundreds of them. Or then again, they may be rocks. These are among the most timid animals on the planet and have good reason to keep their distance from a species that will have their hide for a rug as soon as look at them. We walk on. Despite getting closer, the lumps fail to resolve themselves. I make a decision that we have indeed seen reindeer and hand the binoculars to Olav. He agrees; they seem to be moving. Rocks don’t do that. Time to walk back to the car. And get warm. Norway is western Europe’s wildest country. Unlike us, the Norwegians have failed to exterminate their entire menagerie of interesting and valuable species. Although large predators are now very rare, – there are only a handful of wolves and bears left in the wild, the arctic fox, once on the brink of extinction, is back, and there are golden eagles and moose aplenty. And reindeer. Thirty-five thousand wholly wild animals, plus thousands more (far to the north of where I am) domesticated and semi-domesticated, mostly by the Sami people, Europe’s most mysterious tribe. The landscape is magnificent – think Scottish Highlands on steroids. And Norway is, in some ways, a very green country. It gets nearly all of its electricity from renewables. Recycling is compulsory. Electric Tesla cars purr. But there are anomalies and paradoxes here. Norway is big and the population density is low, meaning that Mother Nature is respected, but often taken for granted. The national psyche, when it comes to green matters, is the bizarre lovechild of Jonathan Porritt and Sarah Palin, Greenpeace with a hunting rifle. Norwegian schoolchildren are taught to shoot and go on hunting trips with their class. Reindeer are killed, butchered and eaten. Hard to imagine that going down well among the pious parents of north London. And nothing shows this more clearly than the strange story of Norway’s reindeer and its green energy programme – and how efforts to conserve a species have come into direct conflict with efforts to conserve a planet. Because to the reindeer, the empty wilderness I see is anything but. It is a land of invisible but terrifying hazards, barriers unperceived by humans – many of them the direct result of Norway’s efforts to become self-sufficient in green electricity. The Norwegian wild reindeer may have lost, according to some scientists, an estimated 40% of their habitat – without the destruction of a single mountainside or desecration of a single forest. It is one of the oddest stories in the history of ecology and it is only now coming to light. Because to a reindeer, Norway’s environmental correctness must seem like a great green swindle. Norway is a lucky country. It has a small population, highly educated. It is also rich beyond avarice, floating on a lake of North Sea oil. Thanks to this bonanza, its 6 million inhabitants have amassed a sovereign wealth fund of nearly a trillion dollars – enough to keep the wolf from the door for centuries after the oil runs out. Norway also, by an equal quirk of geography, has an almost limitless supply of free energy. Norway is mountainous. It rains a lot. And its rocks are impermeable. This makes it an ideal location for hydroelectric power. The country needs about 128,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity a year, and 122GWh – 96% – of this is supplied by 937 hydropower schemes. Rivers are dammed, producing lakes. The water is then allowed to flow, through a series of underground channels, to large turbine plants. There are plans to massively expand Norway’s hydropower grid, by turning the entire country into, in effect, a gigantic gravity-store – the “green battery for Europe”. Under the scheme, any surplus energy (for example electricity produced by turbines during very windy periods or excess solar power on hot days) will be transmitted through the European grid and used to pump water up into Norway’s dammed lakes, creating vast stores of potential gravitational energy that can be turned on and off when needed. It will take a great deal of clever engineering but would solve the biggest issue with renewable energy – its inherent unreliability. But there are unforeseen consequences. As well as flooding river valleys, hydropower schemes have hitherto unsuspected impacts on Norway’s wildlife, especially the population of wild salmon (which are prevented from moving upstream by hydropower schemes) and also for the country’s wild reindeer. Not just the dams, but the access roads and other infrastructure form a powerful barrier to the movement of the animals, trapping them into a series of “islands”, limiting migration and the gene-mixing needed for a successful population to flourish. And the problem may get worse with the planned introduction, on a large scale, of wind power. It seems that just about anything we humans do to the landscape spooks the reindeer. After the end of the ice age, 10,000 years ago, Scandinavia was recolonised by waves of animals – and humans. In Viking times, Norway was home to hordes of migrating ungulates – reindeer and moose – that travelled hundreds of miles a year in vast mass-movements of animals. The country was also home to a menagerie of ferocious predators. Bears, wolves, wolverines, lynx and golden eagles took advantage of this vast mobile smorgasbord. Until the advent of farming – and hunting on a mass scale – predator and prey lived in equilibrium. And then humans, as always, became the region’s apex predator. Things were never the same again. Norway may be a green country, but it has a powerful farming lobby and the nation’s carnivores, a perceived threat to livestock, have been hunted to near-extinction. The hunters went for the wild reindeer too. Traditional pitfall traps, in which whole herds of animals were chased into stone-lined pits, decimated the population. Later, rifles were used. By 1900 the Norwegian wild reindeer was almost extinct. But a series of conservation laws, some of the first anywhere in the world, saw strict controls on hunting and the population recovered to today’s level. The reindeer has few natural predators. The bears and wolves are mostly gone. But I was surprised to be told that even adult animals can be killed and eaten by golden eagles. “How on earth does a bird kill a large hairy mammal that might weigh 60 kilos?” I asked Olav Strand, my guide and a zoologist with Nina, Norway’s environmental research agency. “They land on the animal’s back and pierce the spine with their talons,” he explained. Nerve damage and blood loss mean that the eagle only has to wait a while for its dinner. Now, reindeer populations are carefully controlled by licensed hunting. National parks are strictly managed; you will pay a fine of £2,000 for driving where you shouldn’t. So the reindeer should be safe. But there is another problem. The vast herds, which may number upwards of a thousand animals, have leaders. And these are not the strongest and most resilient animals, but the most timid. This makes sense; with wolves and bears around, the reindeer need to be on twitchy high alert, ready to run fast and far at the first sight of trouble. But the bears and wolves are mostly gone, and the access road to a hydro-power plant poses no real threat. Yet the anxious leaders of the herd remain keen to avoid such structures. “The reindeer, you see, is a victim of its own evolution,” says Strand. The mountain regions, which used to be home to just two to three distinct panmictic (able to freely interbreed) populations of reindeer, have now been fragmented into 23 distinct populations. What to us looks like an unbroken stretch of wilderness is, to a reindeer, an archipelago of safe islands, all separated by psychologically impenetrable barriers; not just major roads, but the most unobtrusive service road or pylon. A single dirt road can render 50-100 square kilometres out of bounds to a reindeer. A frozen dammed lake is 10% less likely to be crossed than a natural lake. “In effect, they have lost 40% of their habitat,” Strand says. The Renewable Reindeer Project started, this year, to quantify the effects of human activity on reindeer movements and the health of their populations. For more than a decade, hundreds of animals have been fitted with GPS collars that allow their movements to be tracked. And for the last four years around a dozen have been fitted with cameras, so the scientists at Nina can work out exactly how the reindeer react to obstacles. “We simply had no idea what they were doing before the use of GPS collars,” says Dr Manuela Panzacchi, an ecologist at the Trondheim offices of Nina and the scientist in charge of the project. “From a reindeer’s perspective, it is important to stress that the problem is the network of infrastructures, rather than each single one,” Panzacchi says. “The more connected humans become, the more disconnected become pristine wildlife habitats.” The cameras and GPS trackers tell the scientists where the reindeer are and how they move; they then model the effects of various possible changes to the landscape, such as the introduction of a road, after seeing how the reindeer react to actual infrastructure additions. It is then, hopefully, possible to work out how to mitigate the effects of, say, building a new hydro plant or wind farm. “The wild reindeer don’t like us humans,” Panzacchi says. “Given the opportunity, they even avoid large overhead power lines.” This would seem to indicate that the only way to really protect the reindeer would be to scrap any plans to build new infrastructure. But the scientists think this is probably not the case. “You can mitigate. Our models will tell us more precisely, but it is looking like it may be enough simply to close a road for a few days a year.” The findings of the Reindeer Project are to be published in a special edition of the Journal of Animal Ecology this month. Environmental correctness is a hard act and paradoxes and contradictions are almost inevitable. Reject nuclear power and you may find, as Germany has, that you end up massively increasing your carbon emissions by burning more coal. Wind power subsidies may suck money from more cost-efficient ways of producing green energy. Electric cars are only as green as the power stations that make their electricity. And there are unintended consequences that are wholly unpredictable. But here in Norway, at least, work is under way to make sure that green power and wildlife can coexist in relative harmony."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/jul/26/economic-recovery-appears-strong-interest-rate-rise-crashing-down","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-26T08:00:04Z","webTitle":"The recovery seems to be strong – but a rate rise will bring it crashing down","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/26/economic-recovery-appears-strong-interest-rate-rise-crashing-down","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/jul/26/economic-recovery-appears-strong-interest-rate-rise-crashing-down","fields":{"headline":"The recovery seems to be strong – but a rate rise will bring it crashing down","bodyText":"Britain’s growth rate returned to Mach 2 speed in the spring and early summer. That’s the consensus among City analysts ahead of official figures out this week, handing George Osborne another golden arrow with which to shoot down his critics. It is the re-emergence of the big-spending consumer (who snaps up a new bed and sofa while ordering a case of wine) that is likely to have prevented the UK economy from repeating the lacklustre growth rate of 0.4% seen in the first three months of the year. Most analysts expect the Office for National Statistics to report on Tuesday that GDP jumped by 0.7% for the three months to the end of June. That’s an annualised GDP increase of 2.8%, which is enough to put supersonic Britain streets ahead of its developed-world rivals. Yet a peek beneath the data reveals a picture that Osborne and the interest-rate-setters in Threadneedle Street ignore at their peril. Based on what we already know from the official figures and those published for individual industry sectors, the main boost to the second quarter figures will come from the very same source of weakness in the first quarter – the North Sea. Last year saw a dive in North Sea oil and gas production as operators reacted to the dramatic fall in crude oil prices. In recent months, rigs taken out of action for maintenance have come back on stream, encouraged by a moderate recovery in prices (though they are falling again now, along with other commodities) and a more generous tax regime announced by Osborne in the March budget. The result was an enormous 9% increase in output between the first and second quarters. Making matters worse, manufacturing is in the doldrums. Since last summer, growth has slowed to a point where output was actually lower than the year before (down 0.4% from May 2014 to May 2015). Great hopes for pharmaceuticals makers, specialist textiles and machinery manufacture have been dashed. Mining and quarrying is in decline and metal smelting has all but disappeared. Filling some of the void are the stellar motor and aerospace industries, which prevent Britain’s manufacturing from being limited to the output of a few niche products. The services sector is also doing its bit: from hotels and leisure to the health sector and online shopping, businesses are expanding and taking on more workers. They are even reporting skills shortages despite there still being more than 1.8 million unemployed. Pay has also rebounded and, according to official figures, wage growth is averaging 3.2% while inflation remains flat, giving workers a welcome income boost. So that’s a dose of good news at least. Is it enough to warrant a smile on Tory faces? Bank of England policymakers seem to think so. They are preparing to raise interest rates in the expectation that higher real wages will send inflation rocketing. But those among the nine monetary policy committee members who prefer to ignore weaknesses in the UK’s growth story are likely to be embarrassed. If rates go up in November or possibly next February, the betting must be that they will soon come down again. With higher interest rates must come a higher pound. It is already strong against the euro; if there is another surge on the foreign exchange markets, billions of pounds’ worth of exports could be priced out by cheaper competition. Much of this loss will be felt by manufacturers. GDP will suffer. More importantly for the MPC’s inflation-watchers, a higher pound will make imports cheaper and bring down prices, which resurrects the threat of deflation and thus the need for an interest rate cut. The embarrassment of cutting back rates after a bold rise is something the Swedes and Canadians know all about. Their central bankers tried it and – in the case of Sweden – now have negative interest rates for their trouble. So surely it would be better for the MPC to hold fire. Then the UK’s still-weak economic recovery can keep climbing. Tories need to get climate change story straight Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary, is a true Janus: the Roman god famous for facing in two directions at the same time. In her first major speech on global warming on Friday, Rudd insisted climate change was a dangerous threat she took most seriously and which would be tackled for the sake of families and businesses alike. But this was the same Rudd who earlier in the week had overseen the scrapping of the Green Deal scheme to make homes more energy efficient and the end of certain solar subsidies. She has already scrapped financial aid for onshore wind – the cheapest of all renewable energy technologies – and has overseen the lowering of taxes on polluting companies while ending tax breaks on cleaner cars. Most of these measures, argues Rudd, can be taken because the subsidy schemes are not working properly or because wind and solar are so successful they don’t need support anymore. She also claims to be standing up for “hard-working families” by cutting energy bills. Rudd also wants to see free-market solutions, not state or consumer-funded ones – although different rules seem to apply to nuclear power. But many see an ideological cuts agenda barely concealed behind consumer-champion rhetoric. It is true the Conservatives publicly promised to be the “greenest government ever”, but privately admitted it wanted rid of “the green crap” . The real truth is that tackling global warming costs money, even if more of the cost comes via the taxpayer than through higher energy bills. But we need to pay now rather than leave subsequent generations to face the devastating and much more costly impact later on. Global warming is a threat that has not been and cannot be tackled by any pure free-market solution. It cannot be driven by companies worried about three-monthly financial cycles, or be achieved in a world where fossil fuels do not pay for the damage they cause. For a party that claims to support business and the commercial imperative, it is also astonishing to see the rug being pulled from under the renewable energy industry just as this job-creating sector really takes off. Should Hornby be derailed? A parliamentary commission into who was to blame for the near-collapse of HBOS in 2008 said the bank’s chief executive Andy Hornby had “proved unable or unwilling to change course” to save it from bankruptcy. It is not yet known what a report by the City regulators into the debacle will conclude, as it is long-delayed and no publication date is in sight. But shareholders have always maintained that there should never again be a place for Hornby on the board of a listed company. Since 2011 he has been chief executive of bookmaker Gala Coral. While it was privately owned, that was no problem. On Friday it merged with Ladbrokes to become a market-listed business. Hornby will not be on the main board, but will be chief operating officer. It is now up to City shareholders to decide if he should be given a second chance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/nov/01/nuclear-waste-underground-storage","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-01T19:00:00Z","webTitle":"Nuclear waste must be out of sight, but not out of mind","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/01/nuclear-waste-underground-storage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/nov/01/nuclear-waste-underground-storage","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear waste must be out of sight, but not out of mind","bodyText":"Should you be anything like me, you will have a place in your home packed full of obsolete technology – VHS players, bulky-backed TVs and brick-like mobile phones, forming a peculiar shrine to the past few decades. Most of the time I ignore it, but the moment has come when our flat is full and it has to go. These electronics contain dangerous heavy metals and don’t belong in the landfill, so what do I do with them? The UK is struggling with a similar dilemma, but on a much larger scale. Nuclear power has played a big part in our energy use over the past 30 years with the benefit that it produces much less CO2 than fossil fuels, but it comes at a price; the process produces harmful waste products that must be managed for millennia. By the end of the century, the UK will have around 300,000 cubic metres of higher activity radioactive waste, enough to fill about one quarter of Wembley Stadium. What’s more, the UK pioneered a number of early experimental nuclear reactors that produced waste that is much harder to manage than material from modern reactors. Although I can take my old tech to the recycling centre for safe disposal, the disposal of radioactive waste is a lot trickier. Whether you support the future use of nuclear power or not, we have a moral and ethical responsibility to dispose of this waste securely. Radioactive waste is such a problem because it remains dangerous for tens of thousands to millions of years. To put that in context, 10,000 years ago our ancestors were hunting with flint blades, and nearly 1m years ago early humans were making their first tentative steps on to British soil. Who knows what will happen in the next million years At the moment, most of the UK’s radioactive waste is stored at ground level in vaults and buildings at Sellafield. Zoe Shipton, professor of geological engineering at the University of Strathclyde, says: “This cannot continue long term, as at the surface the waste will be exposed to many possible threats, including terrorism, tsunamis and climate change.” The vaults and buildings also require ongoing maintenance. Bearing in mind that the longest-running civilisation, the ancient Egyptians, were only around for 3,500 years, it is naive to think we can pass down information on how to monitor and maintain these buildings for hundreds of thousands of generations. The best – and as far as many experts are concerned, only – option is to put the waste out of harm’s way in a geological disposal facility. This is now happening in a number of countries including the US, France and Finland. Rebecca Lunn, professor of engineering geosciences at the University of Strathclyde, says: “Geological disposal of nuclear waste involves the construction of a precision-engineered facility deep below the ground into which waste canisters are carefully manoeuvred. Before construction of a geological repository can even be considered, an environmental safety case must be developed that proves the facility will be safe over millions of years.” Safety cases take between 10 and 20 years to develop and involve scrutiny of the site and scientific modelling to predict how the site will withstand the tests of time. There is no one-size-fits-all solution and the design of a geological repository depends on the rock in which the facility is being built (not all areas will be suitable) and the types of waste being disposed of. In one design, waste is packaged into canisters made from thick steel or copper. The integrity of the canister is ensured by preventing their corrosion, minimising the risk of damage by earthquakes and engineering barriers to stop any radiation reaching the surface if it does escape. Clay is effective for geological disposal because it does not allow water or anything leaking from a canister to flow through it. Clay also flexes, helping to dampen shockwaves from earthquakes and protecting the canisters from damage. Rocks such as granite are brittle and crack when they are stressed. Although water cannot travel through granite, it can flow along its cracks. In these rocks, a facility would be located where there were very few cracks and waste canisters would be entirely surrounded by a thick layer of clay called bentonite, which swells when in contact with water. This seals any gaps between the waste and the rock and also cushions the canisters from earthquakes. There are currently no geological repositories in Britain and after Cumbria county council voted not to continue with the process to find a site last year (despite Copeland and Allerdale district councils voting to go forward) there aren’t any sites under consideration. In the UK, communities must first volunteer their area to be considered as a possible site. After that, a search for a suitable site is made. This process may then take up to 20 years and will include a financial benefits package for the volunteer communities, as well as long-term employment opportunities. “The success of any facility will depend on local support. We must begin a lively, informed public debate to overcome the challenge of siting UK facilities and to fulfil our obligation of making our radioactive wastes safe for future generations,” says Lunn. Like your packed garage or loft full of decades of rubbish, we can continue to ignore the problem, but in the long term it needs to be addressed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/dec/16/cameron-windfarm-subsidies-onshore-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-16T19:59:15Z","webTitle":"Cameron pushes for removal of onshore windfarm subsidies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/16/cameron-windfarm-subsidies-onshore-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/dec/16/cameron-windfarm-subsidies-onshore-energy","fields":{"headline":"Cameron pushes for removal of onshore windfarm subsidies","bodyText":"David Cameron claimed on Tuesday the public was “fed up” with onshore windfarms and said the country did not need any more subsidised turbines on land now that the energy source was capable of providing 10% of UK energy. He said: “Let’s get rid of the subsidy, put them into the planning system. If they can make their case, they will make their case. I suspect they won’t and we’ll have a reasonable amount of onshore wind, we’ll have safer electricity supplies as a result but enough is enough and I’m very clear about that.” Cameron’s remarks to the liaison committee of MPs are at odds with polling conducted by the Department of Energy and Climate Change that suggests onshore wind is popular. Cameron also waded into green groups , claiming environmental campaigners opposed shale gas with a religiosity. “My objection to the green groups is that they don’t want to hear any of these arguments, because they can’t bear any new carbon-based energy source coming on stream,” he said. He said he believed the debate would be resolved in favour of fracking and the industry would be seen in a different light once the first pods were developed, starting next year, and it emerged how little disruption they caused. He told MPs: “I think there are some myths we need to get over – the myth that fracking would be a disaster for the environment, the myth that GM technology means we are all going to be eating fish-flavoured tomatoes, the myth that nuclear power is inherently unstable and we shouldn’t pursue it. “These are myths that we need to confront if we are going to be a successful science-based country in the future.” He surprised green groups by claiming fracking was not subsidised : “We are not subsidising fracking with a guaranteed pence-per-kilowatt hour. What we are saying is, as we stand today there are no unconventional gas wells in Britain and yet the Bowland shale, some of the other shale reserves, have the potential to provide gas for this country maybe for as long as 30 years. “It’s a nascent industry. We are not giving it a subsidy, we are just saying effectively that there should be a tax regime on this industry that encourages it to get going and, crucially, encourages it to get going and to reward local communities. “This industry is going to have to make a profit in order to succeed, but the way you tax a new industry is different to the way you tax an existing industry.” He also refused to say if he would publish an unredacted version of the March 2014 government report into the impact of shale gas on the rural economy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jan/20/worker-dies-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-20T13:31:26Z","webTitle":"Worker dies at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/20/worker-dies-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jan/20/worker-dies-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"Worker dies at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant","bodyText":"A worker at the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has died after falling into an empty water storage tank, in the latest of a series of accidents at the site of the worst nuclear disaster for a quarter of a century. The death was the second at Fukushima Daiichi in less than a year, but the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), insisted that it was doing everything possible to prevent accidents. Almost 7,000 workers are involved in decommissioning Fukushima Daiichi, which suffered a triple meltdown after it was struck by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. Removing melted fuel and dismantling the ruined facility is expected to take four decades. The latest death there, of an unnamed man in his 50s, comes days after inspectors visited the plant and ordered Tepco to address the rising number of accidents. Last March, a worker died after being buried by gravel while digging a ditch. In a separate incident on Tuesday, a worker in his 40s died in hospital after equipment fell on him at a facility storing radioactive waste at the nearby Fukushima Daini plant, Kyodo News said. The plant, which escaped serious damage from the tsunami, is being used as a hub for companies involved in decommissioning. The number of injuries, excluding cases of heatstroke, has almost doubled in the past two years. In fiscal 2013 Tepco recorded 23 injuries, while the number between April and November last year had already reached 40. The firm attributed the rise to an increase in the average number of workers at the site during weekdays, from 3,000 early last year to almost 7,000 today. “We are taking all sorts of measures to prevent accidents,” a Tepco spokeswoman said. They include training sessions for Tepco employees and workers hired by the firm’s many contractors on how to spot potentially dangerous situations at the plant, which now resembles a huge construction site The Fukushima Daiichi worker died after falling into a 10-metre-tall storage tank he was inspecting on Monday. He was taken to hospital but died early on Tuesday. “We are deeply sorry for the death of the worker and express our deepest condolences to the family. We promise to implement measures to ensure that such tragedy does not occur again,” Akira Ono, the manager of Fukushima Daiichi, said in a statement. The man’s employer, the construction firm Hazama Ando, had no immediate comment. In response to concerns that lack of proper rest was making Fukushima Daiichi workers more susceptible to lapses in concentration, Tepco will open a new facility in March where up to 1,200 workers at a time can rest and have meals. Several firms recently created a new company that will provide nutritious meals for about 3,000 workers a day from April. Most Fukushima Daiichi workers belong to a vast network of contractors in the construction industry that are helping Tepco decommission the facility. Amid accusations that some unscrupulous firms were withholding mandatory hazard allowances from their employees, four former and current workers last September took Tepco and several of its partner firms to court seeking $600,000 in unpaid wages. “It’s not just the number of accidents that has been on the rise. It’s the serious cases, including deaths and serious injuries that have risen, so we asked Tokyo Electric to improve the situation,” Katsuyoshi Ito, a local labour standards inspector told Reuters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2013/nov/26/the-poverty-of-targetism-five-years-of-the-uk-climate-change-act","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2013-11-26T18:16:05Z","webTitle":"The poverty of targetism: five years of the UK Climate Change Act | Warren Pearce","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/nov/26/the-poverty-of-targetism-five-years-of-the-uk-climate-change-act","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2013/nov/26/the-poverty-of-targetism-five-years-of-the-uk-climate-change-act","fields":{"headline":"The poverty of targetism: Five years of the UK Climate Change Act","bodyText":"The passing of the Climate Change Act five years ago was a landmark in the development of UK climate policy, introducing for the first time a statutory target for greenhouse gas emission reduction of 80 per cent between 1990 and 2050. Throughout the Bill’s passage through Parliament, the target had been set at 60 per cent, until the government advisory body, the Committee for Climate Change, recommended an increased ambition as a response to developments in the science. The structure of the letter is telling, focusing heavily on the scientific evidence and the technical (some might say, theoretical) feasibility of attaining the target but not attending to the social dimensions of such a radical policy proposal. Roger Pielke Jr. has written previously about whether the 80% target is plausible. Here, I will instead focus on the logic behind this ‘targetism’ approach, and how a linear translation of scientific evidence into managerial targets is an ineffective way of using evidence in policy. For such a high stakes social issue, the poverty of the current legislative approach should be of great concern. Targets have become increasingly prevalent in public policy since the 1990s, with the Blair Government famously enthusiastic about ‘performance management’ as a way of ensuring that policy priorities were delivered. “Welcome to targetworld” as Christopher Hood described New Labour’s centralised target ethos, where targets were linked to dedicated budgets allocated by the Treasury. Want to improve the chances of funding your policy priority? Then provide the Treasury a quantitative target by which you can be evaluated. In this context, the attraction of a ‘one number’ target for greenhouse gas emissions is plain. For those advocating environmental protection, climate change was a policy issue more closely aligned with targetism than the previous ‘big idea’ of sustainable development, increasingly derided as too fuzzy a concept to transfer into effective policy. Rather than the messy balancing of economic, environmental and social goals for sustainability, climate policy provided a logic of turning to science for numbers which could be transplanted into managerial targets. The process is cemented in the Climate Change Act, which states that such numbers can only be changed only as a result of developments in scientific knowledge or international law. Focusing on greenhouse gas emissions alone does, of course, make sense in terms of tackling climate change, and the role of scientific evidence is vital in determining what we do and don’t know about the physical processes involved. However, the Act’s focus on such evidence to the exclusion of social and political factors risks destroying the very policy agenda it seeks to promote. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, as Hood points out in his article, targetism encourages gaming of the system, exemplified in the early 2000s by the adjustment of hospital waiting lists to meet waiting time targets. Cutting economic activity and reducing public services would both contribute to cutting emissions – but are they policies that are really intended to be encouraged? For local authorities, the reporting of certain categories of their own emission sources has become voluntary, providing an added incentive to outsource services as a way of getting emissions ‘off the books’. If one wanted a climate change target, perhaps carbon intensity would be a more appropriate indicator, promoting a logic of efficiency and ‘decoupling’ economic activity from emissions, rather than closing down or exporting production entirely. Secondly, and more fundamentally, targetism belies climate change’s status as a complex social phenomenon. It implies that climate change can be reduced to the level of another indicator on the global data dashboard. Rather than trying to express climate change as a number, social science research, including my own within local authorities, has shown that climate change has multiple meanings for people across time and space: a business opportunity or an unwanted interference, a line on a spreadsheet or a consequence of global development patterns, imperfect expert prediction or near certain catastrophic threat. Such multifarious meanings will not be reconcilable, but through democratic discussion and debate society can try and make better sense of what climate change means for the past, present and future. As Amanda Machin explains in her book Negotiating Climate Change, disagreement, not consensus, is the spark to such discussions, which in turn can lead to more fruitful responses to the issue. This is where the Climate Change Act fails, in presenting climate change as an issue only open to influence by scientific and political elites, rather than as a legitimate subject of public debate. So where does this leave climate policy in the UK today? Despite rumblings on the Conservative backbenches, there does not appear to be any imminent attempt to repeal the Climate Change Act. However, the Committee for Climate Change has been unable to mask its frustration at the rate of implementation in its recent reports to Parliament. The Act risks becoming irrelevant unless it is reformed to make it more responsive to social concerns, articulated through democratic methods more effective than the blunt tool of two general elections per decade. In seeking to be scientifically robust, the Act has been made politically brittle. And that is a precarious position for a document so symbolically important in the climate debate.

Central to his Mansion House speech was a warning that unless the state runs a budget surplus in normal times, a toxic legacy of debt awaits our children and grandchildren. The chancellor, who let it be known last week that he is a Star Wars fan who keeps several replicas of the Jedi weapons in his office, said that for the sake of future generations “governments of the left as well as the right should run a budget surplus to bear down on debt”. Addressing the assembled City grandees, Osborne was echoing comments by the prime minister, David Cameron, before the election, when he said parents and grandparents must “look at the children you love” and save them from a “legacy of huge debts”. The subtext of Osborne’s speech was clear: a return to Labour’s policy of running deficits – even those under the banner of “borrow to invest” – would undermine the public finances. Yet much of what Osborne does favours the old at the expense of the young. A look at five policy areas shows how: Osborne made the triple lock on state pension rises a cornerstone of the election. It guarantees the over 65s a 2.5% increase in the state pension regardless of inflation. Pensions rise in line with earnings or inflation if they are higher. This policy is not means-tested and has made pension costs the dominant factor in welfare spending. One in every £2 of expenditure by the Department for Work and Pensions is spent on pensions. Education is being cut, hitting young people’s prospects. While the schools budget is supposedly protected, more than 100,000 children are being taught in primary school classes larger than the statutory maximum. A cap on class sizes of 30 children has proved to be easily breached by hard-pressed schools and more than one in 20 infant school classes are above the ceiling. The next spending round will take another swipe at further and tertiary education across England and Wales. It is a fallacy of neo-liberal thinking that private companies and workers will train themselves for the modern workplace. Tertiary education needs to be expanded for post-16 and adult education and training. The environment must be a concern for future generations. That means investments in carbon-free energy generation and heat conservation. All the budgets in these areas have been cut, leaving private contractors to bid for a small number of high-profile projects. Carbon-free energy generation comes in the form of Hinkley point nuclear power station and the Swansea tidal lagoon, which cost twice and three times as much as solar power and onshore wind, neither of which are getting much government support. All the previous government attempts to get people excited about heat conservation flopped for lack of funds. In-work benefits are about to be cut again, with tax credits the prime victim. Research has shown that children are the biggest victims of these cuts. They also suffer the knock-on effects of cuts in mental health services, which have hurt funding for adult mental health more than any other area of health spending. More broadly, creating a budget surplus is more about protecting today’s older taxpayers, many of whom already have the infrastructure they need to see out their days. Osborne scared boomers with Britain’s escalating level of debt, which has doubled from around 40% of GDP in 2006 to 80%. But this level of borrowing by a national government is not bad in itself; it depends on who you borrow from and your ability to pay the interest. The UK’s 80% is less than the Japanese (220%) and sits between France and Germany (96% and 71% respectively). The Japanese, like the Italians (who support a 120% debt to GDP ratio), borrow largely from their own savers. The UK has traditionally borrowed mostly from international investors, though today around a third of its debt is owned by the Bank of England. Much of it is long-dated (which means it comes up for renewal infrequently) and enjoys a historically low interest rate. This means there is virtually no threat to the UK’s status as a safe haven. An experiment that proved this was run by Jonathan Portes, head of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research. He looked at the cost of UK debt financing before the election when markets, like most observers, expected a coalition government of some kind, most likely led by Labour. When a Tory victory was announced, the bond market, where government debt is bought and sold, was expected to leap for joy. It did not move – the conclusion being that the difference between a small deficit to fund investment under Labour and surpluses under the Tories left them untouched. Osborne failed to make the point that a government determined to save more than it spends is going to shrink. As a group of academic economists pointed out at the weekend, cutting back on spending to produce a surplus in the public finances shifts the burden of borrowing to businesses and households to maintain the current level of GDP. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects household borrowing to climb back above its former peak of about 170% of GDP by 2020, from a low of 135% after the 2008 crash. The Whitehall independent forecasting unit has made it clear that much of the UK’s GDP growth throughout this period would evaporate were it not for this increase in borrowing. The question must be: how good is the surplus for the next generation if it has to borrow to pay for living expenses and invest when that could be done by the government – which can borrow at much lower rates and has plenty of jobs to do. Cutting public services to achieve a budget surplus will also have the effect of depressing growth below what it might have been if the government was to maintain a small deficit for investment. Lower growth will force the Bank of England to maintain low interest rates. At the moment, Threadneedle Street is expected to begin raising base rates next spring, from 0.5% to a maximum of 3% over maybe two to three years. Lower interest rates will encourage investment in risky assets and property in particular, where regulations are being weakened and taxes on ownership are low. This drives up property prices and creates an expensive asset only the richest young people can afford and a repeat of the 18-year cycle of property crashes Osborne pledged to eliminate. How can sowing the seeds of the next crash be of benefit to the young?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2015/nov/25/public-service-winners-and-losers-in-spending-review","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-25T15:36:51Z","webTitle":"Public service winners and losers in spending review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/25/public-service-winners-and-losers-in-spending-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2015/nov/25/public-service-winners-and-losers-in-spending-review","fields":{"headline":"Public service winners and losers in spending review","bodyText":"George Osborne has announced a series of cuts and giveaways to departments across Whitehall in the 2015 spending review. From the departments of education and health to the Home Office and local government, public spending is to undergo radical changes before the next election. Here is how each will be affected by the chancellor’s autumn statement. Home affairs The chancellor’s decision to provide real-terms protection for police funding will cost £900m by the next election in 2020 and was one of the surprises of his statement. But that protection is to be accompanied by a move “to a fully self-funded borders and immigration system” that will see an extra £300m raised from “targeted visa fee increases”. Holloway prison in north London, the largest women’s jail in Europe, will be the first to close under the government’s “new for old” programme with its “prime real estate value” trumping the fact that it was completely rebuilt in the 1970s/80s. The justice secretary, Michael Gove, said the “inadequate and antiquated” Holloway would close by summer 2016, once places become available at HMP Bronzefield in west London and a reopened HMP Downview. Running costs for prisons will, however, be cut by a further £80m a year and the £700m proceeds from court closures will be invested in a digital justice system. The £900m protection for the police will be accompanied by an extra pot of “transformation funding” for those forces with strong proposals “to support efficiency and reform”, to ensure Theresa May’s radical reform programme remains on track. Nearly £1bn is to be invested in a new 4G emergency services mobile communications programme. The settlement also leaves a question mark over the funding to support the 20,000 Syrian refugees coming to Britain over the next four years. While £460m of overseas aid cash will be used to support them in their first year, there appears to be only £130m available beyond that. Health The chancellor has done a lot to burnish his party’s standing on the NHS. He has given it £3.8bn extra for 2016-17, which is most of the significant extra cash the service’s boss had been seeking, and earmarked £600m of that to fund overdue improvements in mental healthcare, such as for new mothers and those in crisis. The move will doubtless embolden ministers to repeat Jeremy Hunt’s provocative claim, first made by the health secretary in July, that the Conservatives are “the true party of the NHS”. But all the extra dosh comes at a price. The Department of Health’s own budget – the £115bn chunk of its current £116bn income that it does not give the NHS – is being cut by 25%. That means big cuts to the key health bodies funded by that money, notably Health Education, which pays for the recruitment, education and training of health professionals, and Public Health England, which tries to help us all lead healthier lives. Public health experts will question how reducing spending in those areas will help tackle obesity, alcohol misuse and sexually transmitted infections, and continue the work to denormalise smoking – all behaviours which add to the burden on the NHS. Publicly funded bursaries for student nurses are also to be phased out, saving £820m a year. Education The education sector got off more lightly from the cuts than many had anticipated, prompting sighs of relief from universities and further education colleges. But the government’s offer to extend free childcare has been trimmed while services provided to schools by local authorities were hit by a significant cut. Osborne announced that funding for FE colleges would be kept at its current level, after months of lobbying within Whitehall by the education secretary, Nicky Morgan, while sixth form colleges were given a boost. But the government’s much-prized promise of giving working parents 30 hours a week in free childcare for three- and four-year-olds was reined back. Osborne raised the number of hours that needed to be worked to count as full-time and lowered the income ceiling from an expected £150,000 per family to £100,000. That means that fewer than the expected 600,000 families will now be eligible for the extra 15 hours a week by 2017. The Treasury will also provide an additional £330m rather than the expected £365m. Osborne confirmed that a major shake-up of the formula for funding schools in England is to take place by 2017, which is likely to see funding shifted away from inner-city schools. The largest cut in education will be the scrapping of the £600m education services grant paid to local authorities, which will cut back on the school improvement and support functions provided by those bodies. Local government and social care Central government grants to town halls in England will be abolished, the chancellor announced, and councils will instead be able to keep all of their business rates, and raise council tax 2% to pay for social care. The central government grant, which totalled £18bn in 2013–14 and equated to about a third of council revenues, will have gone by 2020. The right to keep 100% of business rates will deliver an estimated extra £11.5bn a year to council budgets by then, councils said. The leader of Newcastle city council, Nick Forbes, immediately warned the move would leave a £16m hole in his budget. Osborne said the new “social care precept” on council tax could see £2bn more go into the system. But councils fear the wider cuts will worsen an existing £3bn spending gap in providing care services to look after older people and people with mental health problems in the community. The Local Government Association has said the measures will affect poor areas more because they have lower council tax revenues. Osborne also said councils would be able to access a “better care fund” supplying £1.5bn extra by 2020. On housing, the chancellor announced a doubling of the housing budget to £2bn a year to “deliver 400,000 affordable new homes by the end of the decade”. Money will go to help housing associations, local authorities and the private sector to deliver 135,000 Help to Buy shared ownership homes by 2020-21. They are expected to be for households earning less than £80,000 outside the capital and less than £90,000 in London. He also made £2bn available to developers to build starter homes for first-time buyers costing £250,000 outside London, and £450,000 inside. From midnight, tenants of five housing associations will be able to start the process of buying their homes and public land would be released to build 160,000 homes. Osborne said £300m would be spent on infrastructure at Ebbsfleet, Kent, for a 15,000-home development he billed as “the first garden city in over a century”. Culture, media and sport Claiming that cutting funding to culture would be a false economy, Osborne promised that national museums and galleries would have their funding protected until 2019-20. The sector, led by the year-old Creative Industries Federation, has lobbied hard to get the message through that public investment generates money for the economy. Osborne acknowledged that in his speech, saying £1bn a year in grants leads to a £250bn benefit to the economy. While the operational budget of the DCMS will fall by 20%, the spending review promises that Arts Council England, national museums and galleries will get the same amount of funding in 2019-20 as they do today. The question remains, however: where will the money come from? Osborne pledged that national museums would remain free to enter and tax credits may be created to help them further. Government money would also go to Hull for its capital of culture year in 2017; to the Royal College of Art for its new Battersea campus; £150m to allow the V&amp;A, the British Museum and the Science Museum to move their storage from Blythe House; and £9m a year would go to Manchester’s new £110m arts centre, The Factory. Although the fine detail needs to be sifted, there will be widespread relief in the arts. Many had been spooked by Osborne’s talk of 25% or 40% cuts and things were not helped by the apparent lateness of the Treasury settlement with the DCMS. It was one of the last departments to settle and arts leaders genuinely had little idea of what to expect. Energy and environment The most startling hit in the spending review is the £132m pulled from energy efficiency schemes, announced on the day that a large rise in winter deaths was revealed. Osborne sold the change as a £30 cut to consumer bills, but customers in leaky homes will pay much more in the long run. The chancellor also slashed 40% (£700m) from a scheme backing green heating systems, reducing the chances of the UK hitting its climate change targets. Meanwhile, heavy industrial energy users got a £20m exemption from green taxes. But Osborne, known as a technology geek, also announced “at least £250m over the next five years in an ambitious nuclear research and development programme that will revive the UK’s nuclear expertise”. This will include a competition to identify the best value “small modular reactor design”, or mini-nuke, which the chancellor said would pave the way to building one of the world’s first SMRs in the UK in the 2020s. The £2bn Osborne announced for flood defences is not new and the £1bn shale wealth fund remains theoretical, as no fracking has yet happened. Both the Department for Energy and Climate Change and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have taken heavy cuts to day-to-day spending, meaning job losses. For Decc in particular, this is likely to undermine the government’s ability to get the best value for taxpayers in deals with the private sector, such as subsidies for expensive future nuclear power plants. Transport With 37% to be slashed from the DfT’s resource budget by 2020, transport has been dealt the biggest cut of any department as a proportion of its day-to-day spending. Most of the savings will come from London: Transport for London’s operational budget of almost £700m a year will be wiped out by the end of the decade, leaving TfL to fund its services through commercial investment, cuts or potentially higher fares. But the chancellor said transport cuts would be offset by money earmarked for infrastructure, up 50% from the last parliament to £61bn over the next six years, including 2020-21. Much of the later spending will go on HS2, whose price tag has been officially increased to £55.7bn at 2015 prices. Roadbuilding will account for £15bn in spending, which Osborne hailed as the largest road investment programme since the 1970s. London will still receive a total of £11bn to continue upgrades and create new infrastructure, including Crossrail. The chancellor said the increased capital budget would ensure critical rail projects, such as the electrification of the Midland mainline and Transpennine route, can go ahead, after they were shelved earlier this year to outcry in the north. The DfT forecasts that rail franchising will deliver bigger returns to the Treasury than it currently receives. The DfT’s budget will fall from £2.6bn this year to £1.8bn in 2019-20. Its administration budget will be cut by 12% in real terms, a slightly less severe cut than the 18% average across government."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/jan/04/guardian-view-uk-energy-policy-limits-market","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-04T18:53:41Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on UK energy policy: the limits of the market | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/04/guardian-view-uk-energy-policy-limits-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/04/guardian-view-uk-energy-policy-limits-market","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on UK energy policy: the limits of the market","bodyText":"Last year was a rough one for the climate change secretary, the Lib Dems’ Ed Davey. The big government offer in 2010 of a clear, market-driven energy policy turns out to have been easier to promise than to deliver. That is partly the fault of coalition politics. Energy became the battleground for the most fundamental differences between the two partners. As a result, a policy area that demands long-term thinking has been mired in uncertainty. The case for green energy has been widely undermined by misleading accounts of its cost to the consumer. David Cameron, the man who used to say vote blue, go green, now talks of cutting the green crap. In the midst of the political squabbling, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) has lurched between crises. Last month, faced with warnings from the power-generation industry that they were working at something close to full capacity, with a margin of as little as 2% at times of peak demand, Mr Davey’s department looked for a cast-iron guarantee that the lights would stay on. Although many independent observers argued that the 2% margin was likely to be breached only in an extreme winter, and then only for a very short period, last month the National Grid held the first ever auction for capacity contracts which can ensure the lights will not go out. The generators guaranteed they would have power available and, in return, were guaranteed sales at a price that, when it comes on stream three years from now, will cost consumers about £1bn a year. This deal is due to be approved by Mr Davey on Monday. There are two particularly contentious aspects to it. First, it has turned out to be a subsidy to generators for doing something that they would do anyway. Second, instead of encouraging a new generation of gas-fired power stations to enter the market, two-thirds will come from existing capacity, which means that nearly a fifth of the supply will come from dirty coal and contentious biomass, while EDF, the major nuclear power operator, will generate a further 16%. Meanwhile, the Decc has rebooted the struggling green deal, the flagship project to encourage home owners to invest in energy efficiency. Beset by complexity, at the end of its second year in 2013, green deal had attracted fewer than 4,000 takers. It has now been rebranded as the green deal home improvement fund, and extended to allow consumers to borrow up to £6,000 to invest in more difficult projects like solid-wall insulation. The experience of the green deal home improvement fund has been the reverse of its predecessor. It’s so successful that it’s a complete sellout. Reshaping energy policy will inevitably be a long-haul project. The political right argues that, with well-designed market incentives, innovative technologies will emerge. Incentives certainly have their place. But, overall, this is too big a challenge, as Mr Davey’s experience has shown, to rely exclusively on incentivising. Moreover, in moral terms, this is a challenge that cannot be left wholly to the market. At its heart, energy policy generates conflicting rights. Only the state can ensure fairness between them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2014/jun/18/britain-old-declining-empire-official-chinese-newspaper","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-18T08:47:17Z","webTitle":"Britain is an old, declining empire, says official Chinese newspaper","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/18/britain-old-declining-empire-official-chinese-newspaper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jun/18/britain-old-declining-empire-official-chinese-newspaper","fields":{"headline":"Britain is an old, declining empire, says official Chinese newspaper","bodyText":"Britain is an \"old, declining empire\" which resorts to \"eccentric acts\" to hide its embarrassment over its declining power, an official Chinese newspaper has claimed on the second day of a visit by the country's premier, Li Keqiang, to London. As China was given the chance to take a decisive stake in the next stage of Britain's energy and transport infrastructure on the first day of the premier's visit, the Global Times said a \"rising\" country such as China should seek to understand a declining power. The paper, which is owned by the official Communist party People's Daily, took a swipe at Britain after reports last week that Beijing had threatened to call off Li's visit if he were not allowed to meet the Queen. The premier and his wife began their visit on Tuesday with an audience with the Queen at Windsor Castle. The Global Times wrote of the reports of a Chinese threat to cancel Li's visit: \"Diplomats might break out into laughter at such rhetoric. This hype only serves to reflect the narrow-mindedness of the British media and even the whole of its society. The once-powerful British empire must now resort to such trickery to manifest its pride.\" The official newspaper added: \"Perhaps Chinese people should forgive Britain's confusing sentiment. A rising country should understand the embarrassment of an old declining empire and at times the eccentric acts it takes to hide such embarrassment. Diplomacy has to be based on realistic recognition of the two countries' power. No matter for China or the UK, it will be tiring if they try to distort this reality.\" The official spokesman for the prime minister, David Cameron, sought to shrug off the significance of the article, telling a Westminster media briefing: \"I read in the Times of London Premier Li's article when he said this was a great nation. That is the prime minister of China's view.\" The barbed comments echo an editorial in the paper during Cameron's visit to China last December. At the time, it described Britain as \"just an old European country apt for travel and study\". The criticism follows agreements between Britain and China on the first day of Li's visit that will allow Chinese companies to own and operate a nuclear power station and to help build high-speed rail lines. The agreements are among trade deals worth £14bn agreed with Beijing. They have prompted Cameron to declare that Britain is playing a part in the rise of China – something he called a defining event of the 21st century. The two most controversial aspects of the deals will allow Chinese firms to own and operate a Chinese-designed nuclear power station and to build and operate rail lines in Britain. The Chinese have a mixed safety record on high-speed rail. On Tuesday, Cameron said: \"Ours is truly a partnership for growth, reform and innovation. Our partnership goes well beyond the economic field. The UK recognises that the rise of China is one of the defining events of our century. \"We welcome the fact that China's economic growth is lifting millions out of poverty. As premier Li noted, as China grows in economic power that brings greater responsibilities on the world stage.\" The government moved to stem criticism of cooperation in the highly sensitive area of civil nuclear power by saying it was part of an overall agreement to tackle climate change. China and Britain also signed a joint statement on climate change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/14/british-hinkley-nuclear-contracts-edf","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-14T17:23:00Z","webTitle":"British firms could miss out on Hinkley nuclear plant contracts, EDF suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/14/british-hinkley-nuclear-contracts-edf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/14/british-hinkley-nuclear-contracts-edf","fields":{"headline":"British firms could miss out on Hinkley nuclear plant contracts, EDF suggests","bodyText":"UK companies are set to miss out on the majority of specialist contracts to build the £14bn nuclear power station at Hinkley in Somerset because of a dearth of hi-tech engineering skills in the country, according to the plant's state-backed French developer, EDF Energy. An announcement is expected imminently on the result of long-running negotiations between EDF and the government over the price consumers will pay to subsidise electricity generated by the new reactors, as well as details of Chinese investment in the Hinkley project. While UK consumers will ultimately foot the bill for building the first nuclear facility in almost 20 years, most of the available contracts could be beyond UK suppliers which are struggling to meet the complex safety and quality standards of the nuclear industry, according to Ken Owen, commercial director for nuclear new build at EDF Energy. \"There are a lot of critical components where quite frankly the UK has lost its capability. We don't mind that because we know there is capability from a global perspective,\" he said. Contracts for what he described as \"muck shifting\" have already gone to UK companies which are set to prepare the site, but contracts for hi-tech engineering, civil engineering, marine engineering and various support services are at the preferred bidder stage or yet to be tendered. Although the UK excels at civil engineering and building in constrained sites, Owen said the difficulty arose when producing and integrating hi-tech components. \"This is where the UK has got to upskill itself because of the constraints of manufacturing parts for nuclear. We need full traceability: where every little bit of material comes from, and documentation of it. We need to understand the documentation sign-off for every manufacturing stage. That is a huge challenge for UK industry because they have never made components for the nuclear industry to today's standards.\" The vast majority of the value of the generator at Hinkley was in hi-tech engineering, not building the structure, said Owen. \"There are 90 contracts to deliver the job, excluding the muck shifting and enabling work. Two – marine works and civils – are traditional UK [strengths]. The other 88, that's the world of manufacturing and erection,\" said Owen, previously commercial director of CLM, the private sector delivery partner of London 2012 Olympics. The government expects the two new reactors at Hinkley to create between 20,000 and 25,000 jobs during construction and 900 permanent jobs once in operation. The project has been delayed because the government and EDF Energy remain locked in talks over the \"strike price\", which will guarantee the long-term price for electricity produced at Hinkley. EDF Energy needs a price sufficient for return on investment. However, the government is reluctant to be seen to subsidise a state-owned French firm at the expense of British consumers. An agreement had been expected by the end of 2012. The strike price also depends on the capital costs of the project, but here the two sides are nearing agreement. Owen said the government's due diligence on the EDF's costs was coming to an end. Until agreement is reached, EDF energy has suspended its procurement process, although it continues to work with four preferred bidders. Owen said EDF was working with the UK supply chain to help it understand the needs of the new build programme and helping suppliers collaborate with French companies with experience in the field. A government study from Oxford Economics and Atkins found the UK supply chain could capture 44% of the total value of a new nuclear reactor. If the government and energy producers worked together to develop the supply chain the figure could rise to 63%, it said. EDF estimates 57% of the value could return to the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/nov/29/chernobyl-desolation-camera-drone","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-29T14:20:58Z","webTitle":"Chernobyl’s eerie desolation revealed by camera mounted on drone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/29/chernobyl-desolation-camera-drone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/nov/29/chernobyl-desolation-camera-drone","fields":{"headline":"Chernobyl’s eerie desolation revealed by camera mounted on drone","bodyText":"A camera mounted on a drone has revealed the eerie post-apocalyptic landscape of a town abandoned after the nuclear power station at Chernobyl exploded nearly three decades ago. The British documentary maker Danny Cooke has travelled to Pripyat, just a few miles from the power plant, which was once home to 50,000 people. It was evacuated soon after the disaster on 26 April 1986 that killed 31 people and sent large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere over the western part of the then Soviet Union and Europe as far as away Wales. His video, Postcards from Pripyat, Chernobyl, marks the first time the area has been seen from the air. He shot the footage while working on a segment for US current affairs programme 60 Minutes on CBS, which was broadcast last week. Cooke’s haunting three-minute film shows sights such as a Ferris wheel in an amusement park quietly rusting away. The park had been due to open for the first time just days after the disaster. The sun is shining as the wind rustles the lush vegetation that is slowly taking over the decaying buildings and facilities. The Devon-based film-maker also sent the drone into a crumbling indoor swimming pool and over factories and apartment buildings where the only sign of life is the weeds growing on the roof. “Chernobyl is one of the most interesting and dangerous places I’ve been,” Cooke said. “There was something serene, yet highly disturbing about this place. Time has stood still and there are memories of past happenings floating around us.” It is not until the drone is sent rising above the treetops that viewers can see the vast dome being built to place over the damaged reactor. There is still so much radiation spewing from it that the 1,400 workers are building the 20,000-tonne steel structure nearby, shielded from the radiation by a huge concrete wall. When the 190m-high dome is finished it will be inched into place and sealed over the defunct power plant. Funding for the project of almost £500m was pledged by 28 countries including Britain in 2011, but it has faced a series of delays following the conflict in Ukraine. Despite the 20-mile exclusion zone around Chernobyl, some former residents returned to the area and it has also become something of a nature reserve and an attraction for a certain type of tourist.

Ed Davey has asserted that by 2030 the consumer will be saving up to £77/year because of a battery of British-based, foreign-funded nuclear plants. This is a deal in which only the taxpayer can lose. If the figures are right, it will be remembered as a bold national investment. But there is a general feeling that locking Britain into a massive long-term agreement with EdF is an unpredictable wager with taxpayers' money. The figures rely on a number of questionable assumptions. For example: More than one plant will be built. Gas prices will rise considerably, driving electricity towards the strike price. The Hinkley plant and other infrastructure projects will be built on schedule and at cost. The strike price negotiated will remain the same - even though there is no guarantee it will. Inflation remains constant. The message from analysts is that any effort to quantify future energy prices (particularly in the 2030s) is futile. But that is exactly what the government has done. Meanwhile, anti-nuclear groups have also been guilty of categorically panning the project's value to the consumer. We cannot know for sure if this will end up working out on a pound-for-pound analysis. The degree to which environmentalism has adopted the language and logic of capitalism is striking. Twenty years ago, this debate would have revolved around deal-breaker issues of meltdown and waste. While issues of safety and radioactivity are definitely still part of the milieu, particularly post-Fukushima, the anti-proliferation movement has quite clearly decided that the zeitgeist is pocket-focussed. Thus there is more traction to be gained from the nuclear's Achilles heel - enormous capital costs and consequently high energy prices. The confounding factor for many anti-nuclear campaigners and policy makers is climate change. The introduction of carbon prices has forced nuclear back onto the agenda. On a positive note, twenty years ago we may have also been talking about nuclear vs fossil fuels rather than renewables, so that's progress. But it should be asked how this massive state subsidisation of nuclear will affect renewable investment? A long-term shift in focus towards nuclear at the expense of off-shore wind or solar would be remedial. Other important costing issues to consider are: The taxpayer will underwrite the vast majority of the costs of a disaster. Our children and grandchildren will foot the bill of decommissioning. The price of nuclear power delivery has consistently risen, whereas renewable alternatives are falling fast. The government's nation-building arguments about jobs and energy security are credible. Although the renewable energy industry will potentially see those jobs as directly coming from their own part of the sector. Also, the majority of jobs and construction contracts represent a short-term economic boost. Of course this all may be academic if the European Commission decides the move is anti-competitive or represents unfair state subsidisation - a very real possibility given Germany's anti-nuclear interests. The following stoush between Britain and the EU would shake the foundations of the union. Many people I have spoken to today have echoed my own sentiments on this. On the whole I am not anti-nuclear. But because of the unquantifiable risks of major disaster, nuclear should always be second-preference to renewable energy unless it can offer a compelling economic argument. There is conjecture on whether this is ever possible. But even with an open mind I can't see how this particular deal can be a good one for Britons. My colleague Andrew Sparrow has followed today's parliamentary debate. Antony Froggatt, Senior Research Fellow with Chatham House has told the BBC: \"It is important to look at the small print which says that the price will be linked to future inflation, which means in some ways that this price is going to continue to rise going forward.\" He said it was also difficult to predict how much the plant would actually cost. \"The price of construction is going up,\" he said. \"Effect what we are saying for this to be economic, is that the price of electricity for households needs to double,\" he said. If this occurred it would drive mass efficiency measures as households sought to cut their energy usage. This would change the complexion of the market again. The Times and Telegraph have both been quoting a figure produced by CF Partners consultancy that estimates the Hinkley deal \"could add another £8 a year to bills\". I spoke to Roland Vetter, CF Partners head of research, who told me the figure had now been revised to £7. He also said the figure was not per year but only for the year 2023 when the plant is due to come online. His figures were based on increasing electricity prices driven primarily by the carbon price floor - which would be £30/tonne in 2020 and £70/tonne by 2030 both, in real terms 2009 money. To calculate the nominal carbon floor price he uses 2% inflation post 2012. But Vetter was clear that any figures he gave were simply guidelines that involved a number of assumptions. He said he couldn't see how Ed Davey could be in any way certain of his own department's projections which estimated a saving to consumers by 2030 of £77/year. \"There will be a significant number of assumptions in that mathematical model,\" said Vetter. He said if the gas price changed a lot - as it has in the US with shale gas flooding the market - Decc's figures would be heavily compromised. Vetter sent me some notes on his estimates: Accumulated revenues, guaranteed for 35 years for two reactors, with a CfD of £92.5/MWh real in 2012 prices, amount to about £83 billion in real terms. In nominal terms (assuming 2% CPI inflation, full inflation indexation) accumulated revenues amount to about £145 bn over 35 years (assuming 10 years planning and construction time before reactors start producing). Were the two reactors already on stream in 2014, then the revenues received would be £2.4 bn per annum for two reactors. Of this, about £1.1 bn would be subsidies, meaning the difference between the market wholesale price in the UK in 2014 (£52/MWh) and the strike price adjusted for 2% inflation per annum (£96.2/MWh). Per household, this would amount to approximately £11 per annum (assuming average consumption of 3,200 kWh and that the cost of the subsidies is spread among all electricity users in the UK – if some consumers like large industrial are exempted the costs per household increase). This example has to be taken into the context that the reactors won’t start before 2023 and therefore this is more a theoretical number. Based on the current level of gas prices (about 65 p/therm for the 2015 forward market), I estimate base load power prices in 2023 (when the first reactor is expected to come on stream) could increase to about £82/MWh nominal, or £68/MWh in real terms (2014 prices to make numbers comparable with above example). Based on this estimate, the difference between the market and CfD price will still be about £28/MWh (real) when the reactors could start operating. This implies total subsidies of about £700 mn per annum or £7 for an average household (both in real terms, 2014 prices) in 2023. The calculations assume that the carbon price floor stays in place (with a lower carbon price floor the subsidies would increase). Ed Davey has given a press conference in which he was heavily questioned on the costs to consumers. The full transcript is on Andrew Sparrow's blog. The gist of his argument seems to be that rising gas prices are driving prices up. This has informed the Decc estimates of £77 lower annual bills in 2030. Q: [To Davey] You are supposed to be keeping energy bills down. But you have just committed to paying double the market price to EDF. Won't that lower us into higher prices. Davey says the cost of Hinkley Point C won't touch customer bills until 2023. By 2023 we will be in a different world, he says. If Britain was just relying then on gas, that really would be risky. Wholesale gas prices have gone up by 50% in recent years, he says. By 2030 the average consumer bill will be £77 lower than it would have been without nuclear if this goes ahead, he says. Q: German prices have come down in recent months. Are we locked in to higher prices? Davey says Germany has far more renewables. In the UK, when the coalition came to power, only Malta and Luxembourg in the EU were producing less energy from renewables. Over the last three years the amount of power generated by renewables has doubled. Eventually renewables should lead to prices coming down, he says. Henri Proglio, the EDF chairman, says Germany has offered the renewable energy huge subsidies. So the taxpayer is paying for this, he says. Derek Duffill, CEO, Energy Works PLC said: “Ed Davey’s proposed plans have singularly failed to address what can be done in the short term and the growing energy crisis we are facing right now. With the proposed power station not generating until 2023, a pertinent question to be asked is what will happen when we run out of power by 2015? The benefits of energy conservation measures need to be felt now, not in 10 years time. By introducing simple methods such as LED lighting, we can reduce lighting power consumption by up to 75 per cent. Lighting consumes 20% of power generated in the UK, which will have a dramatic impact on our resources as well as a reduction of our carbon emissions. “I wholeheartedly agree with Mr Davey that it is ‘essential to keep the lights on and to power British business’ but we must first look at solutions we can adopt now which will use less power and lessen the strain on the national grid. By 2023, I fear it could be too late.” The manufacturers’ organisation EEF, head of climate and environment policy, Gareth Stace, said: It is good news for the security of our energy supply that progress is finally being made on developing extra capacity. However, the focus in the coming weeks must now be on the competitiveness of electricity prices and the need to avoid cost increases that are out of line with our competitors. “The UK also needs to be able to show that the transition to a low carbon economy can be beneficial for both the economy and the environment. Government must now build on this by ensuring that UK companies in the nuclear supply chain get the amount of work to which EDF has committed.” Renewable Energy Association chief executive Dr Nina Skorupska said: Today’s announcement is a major development for the UK energy mix, but it does nothing to address the looming capacity crunch warned of by the Royal Academy of Engineers last week. Hinkley will still be a construction site when old coal and nuclear capacity is shut down. In contrast, the Government could start plugging the generation gap straight away with another reliable low carbon solution: biomass. Biomass plants take only three or four years to build and provide flexible power when we need it. It is not too late to provide support for biomass in the EMR package, and we urge the Government to do so. “In terms of the contracts, Government must explain why it is subsidising nuclear for 35 years compared to 15 years for renewables. This is not a level playing field. The infographic pitting nuclear against solar and wind is also unhelpful. As Ed Davey stressed today, it is not an either/or choice – we need a diverse energy mix.” For reference the image referred to is below. Energy UK said: \"It is good news for the UK and British customers that new nuclear is going ahead. There is a clear need to build new power stations and nuclear represents clean, reliable energy and jobs both during the build and while the plant is running. \"The energy industry is well aware that it has a lot to do in the coming years so customers know it is working for them. This means keeping bills down by insulating our homes better so we use less energy and keep warmer. Companies are committed to being straightforward and open when prices have to go up so customers know the reasons why. It also needs to be easier for new energy companies to enter the market so people feel there is a better choice. \"Building new power stations is never quick or cheap, but in the case of Hinkley development, nothing goes on the bill until 2020.\" Tony Ward, head of power and utilities at consultancy group EY said: Agreement on the price and duration of the CfD contract is one of the most significant enablers to unlock positive investment decisions, not just from EDF at their Hinkley site, but other potential co-investors, and subsequently from other developers, such as Horizon and NuGen. Whilst not the final piece of the jigsaw, this is undoubtedly one of the most significant. \"With as many as 20,000 people working at the power station site over the course of its construction, and electricity supplies secured for 2.5 million homes, new nuclear projects such as this one are vital in terms of meeting the £200bn of investment needed in the sector to secure our energy future. Looking forward, a significant construction programme of new nuclear stations in the UK could boost GDP by up to 0.34% a year and nuclear exports from £700mn up to £1.6bn.\" Jamie McMillan has tweeted me with a pertinent question. It's not all about energy bills matching up. What happens if something goes wrong? The answer is that you cannot commercially insure nuclear facilities. Essentially taxpayers overwrite nuclear projects. The liability of site operators is severely limited - something in the range of £200m. Some reports are estimated the cost of the Fukushima disaster at £250bn. For the record, there are 430 nuclear reactors currently in operation. Three major meltdowns have occurred in the 57 years of commercial nuclear generation. Dr Robert Gross, director of the Centre for Energy Policy, Imperial College has told my colleague Damian Carrington the announcement is good in theory. But past experience of nuclear construction projects should raise questions over the delivery of the project and subsequent costs if it runs overtime. What matters is not so much whether £92.50 is a fair price (it seems reasonable) but whether it bears any resemblance to what consumers end up paying when the reactors are finished.” “Reactors have been built on time and in budget in some parts of the world but recent experience in Europe is not encouraging. And years ago, reactors built in the US, UK and France all suffered from setbacks and delays. We know that nuclear is a low carbon option and it could help to tackle climate change, despite the obvious concerns. What we do not yet know is whether it will turn out to be a low cost, low carbon option. You could say that the UK government is helping the world find out.” Steve Thomas, professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, tells me the policy may well have difficulty clearing the European Commission because it may breach regulations on unfair state aid. This would depend on whether the state aid would distort the electricity market, which Thomas felt it would. The EC would also be concerned that it could create a cascade of similar nuclear investment deals. It's not a decision that the European Union can take lightly because there are 11 other European Union states that want the British scheme of doing things as an option,\" said Thomas. Reuters has reported that: Britain plans to submit its application for state aid clearance to the European Commission for a new nuclear power plant later this week, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said on Monday. \"I'm confident we will manage to argue our case,\" Davey told reporters. Thomas says even if it clears Europe the deal represents \"very bad value\" for the consumer given that the world could change \"six times over\" during the agreement's duration. I think signing up anything for 35 years is highly suspect. If it was a blindingly good deal, if it was half the current wholesale price for electricity I might think about it. But locking us into a deal for so long really doesn't make any sense at all. \"What we don't know is the small print of the deal and how fixed the price really is... It sounds like, if the whole thing's going to go belly up then the price can go up to prevent the company going bust. So it does sound a little bit cost plus to me. \"If that's the case, or at least part of that's the case then it really does look like a blank cheque to EDF.\" Meanwhile the Science Media Centre have sent through a series of expert comments. Sir John Parker, president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said: I welcome the decision announced today to proceed with a new generation of nuclear power, which is critical to long term energy security and a key contributor to meeting our carbon reduction commitments. The employment prospects for construction, engineering and services will be significant and welcome. This is good news for the UK and good news for engineering.\" Prof Dame Sue Ion, a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said: Energy Security is fundamental to National Security and the UK is embarking on a massive programme of refreshment and renewal of our ageing energy infrastructure which has to be paid for as it does not come out of general taxation. Whilst this announcement on new nuclear stations is welcome we would do well to recall that this is already some two years later than originally foreseen – and similar delays are being experienced in the drive to deliver significantly enhanced offshore wind generation. “Last week’s Royal Academy of Engineering report GB electricity capacity margin says ‘The lead times associated with closing, mothballing, reopening or building plant are such that decisions taken during a period of uncertainty can have long ramifications. Thus even a temporary interruption of clear market signals, if it occurs at a critical investment decision point, may have disproportionate effects.’ “The UK’s utility sector is dominated by overseas companies with supervisory boards making decisions on an international basis. Uncertainties in the stability of the power generation sector in the UK do nothing to secure confidence in the UK as an appropriate market in which to invest. \"The Academy’s Generating the future report three years ago highlighted the challenges ahead and the massive investment that would be required to meet energy security and decarbonisation targets in the UK’s electricity generating mix.” Some anti-nuclear commentators have pointed to incomplete or behind-schedule projects in Europe as evidence nuclear construction is troublesome. Dr Paul Norman from the Nuclear Physics Group at the University of Birmingham says: The announcement and confirmation that EDF Energy will build at Hinkley Point is an essential step towards the UK achieving a low carbon, diverse mix of electricity generation which can last until the middle of this century and beyond. EDF partnership with China should also be a positive move, both financially and in terms of helping to keep the project to time and to price - whilst some reactor projects have been known for delays and prices rises, two of this same reactor type are currently being built at Taishan in China, and are both to time and to budget\". Ian Crossland, author of Nuclear Fuel Cycle Science and Engineering has emailed me and he says the price looks high: The international energy agency reckons that the price of gas will remain reasonable steady because of increased supply from unconventional sources (eg fracking). In these circumstances the only way that nuclear can compete is through the application of a carbon tax. $50 per tonne should be enough to change the situation in favour of nuclear. [See Ch5 “Nuclear fuel cycle science and engineering”, Ed Ian Crossland, Woodhead Publishing 2012]. Current government policy is for the price of carbon to rise to $46 in 2020 and $108 in 2030. This is easily enough to tilt the balance in favour of nuclear. The price arrived at however - £93.5 /MWh(e) – looks high. Ch5 of “Nuclear fuel cycle science and engineering” estimates a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for nuclear of about £60/MWh(e) at a discount rate of 7.5% and an overnight cost of $4669/kWh(e). Increasing the discount rate to 10% (the figure quoted in your piece) increases the LCOE to about £81/MWh(e). Presumably, the construction problems being encountered at Flammanville and Olkiloutu account for the rest. In a comment piece today, the Guardian's Simon Jenkins says that nuclear is messy, controversial but cheaper than renewables. The best to be said of the Hinkley nuclear power station announced this morning by the government is that it was announced at all. After decades of indecision, the certain prospect of lights going out across Britain as coal stations closed finally forced Whitehall's hand. The coalition has taken a decision on energy, praise be. And nuclear is at least cheaper than wind. This is a fairly common theme with commenters and tweeters today but there doesn't appear to be a consensus on which is cheaper. I spoke to Steve Thomas, professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, about the question of renewables vs nuclear and he was adamant that the production costs of nuclear do not add up when compared to renewable energy - in particular on-shore wind. If you take on-shore wind, it is massively cheaper than nuclear. In a good site, it's not much more expensive than gas-fired generation.\" Off-shore wind and solar prices were more expensive, but Thomas said the costs were coming down - unlike nuclear. The problem with nuclear is that the costs are going up and they've always gone up through the entire fifty or sixty years of nuclear history, the real cost of power from a nuclear power station has only ever gone up.\" The Guardian's Damian Carrington today wrote a blogpost that agreed with Thomas that the price journeys of nuclear and renewable energy meant that the deal made little sense. Energy efficiency is cheapest and the cost of renewable energy is falling. In contrast, gas prices have risen by 50% in five years and the cost of nuclear energy has trebled since 2008.\" According to WWF, the Committee on Climate Change's Low-Carbon Innovation report: \"Showed that technologies like offshore wind could stimulate economic growth in the UK more than nuclear. This was supported by a research by Cambridge Econometrics, which highlighted the economic benefits of offshore wind.\" Professor David Elmes of Warwick University said today that : The investment in new infrastructure and jobs that [the Hinkley plant] brings shows that today’s announcement is as much about UK industry as it is about energy policy. It is good to be moving forward instead of still debating, but in the future we will need a mix of sources of energy costing different amounts. Nuclear has a part to play in that mix, but it may not prove to be the cheapest.” Consumer watchdogs Consumer Futures and Which? have raised questions of the value of this deal and suggested ways in which it might be secured to make it consumer friendly. Adam Scorer director of Consumer Futures said : Today’s deal to build new nuclear power plants could mean we will pay more than the market price of electricity for decades to come. From the perspective of today’s market, a guaranteed price of £92.50 MWh moves the risks of future variations in wholesale prices from investors onto consumers, will likely see household bills increase and will distort future investment in electricity generation. Consumers will again feel that the energy market is stacked against them. We should recognise that this has not been an easy deal for Government to broker. Investment in new nuclear may be vital and Government may be right to offer a guaranteed long-term price to encourage investment. But the absence of competition to build new nuclear power leaves Government in a fundamentally weak bargaining position. Inevitably, this has been a confidential business negotiation. However, before the Energy Bill casts it in stone, it along with other aspects of the energy market, should be subject to independent scrutiny if consumers are to be able to trust they are getting a fair deal. We will be closer to the end of the century than its start when this deal lapses. It is vital that consumers can be confident it is as keenly priced as it could have been.\" Richard Hall, Consumer Futures head of energy regulation, said the organisation would not be conducting an investigation to try and put exact numbers on future electricity bills because: \"So much is contingent on future market forecasts, which are very difficult to predict... You can't forecast 35 months out, let alone 35 years out.\" Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: Rising energy bills are one of the top concerns for cash-strapped consumers, so everyone will want to be assured that the price the Government has agreed for new nuclear power is fair. The Hinkley deal commits billions of pounds of bill-payers’ money but it has been done without transparent, independent scrutiny. If it emerges that the Government has overpaid, we believe there should be a mechanism to refund consumers instead of a windfall to the suppliers. We can’t afford to continue with a situation where suppliers and ministers blame each other for energy price rises. We now need an independent expert review, that reports to Parliament, of all energy policy costs, with an assessment of whether consumers are getting value for money and where savings can be made. The National Audit Office should also be responsible for ongoing reviews so that ministers’ decisions are held to account and consumers can have more confidence that their money is being spent wisely.\" Jonathan Isaby, political director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: “Yet again consumers and taxpayers are footing the bill for politicians to intervene in the dysfunctional energy market that they have created. Subsidies to guarantee investment in nuclear power will be paid for by households through higher energy bills, at a time when throwing money at uneconomic forms of renewable energy has already pushed bills to breaking point. The Treasury’s financial guarantee creates the danger of taxpayers bailing out French state-owned EDF if something goes wrong with the deal. Ministers should instead focus on more affordable forms of power generation available today, rather than guaranteeing profits for energy firms and leaving families to pay the price.” The Financial Times has run a piece on the policy decisions that drove Britain's nuclear industry offshore and necessitated foreign investment and expertise if Britain is to rebuild its nuclear sector. Experts say the loss of this global lead has its roots in decisions made by governments in the 1980s and 90s, when the UK made a huge bet on natural gas. “The mistake during the dash for gas was in not thinking strategically and not keeping a domestic nuclear option open,” says Matt Brown, director of Pöyry, a consulting and engineering company. Greenpeace has released a briefing that purports to debunk some of the claims the government has made about consumer benefits from the Hinkley deal. The document concludes: The Hinkley strike price deal is deeply unfair to consumers. While a state-owned French company, and state-owned Chinese companies reap the benefits, UK households will be getting ripped off for the next 35 years.\" Greenpeace estimates that British consumers will end up paying £82 billion for the Hinkley plant through their power bills. Whether Greenpeace's numbers are right or not, Ed Davey's statement that the plant would be \"built without money from the British taxpayer\", while technically correct, is misleading. This is no freebie. Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven said: Hinkley C fails every test – economic, consumer, and environmental. It will lock a generation of consumers into higher energy bills, via a strike price that’s nearly double the current price of electricity, and it will distort energy policy by displacing newer, cleaner, technologies that are dropping dramatically in price. \"With companies like Dong Energy now saying the price of offshore wind will drop so much it will be on par with nuclear by the 2020s, there is no rationale for allowing Hinkley C to proceed.\" The briefing document from Greenpeace makes some other interesting points: £92.5/MWh is nearly double the current market price for electricity. Meanwhile the National Audit Office, in its briefing for the House of Commons Energy and Climate Change Select Committee, quoted 2011 revisions to DECC’s costs of nuclear power as being £74/MWh. The original claim of cost in the 2008 White Paper, on which UK Government justified supporting new nuclear, was £38/MWh. The Government contract with EDF for Hinkley is expected to guarantee it a fixed price for 35 years, inflation-indexed until 2060. This is double length of time commitment for renewable energy sources (15 years). The 10% rate of return on investment reportedly given to EDF is double what is offered to renewables. When DECC was challenged over the reduction in the rate of return under the Feed in Tariff (FiT) for small scale solar PV, it stated, “we continue to consider that a significantly lower tariff is needed to provide generators with a rate of return of 4.5% to 5% for well-located installations. We are not persuaded that a higher rate of return would be reasonable given the focus of the FiT’s scheme ... and given the current investment climate.\" Friends of the Earth have also chimed in with a statement. Policy and campaigns director Craig Bennett said: With rocketing gas prices sending fuel bills soaring and fresh warnings over climate change, investment in low-carbon power is crucial - but nuclear power isn’t the answer. The quickest way to end our costly fossil fuel dependency is though energy efficiency and renewable power, not new reactors that will suck up precious investment and take years to complete. Investment in German renewables has led to a massive fall in the wholesale cost of electricity. The Government should be following this example, instead of locking the UK into costly nuclear power for decades. Investors are crying out to develop Britain’s vast renewable energy potential, but they need the confidence to do so. That’s why they want a clean power target in the Energy Bill.” Nick Molho, head of climate and energy policy at WWF-UK, said: Now that the Government has agreed a deal to support to EDF’s proposed new plant at Hinkley, it is essential that clear mechanisms are in place to prevent any future cost overruns from having an impact on the funding available to other low-carbon technologies such as renewables. “This will be key to protect investment certainty for such technologies where there is significant potential to reduce costs, and to support economic growth in the UK without the environmental concerns associated with nuclear power, most notably the absence of a long-term geological storage solution for high level radioactive waste.” The Guardian's Andrew Sparrow is running a wrap up of the reaction to this divisive announcement on the politics live blog. Often politicians are accused – rightly – of being obsessed with the immediate or the short-term: tonight's headlines, this week's GDP figures, next year's elections. But from time to time they take decisions that will last for decades, and today's announcement of the go-ahead for a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C is just such a moment. The full text of Decc's announcement is predictably hyperbolic but there are some key statements to analyse. The Guardian's Damian Carrington was quick to spot the price caveat buried in the notes to editors. According to the press release, the agreement contains: Arrangements whereby the Strike Price would be adjusted downwards to reflect changes to the amount of tax payable by the project company in certain circumstances. Arrangements whereby the Strike Price could be adjusted, upwards or downwards, in relation to operational and certain other costs (including balancing and transmission charges and business rates) at certain fixed points, and in relation to certain future changes in law (including in respect of specific nuclear taxes, and uranium and generation taxes). The government said: Building HPC will have significant benefits for the UK economy, including: A massive investment by EDF Group and its fellow investors of around £16 billion to build the plant. UK companies could benefit from getting up to 57% of the work; 25,000 jobs created during construction, with 5,600 people employed on site at peak of construction, and 900 permanent jobs over 60 years of expected operation; Power provided for nearly 6 million homes, an area almost twice the size of London, with the site meeting around 7% of the UK’s electricity demand when running at full capacity; and A clean, home-grown source of electricity, which will reduce the UK’s emissions by 9 million tonnes of CO2 per year, helping to meet climate targets. Henri Proglio, Chairman and CEO of EDF Group, said: A “Strike Price” of £89.50/MWh fully indexed to the Consumer Price Index. This price benefits from an upfront reduction of £3/MWh built in on the assumption that EdF will be able to share the first of a kind costs of the EPR reactors across the Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C sites. If EdF does not take a final investment decision on Sizewell C, the Strike Price for Hinkley will be £92.50/MWh. The development of Sizewell C will be subject to relevant consent and regulatory and other approval procedures at the appropriate time.\" Energy and climate change secretary Edward Davey has described agreement with French and Chinese contractors to build the UK's first nuclear power station since 1995 as an \"excellent deal for Britain and British consumers\". Davey and prime minister David Cameron said the Hinkley Point C station would provide energy security for Britain and form the foundation of cost-effective carbon reduction. Davey said: For the first time, a nuclear power station in this country will be built without money from the British taxpayer. It will increase energy security and resilience from a safe, reliable, home-grown source of electricity.\" In return for an expected investment of £16 billion, the UK Government has guaranteed French company EDF an energy price of £92.50 per megawatt hour. This 'strike price', for power generated from 2023, is almost double current wholesale energy costs. But the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) released a statement today which said new nuclear power stations could mean a £75 reduction in power bills by 2030. Do the numbers add up? Today I will be speaking to energy policy experts and stakeholder groups and crunching the numbers on the UK biggest energy announcement in almost two decades. You too can help with the investigation. Please write your thoughts in the comments below, tweet me, or email me. If you are quoting figures or studies, please provide a link to the original source.

On Thursday evening, while media attention was gripped by parliament’s vote on going back to war in Iraq, the energy department slipped out the news that it was going to scrap people’s right to block fracking under their homes, despite overwhelming opposition. You might think that burying good news, on the other hand, was bonkers. Yet that is exactly what the George Osborne has done with the UK’s booming green economy, exemplified once again in his speech to the Conservative Party conference on Monday. But not content with just putting the green economy in the shade, I can reveal that the coalition has even decided to stop collecting its statistics on the fast-growing sector. What is Osborne afraid of? That renewables and energy efficiency will be shown to be better better for the economy than the shale gas he once again lavished with hyperbole? Over the lean years of recession, the green economy was one of the few bright lights. The last green economy statistics, published in July 2013 and covering 2011-12, revealed a sector employing a million people - more than teaching. The “low carbon and environmental goods and services” (LCEGS) sector was worth £128bn that year, 8% of GDP. The UK ranked in sixth in the world, a major player in a sector worth £3.4 trillion globally. Even better, the UK green economy was steadily growing at 4.8%, outpacing global growth of 3.8%, and contributing a third of all the UK’s economic growth at that time. For a chancellor who must have woken up every morning for years praying for a glimmer of economic growth, it is astonishing that he continues to ignore the green economy in his speeches. Even worse is the fact that those in the green sector will be pleased to be ignored, if it means Osborne is curbing his tendency to trash talk: “We’re not going to save the planet by putting our country out of business.” His negative words scared investors and put up the cost of green technologies. The Conservative Party conference had already delivered a fresh example of green double standards. The knock-down prices of the 100,000 new homes promised by David Cameron will be achieved in part by exemption from energy efficiency standards: buy now, pay (high energy bills) later. And, as it happens, building services which cut bills and carbon are one of the biggest parts of the green economy. I discovered the demise of the LCEGS data after the non-appearance of the 2014 set in July. After many fruitless enquiries, I winkled out the truth using Freedom of Information laws. I was told the government “will not publish this dataset again”. However, the FOI response continued: “We have commissioned new analysis that won’t be published until later in [2014]. This will provide economic data on low carbon goods and services. However the results will not be directly comparable with the LCEGS report as they will not cover exactly the same sectors and the scope of economic activity captured within a sector will differ.” So the green economy will be measured, after all, but late and in a form that cannot be compared to earlier data. Doesn’t that look like burying good news to you? The most bizarre aspect is that the green economy - frequently innovative, high-tech, disruptive and always looking forwards - seems to be exactly the type of business Osborne wants to encourage. He told the Conservative Party Conference on Monday: “We are living through an economic upheaval as big as the industrial revolution – every single day new technologies, and new companies, and new economies are fundamentally shaking up the established way of doing things. This technology brings intense competition that spells rapid decline for any sector, or any country, that fails to keep up.” Can it really not strike Osborne that this is a perfect description of how clean energy and the fight against climate change are consigning fossil fuels to history? Apparently not. He chose to highlight the “extraordinary shale gas reserves beneath our feet”. He went on to say: “We must learn from the past, not be the past. Decide or decline. That is the choice. We must choose the future.” You could argue that, 60 years on and still nowhere near being commercially viable, nuclear power stations are the past. Not for Osborne. Should “the country that built the first civil nuclear power station not build any more?” he asked rhetorically. Renewables got a one-word mention, after fracking and nuclear. The only explanation that plausibly explains Osborne’s refusal to laud the green economy is that the Tory party’s climate change sceptics just can’t stomach talk of “turbines and targets”, as environment secretary Liz Truss mockingly put it earlier on Monday. “I believe it is perfectly possible for Britain to be the most prosperous major country on Earth. But only if we choose the future not the past,” Osborne said. But unless he finds the courage to disinter the green economy’s good news, his aspiration risks being dead on arrival."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/nov/17/european-leaders-fear-growth-russian-influence-angela-merkel-vladmir-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-17T19:45:50Z","webTitle":"European leaders fear growth of Russian influence abroad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/17/european-leaders-fear-growth-russian-influence-angela-merkel-vladmir-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/nov/17/european-leaders-fear-growth-russian-influence-angela-merkel-vladmir-putin","fields":{"headline":"European leaders fear growth of Russian influence abroad","bodyText":"European governments are increasingly alarmed that Vladimir Putin is building on his destabilisation of Ukraine to extend Russian power and influence within the European Union, targeting the former Soviet bloc countries of central Europe and former Yugoslavia, all of which are in or seeking to join the EU. EU foreign ministers mulled their next moves on the Ukraine crisis in Brussels on Monday after the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, delivered her most robust and pessimistic public condemnation of Putin to date, warning that the Kremlin was seeking to spread its sphere of influence not only in the former Soviet states of Georgia and Moldova, but also to Serbia and Bosnia. The foreign ministers decided to freeze the assets of and blacklist several more Russia-backed separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine, although more substantial penalties for the Russian economy will probably have to wait until the new year. Moscow has notched up notable gains in Hungary, an EU and Nato member, where the government negotiated secret loans from the Russians, awarded nuclear power contracts to the Russian state atomic conglomerate, and where parliament a fortnight ago gave a green light to Russia’s key gas pipeline project in Europe, defying blocking orders from Brussels. In a foreign policy speech in Sydney on Sunday following the G20 summit, Merkel sounded deeply despondent about Putin’s policies and behaviour and gloomy about the prospects of forcing a strategic shift from the Kremlin. “This is not just about Ukraine. It’s about Moldova, it’s about Georgia,” said Merkel. “If things carry on like this … we will need to raise the issue of Serbia, of the states in the western Balkans.” It was the first time a European leader had warned that Putin was seeking to press Balkan states to his side in the worsening tug-of-war in Europe between Moscow and Brussels. “The Ukraine crisis is truly not a regional affair,” she said, voicing incredulity that Putin’s campaign could take place 25 years after Europe’s division into two blocs ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall. “It affects us all … how can something like this happen in the middle of Europe? Old thinking about spheres of influence, trampling international law, must not succeed.” The chancellor, who grew up in communist east Germany in the then Soviet bloc, drew parallels between that experience and Putin’s current strategies. The EU would not yield to Russian pressure, she stated. “Otherwise we would have to say: we’re too weak, look people, we [EU] can’t take any more in, we need to ask Moscow first if that’s okay. That’s the way it was for 40 years and I really don’t want to go back there.” Merkel’s gloom was all the more striking for coming directly after she spent four hours in private with Putin at the G20 summit in Brisbane. Without aides or translators present, the two leaders talked until 0130 in the morning in Putin’s hotel, joined halfway through only by Jean-Claude Juncker, the new head of the European Commission. Afterwards Merkel said that “nothing has changed”. West European and American worries that Moscow is successfully buying, bribing or bullying support for expansionist influence within the EU is most apparent in Budapest, where Viktor Orbán, the prime minister, strongly opposes EU sanctions against Russia and is busy striking deals with Moscow. The Slovak leader, Robert Fico, is also a sharp critic of EU sanctions. Slovakia and Hungary are EU and Nato members. Both are heavily dependent on Russia for energy supplies. The same applies to Bulgaria, while Serbia, the Serbian half of Bosnia and Macedonia are all being wooed or intimidated by the Russians. In a speech in July Orban denounced the west European democratic model as an obsolete failure and held up Putin as a template for a modern successful leader. In January he met Putin in Moscow secretly, secured a €10bn line of credit from the Russians, and awarded contracts to Moscow for the building of two new reactors at Hungary’s sole nuclear power plant. Hungarians found out when the news was posted on the Russian government website. “That was the moment it became clear to Hungarians that Orban is friends with Putin. That was a big surprise,” said Bernadett Szel, an opposition MP who sits on the parliament’s national security committee but who has been unable to gain access to the contracts awarded to the Russians. “Maybe it was unexpected that the deal was reached,” admitted Zsoltan Kovacs, an Orban spokesman, adding: “The contracts are signed.” The Orbán government recently announced it is pushing forward with a Russian joint venture to build part of the Southstream gas pipeline, the key project pushed by the Russian gas monopoly, Gazprom, to pump gas supplies under the Black Sea and up into Europe via the Balkans, bypassing Ukraine. The scheme is vehemently opposed by Brussels, which has already pressured Bulgaria into not taking part and is currently leaning on Serbia, which is negotiating membership of the EU. In September, days after meeting the head of Gazprom, Orbán announced that Hungary was refusing to “reverse-pump” Russian gas back to Ukraine, ditching an EU policy aimed at keeping Ukraine partly supplied should the Russians close the taps to Kiev. “The worry that Hungary could be a Trojan horse for the Russians in the EU is just nonsense,” said Kovács. But anxiety about Orban’s tilt towards Moscow has brought ferocious criticism of his democracy record from the Americans who blacklisted six Hungarian government officials for alleged corruption last month, uniquely for an EU or Nato government. “The Americans have been worried for a long time,” said a European ambassador in Budapest. “Now they are getting vocal.” Last month Putin went to the Serbian capital Belgrade where he was feted with a military parade. Energy supplies and debt owed on gas already supplied were used by the Russians to try to get the government in Belgrade to move ahead on Southstream, according to sources in Belgrade. The Serbs have stalled, playing for time or one side off against the other, with Brussels warning them that a green light would complicate the EU negotiations. Hungary and Serbia are also said to have agreed to store large volumes of Russian gas, securing supplies for themselves should a recent Moscow-Kiev-EU agreement on energy provision and payments break down this winter and also enabling Moscow to maintain some supplies to Europe without pumping via Ukraine. A German foreign ministry document, reported by Der Spiegel on Monday, warned that Moscow was using gas supplies and military ties to draw Serbia into its orbit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/sep/26/labour-conference-2017-former-scottish-labour-leader-says-corbyn-partly-to-blame-for-brexit-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-09-26T17:27:31Z","webTitle":"Labour conference: Corbyn says Brexit has some 'positives' and he's not planning second referendum - live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/26/labour-conference-2017-former-scottish-labour-leader-says-corbyn-partly-to-blame-for-brexit-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/26/labour-conference-2017-former-scottish-labour-leader-says-corbyn-partly-to-blame-for-brexit-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Labour conference: Corbyn says Brexit has some 'positives' and he's not planning second referendum - live","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has said that he is not planning a second referendum on Brexit, but has refused to rule out Labour backing one. He has also said there are some “positives” from leaving the EU. (See 3.09pm.) Corbyn has said antisemitism is “completely at odds with the beliefs of this party”, saying Labour was “not a nasty party”, a day after delegates attended a fringe meeting where a speaker said free speech should include the right to question the Holocaust. Labour is to adopt tough new rules to tackle antisemitism following a heated debate at the party’s annual conference, but some activists have accused the party of policing “thought crime”. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, has said Labour will reverse £500m cuts in funding for Sure Start centres. Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, has said the party will force gambling companies to pay a levy to fund research and NHS treatment to help problem gamblers deal with their addiction. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. A delegates comes up to point out that Watson’s speech was only supposed to last five minutes, but stretched to 22 minutes. Watson had been expecting to speak mid afternoon, but then it was decided that he would come on at 5pm. He did not start until almost 6pm because the session overran. It was the graveyard slot. Watson was one of the very many Labour MPs who refused to support Corbyn when his leadership was challenged last summer, and it seems that the Corbyn loyalists in charge of the conference scheduling haven’t forgotten ... After Watson finished he was joined on stage by the whole shadow cabinet, to pose for pictures alongside Jeremy Corbyn. There was some “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn” chanting too. And this is how Watson wound up his speech. It ended up a bit Richard Curtis .... Winding up my speech last year, I predicted an early election. In which, I also said, we’re going to give the Tories the surprise of their lives. Well conference, we did it. Jeremy, you did it. So this year I’m going to go out on another limb. Yes, there’s hard work to do and no, we mustn’t be complacent, but Jeremy Corbyn has broken the spell of fear the Tories sought to cast on this country. He has helped us all to remember that politics should be about inspiring hope, not peddling despair. He has shown us again what a real alternative to Toryism looks like and what it can achieve. And because of that, I tell you, Conference, Jeremy Corbyn will be our next prime minister ... Politics now is a fight between those who want to be feared and those who’re not frightened to love. Britain’s run out of patience with the tin-pot Machiavellis. Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Liam Fox and the rest of you: your time is up. This country is ready for change. Ready to throw off the shackles, to turn back the tide; ready to do the right thing and to do the thing right. In place of fear, love. Conference, Britain is ready for Labour. Love wins and so will we. Watson says Labour will soon publish the report from the commission into the future of work he announced at last year’s conference. It was chaired by Helen Mountfield. Watson says all workers should get employment rights. So let’s extend employment rights to all workers in the gig economy - the self-employed, agency workers and contractors as well as the traditionally employed. Let’s stop dancing on the head of a legalistic pin about when is a job not a job and when is self-employed not really self-employed. It’s a fake fight which big business always wins and Tory governments love to hide behind. Watson turns to the election. He says: This year’s election showed that real change is possible. We can and we will form a radical government which does things differently. We have the imagination; we have the drive; we have the momentum. The final pun (Momentum) gets a laugh in the conference, not least because Watson once described Momentum as “a bit of a rabble”. Watson turns to Uber, which Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, did not mention in his speech. Watson says: Uber, you’re becoming the perfect picture of how the future gig economy must not look. You may think you’re immune because your friends in the Tory party run Britain and its newspapers. You know the Tories don’t care about level playing fields and orderly markets. They don’t care about consumer protection. They certainly don’t care about workers’ rights. But they don’t run London - and that’s where you make your money. Watson says as culture secretary in a Labour government one of his early priorities will be tackling problem gambling. The damage to the families of gambling addicts can be terrible. Yet some gambling firms, driven by greed, are deliberately targeting our poorest communities. We now know that when vulnerable people try to opt out of online gambling, companies don’t always block their accounts as they should. Gambling companies are even harvesting data to deliberately target low-income gamblers and people who’ve given up. As Mike Dixon, boss of mental health charity Addaction says, “gambling addiction tears lives and families apart. It’s outrageous that an industry with a £13bn revenue contributes less than £10m to treatment”. Well Mike, I can tell you that a Labour government will introduce a compulsory levy. Can you imagine the uproar if the drinks industry started targeting Alcoholics Anonymous by selling drink outside AA meetings? We wouldn’t tolerate that - and we shouldn’t tolerate the same kind of behavior by some bookmakers. And addicts must be given the help they need. Gambling addiction is an illness and it’s about time it was taken seriously. So I can announce today that, together with Jonathan Ashworth, our shadow health secretary, I’m launching a thorough review of gambling addiction in this country and current provision for treatment on the NHS ... Our review will look at how best to fund NHS treatment and help free problem gamblers from the destructive cycle of addiction. My message to gambling firms today is clear: stop targeting vulnerable people. Start acting properly. And meet your obligation to help those whose lives have been blighted by addiction. You can do it now, because it’s the right thing to do. Or you can wait for the next Labour government to do it for you. Oh and by the way, the same applies to the organisations that run football in this country. If you won’t ban football clubs from signing shirt sponsorship deals with betting companies - Labour will. Watson says Labour would ban football clubs from signing shirt sponsorship deals with betting companies. A Labour government would introduce a compulsory levy on the betting industry, Watson says. Labour will review gambling addiction and how it is treated by the NHS. Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader and shadow culture secretary, is delivering his speech now. Near the start Watson tried to get the audience joining in with the chant, “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn.” His stunt fell flat, because very few people joined in. Here is the passage. Machiavelli’s famous advice was that it’s better to be feared than to be loved. This mantra runs as deep in the Tory party as blue through a stick of Brighton rock. Fear is how they win. Fear is how they govern ... Mrs May, the Tory party was never loved. But you were happy to be feared. It worked for you. Well not any more. 15 months in, you still seem as dazed as on day one. Caught between your enemies and, even worse, your friends. Caught in the headlights. Living on Boris time. As shadow culture secretary, I’ve got one of the best jobs there is. When I get invited to the theatre or to the cinema or, yes, to Glastonbury, I get to say I’m only there for work. And one of the most surreal moments of my political life happened to me late at night, in a field, surrounded by people much younger and far more stylish than me. I realised something as the crowd at Glastonbury’s silent disco began to sing: “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn....” And as they sang, I realised it’s actually better to be loved than to be feared. And Jeremy has shown us that it’s possible. In his Sky News interview Faisal Islam pointed out to Jeremy Corbyn that last year Corbyn said he was not in favour of a “cult of personality”. How was that going, Islam asked. Corbyn he often felt “deeply embarrassed” by all the personal attention he was getting. I often feel deeply embarrassed by it. It’s not my wish, not my doing. Richard Leonard, the leftwing candidate in the Scottish Labour leadership contest, and the favourite, has announced that two more unions are backing his candidate: Unison and the bakers’ union, BFAWU. That means he now has six unions backing him. His rival, Anas Sarwar, has not been backed by any union. Here is the Laura Kuenssberg’s full BBC interview with Jeremy Corbyn. And here is Faisal Islam’s interview with Corbyn for Sky News. Barbara Keeley, the shadow minister for mental health and social care, told the conference in her speech that Labour would set up a national care service, spending £3bn a year on it at the start. She said: A service in which we pool the risk of high care costs so that no-one is faced with catastrophic costs as they are now. In its first years, our national care service will receive an extra £3bn in public funds every year: Enough to place a cap on what individuals have to pay towards care Enough to raise the asset threshold for paying for care Enough to provide free end of life care To act on our pledge, we will invite an independent, expert panel to advise us on how we move from the current broken system of care to a sustainable service for the long term. Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, has just given a speech moving an emergency motion on assaults on emergency service workers. Most of his speech was about the Grenfell Tower fire. He said people had been criticised for “politicising” the fire. But it happened as a results of decisions taken by politicians. He said politicians should be summoned to give evidence to the inquiry. But he said that, if it became clear to the FBU and community representative that “the whole thing is working towards a whitewash”, the FBU would consider withdrawing cooperation from it. We need to ask questions about the privatisation and deregulation of building controls, of fire risk assessments, the destruction of the fire inspecting role within the fire service, the elimination of publicly funded fire research within the UK, the abolition of national standards within the fire service. We have to look at why housing becomes more and more a commodity for the production of profit for developers. We need to look at why local authority funding is cut as never before, the fire service is cut as never before. And when regeneration means forcing out working class communities out of our city centres and into other areas. Wrack also spoke about the Grenfell Tower fire at a fringe meeting last night, saying it was a crime that should bring down the government. Scottish Labour leadership candidate Anas Sarwar has called for the “spirit of the rules” of the contest to be respected amid claims there could be a trade union stitch-up in favour of his rival Richard Leonard, the Press Association reports. PA says: The Jeremy Corbyn-supporting Leonard said he was “delighted” to have received support from all the unions that had so far declared, including Unite, the UK’s largest. He said the rules of the leadership contest had been agreed and it was wrong to “call foul” after the decisions had been taken. The two rivals to replace Kezia Dugdale were taking part in a hustings at the Labour party conference following a report in the Huffington Post that Unite had signed up 2,700 members to the union’s political levy - a payment that makes them eligible to vote in the leadership contest - in just two days last weekend. The Herald newspaper reported sources close to Sarwar warning that Scottish Labour activists “wouldn’t take kindly” to any attempt by Unite to return the party to “a branch office”. At the hustings, Sarwar said he wanted more people to join Labour or sign up as supporters in order to vote in the contest. But he added: “Through that process we have all got to make sure we play by the rules - that’s in terms of the written rules and also the spirit of the rules as well. “As long as all of us do that I have no problem with more Unite members or any other trade union members joining this process, voting in this contest and hopefully then engaging with us as well as we return a UK Labour government and also a Scottish Labour government, too.” At the hustings in Brighton, organised by the Daily Record, Leonard said: “The trade unions are going through due process of deciding who it is they are going to back and I don’t think it’s right to call foul about those rules after decisions have been taken. “If there’s a problem with the rules you should say that there is a problem with the rules up front.” He added that Unite’s support came following a hustings and it was “not a decision taken by Len McCluskey”, the union chief who is close to Corbyn, but rather by the “rank and file” of the organisation in Scotland. At the Brighton event, Sarwar said he would not be afraid to clash with Corbyn if it was in the interests of Scotland. “That’s not to say we are going to pick deliberate fights with the UK Labour party of Jeremy Corbyn,” he said. “It’s about saying in a grown-up environment, with an autonomous Scottish Labour party not being a branch office ... that we can take different decisions in Scotland that are right for Scotland’s interests.” Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, delivered one of the best received speeches of the conference a bit earlier. Here are the key points. Ashworth said Labour would reverse the marketisation of the NHS. Our NHS is undermined by millions of pounds wasted on endless tendering of services to private providers. It is patient care that suffers. Let me give a quick example, an ambulance contract here in Sussex handed to a private company who didn’t own any ambulances so they sub-contracted to 20 other companies. Two ceased trading, and ambulances drivers couldn’t be paid. Thankfully the contract was taken back off private hands. I had the privilege of meeting those ambulance drivers recently. They continued taking patients to appointments for 8 weeks without pay. Doesn’t that show public service is about a greater calling, is about compassion, care and public duty, not contracts, markets and commercialisation. So a Labour government will legislate to reinstate the Secretary of State’s duty to provide universal care, we’ll reintegrate the NHS, reverse the Health and Social Care Act, fight fire sales of hospital assets and end Tory privatisation. He said he would introduce a national strategy to help the children of alcoholics and drug users. This year £43m will be slashed from alcohol and drug addiction treatment services. Recently, I chose to speak out very personally about my own circumstances, growing up with a dad who had a drink problem. He was an alcoholic. His drinking hung over my childhood with the fridge empty other than bottles of drink. His drinking became so bad in his final years he couldn’t bring himself to come to my wedding because he felt too embarrassed. I tell this story not for your indulgence or sympathy. But because 2 million children grow up with an alcoholic parent, 335,000 children grow up with a parent with drug abuse issues. So as part of our assault on child ill health, I will put in place the first ever national strategy to support children of alcoholics and drug users and we’ll invest in addiction treatment and prevention as well. He said Labour would allocated an extra £45bn for health and social care. There would also be a new £500m “emergency winter fund”. Here’s a clip from Naomi Klein’s speech. In his TV interviews Jeremy Corbyn has also said antisemitism is “completely at odds with the beliefs of this party”, saying Labour was “not a nasty party”, a day after delegates attended a fringe meeting where a speaker said free speech should include the right to question the Holocaust, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. In the various interviews he has been giving today, Jeremy Corbyn also defended John McDonnell’s decision to talk about the possibility of a Labour government facing a run on the pound. (See 1.18pm.) Asked about McDonnell’s comments, he said: What he is doing is saying we look at all scenarios that may affect a Labour government. It is worth seeing these things through. Surely that’s what an opposition serious about getting into government wants to do ... Now, today, in the Treasury, there is a whole team of brilliant people looking at speculation against the pound and runs on the pound that might affect our economy. John is making the point that we have got to look at all these things and all these scenarios. Asked if he thought there would be a run on the pound if he came to power, he replied: There’s been a run on the pound for the past two years. In an interview with 5 News, Jeremy Corbyn was asked about North Korea, and whether he thought President Trump was as bad as the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Corbyn replied: I think he has responded more than over the top in this matter. Surely reaching out would be a good thing? There were suggestions that for quite a while there was a private channel of communication between the US and North Korea. I would suggest they open up any channel of communication they can. Jeremy Corbyn has played down the prospect of the party offering a second referendum on the Brexit deal, after mayor of London Sadiq Khan suggested it was “possible” it might be included in the next Labour manifesto (see 2.49pm), the Press Association reports. And in comments which may dismay Labour supporters of EU membership, the party leader said that he saw “positives” in Brexit, PA says. Speaking to Sky News, Corbyn stressed that Labour had always made clear it accepted and respected the result of last year’s referendum to leave the EU. He said: We are not planning any referendum. Sadiq is obviously thinking through all scenarios and possibilities. He represents a city which overwhelmingly voted for Remain. As you know, the referendum result across the country was a majority to leave. Corbyn’s answer is in line with what the party has said before, but it is significant that he is not ruling a second referendum out. Asked on Five News whether he saw any opportunities for Britain from EU withdrawal, Corbyn said: I wouldn’t go so far as to say that it is all going to be positive. It is going to be difficult and complicated. But there are positives there. EU withdrawal would allow powers to be devolved from Brussels to Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and English regions, he said. The writer and activist Naomi Klein finished her speech to the conference a few minutes ago. She was speaking in the slot reserved for an international visitor. The full text of the speech is here, and it is worth reading. The passage that went down best was probably this one, where she described Jeremy Corbyn and his Labour party as an inspiration to progressives around the world. The public is hungry for deep change - they are crying out for it. The trouble is, in far too many countries, it’s only the far right that is offering it, or seeming to, with that toxic combination of fake economic populism and very real racism. You showed us another way. One that speaks the language of decency and fairness, that names the true forces most responsible for this mess - no matter how powerful. And that is unafraid of some of the ideas we were told were gone for good. Like wealth redistribution. And nationalising essential public services. Now, thanks to all of your boldness, we know that this isn’t just a moral strategy. It’s a winning strategy. It fires up the base, and it activates constituencies that long ago stopped voting altogether. If you can keep doing that between now and the next election, you will be unbeatable. You showed us something else in the last election too, and it’s just as important. You showed that political parties don’t need to fear the creativity and independence of social movements - and social movements, likewise, have a huge amount to gain from engaging with electoral politics. That’s a very big deal. Because let’s be honest: political parties tend to be a bit freakish about control. And real grassroots movements ..... we cherish our independence - and we’re pretty much impossible to control. But what we are seeing with the remarkable relationship between Labour and Momentum, and with other wonderful campaign organizations, is that it is possible to combine the best of both worlds. If we listen and learn from each other, we can create a force that is both stronger and more nimble than anything either parties or movements can pull off on their own. I want you to know that what you have done here is reverberating around the world - so many of us are watching your ongoing experiment in this new kind of politics with rapt attention. The Evening Standard has splashed on a story about Labour figures pushing for a second referendum on Brexit. As well as quoting Kezia Dugdale (see 8.38am), it also features an interview with Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London. Khan’s direct quotes in the story are relatively non-committal, but the paper says he does not see how “any Brexit deal emerging ... would be good enough to accept without offering a second referendum”. It also says Khan will push for a commitment to a second referendum being included in the next manifesto (although presumably by then it could be too late.) While the idea of a vote on continued single market membership post-Brexit might have been quashed at the conference, the party’s soft-Brexit-backing MPs are not giving up. I was at a fringe event dedicated to debating single market membership, where two of the strongest voices on the issue, Alison McGovern and Chuka Umunna, explained why they disagreed with the official Labour managed ambiguity over the issue. McGovern said do she feared a hard Brexit would be disastrous for manufacturing in her Wirral South constituency. She said: If you’re one of my constituents who produces wings of planes for Airbus you will see the obvious nightmare of a bureaucratic barrier that could stop your part of the high-tech, high value aircraft being able to join its fellow components in Toulouse to make the aircraft that Airbus produce right across the European Union. McGovern said such a Brexit could finish off the process of destroying industry begun by Margaret Thatcher. For me this is absolutely personal - it is about the fortunes of our constituents, And people should remember that. I’ve seen this before. When I was growing up I watched the shipbuilding industry collapse in Birkenhead when Campbell Laird was closed. I do not want the situation for my community, the people I love, to be that Brexit finishes what Thatcher started. Umunna said it seemed strange to debate domestic issues sat the conference when Brexit – which would affect these so much – was sidelined. He said: Although there have been attempts to segregate Brexit from domestic issues and the radical policy agenda at the Labour party movement, they are the same thing, which is why the shenanigans that went on around the Brexit motion - which would have made the control freaks of the New Labour era blush - was so ridiculous. This argument that somehow debating the NHS is more important than, and disconnected from, Brexit is ludicrous. Survation has released a new poll for LabourList. It has Labour two points ahead of the Conservatives (41% to 39%), and would result in Labour being the largest party in a hung parliament, Survation says. When Tory HQ wants to put out a press release bashing Labour, it normally quotes a humbler backbencher (often James Cleverly, for some reason). Cabinet ministers are mostly deemed too grand for this sort of low-level hit job. But CCHQ has just sent out a press notice with a quote from Philip Hammond, the chancellor. He has picked up what John McDonnell said about the election of a Labour government leading to a possible run on the pound. (See 1.18pm.) McDonnell said he did not think it was likely, but he did acknowledge it is a possibility. In response Hammond said: After giving his conference speech, the shadow chancellor privately conceded the disastrous effects that Labour’s plans would have on Britain’s economy – a collapse in business investment and a crash in the value of the pound, causing a shock wave of inflation. Labour’s plans would go too far, and ordinary working people will end up footing the bill. The afternoon session of conference will start soon, and at some point the vote will be taken on the party rule changes debated earlier. The changes proposed by the NEC will go through easily. In an interview on the World at One Jon Lansman, the founder of the pro-Corbyn group Momentum, said that allowing candidates to stand for the leadership with the backing of just 10% of MPs and MEPs, not 15% as now, was a step forward. But he said he would like to go further. Asked if he would like to see the threshold reduced to 5%, he said. I think it [10%] is a good step forward. But, yes, I would like it to be as open as possible, so that all members can be confident ... that they’ve got someone for them on the ballot paper who speaks for them. He also welcomed the new, tighter rules covering antisemitism. I think we’ve showed today in the debate we’ve had, which is one of the best debates we’ve had on antisemitism in the party, shows that there is a universal opposition to antisemitism. I’m delighted we’ve agreed the national executive committee rule change on antisemitism, not just on antisemitism, on all manner of discriminations and hate. And actually the debate was good because people listened. There were different views about some aspects, and they were expressed, and people listened attentively and respectfully. And, asked about the abuse directed at the BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg by some pro-Corbyn supporters online, he said: I’m appalled by the need for that. I know she has suffered from threats], as have many Labour MPs, particularly women. I think the abuse and hate on social media is a problem in our society. He also said some “really quite awful” abuse was directed at people by rightwingers on Tory websites. Jeremy Corbyn may not have given an interview to the Today programme (see 10.33am), but he has been interviewed by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. The Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn has posted a picture, showing her bodyguard looking on. The Jewish Labour Movement has complained about the allegation in the debate this morning about Labour rule changes that it colludes with the rightwing media. (See 11.52am.) In a Twitter thread Richard Angell, director of Progress, the group seen as “centrist” or “moderate” or Blairite, also complains about this comment, and others in the debate. Christopher Hope, a Telegraph journalist who covered the antisemitism story in today’s paper, and included a quote from the Jewish Labour Movement chair Jeremy Newmark, dismisses the suggestion that his story came from them. John Prescott, the former deputy prime minister, has told ITV that he backs John McDonnell’s proposal to wind up PFI contracts. Prescott was in government when the Blair government massively expanded the PFI programme originally introduced by John Major’s government. Prescott said that initially PFI was useful, but that it should never have been used for the NHS. He told ITV: All our problems on this have largely come from health. It meant you built a huge debt up on public borrowing requirement and it’s crucifying our health system. I thought it was wrong there, evidence shows it’s wrong, but you can be much more intelligent about private and public money coming together to help the public services. At a fringe meeting last night John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the party had to be ready for the possibility of a run on the pound if it takes office. As the BBC reports he said: We’re not going to be a traditional government; we’re going to be a radical government. We’re going to face all the challenges ... and we’ve got to scenario-plan for those, bringing the relevant expertise together at every level to talk through what happens if there is such and such a reaction. What if there is a run on the pound? What happens if there is this concept of capital flight? I don’t think there will be, but you never know. Rayner says Labour’s proposed national education service won’t stop at 18. It will make further education more available. And Labour will invest £1bn making T-levels (new technical qualifications) “a true gold standard”. Our national education service will be lifelong, providing for people at every stage of their life. And the national education service won’t stop at eighteen, or sixteen. Further education isn’t just for those who ‘didn’t get the chance’ to go to university; it serves the majority of young people. They too deserve a world-class education. She says today she is publishing a 10-point draft charter for the national education service. Rayner says Labour would fund the full £13bn needed to modernise school buildings. Instead of wasting millions of pounds on an inefficient free schools programme, we will provide funding to ensure our schools are safe – that flammable cladding can be removed, sprinklers installed and asbestos cleared. Rayner says she would allocate £10m a year from the education department’s budget for free sanitary towels “to end the scandal of period poverty in our schools”. Rayner says she is publishing a plan for free childcare. The Tories promised free childcare to the children of working parents. They promised over 600,000 places. But they created less than a quarter of them. The most disadvantaged aren’t even eligible and costs are rising more than twice as fast as wages. Today, we are publishing a report setting out the alternative. Free, high-quality early education, universally available for every two to four-year-old, and extra affordable care for every family, saving them thousands of pounds a year. So our children will be ready for school. And when children arrive, they won’t be let down for a lack of resources there either. Rayner says Labour would introduce a national education service. She says she has personal experience of how politics can make a difference to people’s lives. When I became pregnant at sixteen, it was easy to think that the direction of my life, and that of my young son, was already set. My mum had a difficult life, and so did I, and it looked like my son would simply have the same. Instead, the last Labour government, through support of my local Sure Start centre, transformed my son’s childhood, and made sure that his life would not have to be as hard as mine had been. So when I say that politics changes lives, I say it as someone whose own life was changed. Rayner says since 2012 £437m has been cut from the Sure Start budget. Labour would reverse those cuts, putting in an extra £500m a year, she says. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, is speaking now. She says it has been a surprising day. Theresa May started it by warning of a coalition of chaos. Now she leads it. And her education ministers have spent the last few months ripping up their own manifesto page by page. They wanted to open new grammar schools. But they can’t. They said they’d build 140 free schools. They couldn’t. They pledged the healthy pupils fund would not fall below £400 million. Now it will. They promised they’d provide free school breakfasts. But they won’t. When we beat them on tuition fees, they refused to accept it. Instead they will just stop turning up for votes. They’ve gone from running the place to running away from the place. In fact, I went through their manifesto line by line. There are more education policies that they are reviewing or abandoning than they are actually implementing. Later today the US department of commerce will release its preliminary findings into a complaint about Bombardier, the aerospace company. Boeing has complained about the amount of state aid Bombardier has received. Potentially 1,000 jobs at a Bombardier plant in Northern Ireland are at risk, and delegates have been debating an emergency motion on this from Unite. Unite’s assistant general secretary Tony Burke said: We call upon the British and Canadian governments to meet with Boeing to resolve this crisis. Workers in Belfast are holding their breath. The prime minister and the government need to make it clear to Trump they will not stand back and watch our members jobs and our communities threatened like this. Mrs May needs to stand up for our members in the aerospace industry and for decent jobs and for manufacturing in the UK. Clive Lewis, the former shadow business secretary, told a fringe meeting this morning that trade unions which are involved in the nuclear industry have become “a voice for big business”. He singled out GMB for being too close to the nuclear lobby and said it was not speaking up for renewable energy because it does not have members there. He also questioned why unions “fight to the bitter end” for the arms industry. His comments reflect tensions within the Labour movement over union support for nuclear power and a nuclear deterrent. GMB, Unite and Prospect have tens of thousands of members in the nuclear and arms industries. Lewis told a fringe event on energy: One of the problems with where trade unions are at the moment is that they have been so weakened that I think they have become, and have been used by big business as, a voice for big business. Because big business understands that if you have a unionised workforce they also become spokespeople for you. They create a situation where you have a wide and broad spectrum politically of people supporting your particular position. On nuclear, yes, GMB and other unions are staunchly supporting it because the jobs there generate union members. Contrast that to the highly self-employed solar sector, the unions have no trade unions there. They are not speaking up at all for them. UPDATE: The GMB union has responded to Lewis’s comments. A spokesperson said: We’ll put copies of the Uber and Addison Lee judgements in the post for Clive. He can have a read about what taking on big business and organising ‘self-employed workers’ really looks like. Our energy workers keep the lights on. Of course we want more renewables - and we want good renewable jobs here in the UK - but right now they don’t exist because the government isn’t investing. GMB will always stand up for our members and their jobs - that’s who we speak for, that’s what a trade union does. Long-Bailey ended her speech announcing a review of alternative models of ownership. We’ll ensure that workers themselves can have a stake in our industrial journey alongside business. Imagine if the technology which allows us to hail a taxi or order a takeaway via an app was shared by those who rely on it for work. They would have the power to agree their own terms and conditions and rates of pay, with the profits shared among them or re-invested for the future. That’s why we are today launching a Report on Alternative Models of Ownership. To start asking fundamental questions about how we achieve real diversity of business in the digital age, and how to ensure that it’s enormous potential benefits serve the many, not the few. Amongst the applause, someone started chanting “Oh, Rebecca Long-Bailey” to the tune of the Jeremy Corbyn/Seven Nations Army chant. Long-Bailey says Labour’s industrial strategy will be even more transformative than Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal. We’ll restore the rights of workers – rolling out sectoral collective bargaining and guaranteeing unions access to the workplace – to ensure that new technology is not just an excuse for disgraced old employment practices. Because there is nothing cutting edge about hire-and-fire, casual contracts. We’ll create the conditions for business to make those really ‘transformative’ discoveries which can change all our lives for the better, with an industrial agenda that is so transformational, it will eclipse the new deal set out by Franklin D Roosevelt in the history books. We’ll bring investment in research and development in line with other major economies and create national missions to deal with the big issues of our time And our National Education Service will allow every single person in this country to obtain the skills they need to thrive in a modern economy and ensure real diversity in our workplaces. Long-Bailey says she has just turned 38. Twenty years ago, when she was 18, you had to dial up the internet, she says. The pace of change we have seen in the last 20 years will pale in comparison to the next 20. Over the last few centuries, we have gradually learnt how to transfer more and more human skills to machines. With current technological breakthroughs, we are, for the first time, designing machines that do cognitive and non-routine work. Machines that think! But, with some estimates suggesting that half of all jobs could be lost to automation, and that few businesses are ready to harness change, it also brings the threat of rising poverty and inequality. There is no doubt about what the digital age will look like under the Tories: monopoly profits for the few, and increased exploitation for the many. Only Labour will ensure that workers and businesses are equipped to enjoy the prosperity this changing economy can bring. Long-Bailey says the UK is “standing on the precipice of the fourth industrial revolution,a pace of technological and digital change so immense it will leave you feeling dizzy.” It will transform industry, it will transform our economy. And it has the potential to transform the quality of life of every single person in Britain. But it will only do this if a Labour government is holding the reins. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, is speaking now. She starts by talking about her father, who had a job in Salford unloading oil tankers. My dad’s work was unskilled, but it paid well. My parents even managed to get a mortgage for their own little house. And from poverty-plagued childhoods, which made the film Angela’s Ashes look like an advert for a luxury minibreak, they felt proud of their achievement! And that was true of so many working class people right across Britain, for the first time in history they were truly being offered the chance to aspire! But under Thatcher industries such as my father’s were put into what is so callously called ‘managed decline’. It meant factories shutting their doors, firms moving abroad or simply closing down, lower wages for those who could still find work, and cuts to benefits for those who couldn’t. The debate on the rule changes is over. Delegates will vote just before lunch. Jim Kennedy from the national executive committee is now responding to the debates. He says proposed rule changes used to be seen as the most boring item on the conference agenda. He says the fact that the debate has been so lively shows how lively internal democracy in the party now is under Jeremy Corbyn. Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi, a delegate from Chingford and Woodford Green, says the Jewish Labour Movement would have more credibility if it did not keep “running to the Daily Mail and the Telegraph with stories”. She says there was a proposal for the new rule to talk about incidents “motivated” by hostility or prejudice etc. But this was rejected, and the proposed NEC rule (see 11.12am) talks about incidents “that might reasonably be seen to demonstrate” hostility etc. There is an important difference. She also objects to the reference to “holding” beliefs. Expressing beliefs is one thing, she says. But holding them? That’s thought crime, comrades, and we can’t be having it. Sara Callaway, a delegate from Hampstead and Kilburn, says Labour delegates must be free to speak up for the Palestinian people. And Labour cannot be a party that includes “groups that support an apartheid state, wherever that apartheid state is”. She also complains that BAME members were not consulted about the proposed rule change. Zach Murrell-Dowson, from Bristol North West, says antisemitism is the only form of bigotry where a common response, when complaints are made, is not to accept them, but to question the motives of the complainant. He says the NEC proposal does not go far enough. He urges delegates to abstain, and calls for a card vote so that the abstentions can be counted. James Cleverley, a delegate from Wrexham, says he is opposed to lowering the proportion of MPs and MEPs needed for an endorsement to stand for the leadership. At 15%, Labour already has a low threshold, he says. He also says the 15% rules has generally not stopped leftwing candidates standing in the past. His speech provokes a smattering of jeering, and he only gets limited applause at the end. Philip Cohen, a councillor from Finchley and Golders Green, backs the proposed rule change covering antisemitism. He says too many Labour voters in Barnet turned away from Labour because it thought the party was not taking antisemitism seriously. He says Labour members support the two state solution. And many Labour people in Barnet supporters do not support the actions of the state of Israel, he says. Joy Bratherton, a delegate from Crewe and Nantwich, is speaking now about a proposal from her CLP, and four others, for potential leadership candidates to require the support of just 5% of MPs or MEPs, not 15% (as now) or 10% (as the official NEC motion proposes). She says she will “remit” her motion (not put it to a vote) to avoid creating a split. But she is doing so reluctantly, she says. She says Jeremy Corbyn has been campaigning for more Labour democracy for 40 years, and cutting the threshold to 5% is in line with what he has been calling for. The current Labour party rules say, in clause 1, section 8: No member of the party shall engage in conduct which in the opinion of the NEC is prejudicial, or in any act which in the opinion of the NEC is grossly detrimental to the party ... The NCC [national constitutional committee] shall not have regard to the mere holding or expression of beliefs and opinions. The NEC proposal, backed by the Jewish Labour Movement, would replace that with a new section 8 saying: No member of the party shall engage in conduct which in the opinion of the NEC is prejudicial, or in any act which in the opinion of the NEC is grossly detrimental to the party. The NEC shall take account of any codes of conduct currently in force and shall regard any incident which in their view might reasonably be seen to demonstrate hostility or prejudice based on age; disability; gender reassignment or identity; marriage and civil partnership; pregnancy and maternity; race; religion or belief; sex; or sexual orientation as prejudicial to the party; these shall include but not be limited to incidents involving racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia or otherwise racist language, sentiments, stereotypes or actions, sexual harrassment, bullying or any form of intimidation towards another person on the basis of a protected characteristic as determined by the NEC, wherever it occurs, as conduct prejudicial to the party ... The NCC shall not have regard to the mere holding or expression of beliefs and opinions except in any instance inconsistent with the party’s aims and values, agreed codes of conduct, or involving prejudice towards any protected characteristic. A delegate is now attacking the way Labour MPs mobilised against Jeremy Corbyn last year. There were accepted ways of challenging a leader, and those should have been used instead, he said. Mike Katz from the Jewish Labour Movement says the antisemitism rule change should have been adopted last year. But he is pleased it has now been backed unanimously by the NEC and is backed by Jeremy Corbyn. We need to win seats like Hendon, Finchley and Golders Green, Chipping Barnet, Harrow East and seats across north London and around the country if we’re to rid this country of the awful Tory government. So repairing the once-strong relationship between our party and the Jewish community, where we share so many shared values, is a political imperative as well as a moral one. This rule change is about so much more than just antisemitism. It’ll give us the power to put a stop to the misogyny, the homophobia, the racism that can creep into our party. Speaking up against bullying and bigotry - that is our tradition, those are our values, and I want to be able to show the country that those values endure and they’re important today as they ever were. That is why Jeremy Corbyn supports it. Katz says under the current system, members are expelled for backing another party. But it is not so clear what happens if they engage in hate speech. He says the rule change will close a loophole that allowed people to engage in hate speech if they were expressing sincerely held beliefs. He says there is nothing wrong with criticising illegal settlements. There is nothing wrong about legitimate criticism of the Israeli government or illegal settlements. JLM members do it all the time, often in strident debate - because as we say, when you have Jews you have at least three opinions. But you don’t need to use anti-Semitic language and stereotypes to engage in that debate and that’s what we need to deal with. Leah Levane, a delegate from Hastings and Rye, says her constituency Labour party (CLP) proposed an alternative rule change covering antisemitism and other prejudicial conduct. But the party refused to discuss it with them, she says. Now the NEC is saying their proposal should be voted down. She says the Jewish Labour Movement (which backs the official rule change) does not speak for her, or everyone in the party. The Jewish Labour Movement has every right to organise in this Labour Party. The right they do not have is to speak for me, the other Jewish members of Hastings and Rye and many other Jewish Labour members in this place. They do not speak for me and part of what we were proposing was to make sure not only on the issue of anti-Semitism... on any issue, that you take a sounding on a wide range of views. And we have proof from the response to Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi’s fabulous speech yesterday, and from the phenomenal launch of our organisation last night with standing room only, with Ken Loach, trade union leaders like Len McCluskey and Tosh McDonald promising support, that we know those other Jewish voices exist. She says people should be free to criticise “the despicable behaviour of the state of Israel towards the Palestinian people.” But she says she will “remit” her motion - ie, withdraw it, rather than push it to a vote. Hastings and Rye don’t want to be seen as “splitters”, she says. Jim Kennedy, a member of Labour’s national executive committee, is opening the debate. He says the NEC is proposing three rule changes: one would add four new seats to the NEC (three for constituencies, one for the unions; the second would reduce the proportion of supporting MPs and MEPs needed for someone to stand as leader, from 15% to 10%; and the third would tighten disciplinary rules. There are another 10 proposed rule changes from constituency parties that the NEC wants delegates to vote down. The actress Frances Barber posted a message on Twitter yesterday says she was leaving the Labour party. Earlier she retweeted this Daily Mirror story about Labour and antisemitism. And she added this comment. At the conference Labour delegates are just starting their debate on party rule changes, including on measures to tighten Labour rules on anti-semitism. According to Paul Waugh’s HuffPost UK Waugh Room briefing, Jeremy Corbyn may end up getting through the entire conference without giving an interview to the Today programme. Waugh says: I’m told that Jeremy Corbyn was expected on the Today programme for a live interview this morning but his team made clear last night he wasn’t doing it. If the impasse remains, it means for the first time ever, there will be no Labour conference leader interview on the Radio 4 flagship show. Team JC tell me no interview was ever “agreed or arranged … no pull out, that’s simply not true”. But another source suggested senior Labour figures were unhappy because Today had yesterday failed to ask McDonnell about his overnight trail of the credit card cap policy. Diana Holland, the Labour party treasurer, is presenting her report to the conference now. She says 10 years ago the Labour party was in debt to the tune of almost £25m. But last year, for the first time since the 1960s, the party was debt free, she says. She says the party’s finances are “strong and stable”. And every penny donated for campaigning is spent on campaigning. She said Labour had more than £2m set aside for the local and mayoral elections in May. And, when the snap election was called, it was able to start immediately with a budget of £3.5m. She says Labour’s donations during the election came from “the many, not the few”. On one day £470,000 was donated. A woman delegate at the conference speaking from the platform has just collapsed. A stretcher is being called to help her, the conference has been told. Owen Smith, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, has suggested that Northern Ireland should be allowed to remain as part of the EU after Brexit. As the Times (paywall) reports, Smith floated the idea at a fringe meeting as a means of resolving the dilemma about how to implement Brexit without resulting in the introduction of some form of border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Smith said: What I am increasingly convinced of myself is we will need . . . to be much more imaginative and much more concrete in what we offer. Does it mean Northern Ireland needs to remain within the EU and as part of Britain, and with people being able to identify within Northern Ireland as Irish? I think that is the space we need to be in. I do not see another solution that allows for a different outcome. However, according to the Times, Smith also conceded that he was “not entirely sure” how this would work in practice. In his morning interviews Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, also spoke about the plan to wind up PFI contracts announced by John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, yesterday and about the NHS. Ashworth played down suggestions that the Labour policy would result in most PFI contracts being wound up. He said only a “handful” of contracts were causing significant problems for the NHS. When he was asked if this meant only a handful would be returned to the public sector, he replied: I’m not going to make a sort of hypothetical guess of how many contracts will be [brought back in-house]. There are a handful of hospital trusts who have got a problem with their deficits and their financing which is because of the PFI contract they are in. Here is the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Ashworth’s comments. Ashworth also accepted that winding up PFI contracts could take years. When it was put to him that the policy might take years to implement, he replied: Yes, this could take some time, this is not a thing that happens overnight. He said ideally he would like NHS spending to increase by 4% every year. But he said he could not commit to this at that stage. I strongly believe as the health secretary, we should be giving the NHS 4% a year and I want us to work towards getting back to that. But I cannot say on day one of a Labour government that it will definitely be 4%, because we have to manage the public finances prudently. He would not back calls for a cross-party dialogue about reforming social care. He was happy to talk to other parties about this issue, he said. But, when asked why he was not actively promoting the idea, which is being pushed in particular by the Lib Dem health spokesman Norman Lamb, he replied: Tell me a formal cross-party process that has ever succeeded. The BBC’s Norman Smith points out that social care has become less of a priority for Westminster anyway in recent months. UPDATE: The Manchester Evening News’ Jennifer Williams points out that Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has also proposed cross-party talks on social care. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, was planning to talk about the NHS in his morning interview round, but he has found himself fielding a lot of questions about the Daily Mail splash. Today one of the proposed rule changes being debated by the party will tighten the party’s rules on anti-semitism. Proposed by the Jewish Labour Movement, it will remove a defence that “the mere holding or expression of beliefs and opinions” cannot be a disciplinary matter, which JLM members have argued has led to a more lenient approach to members accused of being anti-semitic. The Mail story is based on what was said by some people attending a conference fringe meeting on the theme: “Free speech on Israel: why we oppose the witch hunt”. The Mail claims that “activists applauded panellists at a fringe meeting who likened supporters of Israel to Nazis”, that some said the JLM should be expelled from Labour and that “one speaker even suggested Labour should be free to debate whether the Holocaust had happened.”. Asked if the remarks had given concern to those at the top of the party concern, Ashworth told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “Yes, yes it has.” He went on: And I think party members who make anti-Semitic remarks, who make some of these disgusting Holocaust denial statements, they shouldn’t be in the party, they should be expelled. ... If any of those people who are named, are making these statements, they shouldn’t be in the Labour party. The Jewish Labour Movement has long been involved in the party for donkey’s years and they should remain in the party for years to come as well. Labour sources said the party was not responsible for the content of fringe events staged by groups that had no affiliation to the party. A party spokesman said: Labour condemns anti-Semitism in the strongest possible terms and our national executive committee unanimously passed tough new rule changes last week. All groupings in the party should treat one another with respect. We will not tolerate anti-Semitism or Holocaust denial. The 2015 and 2016 Labour party conferences both took place after divisive leadership contests. This year, in public at least, the party is remarkably united, and you might think that there is no sign of a leadership contest at all. But there is a contest underway, for someone to replace Kezia Dugdale as Scottish Labour leader, and today Dugdale has today used an article in the Daily Record to challenge the party position on Europe and to revive recriminations about the EU referendum. Here are her main points. Dugdale, the former Scottish Labour leader, said Jeremy Corbyn was partly to blame for Britain voting to leave the EU. I blame David Cameron for calling a referendum no one wanted in the first place but I also blame my party, the Labour Party, for a totally lazy and lacklustre Remain campaign that got us here. And yes, I blame Jeremy Corbyn too for failing to use the power of his popular appeal to convince traditional Labour voters to see that Europe creates more good than harm. She criticised the party for not committing itself to keeping the UK in the single market. Not only that, now the country has spoken, I’m embarrassed by the complete paucity of my party to say and do the right thing no matter how hard or unpopular that might be at first. Seriously, Labour have just denied their own members a meaningful vote on the issue of Brexit at party conference – whatever happened to straight-talking, honest politics ... I have long believed that Labour should be making a full-hearted, passionate case to retain full tariff-free access to the single market – the equivalent of membership. And we should accept all the conditions that come with that, including the free movement of labour. (Dugdale’s point about members being denied a meaningful vote is not really fair; delegates did not get a meaningful vote at conference because those delegates themselves voted not to have one - albeit with implicit leadership approval.) She said Labour should back a second referendum on leaving the EU if the alternative is leaving the single market. And should we fail [to get the government to keep the UK in the single market], the biggest test for Labour has yet to come because leaving the EU without access to the single market is not what I believe the country voted for. If that happens then Labour must insist that the final Brexit deal goes to another public vote to be ratified or rejected. Ireland wouldn’t think twice about doing this. If the UK Parliament and the other 27 nations of Europe get a final say on the deal, why shouldn’t we? This morning Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, has been doing a round of media interviews. As Jessica Elgot reports, he is urging the government to commit a £500m “winter bailout fund” for the NHS over the coming months, citing party analysis suggesting 10,000 people a day will wait at least four hours for A&amp;E treatment this winter. I will post more from what he has been saying shortly. Here is the conference agenda for the day. 9.30am: Conference opens, and delegates debate a series of changes to party rules, including those relating to leadership elections, the composition of the national executive committee and anti-semitism 10.45am: Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, opens a debate on investing in the future. 12.30pm: Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, speaks. 2.15pm: Naomi Klein, the writer and activist, delivers a speech as the international guest speaker. 2.30pm: Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, speaks. 5pm: Tom Watson, the deputy leader, speaks.

Here's chancellor George Osborne's take: \"If it wasn't Chinese investment or French investment, it would have to be the British taxpayer. I would rather British taxpayers were spending their money on our schools and hospitals and those things, and let's get the rest of the world investing in our energy.\" Put like that, you might assume UK taxpayers have hit the jackpot, that EDF of France and China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGNPC) will bear all the financial risks and that energy bills in the UK are bound to fall sometime around 2020 as cheap nuclear energy comes on stream. Forget it. The UK will be agreeing to buy electricity from Hinkley Point for 35-40 years at £93 per megawatt hour or thereabouts, according to the whisper from Westminster. That is roughly twice the current market rate for electricity, and far in excess of the £40 per megawatt hour that was airily waved around by the Department of Energy only half a decade ago. Nuclear power, it seems, can only be bought at a cost roughly equivalent to on-shore wind, complete with its subsidies to landowners. Maybe that is the price that has to be paid for secure low-carbon supplies, but at current energy prices, the first impact of Hinkley Point will be to add to consumers' bills, just as wind does today. \"In the long term,\" the chancellor continued, new nuclear should lead to \"lower and more stable energy bills.\" The key phrase there is \"long term\". The claim rests on the assumption that the costs of other sources of energy will continue to rise and make £93 appear a bargain sometime in the future. That assumption may or may not prove correct – but coming from a government that supposedly thinks fracking will revolutionise the energy market, it's a strange argument to hear. But is £93 the real cost anyway? The devil will be in the detail of this contract – specifically, in the indexation formula for the strike price. If Hinkley Point's entire output is tied to the rate of inflation for 40 years, we could be staring at a truly astronomical cost by the end of the contract. \"The government surely can't be that dumb,\" comments one City analyst. One assumes not. But what proportion of Hinkley Point's operating costs and uranium purchases will inflate automatically? The answer is critical to any assessment of value for money. So, too, is the size of the loan guarantees given to EDF and the Chinese. If they amount to 70% of the debt raised to fund the £14bn construction costs of two reactors, the UK taxpayer is firmly on the hook. And, given that EDF's recent construction experience in France is massive cost over-runs, is the UK backstopping that risk as well? The Department of Energy and Climate Change refuses to comment until the talks are completed, but Steve Thomas, professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, has a blunt assessment of where negotiating power lies: EDF has the government \"over a barrel\" and the contract may be an \"absolute disaster\" for taxpayers. Strictly speaking, judgment must be reserved until the contract is signed and published. But Osborne's Chinese spin should make us nervous. How is it meant to be good news that, among all the possible sources of capital to partner EDF at Hinkley Point, we have ended up with a company controlled by the Chinese Communist party? Remember the history here. Centrica, the UK's supposed energy champion, dropped out of the EDF-led consortium, preferring to take a £200m hit than continue down a nuclear path where the costs and risks only ever seem to increase. In the face of homegrown scepticism, guarantees from the UK taxpayer have now persuaded Beijing to climb aboard. This does not sound like a triumph in the making. It sounds instead like the latest instalment in the 30-year saga of the UK's shambolic and short-termist energy policy. Cable's defence of Royal Mail price doesn't wash It's onwards and upwards for Royal Mail's shares. A price of 500p was passed on Friday, completing a 50% advance from the flotation price of 330p a week ago. Still, at least business secretary Vince Cable is now trying to explain why the government sold at a price that looks a gross under-valuation. One of his arguments is that the Communication Workers Union soured sentiment among City investors by calling a strike ballot. Sorry, but this doesn't wash for a couple of reasons. First, as Cable's letter to the business select committee states, Royal Mail's management concluded \"in the second half of August\" that a ballot was likely. So, if the government really deemed the threat of a strike to be a game-changer, it could have delayed a float that was finally announced only on 12 September. After all, the public commitment at the time was only to complete the privatisation by spring 2014. Second, City investors were bound to jump on any excuse to lobby for low pricing. Behind the scenes though, few investors regard strike action, which has now been called, as a life or death struggle for Royal Mail. The calculation remains that the CWU's hand is weak since the offer of a pay rise of 8.6% over three years will look good in the eyes of, say, NHS nurses. The business select committee, when it cross-examines Cable and government adviser Lazard, should stick to the heart of the matter: demand for shares from institutions was strong at 330p, so how hard did the government push for a higher price to protect the public purse? An assessment \"of where demand would taper off\" was made, Cable says, adding: \"A number of the key long-only accounts expressed concern over the possibility that the top of the range might be revised above 330p.\" Well, yes, the institutions would say that, wouldn't they? The job of Lazard and bookrunners Goldman and UBS was to establish whether this \"concern\" was bluster. The MPs should keep pressing. Is tax too taxing for Barclays' finance director? If you are the group finance director of a major bank, filing your tax return ought to be a doddle – a minor chore to be completed in a couple of hours on a wet Sunday evening. So why does Tushar Morzaria, Barclays' new finance director, need an annual allowance of £25,000 to cover the cost of help in filing his return? The entitlement was a curious detail in Morzaria's contract revealed on these pages this week. OK, the new recruit is coming from the US, which may complicate his employment status. But for £25k, you could hire a senior partner in a leading accountancy firm for a few days. Can it be that complicated? The explanation, apparently, is that the arrangement is par for the course among international companies whose executives have to work in more than one country. The employer doesn't want the embarrassment of a big cheese failing to pay the right amount of tax. The good news for Barclays shareholders is that the allowance lasts for only three years. After that, the bank's top numbers man will have to conquer HMRC's website all by himself. No, Ahrendts is not 'transitioning' Sound advice from Terry Smith in his latest dispatch to investors in his Fundsmith fund: be wary of management gobbledygook, because it usually represents \"a combination of woolly thinking and a desire to disguise or divert attention from a problem\". He cites the example of US retailer Walmart, which used the term \"leverage\" 80 times in a recent results presentation. One could offer other examples. Try the headline on this week's announcement from Burberry: \"Angela Ahrendts transitions from Burberry.\" No, Ahrendts is not transitioning – she has quit to join Apple. \"This CEO transition is a natural progression,\" continued chairman Sir John Peace. He sounds overly anxious to claim that the promotion of chief designer Christopher Bailey, who will retain his old job as well as succeeding Ahrendts, represents business as usual. No wonder Burberry investors are alarmed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/apr/29/countries-that-lead-the-switch-to-clean-energy-will-reap-the-financial-rewards","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-29T14:58:29Z","webTitle":"Countries that lead the switch to clean energy will reap the financial rewards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/29/countries-that-lead-the-switch-to-clean-energy-will-reap-the-financial-rewards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/apr/29/countries-that-lead-the-switch-to-clean-energy-will-reap-the-financial-rewards","fields":{"headline":"Countries that lead the switch to clean energy will reap the financial rewards","bodyText":"Silicon Valley start-ups are proud of their fast-paced culture and being first movers in creating new product categories and markets. UN climate change summits are the opposite: they sit and discuss the risks of being first movers by transforming our energy systems to reduce emissions and protect our planet, but only the proverbial second mouse gets the cheese. Silicon Valley treasures those who take risks, fail fast and iterate – at this year’s Paris climate change summit we need to adopt more of this approach. The stance developing nations often take at international climate negotiations is that the rich got rich burning coal and oil, so why should poorer countries sacrifice their economic development for the good of future generations? Better to get rich via fossil fuels now even if we roast later, the logic seems to go, despite UN envoy on climate change Mary Robinson recently making the case for developing countries skipping straight to renewable power. Meanwhile, coal companies have successfully persuaded some developing countries’ governments to buy into the notion that fossil fuels are essential to tackle energy poverty and US Republicans have long argued the US doesn’t need to tackle its polluters until developing countries cut their own emissions.But the whole debate rests on a falsehood. The reality is that acting to protect the climate does not impose a financial penalty. Being one of the first countries drastically reducing its emissions is not a disadvantage. Both developed and developing nations are moving rapidly to renewable energy sources, not because it is morally the right thing to do, but because it’s the route to prosperity. The numbers show that there is a strong first mover advantage. South Africa is using solar and wind to meet its capacity shortfalls faster and more cheaply than new coal or nuclear facilities could. This already saved the country $69m (£63m) in 2014, created jobs and local industrial capacity. With proposed coal plants on hold because of their soaring costs, South Africa commissioned 79 renewable energy projects, totalling more than 1GW. That is roughly a nuclear power plant-sized chunk of capacity, but a new nuclear plant would take 10 years to build and cost $6 per watt according to one recent estimate. Coal, long thought of as dirt cheap, comes at $2.30 per watt. In contrast, the Chinese will be selling solar panels for $0.42 per watt this year. South Africa’s renewable capacity will hit 5.24GW within a year, up from nothing in 2012, with another 6.3GW to be commissioned in 2015. No fossil fuel technology can scale this quickly. Across the Atlantic, Brazil’s commitment to biofuels and hydroelectricity made it independent of imported oil in 2006. Since 2009, Brazil has been adding solar and wind energy, contracting 14GW of wind power at prices below any other option. In 2014, at prices only a bit higher, Brazil also brought on almost 1GW of solar energy. As the severe drought drives Brazil’s electricity prices higher, industries eager to have access to reliable and affordable power are turning to renewables. The biggest user of energy, China, is also becoming the world’s renewable energy powerhouse. Growing its installed solar capacity by two orders of magnitude within only four years, China went from a capacity of 0.3GW in 2009 to 13GW by 2013 and is now preparing to install 17.8GW of new solar energy for 2015. China burns a lot of coal, but its Green Horizons program has committed to clean the air in its cities and cut carbon intensity by 40 to 45% from 2005 levels within the next five years. So far in 2015, China’s coal imports already fell by 42% compared to 2014. As hundreds of entrepreneurs around the world bring renewable electricity to the poorest people on the planet, at prices less than they had been paying for kerosene or other fuels, the renewable power future is inevitable. Juan Rodriquez’ company, Quetsol, sells solar electric light to thousands of Guatemalan villagers beyond the reach of the electricity grid. He bundles solar panels, light, and phone charging into a mobile money system that connects poor villagers to modern finance, empowering and enriching their lives. Practical Action, founded by the author of Small is Beautiful, E F Schumacher, has done similar work for years, enabling villagers to preserve food 10 times longer through evaporative cooling, providing irrigation and renewable energy technologies, and locally-developed finance programs. Similarly, SELCO India, a solar electric light company, is delivering a renewable future today, not as aid, but as a $3m a year business with no government subsidies. With 25 centres across India, SELCO has brought to 35,000 homes and businesses inexpensive lighting, communication technology, water pumping, water heating, refrigeration, computing and power for clinics as well as for entertainment. With the ability to light even one bulb, villagers can provide light for silk worms which are needed for silk production, looms, and moveable lights that can go from room to room as needed, providing villagers with an income. Imagine a world in which no family needs to burn smoky dung or wood or oil lamps for light, where wireless digital communications are available to everyone, and where women and young people have illumination to become literate, and businesses have abundant, affordable power. Imagine societies that not only save money by investing into renewable energy production, but in doing so decrease their political dependency from oil and coal rich neighbours and improve the physical health of their citizens. This is the real first mover advantage for developing countries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/oct/03/new-uk-nuclear-power-station-setback","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-03T10:33:21Z","webTitle":"New UK nuclear power station plans suffer setback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/03/new-uk-nuclear-power-station-setback","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/oct/03/new-uk-nuclear-power-station-setback","fields":{"headline":"New UK nuclear power station plans suffer setback","bodyText":"Plans for new nuclear power stations in the UK have suffered a setback as Chinese financial backing for two new reactors has failed to materialise, and a bid by French nuclear group Areva has not been submitted. In March, German utilities E.ON and RWE scrapped plans to build two new reactors at Wylfa in Wales and Oldbury in Gloucestershire, inviting bids for the project, called Horizon Nuclear Power, with a deadline last Friday. On Wednesday, French nuclear engineering group Areva told the Guardian that it had dropped its interest – in partnership with the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group – in bidding for Horizon. \"Areva and CGNPC have suspended their interest in the planned sale of Horizon Nuclear Power and did not submit a bid,\" an Areva spokeswoman said, adding that the company was still committed to new nuclear in the UK through other avenues. Areva's withdrawal leaves bids by a consortium led by US nuclear engineering company Westinghouse – reportedly without the involvement of the China National Nuclear Power Corporation, as has been previously floated – and one by Japan's Hitachi, whose nuclear techonology is not yet licensed for use in the UK. A decision is expected within weeks, but if either failed to proceed because of financial or other challenges, that would leave EDF as the main developer committed to building new nuclear reactors in the UK. The French state company already owns and operates eight of the UK's 10 existing nuclear power stations, and is due to make a final investment decision on a new reactor at Hinkley Point in Somerset by the end of the year. EDF has also been in discussions with Chinese state corporations over funding new reactors in the UK, while UK government officials flew to Beijing in September to hold talks on energy collaboration between the UK and China, including new build nuclear power. The other project eyeing new nuclear in the UK is NuGen, owned by Spain's Iberdrola and France's GDF Suez, which is considering new reactors in Cumbria and says it will make a decision by 2015. This week, three councils, Cumbria county and Allerdale and Copeland districts, delayed a decision on new nuclear waste sites - due in October - until January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/may/11/amber-rudds-appointment-as-climate-secretary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-11T11:45:32Z","webTitle":"New UK climate secretary Amber Rudd: 'really green and no-nonsense'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/may/11/amber-rudds-appointment-as-climate-secretary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/may/11/amber-rudds-appointment-as-climate-secretary","fields":{"headline":"New UK climate secretary Amber Rudd: 'really green and no-nonsense'","bodyText":"At the very least, those concerned about global warming and the green economy can take heart from the fact that David Cameron has not appointed a climate change sceptic as secretary of state for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (he has form). Amber Rudd says climate science is “compelling” and has spoken strongly of the need for a strong deal at a crunch UN summit in Paris in December. But there appears to be much more to be optimistic about than that, with her appointment meeting with broad approval from green business and campaigners. Firstly, she was climate change minister for almost a year before the election, meaning she can hit the ground running in the tortuous but crucial climate change negotiations. One government insider told me she is “really green and no-nonsense” and can get things done, adding that her past experience as an investment banker and businesswoman will be useful in delivering the huge investment needed in the energy sector. The key will be whether energy and climate change policy is run from Decc or the Treasury. Rudd was first elected as an MP in 2010 and rose quickly, becoming a parliamentary private secretary to chancellor George Osborne and then assistant whip. Being relatively close to the chancellor will be vital in getting Rudd’s energy policies through, but another former Decc minister and windfarm opponent, Matt Hancock, is said to be closer to the chancellor. Rudd, MP for Hastings and Rye, frequently quotes Margaret Thatcher when asked about the Tory attitude to climate change. “The first world leader to speak about climate change at the UN was Margaret Thatcher and she of course was a scientist and the science is completely compelling. If I’m challenged on it by any of my own party – although I haven’t been – I would say ‘I’m a Thatcherite – aren’t you?’” she told Business Green in 2014. So, despite having been barred by Michael Gove from going the UN climate talks in Peru in December, it seems likely Rudd will push hard for a deal to cut emissions. But her admiration of Thatcher may well prove more divisive in other areas. She is a strong believer in business and markets as drivers of change, rather than regulation and government intervention. The balance between those two approaches is at the heart of arguments about how to fight climate change and also how to ensure the UK’s energy system is simultaneously low-carbon, affordable and secure. A looming problem is the much-delayed EDF nuclear power station that Rudd backs. Despite the promise of vast subsidies, the deal is still not finalised. Rudd’s instincts will not be to throw even more billpayers’ money at the problem, but losing the station would leave a big hole in the UK’s energy plans. Just before the election, Rudd said: “We will continue to take action to protect the environment as part of our long-term economic plan for green jobs and growth. However, we will do it in a way that represents the lowest possible cost to consumers - through bearing down on the costs of green energy, driving greater innovation and working with business to deliver solutions.” Championing the fast-growing green economy will be vital - it was barely spoken of by the Tory part of the coalition. But the “lowest possible cost” promise is directly contradicted by the Conservative’s own manifesto, which pledged to halt subsidies to new onshore wind farms, the cheapest renewable energy available. Rudd’s business-centred approach will also be challenged by the need to continue to increase the energy efficiency of the Britain’s cold and leaky homes. It’s the cheapest way of all to cut carbon emissions and tackle fuel poverty, but the coalition’s market-based approach, the Green Deal, was a complete flop. Most insulation was delivered by forcing the big energy companies to do it. A Tory aversion to regulation also rules out improving building regulations to provide warmer homes. However, sources have told the Guardian that Rudd does place a high priority on delivering energy efficiency. The attitudes of Rudd’s ministers will be important but there could scarcely be less unity of purpose than there was under the coalition, where windfarm-averse Tory ministers were sent into Decc to fight LibDem energy secretary Ed Davey. Greenpeace called Rudd’s appointment hopeful while Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “The appointment of Rudd is significant in that it shows that the Conservative Party leadership retains its commitment to policies based on sound climate science.” Whether that commitment survives better than Cameron’s pre-2010 election slogan of “vote blue, go green” remains to be seen. Updated 15:00: Liz Truss remains Environment secretary; Greg Clark replacing Eric Pickles at Communities and Local Government; Oliver Letwin to run Cabinet Office. Liz Truss, who was promoted to environment secretary after Owen Paterson’s sacking in July 2014, is to continue in the post. Truss has been an enthusiastic backer of British farmers and food but has been much less vocal on the natural environment. Truss has said the highly controversial badger cull will be rolled out more widely. Most farmers support the cull, aimed at curbing tuberculosis in cattle, but scientists have declared it ineffective. The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was heavily cut in by the coalition and, as an unprotected department, faces further cuts. With the large flood defence budget now set till 2020, other areas are likely to suffer. Former Communities and Local Government secretary Eric Pickles was widely loathed by the renewable energy industry for repeatedly overruling planners to turn down onshore wind farms. Greg Clark, by contrast, earned a reputation as a calm and thoughtful shadow energy and climate change minister up to 2010 and saw through controversial planning rule changes with huge fuss during the coalition government. Planning decisions relating to fracking and new airports will test Clark. But he may bring a more evidence-based approach to rubbish collections than Pickles. The promotion of Oliver Letwin to full cabinet member and in charge of Cabinet office is another boost for green businesses and campaigners. Letwin is seen as one of the most environmentally friendly Conservative MPs.

Harris writes that he “does not want to live in a world like that”, in which people like Gill Pharaoh decide to end their lives rather than cope with old age, and in which they do not want to “be a burden”. First, could we please acknowledge that just as there are a wide range of physical experiences of old age, so there is a wide range of intellectual and psychological attitudes towards death and dying. For every admirably physically and mentally spry nonagenarian, there are dozens who are mentally and physically impaired, bored and lonely. Of the latter, there are probably a majority whose urge to remain alive is strong, and who should receive the best palliative and social care possible. But there are also those like myself, who are not afraid of the idea of death, but who do fear mental and physical disability and who, yes, do not want to be a burden. Could we also please consider what “being a burden” means to people like myself (and probably Gill Pharaoh)? It is not a spirit of abnegation that drives us – it is the objection to lack of control over our own lives, which old age and ill health are highly likely to incur. Oliver Burkeman tells us that having control in one’s life is fundamental to happiness. In some of us this need overrides the fear of death. In others it doesn’t. Please don’t presume to make value judgments or decisions for all of us equally. Gabi Duigu Cammeray, New South Wales, Australia • Midwives help us into this world when at our most vulnerable. Let us give a title to someone helping us at our next most fragile stage in life.

Simon R Wilkinson Bekkestua, Norway Migrants and the EU With regard to British foreign secretary Philip Hammond’s comments about African migrants threatening Europe’s standard of living (14 August), I live in Baden Württemberg in south-west Germany, which at the moment is receiving hundreds of refugees every day. This is unprecedented, but by the vast majority of the population, they are welcomed, provided with food and accommodation, and treated with respect. Meanwhile, the British government accepts far fewer refugees, describes the refugees in Calais in very insulting terms and refuses to work with other Europeans countries in seeking a common, fair and humane response. Does it not occur to the British cabinet that people do not leave their homes and undertake perilous journeys that often take much more than a year, simply to seek a better standard of living? Do they also not realise that the actions of European governments and the multinational companies to which they give shelter have contributed very greatly to the economic misery and the tyrannical governments from which they are escaping? Three refugees with whom I spoke recently, one each from Togo, Nigeria and Gambia, were unanimous in saying that, in their opinion, if they so chose, European countries could exert such positive political and economic influence in their countries that no one would need to flee. But is that what our governments really want? Keith Lindsey Winnenden, Germany • In your front page article The Europeans offering aid (7 August), you mention that British prime minister David Cameron was intending to work “hand in glove” with the French for a solution to the serious and growing refugee problem at their borders. However, you neglected also to mention Cameron’s recent broadcast explicitly offering a resolution to the existing situation on his own border. Watching Mr Cameron’s broadcast, I found it grotesquely ironical to hear the head of a Nato nation proposing to increase funding for the building of better fences and an additional wall, all patrolled by sniffer dogs, in order to prevent young, foreign refugees from entering Britain after having possibly fled from a country on which Nato bombs may have earlier been dropped. My own country, Canada, another bombing Nato member, should also be doing its utmost to provide transportation, money and easy entry into our own huge, welcoming country, as it did successfully for the Vietnamese “boat people” after the devastating events there many years ago. Concern, positive effort, and money from all responsible countries must be directed to the help of desperate refugee people, without qualification, now! David Darvill Cobble Hill, British Columbia, Canada Nuclear threat remains In Alex Wellerstein’s Comment article Five ways the nukes could still be used (14 August), the fifth way – by accidental nuclear detonation – omitted what may well be the most likely accident to happen. About 10% of the 15-18,000 nuclear weapons are deployed in “Launch on Warning” mode. Under this protocol, if a nuclear threat is detected the nuclear power will respond within 15-20 minutes, before the missiles arrive on their targets. Military personnel must be so well trained that they will never mistake a suspicious shadow on their monitor for a nuclear missile. Colonel Stanislav Petrov of the USSR on 26 September 1983 used his own instincts, against protocol, not to respond to a “missile launch” that later turned out to be a computer malfunction. Given the high rate of psychological invalidism in missile personnel, this sort of accident is a real possibility. It is sobering to know that at the recent five-year review of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty the five great nuclear powers refused to rescind this policy. Dr John Bury Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada Corbyn can open up debate Jeremy Corbyn’s possible election as leader of the UK Labour party (7 August) gives me hope because, unlike the other candidates and the Labour grandees who have recently weighed into the fray, he is prepared to refute the Thatcherite doctrine that “there is no alternative”. I do not worry greatly that Corbyn might not be media friendly – who wants a leader of whom most of today’s popular media would approve? Nor do I worry that he may not appear pro-business, when the business world simply perpetuates the myth that a competitive market dominated by global corporations is the only economic model on offer. Nor do I worry that he is against Trident, when a nuclear war would be the end of civilisation. I simply want a party leader on the English scene who, like Nicola Sturgeon of the Scottish National party, can open up a far more penetrating debate than currently passes for “received wisdom” as to how we can build a just, peaceful and sustainable world in the years to come. David Clark Bakewell, UK Flight attendants’ rights As I read the article about flight attendants at Qatar Airlines (3 July), I felt like I had travelled back in time to the 1950s. I worked as a flight attendant for 43 years. I started with Pan American World Airlines in 1969. After Pan Am ceased operations in 1991 I continued with another airline until I retired two years ago. I witnessed dramatic changes in flight attendants’ lives. The elimination of age and weight restrictions, marital status, and the inclusion of paid maternity leave were the result of the unions’ efforts on our behalf. They negotiated improved work rules and filed lawsuits to end discriminatory practices. As a result, flight attendants are now like other workers. They marry, buy homes, raise children and send them to college, and contribute to the economy. The flight attendants at Qatar Airlines need a good union, but it does not seem likely that will happen. Ann Blumensaadt Greenwich, Connecticut, US Briefly • Jessica Murphy, reporting on the federal election campaign in Canada (14 August), propagates the myth that “the NDP [dropped] references to socialism from the party constitution in 2013”. In fact, the 2013 preamble states that “New Democrats seek a future that brings together the best of the insights and objectives of Canadians who, within the social democratic and democratic socialist traditions, have worked … to build a more just, equal and sustainable Canada within a global community dedicated to the same goals.” It is clear and resonant language of which the NDP can be proud.

Driven by rapid expansion in developing countries, new installations of carbon-free renewable power plants in 2014 surpassed 100,000 megawatts of capacity for the first time, according to the Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment report. It appears that renewable energy is now entering the market at a scale that is relevant in energy industry terms – and at a price that is competitive with fossil fuels. The numbers are compelling. Renewables such as wind, solar and biomass generated an estimated 9.1% of the world’s electricity in 2014, up from 8.5% in 2013, according to the report. These sources made up the majority of new power capacity in Europe, and also brought electricity to new markets. They also caught the eyes of investors: in 2014, energy investment in rose 17% over the previous year, surging to $270bn, according to the report. Conventional wisdom meets unconventional growth Some experts still predict that fossil fuels will supply the majority of our energy for decades to come, but the evidence strongly points in another direction. As the Global Trends report points out, the clean energy investment that funded almost half of all new power plants in 2014 came at what would, seemingly, be a very bad time for renewables. While oil prices were rapidly falling and China’s coal consumption was decreasing, both commodities were, if anything, more economically viable. But at the same time, renewables appear to be increasing rather than decreasing in competitiveness. For example, a large-scale solar plant in Dubai has recently bid to provide electricity at less than $0.06 per kilowatt-hour. To put this in context, this is less than what the vast majority of consumers around the world pay to keep the lights on. It’s a third of the cost of electricity in Africa. Grid parity for solar is already available in many countries; in others, it’s just around the corner. In developing countries, where renewables are best positioned to address the chronic lack of energy access, clean energy investment rose 36% to $131bn. It’s well on track to surpass investment in developed countries, which amounted to $139bn last year. When it came to investment, China led with $83bn in clean energy funding, but many other countries followed closely behind. Some of the most promising states – like Brazil, India and South Africa – are expected to lead the way. Others, like Kenya, which boasts one of the largest solar rooftop system on the continent and shortly the largest wind farm, are more of a surprise. It’s hard to overstate how vast and impressive this change is. In the first years of this century, it was simply unthinkable that, between 2004 and 2011, 70% of new power capacity added in Europe would come from renewable energy sources. For that matter, the 100,000 megawatts of renewable capacity that were added around the globe in 2014 are equivalent to the total installed nuclear power capacity in the US. To some extent, comparing the capacity of US nuclear installations to that of renewable installations across the world is comparing apples and oranges. While the capacities are comparable, the actual energy generation likely isn’t. That said, it’s clear that the world is finally producing renewable energy at an industrial scale. Bloomberg’s New Energy Finance 2030 Market Outlook reflects this: it forecasts that the capacity of new renewable installations, including large scale hydro, could outpace that of new fossil fuel power plants by threefold over the next 15 years. A change in perspective The interest in clean energy has spread to every corner of the globe, undermining the long-held assumption that a strong economic future is reliant on fossil fuels, particularly in the developing world. The technology evolution that dropped the cost of solar modules by around 75% between 2009 and 2014 is now being followed by political and financial initiatives that are further driving down costs. South Africa, Brazil, China and India have developed new policy approaches for auctioning off power concessions. Today, those mechanisms are spreading to Europe. Meanwhile, America’s big banks are bundling thousands of rooftop solar systems into Wall Street-friendly investment opportunities. On the other end of the economic spectrum, crowdsourcing and community financing is also taking hold and driving growth at the grassroots level. One of the next big steps for government will be removing or redirecting state support for mature and profitable fossil fuels. According to the IEA, fossil fuel subsidies totaled an estimated $550bn in 2013, more than four times those for renewable energy. If we redirect most of the estimated $36tn that will be invested in energy infrastructure over the coming two decades into clean energy, the transition to a green economy could be realized far more quickly than most imagine today. Beyond all the numbers, though, there’s also an intangible energy building behind renewables. Simply put, people are inspired by clean energy and realize that it’s an idea whose time has come. Right now, for example, two pilots are attempting to circumnavigate the Earth in an airplane powered only by the sun. Tackling a feat that not long ago would’ve been considered impossible, they have combined the best solar technology with the most efficient motors and materials to take their plane, the Solar Impulse, on an epic, clean energy voyage. The clean energy future isn’t just possible and desirable – it’s essential. On a vital, basic level, our decisions and actions will determine whether the Anthropocene will be an age in which human ingenuity and responsibility will allow 10 billion people to have access to modern forms of energy without compromising the vital life support systems of our planet."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"music/2015/aug/26/gil-scott-heron-the-revolution-will-not-be-televised","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-26T07:00:10Z","webTitle":"Gil Scott-Heron: the revolution lives on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/26/gil-scott-heron-the-revolution-will-not-be-televised","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2015/aug/26/gil-scott-heron-the-revolution-will-not-be-televised","fields":{"headline":"Gil Scott-Heron: the revolution lives on","bodyText":"When Gil Scott-Heron died in May 2011, Public Enemy’s Chuck D hailed him as “the manifestation of the modern word”. At his funeral, Kanye West performed Lost in the World/Who Will Survive in America, which sampled his spoken word . During the attempt to overthrow Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, Scott-Heron’s most famous track, The Revolution Will Not Be Televised, was playing in Tahrir Square. “Gil was a legend to me as a kid,” says rapper Talib Kweli, one of several artists appearing at The Revolution Will Be Live, a concert tribute to Gil Scott-Heron in Liverpool. “Kanye West, Jay Z, Ice Cube … mention Gil Scott-Heron and they will go on about how he’s influenced them. Put it this way: without Gil Scott-Heron there would be no Kanye talking about New Slaves.” From Kweli and Kanye to Kendrick Lamar, Scott-Heron’s catalogue has long been a vital source of inspiration for hip-hop artists. But his influence is far broader than just music. He has been a guiding light as a singer and proto-rapper, novelist and poet, teacher and civil-rights activist. At the concert, Kweli will be joined by actor and broadcaster Craig Charles, reggae band Aswad, Liverpool pop-soul group the Christians, who had a hit in 1993 with a cover of Scott-Heron’s 1974 popular single The Bottle, his protege Abdul Malik Al Nasir, his son Rumal Rackley and guest of honour Ndaba Mandela, grandson of Nelson. It will be a day of celebration, if not an opportunity to explore the conflicted individual behind the growing myth. Scott-Heron was a high-achieving polymath, so there is plenty to laud: he was a novelist by 20, while his 1970 album of politicised, rhythmic spoken word, Small Talk at 125th and Lenox, preceded rap by a decade. Without his pioneering contributions, Al Nasir believes hip-hop wouldn’t have evolved beyond good-time party music. “It would have just been Rapper’s Delight,” he says. Throughout the 1970s and early 80s, Scott-Heron used his songs to rail against the Vietnam war, the perils of alcohol and narcotics, the Watergate scandal and racial injustice, although these pieces – created with principal collaborator Brian Jackson – were generally harmonious fusions of soul, jazz, blues and funk, rather than diatribes. Pieces of a Man (1971) and Winter in America (1974) are regarded as the forerunners of both conscious soul (such as Raphael Saadiq and D’Angelo) and conscious rap: Lamar and J Cole are, as Kweli states, “two of the biggest artists in America – Gil is all over popular music right now.” Scott-Heron’s political activities – tackling the dangers of nuclear power via the No Nukes shows at Madison Square Garden in 1979, campaigning in 1981 with Stevie Wonder to make Martin Luther King’s birthday a national holiday and his involvement with the Artists United Against Apartheid movement – are well documented. But by the mid-80s, he had succumbed to drug addiction, seemingly drawn into the spiral of self-abuse he had spent the previous decade damning. In his final years, he was jailed for possession of crack and cocaine and was diagnosed HIV positive. And yet when he released his first album for 14 years – I’m New Here, in 2010, which turned out to be his last – it was as a returning champion, not a victim. Nevertheless, there is a sense of Scott-Heron as tragic underachiever – someone who never reaped the same commercial rewards as Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield and Sly Stone, yet whose records were also hard-hitting – and as multivalent innovator. Since his death, he has been variously cited as “the black Dylan” and “the godfather of rap”. In 2010, Charles interviewed Scott-Heron for BBC Radio 6 Music. “He was really grouchy and wasn’t keen on looking back,” remembers the DJ. “Every time I’d ask a question about his past, he’d fly off the handle. He came across as angry and frustrated,” recalls Charles. “But he’s still one of the most intelligent poets ever. His records are seminal for anyone who knows their political funk and soul. And his final album was brilliant, even if it was dark – even frightening – in places. He was always a trailblazer.” (Indeed, Jamie xx released a remix of that final album, We’re New Here, was a year later). “I don’t think his influence can be overstated,” says Charles. “For black America, he was their greatest folk hero. He just couldn’t beat his addictions.” But Al Nasir says it is misguided to regard Scott-Heron’s later years as a descent into poverty and addiction. “He wasn’t impoverished – don’t get it twisted,” he says, testily. “He could have had seven figures in the bank, but that wouldn’t stop him living in a single room in Harlem. Why? Because he was a humble man. He didn’t like the trappings of wealth. He was generous and kind. One of the values inculcated in him by his grandmother was: if you can help someone, why wouldn’t you?” In 1984, a chance encounter between Scott-Heron and Al Nasir, then a self-described “illiterate street kid” in Liverpool, led to him taking the 18-year-old under his wing. Today, Al Nasir boasts a master’s degree and is sensitive about press intrusions into his mentor’s personal life. “If you want to talk about [crack], you’re talking to the wrong guy,” he warns. “I don’t get involved in trying to take down the man who raised me up. If he’d sat in judgment over me when I was 18, I’d probably be dead now.” Kweli is also sympathetic to Scott-Heron’s dark side. “Gil had famously bad habits, and of course there were things that made me sad, but disappointed? No. Who am I to be disappointed by someone’s personal demons? If anything, I think he was courageous to bare his soul the way he did.” Naturally, everyone involved in The Revolution Will Be Live is a paid-up member of the Scott-Heron fanclub. To Garry Christian, he was “a poet who spoke about what was wrong with society”, his music continually relevant, “especially now, when cops are killing black people”. Ndaba Mandela, who is giving a lecture on slavery the weekend of the concert in Liverpool, is grateful for his pursuit of equality. “It won’t grow automatically,” he says of Scott-Heron’s legacy, which he likens to that of his grandfather. “Even the old man, eventually, if we don’t continue his work, people will forget.” Promoter Richard McGinnis sees the event, ultimately, as “a bookend to Malik’s story. It’s his way of thanking Gil for putting him through university,” he says. “For seeing the good in him when he was destitute.” What does Al Nasir consider to be an appropriate memorial? “Gil wouldn’t want to be canonised. He had a similar perspective to Mandela – he didn’t want statues. He was a complex character, a troubled soul. He wasn’t perfect. But what he did have was sincerity, and heart. He wanted to raise consciousness and make the world a better place.” • The Revolution Will Be Live is on 27 August at the Liverpool International Music festival. Pieces of a Man The Revolution Will Not Be Televised This was originally a spoken-word piece from 1970 and rerecorded with a band in 71. You could draw a straight line all the way from this thrilling piece of invective to Public Home Is Where the Hatred Is Sampled by Kanye West on My Way Home , this grim depiction of ghetto misery and narcotic misadventures assumed a new resonance in the light of Scott-Heron’s own drug addiction. Lady Day and John Coltrane A 1971 homage to two inspirational jazz figures, its lyric about seeking solace in the work of greats could have been penned about Scott-Heron himself. Winter in America Not originally featured on the 1974 album of the same name, this was typical Gil: an apocalyptic vision of the US, accessibly presented, flutes and all. H²Ogate Blues A lengthy dissection of the corrupt Nixon administration and the America of Watergate and Vietnam, set to insidious proto-rap. The Bottle Although dark comment on alcohol abuse from 1974, this was a melodic and funky affair. Johannesburg A prime example of Scott-Heron’s expansive vision, this jubilant 1975 single tackled the issue of apartheid in South Africa. Angel Dust Recorded with Malcolm Cecil, one half of Stevie Wonder’s classic-era production team, this 1978 track was about as mellifluously mesmerising about a killer drug as you could get. B-Movie This 1981 track – with its now-famous opening “The first thing I want to say is, ‘Mandate my ass’” – was a diatribe against the election of a former B-movie actor to the White House. Me and the Devil The only single lifted from his 13th and final album, I’m New Here (2010), this was a riveting, rasping electronic adaptation of Robert Johnson’s Me and the Devil Blues (1937)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2014/sep/07/break-the-silence-on-ttip","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-07T19:06:08Z","webTitle":"Break the silence on the danger of the TTIP | @guardianletters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/07/break-the-silence-on-ttip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/sep/07/break-the-silence-on-ttip","fields":{"headline":"Break the silence on the danger of the TTIP","bodyText":"Why are the media almost silent about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership being negotiated by the EU and the US? The TTIP represents a massive attack on the sovereignty of democratically elected governments; it will be irreversible. Attempts to harmonise standards between the EU and the US are likely to hit hard-won protections on food and chemical safety (eg in cosmetics, insecticides and pesticides), the environment, and workers’ rights. US agribusiness is pressing hard for Europe to import currently illegal GM products, and meat that does not conform to EU standards, such as chlorine-washed chicken and cattle raised with growth hormones. The threat of litigation against states which pass laws in the public interest that could impact on corporation profits is particularly insidious. Already, Quebec is being sued for deciding to ban fracking, and tobacco company Philip Morris is suing the Australian government for trying to protect public health by legislation on the marketing of cigarettes. Germany is being sued because of its policies on nuclear power; Slovakia’s public health system is being challenged by commercial interests. Such cases could become commonplace, with profits being placed firmly above people, and commercial interests overriding national law. Apparently, Ed Miliband hopes for an NHS opt-out clause, but it is doubtful the EU would make this a high priority in talks. We hope that all our political leaders agree that it should be democratically elected governments that decide what services should be publicly owned and managed, in the public interest, not international corporations.

Perhaps it is in the genes, or perhaps it results from centuries of practice conducting the foreign relations of great dynasties. Sir Thomas Herbert, a writer who accompanied British diplomats to Iran in the 17th century, noted that visiting foreigners were encouraged to wear their own dress “so that the greater the variety” the more the Shah would feel “his court and country [were] honoured at home and [held] in estimation abroad”. Among the best-sellers at last month’s Tehran international book fair was a biography of foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. In its sixth printing since its release in 2013, “Mr Ambassador” collects interviews telling the life story of the diplomat set to deliver a nuclear agreement with world powers. Does the work of Zarif and president Hassan Rouhani show that hard-headed, practical diplomacy has been wedded to the ideological zeal of the 1979 Islamic Revolution? Complex, detailed and long-running talks with world powers over the nuclear programme are now concentrating on how any agreement might be verified, and how sanctions might come back into play if Iran violated any of the terms. “This is simultaneously political and technical,” a European diplomat involved in talks in Vienna told me. “The technical and the political people are having to work very closely together”. This illustrates a central difficulty in the talks – maintaining unity among world powers. The United States wants sanctions that “snap back” automatically, and Russia wants any re-imposition referred to the UN security council. At the same time, United States secretary of state John Kerry has to deal with the hostility towards the talks from Washington’s two main Middle Eastern allies, Saudi Arabia and Israel. Richard LeBaron, Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council and former US ambassador to Kuwait as well as deputy chief of mission in Israel, told me that fears among the Sunni-led Arab states and Israel over Iran are for different reasons, but real enough. “The Arabs fear Iranian revolutionary zeal, their dedication to spreading their influence in the Arab region, and they believe that the US intends to use Iran to create some sort of balance against their interests,” he said. “Nuclear proliferation has never been high on their list of concerns. But any step out of isolation by Iran is considered a step backward for the Saudis. Israel fears a somewhat unpredictable nuclear power in the Middle East, which ideologically opposes it: they don’t much care about Iran’s regional meddling other than its support for Hezbollah and its minor support for Hamas.” Those who negotiate with Iran express a mixture of respect and frustration. Two former European diplomats who dealt with Iran during the European Union’s 2003-05 nuclear negotiations told me of serious challenges. Sir Richard Dalton, British ambassador to Iran 2002-06, recalls Iranian diplomats being “dogged and determined” while frequently changing position. “They often think in terms of conspiracies,” he said. “Their convoluted analysis of plots has to be slowly and carefully deconstructed to locate the common ground on whatever is the issue of the day.” There is also domestic Iranian politics. “A revolutionary country, its diplomats and negotiators, can be outflanked by radicals claiming to be the true exponents of national values,” Sir Richard said. “They [Iranian politicians or diplomats] often speak of external enemies as a way of fostering internal unity. There is usually lively argument [in Tehran] among the factions and the personalities in the leadership and it takes time to resolve them - hence the need for [anyone negotiating with Iran to have] patience and a thick skin.” Paul von Maltzahn, Germany’s ambassador in Tehran from 2003 to 2006, also warned of the dangers of Iranian domestic politics, particularly if talks go beyond the deadline of June 30. “They should not stick too much to timetables. If 30 June does not work, then go on. This is important enough. [But] I am speaking of one week, two weeks, not a long time, because then of course the process unravels.” Von Maltzahn remembers the particular problem of knowing exactly when Iran’s negotiators were speaking with authority. Back in 2003 Rouhani, then Iran’s leading nuclear negotiator as secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, took time out at delicate points during talks at the Sadabad palace, north Tehran to telephone Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, seeking approval. But von Maltzahn also recalls a senior Iranian negotiator floating proposals without making clear if they were hypothetical, much less if they had the backing of the leader. Hossein Mousavian, effectively Rouhani’s deputy, came to the German residence “a few times” when he “flew kites, trying out ideas”. Some European diplomats saw such “kite-flying” as a deliberate means to confuse, and were especially suspicious that Iranian negotiators were seeking tactical advantage when they warned time was running out for a deal because they were under growing pressure from their own “hardliners”. This was never an easy judgement. Indeed, just as the Iranians had warned, the talks’ failure and the 2005 election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president did lead to the removal of both Rouhani and Mousavian as negotiators and even, briefly, to Mousavian’s arrest in 2007. The Europeans then spent several years listening to lectures from Saeed Jalili as the Iranian nuclear programme expanded. But – despite, or perhaps because of their experience in Tehran – both von Maltzahn and Dalton express cautious optimism over the current talks. In contrast to 2003-05, the United States is not only directly involved but has agreed to accept in principle that Iran can continue some uranium enrichment. It is France that now takes the toughest approach, especially in demanding access for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to military sites and that Iran give more thorough explanations of alleged past research. But while Iran’s official line – strongly expressed by Khamenei – is that allowing access to military sites would cross its “red lines”, von Maltzahn believes Rouhani in 2003-05 indicated the issue was not entirely closed. “Rouhani regarded this as a playing card, something that might be played at some stage,” he said. “The big thing for Iran is really “non-discrimination”, so they are not treated differently to anyone else.” For von Maltzahn, Tehran’s thinking points towards an agreement. “Iran has come to conclude that the nuclear option is not necessary for them to have more power projected in the area. With the decline or disappearance of Iraq, and with Egypt’s lack of a regional role, de facto Iran is the most powerful nation in the area. They don’t need nuclear parity with Israel, and in any case it’s far too costly. So why go that way?” Other regional powers have long been assessing the consequences of a nuclear agreement. Is it a precedent for other efforts to solve problems through diplomacy? Saudi Arabia portrays its bombing strikes against the Houthis in Yemen as a means to resist Iran’s attempt to back regional allies, but can the Saudis deploy negotiators as well as F-16s? Von Maltzahn looked sceptical when asked why Riyadh in 2013 rejected the chance to sit on the UN security council and present its case to the world. “What case?” he quipped. By contrast, the former German ambassador to Tehran expressed professional regard for Iran’s diplomatic team, describing Zarif as “courageous”. His highest praise was for Abbas Aragchi, who has done much of the work on the Iranian side. “He comes from a family of carpet dealers. He’s very honest and straightforward – for an Isfahani.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/sep/03/japan-ice-wall-fukushima-water","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-04T01:39:00Z","webTitle":"Japan earmarks £300m+ for Fukushima cleanup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/03/japan-ice-wall-fukushima-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/sep/03/japan-ice-wall-fukushima-water","fields":{"headline":"Japan earmarks £300m+ for Fukushima cleanup","bodyText":"Japan's government is to spend almost $500m (£320m) in an attempt to contain leaks and decontaminate highly toxic water at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The measures come as the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), struggles to prevent leaks into the Pacific Ocean and to find a way to contain and treat the huge volume of water that has accumulated at the site since it was hit by a tsunami in March 2011. Last weekend, workers recorded radiation levels of up to 1,800 millisieverts an hour near one storage tank for the contaminated water. A radiation dose of that size is big enough to kill an unprotected person nearby in about four hours. Tepco said the radiation was emitted in the form of beta rays – which travel only short distances and can be easily shut out – and that workers had not been put at risk. The government's decision to step in is widely seen as a safety appeal just days before the International Olympic Committee chooses between Tokyo, Istanbul and Madrid on which city will host the 2020 Olympics. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said the government would take a more active role in the biggest nuclear cleanup in history, amid mounting concern that Tepco is no longer able to cope alone. \"The world is watching to see if we can carry out the decommissioning of the Fukushima nuclear power plant, including addressing the contaminated water issues,\" Abe reportedly told cabinet ministers. Reports said that about 32bn yen of the 47bn yen in new funding would be spent on constructing a 1.4km-long underground frozen wall around four damaged reactors – an untested and expensive technique. The wall would prevent groundwater from mixing with coolant water that becomes contaminated after it comes into contact with melted nuclear fuel. A further 15bn yen will be spent on improving technology to remove all radioactive particles – except tritium – from the water, or to least reduce them to legally accepted levels. The head of Japan's nuclear watchdog, Shunichi Tanaka, confirmed on Monday that discharging treated water into the ocean is one option under consideration. Given the large volumes involved, experts say that Tepco will soon run out of storage space and will have no choice than to discharge or evaporate the contaminated water. Last month, Tepco belatedly confirmed reports that coolant water was mixing with groundwater and flowing into the sea at a rate of about 300 tons a day. In a separate incident, the utility, which was effectively nationalised last year when it was saved from collapse with a 1tn yen injection of public funds, said a storage tank had sprung a serious leak. Smaller amounts of tainted water are thought to have breached other tanks and pipes. The new funding was announced days before the International Olympic Committee [IOC] is due to select the host city for the 2020 Olympics. Concern is growing that the water crisis could harm Tokyo's chances of being chosen ahead of Madrid and Istanbul. But Japanese Olympic officials said the Fukushima crisis should not affect Tokyo's prospects. \"There is no risk from Fukushima,\" Tsunekazu Takeda, who is leading the city's bid, told AFP. \"Day-to-day life in Tokyo carries on as normal for its 35 million people. \"The air and water quality is safe. Also the data shows that the radiation level is the same as most cities, like Paris, London and New York. Our main focus is to deliver a great and safe Games.\" Abe will deliver Japan's final pitch to the IOC ahead of the decision in Buenos Aires on Saturday evening. The emergency measures announced on Tuesday do not address the wider problem created by the need to constantly cool the damaged reactors and the resulting buildup of contaminated water. In addition, the new funding represents only a tiny potion of the tens of billions of dollars experts estimate it will cost to decommission the plant, an operation that is likely to last at least 40 years. No decision has been taken on who will foot the bill – the state or Tepco. \"This is a matter of public safety, so the country has to take the lead on this issue and respond as quickly as possible. Figuring out who to bill for the costs can come later,\" Akira Amari, the economics minister, told reporters. Public criticism of Tepco has intensified in recent months. It initially denied reports of groundwater leaks, and was found to have employed just two workers to conduct twice-daily inspections of more than 1,000 storage tanks containing an estimated 330,000 tons of contaminated water. To compound Tepco's problems, sources familiar with the situation at the plant say the firm is struggling to hire new workers, as others resign or are forced to leave because they have reached their radiation exposure threshold. Critics of the nuclear industry, even inside the governing Liberal Democratic party, are beginning to ask why no Tepco executives have been held accountable for the latest string of accidents. \"Is anyone at Tepco taking responsibility for these mistakes?\" Reuters quoted Taro Kono, an LDP deputy secretary general, as saying. \"I haven't heard of anyone stepping down or being fired. Tepco needs to go down and the government needs to take over.\" Senior LDP officials have said that liquidating Tepco is not under consideration."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/apr/15/coalition-partners-tories-lib-dems-minority-labour-snp","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-15T10:52:03Z","webTitle":"It’s time to talk about coalitions – who’s courting who? | Anne Perkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/15/coalition-partners-tories-lib-dems-minority-labour-snp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/15/coalition-partners-tories-lib-dems-minority-labour-snp","fields":{"headline":"It’s time to talk about coalitions – who’s courting who?","bodyText":"The next three weeks will be a bit like waiting for pandas to have sex. It isn’t going to happen on camera. But deep in the bamboo forest, there are a whole series of political courtships going on. Nick Clegg is rather spoiling it by being out there touting for business, offering a coalition of conscience (with the Lib Dems, obviously) instead of what he says is the alternative, a coalition of grievance with either the SNP or Ukip. But it’s in his interests to call the bluff of the two main parties as they carry on trying desperately to assemble enough votes to win a working majority, some number – any number – greater than the absolute minimum of 323 seats (allowing for Sinn Fein not taking their seats). Both parties look at least 40 seats away from that target. They know, as they have feared for months now, that to be in power, each is likely to need some form of partnership with another party or parties. The parties would prefer us to believe it’s not on their minds at all. Yet, judging from the churn in voting intentions that is disguised by the way the headline figures for Labour and Conservative are stuck in the mid-30s, many voters don’t know what they want, or at least, not how to get it. The biggest difference between now and 2010 is that there has been five years of coalition. The coalition worked, in the sense that it has lasted, government business proceeded and each of the two parties managed to hold together throughout, just. The upshot of that, however, is not that the parties eagerly anticipate pulling off the same trick, but that the Conservatives – the party, if not the leadership – do not want it to happen again (the Liberal Democrats know they will be lucky to get the chance). Whatever the result on 7 May, David Cameron will face a meeting of his backbenchers immediately after the weekend. The stakes are high, maybe as high as they were at the original backbenchers meeting which gives the committee its name, when the party rebelled against being in coalition with Lloyd George. There is no appetite in Tory ranks for getting back into bed with the Lib Dems. It is often claimed that the Lib Dem rank and file are equally reluctant. Even if a majority of those who hold their seats – maybe between half and two-thirds of the 57 seats they won in 2010 – were prepared to accept the idea in principle, any arrangement could be vetoed. But much of the party’s left-leaning support has gone. People who tell pollsters they’ll vote Lib Dem are happy at the idea of another coalition. And Nick Clegg and David Laws, chief negotiator last time round, sound as if they at least are ready to try again. The clue is that neither will say that the EU referendum to which Cameron is committed would be a red line, while Vince Cable, who may still fancy his chances as an alternative leader to Clegg, hints that it would be. But look at the five front-page pledges that Clegg says are non-negotiable, and there is nothing there that the Tories would find indigestible. More austerity – although Clegg insists the cuts cannot come from welfare, or at least not £12bn of them – a higher tax threshold for lower rate taxpayers, that £8bn for the NHS, more money for education, climate change targets – those are areas where Cameron’s Tories could find common ground. Now put behind you any bitter memories of tuition fees and nuclear power, the headline pledges abandoned in 2010 – the negotiations then weren’t all one way. Some policies close to Tory hearts were sidelined in 2010 that cannot be shelved again. Think Trident and the European court of human rights. There is sparse common ground here, and no appetite for another compromise in either party. Most of all, it doesn’t look as if the sums will add up for a deal. The idea of any kind of pact with Labour might seem unimaginable, but then that is what people thought last time about a deal with the Tories. Those Lib Dem red lines could be less of an issue – Labour might be happy to divert a final decision on Trident into another inquiry – but the idea that the kind of personal chemistry that got Cameron and Clegg through some hard times would work between Clegg and Miliband verges on the unbelievable. Miliband’s Labour really isn’t the same as Blair’s in 1997 when he and Paddy Ashdown discussed a realignment of the left. So Labour will, at least sometimes, need the SNP. The press oligarchs portray this as a catastrophe. Here’s why it isn’t. First, these political courtships are not, or will not be in this case, any kind of a marriage of equals. Even if the SNP wins 50 seats, Labour will have something around six times as many. Labour will not be in the SNP’s pocket. Alex Salmond – not the leader of the Westminster party, but likely to be the chief tactician – could make life very difficult for a minority Labour government. But if the SNP thought Labour was too fiscally constrained on its budget, for example, would they really vote with the Tories to defeat it, and bring the government down? The record shows that the last minority Labour government, from 1976-1979 did well enough to look like winning the election, until the winter of 1978. Minority governments can work. As we may be about to find out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2013/jul/12/invensys-shares-takeover-french-schneider-electric","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-07-12T12:33:02Z","webTitle":"Invensys shares soar after £3.3bn takeover approach by French rival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/12/invensys-shares-takeover-french-schneider-electric","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/jul/12/invensys-shares-takeover-french-schneider-electric","fields":{"headline":"Invensys shares soar after £3.3bn takeover approach by French rival","bodyText":"One of the last survivors from the era of British industrial conglomerates, Invensys, looks set to fall into foreign hands after a £3.3bn takeover bid by Schneider Electric of France. The board of Invensys, a product of the 1990 merger of two diversified engineers, BTR and Siebe said it was \"likely to recommend (the acceptance of) a firm offer\" at a price of 319p a share in cash and 186p in new equity. Shares in the London-based group, which makes control systems for everything from domestic washing machines to nuclear power stations, soared by 15% on news of the offer. The City believes that the potential deal with Schneider could flush out counter-offers from the likes of Siemens of Germany, ABB of Switzerland or Emerson Electric in the US. The shares closed slightly above the cash-and-shares offer price at 508p, up almost 68p. Invensys, which was once part of an elite band of diversified leviathans including Hanson, Williams Holdings, and \"guns to buns\" group Tomkins has slimmed down – not least after selling its lucrative rail business to Siemens for £1.7bn last year. The group has also been in talks during the last 12 months with Emerson about the possible sale of its US-based Foxboro brand – another key part of the group - but this came to nothing at the time. There has long been speculation that the whole of Invensys, which made operating profits of more than £150m last year on revenues of £2.5bn, would be bought by a foreign competitor. The UK company now wins only a small part of its sales from Britain and less than 1,000 of its 16,500 workforce are based here. Under stock exchange rules, Schneider must make a firm offer or drop its interest by 8 August. The French company, whose products help utilities distribute electricity and which makes automation systems for cars, said last summer it planned to make acquisitions as part of a wider plan to increase sales and move into new markets. Analysts at investment bank Morgan Stanley said that the mooted offer price from Schneider was \"fair and reasonable\" and the strategic logic of a tie-up made sense for both sides. Another investment bank, Société Général, said the fact that Invensys publicised the talks with Schneider with the latter's consent indicated it was trying to encourage more bidders and tipped Emerson as a likely candidate, while Nomura believed \"Schneider would seem to have fewer anti-trust issues than other parties\".The keen interest in Invensys is a major turnaround from 10 years ago when the company had run up £3bn of debts after a buying spree. Its previously highly rated shares were hit badly by the bursting of the dotcom technology bubble. Allen Yurko, the chief executive of the time shed 23,000 jobs in a bid to turn the overly-complicated business around but ended up paying with his own job as angry shareholders turned against him after a series of profit warnings. Under new management the business gradually recovered although its share price was damaged again in 2011 and early last year after Invensys ran into problems supplying control and safety systems for eight Chinese nuclear reactors. The chairman of Invensys has remained the same since 1999 in Sir Nigel Rudd who had set up Williams Holdings almost 20 years earlier and built it into one of Britain's biggest industrial conglomerates through a series of acquisitions –it sold its Yale locks and demerged into Chubb and Kidde in 2000. Rudd has since been criticised for disposing of other businesses where he was chairman to foreign buyers – notably Pilkington Glass and Boots. But he was associated with the corporate raiders such as James Hanson at the company of the same name, Greg Hutchings at Tomkins and Owen Green who turned BTR – British Tyre Company – from a small tyre producer into a huge diversified group. BTR bought Dunlop Holdings and a variety of other businesses in the UK, US and Australia before buying the Hawker-Siddeley aircraft manufacturing company in 1992 for £1.5bn. It eventually joined forces with Siebe which itself had grown from a small diving equipment maker into one of the UK's largest engineering businesses. Conglomerates grew quickly on the back of major acquisitions and large borrowings at a time of low interest rates but went out of fashion as a business class once the City realised they were unwieldy and highly vulnerable in a downturn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2015/mar/13/white-house-pointedly-asks-uk-to-use-its-voice-as-part-of-chinese-led-bank","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-13T00:12:30Z","webTitle":"US anger at Britain joining Chinese-led investment bank AIIB","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/13/white-house-pointedly-asks-uk-to-use-its-voice-as-part-of-chinese-led-bank","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2015/mar/13/white-house-pointedly-asks-uk-to-use-its-voice-as-part-of-chinese-led-bank","fields":{"headline":"US anger at Britain joining Chinese-led investment bank AIIB","bodyText":"The White House has issued a pointed statement declaring it hopes and expects the UK will use its influence to ensure that high standards of governance are upheld in a new Chinese-led investment bank that Britain is to join. In a rare public breach in the special relationship, the White House signalled its unease at Britain’s decision to become a founder member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) by raising concerns about whether the new body would meet the standards of the World Bank. The $50bn (£33.5bn) bank, which is designed to provide infrastructure funds to the Asia-Pacific region, is viewed with great suspicion by Washington officials, who see it as a rival to the World Bank. They believe Beijing will use the bank to extend its soft power in the region. The White House statement reads: “This is the UK’s sovereign decision. We hope and expect that the UK will use its voice to push for adoption of high standards.” George Osborne – who has discussed the decision to become a founder member of the investment bank with his US counterpart, Jack Lew – has been the driving force behind developing closer economic ties between Britain and China. The chancellor has led the way in encouraging Chinese investment in the next generation of civil nuclear power plants in the UK and he ensured that the City of London would become the base for the first clearing house for the yuan outside Asia. The US administration made clear in no uncertain terms its displeasure about Osborne’s decision to join the AIIB. A US official told the Financial Times: “We are wary about a trend toward constant accommodation of China, which is not the best way to engage a rising power.” Britain was unsurprised by the decision of the US administration to air its concerns in public after the formal announcement that the UK would join the new investment bank. Sources said, in addition to the talks about British plans between the chancellor and the US treasury secretary, British and US officials have been in regular contact ahead of the announcement. UK officials say that, by joining the bank as a founding member, Britain will be able to shape the new institution. In its statement to the Guardian, the White House national security council said: “Our position on the AIIB remains clear and consistent. The United States and many major global economies all agree there is a pressing need to enhance infrastructure investment around the world. We believe any new multilateral institution should incorporate the high standards of the World Bank and the regional development banks. “Based on many discussions, we have concerns about whether the AIIB will meet these high standards, particularly related to governance, and environmental and social safeguards … The international community has a stake in seeing the AIIB complement the existing architecture, and to work effectively alongside the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.” Human rights groups and others have complained that the UK has become too willing to placate China – particularly in light of its muted comments over the tight restrictions set out for voting rights in Hong Kong – but Thursday’s remarks seem to be focused on the bank. “I think the US has had its questions about the UK posture towards China on other issues and I suppose this announcement probably triggered renewed concern in Washington about overall British politics vis-à-vis China. But [we] don’t normally arbitrate these things in public and I’m a little unsure as to why the US has chosen to pick a fight with the UK on this bank at this time, because I thought it had somewhat softened its posture on the bank. It’s a bit surprising to me,” said Matthew Goodman, senior adviser for Asian economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Goodman said the US had legitimate questions about the AIIB when it was first announced last summer, such as the governance of the institution, its lending standards and procurement rules. “Notwithstanding that, I think they should have been more willing to engage in discussion with China and others about the institution. There’s a big infrastructure gap in Asia, existing institutions are not filling it and China has the wherewithal to contribute on the right terms.” Some surmised that the US was responsible when Australia backed away from signing up to the bank at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Beijing last autumn, after widespread speculation a deal was on the cards. “The US did reach out to Australia, Koreans and others to consult about questions and concerns, and that’s been interpreted as leaning on allies not to join the bank,” said Goodman. As the world’s second largest economy, China has grown increasingly frustrated that it does not have more influence at the IMF and World Bank, and sees little prospect of more say regarding the Japanese-backed Asia Development Bank."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/sep/29/netanyahu-un-isis-hamas-branches-poisonous-tree","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-29T17:37:57Z","webTitle":"Binyamin Netanyahu: Isis and Hamas 'branches of the same poisonous tree'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/29/netanyahu-un-isis-hamas-branches-poisonous-tree","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/sep/29/netanyahu-un-isis-hamas-branches-poisonous-tree","fields":{"headline":"Binyamin Netanyahu: Isis and Hamas 'branches of the same poisonous tree'","bodyText":"Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu compared his country’s recent bombing campaign in Gaza to the US-led strikes against militants in Iraq and Syria on Monday, saying Hamas and the Islamic State (Isis) group share the same goal of world domination. In a speech to the United Nations general assembly, Netanyahu railed against countries who condemned Israel for its war with Hamas while praising President Barack Obama for attacking Islamic State militants and other extremists. The Israeli prime minister said those world leaders “evidently don’t understand that Isis and Hamas are branches of the same poisonous tree.” Netanyahu also says Iran’s concern about the spread of terrorism was “one of history’s greatest displays of doubletalk.” A nuclear-armed Iran would pose a far greater threat to the world than Isis, he said. “Make no mistake, Isis must be defeated. But to defeat Isis and leave Iran as a threshold nuclear power is to win the battle and lose the war.” “Iran’s nuclear military capabilities must be fully dismantled,” he said, adding that the point of Tehran’s recent “charm offensive” for the West was get international sanctions lifted “and remove the obstacles to Iran’s path to the bomb.” Earlier, Israel’s foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman said Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas had no intention of making peace with Israel, calling his speech to world leaders last week “a message of hatred and incitement.” Lieberman also questioned Abbas’ legitimacy to speak on behalf of the Palestinian people, saying he does not control the Gaza Strip, where Hamas remains in charge of security and elections have been postponed for more than four years. Abbas accused Israel in his speech on Friday of carrying out “war crimes” and conducting a “war of genocide” in Gaza, but stopped short of saying he would pursue war crimes charges against Israel. He said he would ask the UN security council to dictate the ground rules for any talks with Israel, including setting a deadline for an Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian lands.

It's wicked.\" The first words of the documentary film Pandora's Promise are screeched by an emotional anti-nuclear protester and the following 89 minutes is spent dismissing these concerns. As it happens, I think these concerns are overblown too. The harm to human health resulting from nuclear power is tiny compared to other energy sources, principally coal. The cancers caused by leaks from nuclear power stations are small in number compared to the deaths resulting from the air pollution caused by fossil fuel burning. And nuclear weapons are a lot easier to make than nuclear power stations. But for all the globetrotting from Fukushima to Chernobyl to Three Mile Island, the film completely ignores the issue which is actually at the centre of today's nuclear debate: cost. Actually, that's not quite true. There's 30 seconds near the end, in which Michael Shellenberger, from a thinktank called The Breakthrough Institute, says: \"It's a big upfront cost but these plants are going to last 60, 80, even 100 years and much of the infrastructure will last much longer than that. It's much more economical than very expensive solar and very expensive wind.\" I have never heard anyone talk about century-old nuclear plants. Nuclear power costs are, as always, soaring, while renewable costs are falling fast. To analyse the economics of nuclear so flimsily renders the film irrelevant to any serious debate about the future of nuclear power. In the recent coverage of the UK government's agreement with the French state company EDF to subsidise a vast new nuclear power plant in Somerset, the debate was entirely about the economics. Safety and weapon proliferation were non-issues. Want to talk about fourth-generation reactors that might address important safety and waste issues? Want to discuss small modular reactors that might be cheaper to build? Tough luck: this film resolutely sticks to fighting old battles. It castigates, rightly, those ignoring the best medical data on radiation risks in favour of anecdote and intuition but then has a resident of Chernobyl, who returned shortly after the blast, sharing his own anecdote: \"None of the people who came back to Chernobyl died of cancer or any other illness.\" There is a serious debate to be had about whether new nuclear power stations are a vital tool in tackling climate change or a damaging distraction from a truly clean energy future. The debate needs to be about which technology should be used, in which countries, at what cost and at what speed of deployment. This film, with its scant cast of writers and octogenarian engineers, says nothing about any of these issues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2013/feb/08/nuclear-power-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-08T12:51:51Z","webTitle":"We don't need nuclear power to meet climate goals and keep lights on | Caroline Lucas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/feb/08/nuclear-power-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2013/feb/08/nuclear-power-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"We don't need nuclear power to meet climate goals and keep the lights on","bodyText":"Making the case for new nuclear this week, George Monbiot admitted that, what with the proposed nuclear waste dump in Cumbria being rejected and Centrica pulling out of new nuclear in the UK, the facts are not exactly working in his favour. But his argument raised two crucial questions. First, what is actually happening as a result of Germany's nuclear phase-out? Is Angela Merkel now barrelling down a catastrophic, high-carbon coal path, or is the reality more complex? It's true that there has been a spike in coal burning, but this is largely because the EU carbon price has collapsed and gas prices have risen – meaning that burning coal and lignite is cheaper than burning gas. Right now, Germany's renewable energy boom is displacing gas, rather than coal. Moreover, since the country's decision to phase out nuclear, no new coal plants have been proposed and some have even been cancelled. So it is a massive oversimplification to state that Germany's decision to go nuclear free means more reliance on coal – either now or in the future. The German government has made clear that it remains committed to its carbon reduction and renewable energy targets – which are more ambitious than ours – and are driving investment and creating jobs in the sector. The renewables sector in Germany is significant, already providing 25% of electricity and resulting in lower market prices. Crucially, a recent study by the German engineering association VDE found that Germany's switch to renewables could \"obliterate\" the need for baseload power from coal and nuclear altogether. Second, is there really no hope of tackling climate change without nuclear power? This is certainly what the nuclear industry wants us all to think. But analysis using the government's figures shows that we don't need nuclear power to meet climate goals and keep the lights on. Renewable energies, together with combined heat and power, energy efficiency, smart grids, demand management and interconnection, are the building blocks of an alternative energy future. The path we take is a matter of political choice, not technological inevitability. As for coal, the emissions performance standard in the energy bill should rule out all new unabated coal, although it needs strengthening to ensure the operation of any fossil fuel plant is compatible with the decarbonisation of the power sector by 2030. Importantly, we also need to stop subsidising the fossil fuel industry. Coal, oil and gas have enjoyed decades of support that the renewables sector can only dream of. And with the energy bill set to deliver a backdoor subsidy for nuclear, truly sustainable renewables like wind, solar, waste digestion, wave and tidal are in danger of being sidelined once again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2013/oct/10/energy-price-rise-david-cameron-defends-green-subsidies","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-10T15:46:16Z","webTitle":"Energy price rise: David Cameron defends green subsidies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/10/energy-price-rise-david-cameron-defends-green-subsidies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2013/oct/10/energy-price-rise-david-cameron-defends-green-subsidies","fields":{"headline":"Energy price rise: David Cameron defends green subsidies","bodyText":"David Cameron has defended \"necessary\" green subsidies on energy bills to fund wind and nuclear power after large energy supplier SSE partly blamed government-imposed levies for forcing it to raise gas and electricity prices by 8.2%. The prime minister said the best way of reducing energy bills is tackling the root causes of high wholesale gas prices, including improving competition between energy companies and pushing ahead with fracking. Cameron said green levies to subsidise renewables will not be on bills \"for a moment longer than is necessary\" but added that the UK needs to have a \"balanced energy mix\" including nuclear power and wind power. To achieve this \"some of those subsidies have been necessary\", he said. He also criticised Labour's promise to freeze energy bills for 20 months as a \"con\" because it would be impossible to keep the pledge if wholesale prices shoot up. His comments follow criticism of SSE for announcing higher prices, meaning the average annual bill for its customers will rise by £106 to £1,380. They also come amid speculation that the Treasury will respond to Labour's price freeze by removing some green levies on bills that go towards subsidising wind, solar and other renewables as well as energy efficiency and fuel poverty programmes. Some Conservatives have been pushing for further cuts to subsidies. The Liberal Democrats would strongly resist the move if it were to have any effect on the UK's ability to hit targets on reducing carbon emissions and tackling climate change. The government is under pressure on energy prices as household bills rise to a record high, mostly driven by rising wholesale gas prices. Green levies - which include subsidies for renewables and social programmes to fund energy-saving measures for low-income homes and pensioners - make up £112 of the average £1267 dual fuel annual bill, according to Department for Energy and Climate Change figures. On Thursday, SSE blamed a raft of factors for its decision to raise prices from next month. \"We're sorry we have to do this,\" said SSE's Will Morris. \"We've done as much as we could to keep prices down, but the reality is that buying wholesale energy in global markets, delivering it to customers' homes, and government-imposed levies collected through bills - endorsed by all the major parties - all cost more than they did last year.\" Ed Davey, the energy secretary, said rising wholesale gas prices are the biggest factor in the increase, rather than government-imposed costs. He also encouraged people to consider switching their supplier to make sure they are getting the best deal. \"Half of an average energy bill is made up of the wholesale cost of energy,\" he said. \"This far outweighs the proportion of a bill that goes to help vulnerable households with their bills and to cut energy waste, and to encourage investment in the new low-carbon energy generation we need to keep the lights on.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2013/sep/25/super-furry-animals-perform-wind-turbine","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-25T05:00:00Z","webTitle":"Super Furry Animals' keyboardist to perform atop wind turbine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/25/super-furry-animals-perform-wind-turbine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/sep/25/super-furry-animals-perform-wind-turbine","fields":{"headline":"Super Furry Animals' keyboardist to perform atop wind turbine","bodyText":"Despite having performed gigs from Cardiff to Japan, Welsh musician Cian Ciarán is confident that playing atop a wind turbine will be the most unusual location so far. On Wednesday night, the Super Furry Animals' keyboardist will perform his new solo album to an audience of seven people crowded on to the viewing platform of the 67m-tall turbine in Swaffham, Norfolk, in protest at the UK's plans for new nuclear power and in support of renewable energy. The last remaining nuclear power reactor in Wales, at Wylfa, is expected to shut down in the next two years, but Japanese company Hitachi bought the rights to develop new reactors at the site for £700m, and it is one of several potential locations where the UK government wants to host a fleet of new reactors. But Ciarán is adamant the closure of Wylfa, in Anglesey, north Wales, should be the end of atomic power in Wales. \"Yes, definitely, it should be the last nuclear power station in Wales, without a shadow of a doubt. We don't need them. The scaremongering, that the lights would go out, is a myth,\" he told the Guardian. Planning consent for large energy projects is given by Westminster, with only power over small projects generators devolved to the Welsh assembly. To proponents of nuclear power who argue it is an important low-carbon energy source, such as energy secretary, Ed Davey, who helped overturn the Liberal Democrats' opposition to nuclear power at its conference earlier this month, he said: \"We have a myth that nuclear power is green. It is bullshit in my opinion. You have to mine the uranium, enrich it, get it here, not to mention all the concrete that goes into building it [the reactor]. It is by no means green.\" New nuclear power stations would take too long to build to make a difference to urgent efforts to tackle climate change, he argued. The UK government is still locked in long-running negotiations with French energy firm EDF over how much the company should be subsidised for generating electricity – the so-called \"strike price\" – from its planned nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset. Contracts guaranteeing the price for up to 40 years have been discussed, the Guardian revealed earlier this year. Contracts will also be issued for wind power. Ciarán said that the economic case for new nuclear did not make sense. \"How can you justify subsidising – however you want to sugarcoat it – paying EDF with taxpayers' money, locking us in for the next 40 years to high electricity bills?\" Both the Welsh assembly and the Westminster government should be focusing on renewable energy and energy efficiency, he said. \"It [wind power] is the cleanest source of energy, becoming cheaper to produce, is as competitive and is in endless supply. I can't just sit and watch as they continue to miss opportunities that will make a difference environmentally and economically.\" The gig on Wednesday night will be the first live performance of They Are Nothing Without Us, an album which Ciarán describes as being \"about shouting up, exercising your voice, being pissed off and urging people not to take any more shit.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/apr/27/shell-lobbied-to-undermine-eu-renewables-targets-documents-reveal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-27T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"Shell lobbied to undermine EU renewables targets, documents reveal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/27/shell-lobbied-to-undermine-eu-renewables-targets-documents-reveal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/apr/27/shell-lobbied-to-undermine-eu-renewables-targets-documents-reveal","fields":{"headline":"Shell lobbied to undermine EU renewables targets, documents reveal","bodyText":"Shell successfully lobbied to undermine European renewable energy targets ahead of a key agreement on emissions cuts reached in October last year, newly released documents reveal. At the time of the emissions deal, the European commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, said: “This package is very good news for our fight against climate change.” He added: “No player in the world is as ambitious as the EU.” But it now appears that a key part of the agreement – which was championed by the UK government – was proposed by a Shell lobbyist as early as October 2011. At the 2014 meeting, heads of government agreed a 40% overall target for the bloc’s emissions cuts, but in the run-up to the deal there had been disagreement between member states about how best to achieve that. The UK and others had resisted binding targets for individual member states on energy efficiency and renewable energy and these did not make it into the final agreement. Proponents of renewable energy say this was a key missed opportunity to give a strong signal to investors that the EU was serious about clean energy. Now documents released to the Guardian under freedom of information laws show that as far back as October 2011, Shell had begun lobbying the Barroso, who was succeeded by Jean-Claude Juncker last November, to scrap the bloc’s existing formula for linking carbon-cutting goals with binding renewable energy laws. Shell argued that a market-led strategy of gas expansion would save Europe €500bn (£358bn) in its transition to a low carbon energy system, compared to an approach centred on renewables. “Gas is good for Europe, and Europe is good at gas,” the firm’s upstream executive director, Malcolm Brinded wrote in a five-page letter to Barroso. “Shell believes the EU should focus on reduction of greenhouse gases as the unique climate objective after 2020, and allow the market to identify the most cost efficient way to deliver this target, thus preserving competitiveness of industry, protecting employment and consumer buying power, to drive economic growth,” he wrote, adding in a hand-written note at the end, “This is a great opportunity for the EU to seize!” Shell is the sixth biggest lobbyist in Brussels, spending between €4.25-4.5m a year lobbying the EU institutions, according to the bloc’s transparency register. Participants in the 2030 negotiations confirm that Shell was the first lobbyist to push for a single target in Brussels, and its heft gave the idea momentum. “Shell has a lot of clout in the UK, where they are very active in the policy debate,” a source close to the lobbying discussions said. “That is partly because the UK likes to have companies saying what the UK government wants to hear.” The firm’s ‘single target’ idea gathered traction, particularly among supporters of nuclear power and shale gas, and was agreed as an official position in discussions between the UK Treasury and the Department of Energy and Climate Change in mid-2013. Britain spearheaded the idea, with support from other countries in inter-state Green Growth Group meetings that year, before successfully getting a variant of the idea into the final agreement last October. The bloc agreed that by 2030, every country would cut its emissions by 40%, measured against 1990 levels, and that although the EU as a whole would commit to a 27% share for renewables in the energy mix, that target was not binding on individual member states. But the clean energy industry says that this is not enough to give investors the long-term certainty that they need. “An ambitious greenhouse gas target is a crucial signal to the most polluting power stations, but it is not an effective driver for the energy transition towards renewables,” said Frauke Thies, a policy officer for the European Photovoltaic Industry Association. “The 2030 package was a once in a decade opportunity to send a signal to clean energy investors,” added Brook Riley, a spokesman for Friends of the Earth Europe. “The EU chose to reward the fossil fuels lobby instead.” Shell was not the fiercest opponent of climate action in the 2030 debate, and some see it as the most progressive of the big fossil fuel firms. It supports a strong emissions trading scheme (ETS), carbon capture and storage technology, and factors a $40 a tonne CO2 price into some of its long-term investment decisions. Most of Shell’s operations are now gas rather than oil-based and the firm has invested heavily in Brazilian bioethanol. But environmentalists object to the company’s pursuit of Arctic drilling and its extraction of Canadian tar sands, one of the most polluting fossil fuel sources. A Shell spokesperson said the company supported the 40% target agreed last October. “Our position is clear: we support an ambitious GHG [greenhouse gas] target, driven through a strong and functioning carbon market. This delivers the most cost effective decarbonisation. A strong ETS, as well as focus on innovation funding will support renewables without the need for binding targets.” On the company’s lobbying efforts the spokesperson said: “Shell engages with European policy makers on a wide range of topics on a regular basis”. The European commission said that Shell had been one of 550 stakeholders who contributed to a green paper on 2030 targets in March 2013. “This stakeholder consultation provided important input into the further process,” a spokesperson said. But the commission declined to comment on any engagement with the firm before that date. The UK government was never an advocate of EU-wide renewable energy targets – which it saw as costly, ambitious, and encroaching on national sovereignty. In the 2030 debate though, the UK claimed a leadership role in harnessing consensus across a divided bloc for an emissions target that did not torpedo decarbonisation hopes. Unlike most European countries, the UK has a carbon floor price that may help to trigger some fuel switching from coal to gas. Gas releases about half as much carbon as coal when burned, although over its full lifecycle, this is still 40 times more than wind, according to the IPCC. As a flexible backup to often intermittent renewable energy supplies, analysts say that it may provide a crucial, if short, bridge to a clean energy system."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/oct/24/britains-deals-with-china-billions-what-do-they-mean","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-24T15:00:03Z","webTitle":"The UK’s deals worth billions with China: what do they really mean?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/24/britains-deals-with-china-billions-what-do-they-mean","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/oct/24/britains-deals-with-china-billions-what-do-they-mean","fields":{"headline":"The UK’s deals worth billions with China: what do they really mean?","bodyText":"Britain’s diplomatic elite has been rushed off its feet catering for the largest contingent of Chinese officials and business executives to arrive in London for 10 years. In 2005, the chief concern was how to contain the noise from protesters angry at Beijing’s occupation of Tibet. This time the Dalai Lama and talk of human rights were kept off the agenda during a four-day visit that David Cameron said was the opening act in a “golden era” for UK-China relations. In a joint statement, Cameron and President Xi Jinping said they were committed to creating “a global comprehensive strategic partnership for the 21st century,” and exploiting to the full Xi’s “one belt, one road” policy that aims to turn the old Silk Road into a modern trade route across Asia to the Middle East and Europe. However, one comment in particular stood out: when the prime minister hailed “up to £40bn” of trade and investment deals between Britain and China as he attended a trade conference at Mansion House in the City of London. There was some incredulity over how Downing Street had arrived at the number, and No 10 eventually issued a list at the end of Xi’s visit that acknowledged the total included previously announced agreements. Nonetheless, it underlined that the British economy has links with China in many different sectors – from carmaking to TV programming. But it remains to be seen whether the announcements, analysed below, will amount to a significant trade boost. TRADE LINKS China now represents the UK’s sixth-biggest export market, taking 3.6% of its goods and services. But some analysts characterise Xi’s visit as all one-way traffic, with a grateful Britain buying almost anything China had to offer, from nuclear technology to investment funds for the HS2 rail line, with only a handful of Chinese purchases of UK goods and services going the other way. Critics have also characterised many of the deals as largely symbolic and spread over many years, diminishing their value in the context of overall investment in the UK. But for Xi the willingness of the UK to embrace China is a much-needed fillip as he struggles with an economy suffering from massive overcapacity, especially in the steel, coal and building sectors, where official data suggests factories have the ability to produce up to 30% more than current demand. A huge drop in exports and efforts to shift the away from heavy industries to consumer services has also slowed growth to a pace dubbed by Xi as the “new normal”. And even these lower estimates from the government statistics department could be generous with independent efforts to measure the economy downgrading growth in the last quarter from 6.9% to nearer 4% and an unemployment rate that hovers just above 4% to the dangerously high 10%. Launched in 2013, “One Belt, One Road” is Xi’s route out of the malaise. Beijing estimates it will add £1.7tn to China’s trade in the next decade, as it seeks overseas destinations for products that have no home in a saturated domestic market. Britain is one of many such destinations. NUCLEAR The flagship industrial project for the “golden era” of cooperation is the £6bn investment by China in the planned new Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset. The British government is relieved that state-owned China General Nuclear Power Corporation has bailed out the cash-strapped main developer, EDF of France, and promised to take a 33.5% equity stake in the controversial project. The quid pro quo for the Chinese participating, and for providing cash for new reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk, is to be allowed to build and operate their own facility at Bradwell in Essex. Bradwell will allow the Chinese to trial its Hualong reactor designs in the west and act as a showcase to the rest of the world for its nuclear prowess. New investment money coming into Britain’s creaking energy infrastructure is considered the main UK benefit at a time when over £100bn is needed to update old power stations and introduce new low-carbon power. EDF has promised that 60% of the contracts at Hinkley will go to the UK although the plant will use a French reactor design, the EPR, and engineering via another French company Areva. British companies such as Laing O’Rourke, Balfour Beatty, and Cavendish Nuclear are in line for significant contracts, with G4S a bidder for security contracts and Somerset Larder for the catering. The biggest boost should be 25,000 new jobs, but the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors warned last week the UK “lacks the necessary construction skills to deliver critical programme such as Hinkley Point.” VISAS AND CULTURAL EXCHANGE Xi made much of the demands from China’s new middle-class consumers for foreign goods and travel. He said that over the next five years, China would import the equivalent of £6.5tn of goods and that 500 million Chinese tourists would travel abroad. To make sure Britain stays on the map, Cameron said that, from January, new visitor visas for Chinese tourists would be valid for two years – four times the usual six-month limit. He also pledged to match the US government’s latest 10-year multi-entry visa for Chinese tourists at no extra cost. Why single out Chinese tourists for special attention? They contribute £500m a year to the UK economy, according to the latest figures from VisitBritain and the numbers are increasing rapidly. There was a 35% jump in visitors from China in the year to June on 2014. With every Chinese holidaymaker and business traveller spending on average £2,688 every time they visit, “the extension of the visitor visa will enable them to maximise their spending power even further,” said Downing Street, adding that every 22 additional Chinese visitors create an additional job in the tourism sector. INDUSTRY Low-carbon technology was at the heart of deals struck with China across the automotive sector during Xi’s visit. Aston Martin signed a deal worth £50m with private equity firm China Equity to develop an electric sports car, the Rapide S. The Chinese carmaker Geely, which makes London’s distinctive black cabs, promised to pump in an extra £50m to research and development at an expanded Coventry factory, including the launch of a new fleet of hybrid black cabs capable of zero emissions. And bus manufacturer Alexander Dennis agreed a £660m deal to build single-decker buses that China’s BYD will equip with batteries to run as electric vehicles. Ian Fletcher at IHS Automotive says even the smaller deals now represent significant investment: “Unfortunately our homegrown industry isn’t as big as it once was, so it’s a feather in the cap. The investment in R&amp;D for a new London taxi does suggest that we still have strengths in engineering in that field: had you said that London Taxi would get a total £300m investment from abroad five years ago, they’d have said you were mad. Geely do see something in that brand, they are probably eyeing more exports.” Meanwhile, Fletcher says, the injection of funding will be important for Aston Martin. “Electric vehicles are a growing market, but there hasn’t been that much movement at the top end. It’s an opportunity for Aston Martin to become a super-Tesla – and, with the Chinese government very focused on trying to reduce emissions in their cities, to sell into that market.” CREATIVE INDUSTRIES The UK’s creative and TV production industry struck deals worth more than £225m with Chinese partners in a flurry of announcements. The deals included BBC Worldwide’s co-production deal with Shanghai Media Group to make the sequel to 2007 hit Earth, the feature-length version of the Planet Earth series, due for release in 2017. It is the first deal completed under the Sino-UK Film co-production treaty ratified earlier this year. Other deals include co-production agreements to make a Chinese version of the BBC series Coast. And Chinese online video company LeTV picked up the broadcast rights to Poldark, while this year’s Sherlock Christmas special will transfer to cinemas across China. Other initiatives include the University of York striking a £200m TV training programme deal with a Chinese investment group that will involve 300 foreign students a year. While the list of glossy announcements is impressive, China remains a difficult market for UK TV producers to crack. According to indie trade body Pact, sales of British TV shows to China were just £16m last year, with growth of just 1%, down on a 40% surge in 2013. “China still seems to be mostly a case of a long walk for a short drink,” says one senior executive. PROPERTY Even before last week’s visit, China had been busy investing in the UK. The country has amassed a huge fortune in foreign reserves from exports, and until the financial crash parked much of it in US Treasury bonds. These days property is the asset of choice, sometimes to the point of investing in apartment blocks that remain empty simply because it is too much hassle to rent them out. Investments in the UK are mainly in London and will soon grab the attention with a development on the river Thames at Nine Elms by Chinese developers Dalian Wanda. The massive towers planned for the area upriver from the Houses of Parliament have already been branded a super-rich playground with flats starting at £1.3m. Cameron was only able to lay claim to a small investment by the Chinese developer Advanced Business Park (ABP) in the £1.7bn Royal Albert Docks scheme as part of Xi’s visit. But the scheme – also involving fellow Chinese group Citic, which already owns 40% of that site – is billed as developing a new financial district in east London that will create up to 30,000 jobs. As a signal of intent, it is clear. Beijing wants to take over from the oil-rich Middle Eastern states as the main investor in London’s trophy assets. FINANCE In a deal timed to coincide with Xi’s visit, China’s central bank made its first sale of debt on London’s markets last week, drawing orders of more than 30bn yuan (£3bn). The move is mutually beneficial: it aids China’s drive to make the yuan an international currency, while consolidating London’s position as a global financial centre. The City treasures its reputation as the most international financial centre in the world. It plays host to many more foreign banks than either New York or Tokyo and in recent years added Middle Eastern banks wanting to sell products under sharia law to a list that includes banks from every continent. Last week’s debt sale was not the only example of Sino-British cooperation in finance. In 2014 the China Construction Bank won approval from Beijing to open Europe’s first clearing bank for yuan in London. Later it also started trading in Paris and Frankfurt, but made London its European headquarters. CCB UK, which spent around £110m on a new headquarters in the Square Mile, processed around 6bn yuan of transactions per day last year. Last week the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced that its London trading centre would offer offshore yuan futures, allowing financiers to trade and hedge on movements in China’s currency. The move will bring to London a practice that was previously conducted through Hong Kong.

Local attractions include the pier at Weston-super-Mare and the holiday camp at Minehead. \"It's a flipping eyesore,\" said Maxine Sanni, on holiday from Basingstoke with her husband Addy. \"What a blot on the landscape. You come to the country and expect to see a lovely landscape. And I think nuclear scares people – when tourists find out what it is, they find it frightening.\" Carol Evans, from south Wales, who regularly takes breaks in nearby Burnham-on-Sea, said: \"I would like to see more windfarms instead. That's cleaner than nuclear – you think of things like Chernobyl.\" Her husband, Gordon, added: \"We have windfarms near us. We like them.\" But Hayley Derry, who lives locally and works in Burnham-on-Sea, said the site did not put people off. \"I think tourists have an interest in the power station, when they come down for their holidays. But they are not worried by it. I don't see it as a problem.\" It is possible to approach up to the neighbouring car park of the power station and the shore beside it. Hinkley Point B is an advanced gas-cooled reactor, one of the UK's 16 remaining, and ageing, nuclear reactors. Apart from a few small construction vehicles, there is little to show here that this is to be the site of the first new reactor to be built in the UK for nearly 20 years. Hinkley Point C, which will be constructed on land adjacent to the existing plant, will cost about £14bn and take years to build. For the moment, work has stalled, as long-running negotiations about the premium the French company EDF will get from the government for the power have dragged on for nearly a year. These talks are now drawing to a close – EDF is likely to receive around £90 per MWh for its electricity, via reforms to the electricity market known as \"contracts for difference\", whereby low-carbon power is prioritised over fossil-fuel energy. The system is complex, but enables ministers to say they are not subsidising nuclear power. Many people living near Hinkley have mixed views about the new reactor, seeing it as a source of employment and a boost to the local economy, but also appearing apprehensive about some of its impacts. Most of the jobs going to local workers will be in construction, or \"muck-shifting\", as EDF's head of procurement told the Guardian in an interview. Ken Owen, commercial director for new building at EDF, made clear that the more advanced and technical jobs – in engineering, design, manufacturing and technology – would go to overseas firms: \"There are a lot of critical components where quite frankly the UK has lost its capability. We don't mind that, because we know there is capability from a global perspective.\" However, there are likely to be ancillary benefits to local services, such as retailers. Michael Davitt, in a local shop, said: \"I'm not especially happy about nuclear power, but we have regulations [for safety] and it provides employment, so people understand that.\" Jill Taylor, a resident in nearby Cannington, said: \"I can remember when the last [nuclear power station] was built. I worked in a hotel that was full with people coming to the area. I am all for it. It's going to bring employment and it has got to be done for the future.People these days are not looking to the future and the need to replace power. They don't look at the background.\" Within two years, many of the UK's coal-fired power stations will have to be taken out of service due to EU pollution regulations, and electricity firms have mothballed many of their existing gas-fired power plants as they are more expensive to run than coal. Hinkley Point C will not be ready in time to avoid the generation gap; even with the strike price settled, it is likely to take at least five years to get the reactor up and running. But the government hopes the new power station will be the first of several to replace the ageing fleet for the 2020s, when carbon dioxide emissions must be drastically cut from current levels."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/may/06/uk-energy-bill-subsidies-driving-boom-in-polluting-diesel-farms","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-06T15:20:47Z","webTitle":"UK energy bill subsidies driving boom in polluting diesel farms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/06/uk-energy-bill-subsidies-driving-boom-in-polluting-diesel-farms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/may/06/uk-energy-bill-subsidies-driving-boom-in-polluting-diesel-farms","fields":{"headline":"UK energy bill subsidies driving boom in polluting diesel farms","bodyText":"Subsidies levied on household energy bills have helped drive a boom in polluting “diesel farms” across the UK to meet periods of peak electricity demand, the Guardian has found. Almost a quarter of Britain’s back-up power under one programme for the National Grid is being provided by tiny fossil fuel power stations – some of which have been built on farmland by entrepreneurs. The mini-power stations are brought into play by grid managers when there is a rapid surge in demand for power, for example when large numbers are watching major sporting events such as the World Cup or Wimbledon finals or during major TV events such as the final of Strictly Come Dancing. In the coming weeks the grid is to offer through auction a new set of subsidies to diesel farms under a scheme designed as insurance against the lights going out. Neither the Department of Energy and Climate Change, the grid nor many of the companies involved are keen to provide much information about this shadowy new industry. Many environmentalists, industrialists and politicians admit they have been largely unaware of the trend but say they run totally counter to the Department of Energy and Climate Change’s (Decc) attempts to reduce C02 levels. Burning diesel also produces particulates and nitrogen dioxide which are responsible for at least 29,000 premature deaths a year – mostly from traffic fumes. KiWi Power, an energy technology company specialising in demand reduction, argues the grid’s new transitional arrangements should be restricted to low carbon solutions and the diesel farm boom halted. “We feel that it would be extremely unfortunate and not in the country’s interests if this subsidy were instead spent on polluting diesel farms, rather than encouraging true innovation,” said Yoav Zingher, a co-founder of KiWi. The grid accepts that 22% of its short-term operating reserve (Stor) programme is already met by diesel generation but is unwilling to provide detailed information about which companies offer what capacity. The privately-owned grid that balances energy supply and demand, claims to publish all the information it can about diesel on its website and argues that it cannot discriminate against fossil fuels. “As with our approach to operating the (power) system on a national level, National Grid has to be generation neutral,” said a spokesman. “Stor contracts [for shot-term extra power] are awarded based on capability and price, and we cannot discriminate against fuel types offered.” Decc confirmed that diesel generators of under 50 mega watts (MW) could bid for subsidised contracts under the transitional arrangements – a part of a wider “capacity market” scheme. A spokesman declined to explain why one of the most carbon heavy fossil fuel capacity was being encouraged saying Decc was in “purdah” due to the general election campaign. The need for demand response to meet peaks in power has become more acute because old coal and nuclear power stations have been retired and fewer than expected new gas-fired generation built. Tim Yeo MP, the outgoing chairman of the House of Commons select committee on energy and climate change, described the diesel farm boom as “ridiculous” and campaigned for more to be done on demand reduction. Tom Greatrex, the shadow energy minister, said earlier rounds of the capacity market had already rewarded mini fossil fuel power stations: “It was clear from the outset that the capacity market risked locking in a new generation of dirty diesel generators that were too small to be affected by carbon policies. Sure enough, 40MW of small diesel generators have now secured 15-year subsidies.” Alasdair Cameron, energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, was also critical: “Renewables will certainly be the main source of energy in the future. It’s vital that we design a clean back-up system that works with them, based around energy storage and the smart use of electricity,” he said. Obtaining information about the diesel farms is difficult with one operator privately claiming that it would not provide detailed information on where its plants were located for “security reasons.” Green Frog Power, Abbey Powergen and UK Power Reserve are among the few firms which have been willing to confirm that they have taken advantage of contracts through Stor under which they can be paid for diesel plant generation even when it is not used. Green Frog was originally established to collect cooking oil which could be turned into biofuels for generating electricity but later since switched to using traditional fossil fuels to make power. Backed by a former part of HSBC bank known as InfraRed Capital Partners, Green Frog has built 214MW of diesel generation including a 52-generator site producing 20MW of power at Neath in south Wales, a similarly sized one in Swansea and others in Hull and Plymouth. Mark Jones, a Green Frog director, admitted the carbon intensive diesel equipment was expensive to run but insisted it was built only to respond to occasional moments of peak demand. “Plants run for short periods quite infrequently, less than 50 hours a year on average. They are designed to start and get to full output very fast and can do so in 45 seconds if needs be. Gas plant cannot respond so fast for technical reasons.” The Green Frog website says it is building “modular fast-start” power stations throughout the United Kingdom. It says: “We have sites located from Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the North through to Plymouth in the south. All of our first-phase sites have approved electrical export connection agreements and approved detailed planning and environmental permits.” Jones said the company had now stopped building any more diesel farms and had now moved onto cleaner gas-fired plants. “We intend to become the leading supplier of balancing services to the system and we intend to do that in as clean and efficient manner as practically possible. We hope that ... legislation does serve to close down the diesel plant that our competitors seem hell bent on building.” Meanwhile, UK Power Reserve has three diesel generators at Asfordby in Melton Mowbray, Trumfleet in Doncaster, and Wakefield but says they are different from small-scale diesel farms. “These are big industrial ones and not designed to sit empty. The majority of the [UK Power Reserve] plants are gas-fired,” according to a spokeswoman. Tim Emrich, the chief executive of UK Power Reserve in an interview with trade newsletter New Power said other firms “are using small diesel generation behind the scenes for ... Stor,” adding that “the diesel farm mentality is flawed.” Abbey Power Solutions, an arm of a larger property development group, has constructed 50MW of diesel generation on sites near Sheffield and Barnsley in Yorkshire plus Spalding in Lincolnshire. The company confirmed it was involved in Stor but was not willing to talk about its operations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/17/nuclear-expert-warning-chinese-role-uk-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-17T19:19:27Z","webTitle":"Nuclear expert raises concerns about Chinese role in UK's new nuclear plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/17/nuclear-expert-warning-chinese-role-uk-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/17/nuclear-expert-warning-chinese-role-uk-plants","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear expert raises concerns about Chinese role in UK's new nuclear plants","bodyText":"One of Britain's leading nuclear engineering consultants has raised serious concerns about the safety implications of handing over some of Britain's nuclear plants to Chinese operators. John Large, a government adviser, said he felt uncomfortable with the lack of transparency around the Chinese atomic industry, which has been drafted in to help the UK by George Osborne on the chancellor's trade mission to China. Osborne has given the green light to Chinese nuclear firms taking majority stakes in the UK's next generation of nuclear plants. The first deal is likely to be unveiled next week, with China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGNPC) taking a minority stake with the main operator, France's EDF, to build the new Hinkley Point C power station in Somerset. No UK firms are involved after Centrica pulled out. Large, who has advised the UK government on nuclear issues, said: \"We can see that even with the French operatorship of UK nuclear power stations [through EDF] that there are differences in the regulatory regimes in France and the UK. \"But these problems would be much more profound with the Chinese, who like the Russians, are rooted in a government system without independent [safety] regulators,\" he said. His warning came as a report from the anti-corruption organisation Transparency International highlighted Chinese firms as some of the most secretive within the world's fastest-growing markets. Large said it would be quite easy to supervise a US company working in Britain because they were used to operating under the American safety regime, which is noted for its openness. But he said he was very wary of the \"totally non-transparent\" Chinese regulatory system, which left outsiders with almost no idea how it really worked. Large feared that the Treasury's enthusiasm for winning and keeping foreign investment might mean pressure being brought to bear on the UK's Office for Nuclear Regulation to gloss over problems encountered with a Chinese operator. The reaction from Large, who in the past also helped the Russian government raise the stricken nuclear submarine Kursk, comes after Osborne endorsed Chinese firms' purchase of stakes in British reactors, including majority ownership. The Treasury said: \"While any initial Chinese stake in a nuclear-power project is likely to be a minority stake, over time stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes.\" But it added: \"Any investment from any country has to comply with rigorous regulatory standards for safety and security.\" The government is expected to agree a deal over a generous 35-year subsidy regime to enable EDF and CGNPC to proceed with building a new Hinkley C reactor. There has always been unease in some quarters about the security issues around inviting China to take a close role in certain industries such as telecoms and power. A leader from the GMB union recently told the Independent it was \"almost Orwellian\" to allow a country like China, which has been linked to allegations of corporate hacking, to be allowed access to highly sensitive energy infrastructure. The concerns came as a report showed that China has the least transparent companies operating in the major emerging economies of Brazil, India, Russia and South Africa. In a survey of 75 companies across the Brics by Transparency International, Chinese companies were the least likely to publish financial information and vital details about corporate structure that allows them to be held to account. Of 33 Chinese firms surveyed, including Chery Automobile and China National Offshore Oil Corporation, none has made any public statements on outlawing bribery. Robert Barrington, executive director of Transparency International, said: \"There is a lack of transparency about some global companies in emerging markets, particularly in China. As they expand, that is a problem because the citizens of the countries in which they are operating will want to know some basic things about them. And indeed we think they have a right to know.\" \"Part of the quid pro quo of coming into the international arena is that you have to play by international norms.\" Barrington said Osborne had to ensure that Chinese firms operating in the UK met British legal and company standards. \"[Osborne] hasn't sent that message out publicly – I hope he is doing it privately.\" • This article was amended on 18 October 2013 to correct the spelling of the Russian submarine Kursk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/oct/17/china-investment-uk-osborne-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-17T18:24:04Z","webTitle":"China's investment in UK: Osborne pushes the nuclear button","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/17/china-investment-uk-osborne-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/oct/17/china-investment-uk-osborne-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"China's investment in UK: Osborne pushes the nuclear button","bodyText":"The announcement that Chinese companies can take a stake in British nuclear plants was hardly a surprise: George Osborne had already told reporters that the UK welcomed Chinese investment in all its infrastructure – citing the sovereign wealth fund CIC's existing investment in Thames Water and Heathrow. China has massively increased investment in Europe in recent years. One study this spring, by private equity firm A Capital, found that Chinese state-owned companies invested more than $12.6bn (£7.8bn) in the continent last year: a year-on-year increase of about 20%. Cash-strapped European countries have proved relatively welcoming. Involvement in critical infrastructure – and particularly the nuclear sector – is a more delicate issue. Jonathan Fenby, director of the China team at research service Trusted Sources, said: \"The question is whether people in Britain will say, 'Our electricity is being sold to the Chinese and if something happens and we say something we shouldn't, they will turn off the lights.' I think that's pretty unlikely, but nuclear brings a level of sensitivity.\" But on the Chinese side, the same concerns – diversifying holdings, gaining technical knowledge and turning a profit – apply. The UK is expected to guarantee a generous price for nuclear-generated electricity to ensure more plants are built. \"All these deals have a commercial logic to them. In this case they will get, they hope, some technological expertise which is what they have wanted for their domestic nuclear programme. Then, if it is a successful investment, that helps them vis-a-vis joint ventures elsewhere in the world or selling on their technology,\" said Fenby. China already has 17 nuclear reactors and another 28 plants under way at home, although construction has been held up by a moratorium that was imposed after the Fukushima crisis. If firms manage to meet Britain's strict regulatory requirements, it will give them credibility as they seek to sell their technology elsewhere, experts say. The memorandum of understanding also includes training for Chinese technicians in Britain in radioactive waste management. Osborne's determination to welcome the Chinese across the board was underscored by his visit to the HQ of telecoms equipment firm Huawei in Shenzhen. Its founder is a former officer with the People's Liberation Army, and despite its insistence that it is not tied to the military or Chinese government, it has faced hostility or outright bans on its involvement in projects in the US, Australia and Canada. \"There are some western governments that have blocked Huawei from making investments. Not Britain. Quite the opposite. That is why I was pleased to welcome Huawei's opening of a flagship office in our country in June, and of £1.3bn of investment that came with it,\" the chancellor said. But while Osborne this week praised Chinese firms as \"very straightforward partners\", others are more wary and say greater openness is crucial. The nuclear announcement came on the same day that anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International gave Chinese companies the worst ratings in a survey of the openness of firms in Brics economies. Eight of the 10 worst-performing companies – including Huawei – were Chinese, scoring zero on a scale where 10 indicated the greatest transparency. \"Results show that companies from China lag behind in every dimension with an overall score of 20%,\" Transparency said in the report. \"Considering their growing influence in markets around the world, this poor performance is of concern.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/oct/30/renewable-energy-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-30T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy will overtake nuclear power by 2018, research says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/30/renewable-energy-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/oct/30/renewable-energy-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy will overtake nuclear power by 2018, research says","bodyText":"Renewable energy capacity will overtake nuclear power in the UK by 2018, if current rates of growth continue, and will provide enough power for one in 10 British homes by 2015, according to new research. The amount of electricity supplied by wind energy alone is up by a quarter since 2010, in a surprisingly good year for the renewables industry. While the government has notably cooled on wind power – more than 100 Tory MPs signed a statement this year opposing new windfarms, and the chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, has queried the future of subsidies – the industry has continued to grow, with investment in offshore wind up by about 60% to £1.5bn in the past year. Planning approvals for onshore windfarms also rose, up by about half, to reach a record level, according to the trade association Renewable UK. Despite the outspoken opposition from many Tory MPs against wind power, there was a rise in the amount of onshore wind capacity approved last year for the first time since 2008. Maria McCaffery, chief executive of Renewable UK, said: \"These strong figures underline the importance of a secure trading climate to attract investment, especially in difficult times. That's why it's so important that the framework provided by the energy bill, currently under parliamentary scrutiny, must be right. Although we still have a long way to go to meet our challenging targets, we are firmly on track and gathering momentum.\" John Hayes, the newly appointed Conservative energy minister who has been an outspoken critic of windfarms in the past, told the Guardian he was proud of the UK's wind energy industry. \"Investing in cutting edge technology is very British,\" he said. Despite his past opposition to windfarms, he said he would support new turbines if built in suitable areas. \"It's about having the support of local people – that is the key thing,\" he said. Measures to make it easier for local communities to benefit from windfarms – for instance, by taking a financial stake in the revenues – are to be brought forward by the coalition government. The energy bill, originally expected to be debated next week, is likely to be delayed until later in November as ministers wrangle over the implications. There is a sharp split within the Tory party over how to treat renewable energy, as more than 100 of the Conservatives' MPs earlier this year signed a letter opposing new windfarms. Peter Lilley, a vocal climate change sceptic, was appointed to the energy and climate change select committee last week in a move that some saw as an indication of a rightward shift in the government's climate policy. But David Cameron has in the past said renewable energy would be crucial to the UK's future prosperity. Any last-minute changes to the energy bill risk alienating investors. Wind turbine makers are stalling decisions on whether to invest in new manufacturing plants in the UK, pending clarification from the government on its future energy policy. Several large companies, including Siemens, General Electric and Mitsubishi, are pondering building manufacturing plants in the UK, but will make no decision without firmer assurances from the government. The repeated insistence from Osborne that the UK's energy future lies with the gas industry – a new \"dash for gas\" is under way, with the government clearing the path for 20 new gas-fired power stations – has unsettled renewable energy investors. \"The constant talk about gas is not reassuring for us,\" one wind investor, who could not be named, told the Guardian. Renewable UK said that last year there were at least 137,000 people involved in the sector, with a further 654,500 jobs in ancillary industries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2016/aug/27/north-korea-defectors-ian-birrell","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-27T09:00:03Z","webTitle":"'How could our country lie so completely?': meet the North Korean defectors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/aug/27/north-korea-defectors-ian-birrell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2016/aug/27/north-korea-defectors-ian-birrell","fields":{"headline":"'How could our country lie so completely?': meet the North Korean defectors","bodyText":"One day, when he was 25 years old, Park Sang-hak was strolling around a huge square in the North Korean port of Wonsan. It is a drab place, with just a few flags and painted propaganda posters providing splashes of colour. But, as a trusted party worker and the son of a top spy, Park had been given rare dispensation to travel to the city along the bumpy roads from the capital, Pyongyang, and he had made plans to see a friend from university. The pair talked animatedly as they walked around on that autumnal day in 1993. This was a break from the usual repetitive routine of life in the world’s most repressive nation: ceaseless work broken by Monday political classes and Saturday self-criticism sessions. The square was packed as they mingled with men in spartan clothes and women with regulation hairstyles. They passed an imposing statue of Kim Il-sung, the state’s founder, who landed in the city after its postwar liberation from Japan. Suddenly, they saw hundreds of leaflets raining down from the sky. “There were about 800 people there and just five security men, so I grabbed one and put it quickly in my pocket,” recalls Park, now 48, showing me how fast he stuffed away the piece of paper as we chat over fruit in a Seoul cafe. His friend was too scared to do the same; they could have faced party expulsion, exile to the countryside, even execution. Later, they read the story on the leaflet about a family of defectors who had fled to South Korea, and looked with wonder at pictures of escaped women in bikinis on a beach. The flyer was sent by the South as part of a propaganda war being waged on both sides of the divided nation. Once, Park would have been sceptical about its message: he was from a privileged family and had been told since birth that his great leaders were wise, their nation the world’s finest, that jealous enemies such as South Korea and the US sought to overthrow their glorious system. When, as a teenager, he discovered a neighbouring family had disappeared in the night, he was disturbed, but he accepted they must have done wrong. But first Park’s grandmother, on a rare visit from Japan, told him how much happier people seemed in other places, although he warned her against spreading rumours about the regime. Then fellow students, chosen to study in communist countries, whispered stories about life outside. “One had been to Berlin, where he had access to the west. I was shocked to learn some people had free access, since, if you travelled to South Korea and were caught, you went to a concentration camp. And I discovered in Europe people did not have weekly self-evaluation sessions [where citizens must confess to ‘wrongdoings’], which were a source of great stress for our people.” Yet, as a young bureaucrat rising in the system, Park had no desire to leave; not until one day in the summer of 1999, when he received a message from a Chinese man. He had come on behalf of Park’s father, who was working in Japan for the government. His father had realised the family were in danger; he wanted them to leave. “This was the moment my dreams crashed,” Park says. “I was sad and scared, but I knew I had no choice.” As entire families are held culpable for offences, he says, “If I stayed, I would be sent to a prison camp, since my father was not coming back.” His father had discovered the horrific scale of famine in North Korea and feared fresh purges. Huge numbers had starved to death due to the loss of financial aid after the collapse of the Soviet Union, followed by a series of natural disasters. But even to say the word “famine” was a crime, because it implied state failure. Park, suspecting a trap, demanded proof that the message was genuine, asking for photographs of his father. This took two months to arrange, “but felt like 20 years”. A week later, he bribed a border guard to defect across the Yalu river to China with his mother, brother and sister. In the first weeks of a new century, he arrived in Seoul, aged 32, to start his new life. He quickly found a job in a university’s technology department, where he was able to use his engineering skills. But many defectors do not integrate so easily. Often, they struggle to settle in a world they find so strange, with its personal freedoms and paralysing choice. They are, after all, emerging from an Orwellian land where life is determined by a rigid hierarchy dependent upon family history, where the state controls everything under a despotic dynasty that has ruled though three generations since 1948. Today, this diminutive man dedicates his life to bringing down the brutal regime that brainwashed him and 25 million fellow citizens. Park quit his job in 2003 after learning his fiancee had been beaten so badly following his escape that she was left unrecognisable, that his two uncles had been tortured to death and that his teenage cousins were reduced to street begging. “I had to do something,” he says. “I was mad that these innocent people had been tortured and killed.” Park does not fight with bombs and bullets, but with flyers such as the one that once floated down beside him. This year, he has dispatched 2m leaflets attacking the dictatorship in homemade balloons sent across the barbed-wire border. The leaflets are sent in packages alongside dollars, declarations of human rights, booklets about South Korea, sweets, soap operas and even comic films such as The Interview that ridicule North Korea’s leadership. Park believes that information can break down the walls of the world’s toughest totalitarian state and that truth can free citizens from their cocoon of total censorship. “All defectors ask the same question: how could our country lie so completely to us?” he says when we meet again two days later. It is a cloudy July night and we are driving to Gimpo, by the North Korean border, so he can send over 10 balloons, 150,000 leaflets, $2,000 (£1,500) in cash and a cartoon banner mocking “supreme leader” Kim Jong-un. Park’s team – comprising his wife, his brother and his sister-in-law – work silently but systematically as they fill agricultural tubes with hydrogen, then release them with dangling parcels attached. “Obviously, we have no idea how many get in,” Park says, “but at least there is no risk to people smuggling the information in.” Watching the balloons disappear into the night, it is hard not to think that these are flimsy weapons with which to fight the maverick nuclear power that lies a mile north. Yet Park’s missions seem to have stung North Korea. He has been named “Enemy Zero”. Five years ago, he survived an assassination attempt by an agent armed with two poison-tipped pens and a torch that fired bullets. The would-be killer asked to meet, but the police went in his place; now Park has permanent bodyguards. Missiles have been fired back over the border in response to his balloon launches, and at times of tension South Korea has deployed the police to prevent his efforts. But Park is far from alone. Dozens more defectors, dismayed by international inertia towards a dictatorship that enslaved an entire population for seven decades, are trying to topple tyranny with similar tactics. Aided by non-profit organisations such as the New York-based Human Rights Foundation, activists are using drones to send memory sticks from China loaded with books, encyclopedias and films. Others bribe border guards or use boats and fishermen to send banned data, documentaries and radios. The risks are high: three women were executed after being caught circulating a South Korean drama about a defector last November. Kim Jong‑un has cracked down hard to consolidate his position since becoming leader five years ago, and only two of the other seven people who stood beside his father’s coffin are still thought to be alive. He has toughened border controls, warning that people who aid illegal crossings face the death penalty and offering rewards for soldiers who stop them. Those with cash and luck can still get through, but in the past two years alone the cost has doubled to $14,000 (£11,000). In such a closed culture, even the most banal items can seem revolutionary. One prominent defector told me how watching Titanic made her realise the restrictive nature of North Korea and the real meaning of love. Another described being transfixed by Chinese television commercials for products she had never seen before, such as bottled water. A third man told me how he smuggled in DVDs of Desperate Housewives – its glossy view of life in the US runs counter to the official line. A fourth was fascinated by Jane Eyre, so different from the censored version shorn of any sexual frisson or societal critiques. For five years, Kim Heung-kwang was among the party cadres seeking to stem the flow of such seditious material. A computer-science professor at Hamhung University, he was recruited to join the state censorship team and study seized electronic devices. He went on searches, took bribes from terrified families and confiscated “capitalist” materials. Afterwards, he would read captured books and watch banned films at his leisure, then lend them to friends – until the day he was denounced in 2003. He was tortured, stripped of his post and sent to work on a farm. Thanks to his wealth, however, he was able to flee the country a year later. Arriving in South Korea, Kim sought to subvert the system he had once followed so fervently by setting up a group of intellectual defectors. He made videos, such as one showing the inside of a bookshop that told viewers to look at the number of volumes on sale; another featured taps with hot and cold water, so rare north of the border. He loaded them on to “stealth” memory sticks, designed to seem empty if checked by officials, along with books and essays. Thousands were sent through secret smuggling pipelines that date back to the deadly famine two decades ago. Like Park, the professor was placed on a hitlist of enemies of the state. “I knew North Korea was a republic of lies, so I thought that to reveal the truth was the best way to destabilise the regime,” he tells me in his tiny office, with a South Korean flag on the desk and a world map on the wall. “Outsiders think North Korean minds are controlled by the state, but if they have access to well-made information, they have the capacity to understand it.” His aim is not to bring down the regime, but to help people see reality: “Then it is their choice whether to have revolutionary or evolutionary change.” The penalties for watching even the mildest materials are harsh, as 32-year-old musician Jiwon Jung can testify. We meet in a downtown cafe. She has cropped hair, several earrings and a ready smile. Her mother was a doctor and her father taught the accordion. Like many elite North Koreans, the family bought illegal items that gave glimpses into the wider world. “We would listen to music, although we didn’t know it was from a couple of decades ago,” she recalls. She was arrested more than a decade ago as the result of investigations into the family of a close friend. “The police would interrogate me, asking again and again if I listened to foreign music and films. They would get friends to testify against me that I was the ringleader and smuggling videos, then beat me for days until I admitted it.” After confessing her “crimes”, Jung was sentenced to eight years in prison, which, due to forced labour and poor food, can often be a death sentence. Her family were able to use their connections to get her out after a year, claiming that she suffered a severe illness. They smuggled her to China as soon as she was released, but the broker they paid to get her over the border sold her as a slave. The young woman was sent to the countryside, forced to work in fields and barely fed before escaping months later for South Korea. Now Jung has joined the North Korean People’s Liberation Front, a quasi-military group in the South, waging information war against the Kim regime and preparing for its collapse. Although not armed, its members wear fatigues and its logo is a map of Korea with a gunsight targeting Pyongyang. “When it comes to overthrowing the government, I don’t think it is possible,” admits Choi Jung-hoon, its affable commander, despite claims of links to army dissidents over the border. “But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try. I want to slowly change the situation there.” The group claims to have smuggled in thousands of notels – cheap, battery-powered, Chinese-made devices that play DVDs and content stored on memory sticks. Although recently legalised in North Korea, they are meant to be registered, so that use can be monitored. Choi shows me pictures of USBs hidden in popular biscuits and sweet wrappers. Few citizens own computers – which have their own operating system, “Red Star”, and control access to what one defector calls “very boring” state-run websites – but most have access to television. Choi was an army officer in North Korea’s cyber-hacking unit for nearly 20 years, before leaving, almost by accident, in 2006. After hearing that a South Korean family was offering a $10,000 reward for contact with a kidnapped man, he searched the North to find him, successfully. But when he took the man to China to claim his reward, the family held a press conference and revealed publicly what Choi had done. “The regime ordered my execution,” Choi says. “I couldn’t go back.” Two years ago, he survived an attempt on his life by a female agent posing as a defector. We speak in the group’s Seoul headquarters, a nondescript office with its logo on the wall and so many pairs of army boots under the table I have to push back my chair to sit down. He admits that, when he was forced out of the country, he was filled with regret – his family was successful, his career was thriving and he had no reason to doubt the dominant ideology. “I never realised how horrifying the regime was that I defended,” he says intensely. “But the more you believe in something, the more you feel betrayed when you see through it. Finding out what the government had been doing changed my life. That’s why I work so hard to get information in.” *** More than two-thirds of the 28,000 defectors in South Korea are women, most of whom endured terrible traumas after fleeing. Many others are trapped in China, forced into marriage or slave labour, at risk of repatriation if caught. If they are sent back, they face abuse from prison guards or are sent to work in mines or political camps. Suicide rates are high among defectors, even in the South. Official figures indicate that one in seven defector deaths are suicides – a legacy of abuse, the impact on family members left behind and the struggle to survive in a free society. This inspired Lee So-yeon, 40, to fight for fellow North Korean female defectors. A former soldier, Lee worked as a cleaner after escaping, before pursuing a degree with the aim of turning her personal pain into action against the men behind atrocities. Now she runs a human rights group making videos in which abuse victims tell their stories, accusing high-ranking assailants and detailing locations and dates of attacks. These are loaded on to USB sticks with information about women’s rights, then smuggled into North Korea and scattered on the ground in public places. When we meet, Lee shows me a leopardskin makeup bag with a sly smile. Inside are several freshly smuggled North Korean mobile phones that contain pictures of people watching banned content. Already this year, her New Korea Women’s Union, which also helps new arrivals settle, has sent more than 1,200 memory sticks north. “We accuse specific offenders of carrying out sexual offences,” she says. “The videos tell them they will be subjected to punishment after reunification.” One of her key challenges is to explain basic human rights. “The big problem with women in North Korea is that even when they are sexually abused [or] raped or their rights are violated, they do not know these are violations. They are really emotionally damaged. Then, when defecting, they are often put through more trauma – and because they do not know these things are wrong, they suffer badly from depression.” Lee’s own story is typical. She enlisted for the army after leaving school. Famine was starting to bite: corpses littered the streets and the government stopped supplying free food to citizens. Soldiers’ rations were cut in half; some resorted to stealing from villagers. Lee served for a decade; discharge was not an option. There was widespread sexual abuse. “One company commander had 120 female soldiers under his command and he raped 30 of them,” says Lee. Was it her unit? “Yes,” she replies. “In North Korea, there is a form of social stigma, so if a woman were to step up and say: ‘I was sexually abused,’ she would be the one blamed. And, because power was so prized, lower ranks could not step up over such matters.” Yet Lee never doubted the system. She had seen leaflets sent from the south, but she dismissed them as psychological warfare. “We were trained all our lives to worship the Kim regime. Even when people were dying all around me, I never thought the leaders were the problem. I just wondered if I was going to die.” After finally being discharged in 2001, she ended up selling black-market goods near the Chinese border. Buyers seeking items from abroad would ask for something “fun”. Listening to banned radio, watching foreign films and talking to people who had crossed the border, she began to learn about the outside world and slowly understand the scale of state duplicity. “One time I heard a radio broadcast with a defector woman talking about what her life was like in South Korea. That was when I got the desire to leave.” Lee’s first attempt at escape in 2006 ended in failure. She was caught, beaten and sent to prison for a year of re-education. Two years later, she tried again. After bribing a border guard with $500 (£380), she was successful. She spent six months in China, hiding until she could find a broker to take her to South Korea. She tells me she had bad experiences in China that she cannot bear to talk about. Many defectors are badly scarred by their experiences, especially the children. One teacher tells me they struggle to cope with simple things, such as seeing pupils talk back to teachers, or even seeing pizza for the first time. “The other day, we played a couple of North Korean songs and they reacted very badly. They still suffer such trauma,” the teacher says. Yet young South Koreans show surprisingly little interest in their cause. One poll at a Seoul university found that eight out of 10 students had never met a defector, although many refugees hide their backgrounds. “The youth in South Korea today show total apathy towards their brothers and sisters in North Korea,” says Cho Myung-chul, the first defector to become a South Korean MP. “If this lack of awareness and interest is not addressed, our society is doomed.” His government has passed a human rights act, after more than a decade of fierce debate, that will log atrocities and fund local groups. But it is a polarising issue. Two years ago, one far-left group of five MPs was disbanded by a court after accusations of pro-North activities. For many years following the famine, liberal South Korean governments pursued a “sunshine policy” of aid and engagement with the North (technically, the two nations remain at war: when conflict ended in 1953, they merely signed a truce). The past two South Korean presidents, both on the right, have taken a tougher line, demanding an end to the North’s sabre-rattling and nuclear aggression. South Korea sees reunification as a core policy, with a special government ministry and programmes to assist defectors. But many are sceptical about the practicalities, especially given the growing economic disparity between Asia’s fourth biggest economy and its poor, isolated neighbour. “We are not going to war,” says Lee Jung-hoon, South Korea’s ambassador for human rights, who supports defector activism. “The change has to come from within. So, they have to hear information. They need to understand the situation outside their walls.” The efforts of defectors to subvert a state that once controlled them seem to be having an impact. A leaked North Korean security report from September 2014 revealed that “inappropriate recordings and propaganda publications” were on the rise, with mobile phones proving difficult to control. Citizens were ordered to disable Bluetooth on phones to stop data transfers, and searches have been increased in schools, factories and offices. One school was singled out for praise after insisting on daily reports from all students and staff to prevent suspicious activities such as “watching and circulating illegal content”. But these attempts to empower citizens can do only so much: the key to the disintegration of the regime can come only from China, which supports Pyongyang as a buffer against the west. *** Perhaps the most haunting story of escape and defection I hear is from Hyeonseo Lee, whose gripping biography The Girl With Seven Names has become a global bestseller. “I saw a public execution aged seven, the victim’s brains exploding from machine-gun fire,” she says. “People cannot believe how these things happen, but for us that was normal life. It didn’t seem strange. Because we were brainwashed, we thought these people deserved to die.” Lee’s family was in the top strata of society, so she questioned her leaders only when she saw starving people dying in the streets. She began secretly to watch Chinese television at the age of 16, hanging a blanket over her bedroom window. When her family’s home burned down following an accident, her father ran back to grab their most precious possessions: portraits of Kim Jong‑il and Kim Il-sung. Without them, even in such circumstances, the family might have been carted off to prison – all families must display them in their homes. She crossed an icy river the following year to reach China and her mother sent a message telling her not to return. Lee spent years underground, during which she was kidnapped, narrowly escaped being forced into a brothel and survived police interrogation by pretending to be Chinese. Eventually, she reached South Korea – then, 11 years after she last saw her family, returned to the border on a daring, successful mission to smuggle her mother and brother across the border. Her father had died several years earlier, after falling out of favour with the regime and facing interrogation and beatings. I first meet her at dinner with a dozen other people. She arrives late, laughs a lot and generally lights up the room. Yet, talking alone the next day in a cake shop, Lee confesses her struggles, that she keeps busy to avoid awful memories. “When I meet people, I forget the pain. I want to keep positive and show that North Koreans can be positive people. But when I am on my own, I think about the past and it gives me more trauma.” Sometimes she cries at her computer; even sympathetic messages on social media remind her that she is a victim. “I don’t know how to enjoy your life,” she says. “Keeping busy is my escape.” She believes it is her duty to spread the word about “this alien life”. She plans to send back videos of her success as an inspiration to others. “Many female defectors are successful. It can be difficult to adjust, but this is still better than staying in hell. I want people to escape the country, but, if not, to know there is life outside. These are the most brainwashed people in the world. Only a small number are waking up.” • Jiwon Jung is a name assumed to protect family members in North Korea.

Even as private ownership of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) continues to grow, the public has been slow to embrace them. One study found some 73% of Americans wanted regulations on drones, while 42% said they opposed private ownership outright. In 2014, 36 states took up legislation governing drones, and the deadline for the US to impose federal regulations is near – the Federal Aviation Authority Modernization and Reform Act expires in September. In such an atmosphere, the notion of “drones for good” may seem somewhat counterintuitive. It is, though, the guiding principle of an international competition launched by Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, vice-president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Dubai. The year-long contest, which organizers dubbed the “World Cup of drones”, sought entries from contestants looking to put drones to positive use. It garnered more than 800 submissions from 57 countries. On Friday and Saturday, in Dubai, 19 semi-finalists will present their work to judges and investors from around the world. The winner of the international competition will receive $1m. Here are some of the most innovative contenders: Park ranger drones, Spain Poaching is a major issue in countries that are home to the world’s endangered species. Even in wildlife refuges and reserves, limited numbers of rangers are tasked with policing hundreds of acres, making it impossible to effectively protect the animals day and night. Arnau Terrades has a plan: deploy fleets of UAVs equipped with cameras, infrared sensors and high-quality microphones to deliver bird’s-eye views of the forest in real time. Such fleets would be supported by highly portable ground-support systems, requiring only a laptop, GPS, a communication system and extra batteries. Rangers would be able to launch drones via a car-powered catapult. The drones would use 3G technology to send position data back to the ground station and to communicate. Sensing suspicious activity, a UAV would sound an alarm to home base, allowing rangers to stream real-time video and react more quickly, potentially saving the lives of endangered animals. Drones to relieve slums, Kenya In Kenya, nearly one-third of the population lives in urban areas. Of that group, 60% – about 7.8 million people – live in slums, crudely constructed structures often so tightly packed that they only allow for very narrow dirt roads. This makes it exceedingly difficult to deliver clean water, install adequate lighting and build sustainable sanitation systems. It also poses incredible obstacles to firefighters. This is where David Kiarie’s drones come in. He proposes UAVs to fly above slums and capture spatial data – a way to map the areas and allow for better development planning as well as the delivery of much-needed supplies at a fairly low cost. Kiarie hopes to provide government stakeholders with accurate, timely information attained by drones in order to fight poverty, save lives and improve quality of life. Drones for search and rescue, Switzerland In the wake of air crashes, earthquakes and other disasters, the first order of business is to search for survivors, a task that can be difficult and dangerous. Rescue efforts in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear power plant meltdown showed the limitations of using robots, so Patrick Thevoz and his team of Swiss engineers developed the world’s first drone that does not crash on impact and is safe to fly around humans. Encased in a kind of pliable honeycomb orb, the drones are able to roll across surfaces in order to gather optical and thermal data, which could allow more disaster survivors to get medical attention sooner. Drones for reversing deforestation, UK The planet’s forests are rapidly disappearing – and conventional reforestation is too costly and time consuming. “We believe industrial-scale deforestation can only be countered with industrial-scale reforestation,” one team member says in a submission video. After gathering terrain data to generate a 3D map of the environment, drones can plant biodegradable seed pods, suspended in nutrient-rich gel, at predetermined locations. The British team behind the drone says it has the capacity to plant a billion trees in a year. Drones to detect land mines, Spain Bosnia and Herzegovina has been at peace for almost 20 years, but 120,000 buried landmines still dot the country. Such mines have claimed more than 1,700 lives. Using drone-detecting dogs or humans to find and remove mines is extremely slow and dangerous – so Marc Beltrán and his team want to employ drones to seek them out. Mine-seeking drones would capture images of the landscape and run algorithms post-flight to calculate the chances that land mines are present. The team says trial runs have been successful."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/marketforceslive/2015/jun/08/diageo-vodafone-and-bt-jump-on-bid-talk-but-greek-woes-hit-ftse","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-08T08:42:02Z","webTitle":"Diageo, Vodafone and BT jump on bid talk, but Greek woes hit FTSE","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2015/jun/08/diageo-vodafone-and-bt-jump-on-bid-talk-but-greek-woes-hit-ftse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/marketforceslive/2015/jun/08/diageo-vodafone-and-bt-jump-on-bid-talk-but-greek-woes-hit-ftse","fields":{"headline":"Diageo, Vodafone and BT jump on bid talk, but Greek woes hit FTSE","bodyText":"A spate of takeover talk is giving some support to a London market otherwise going through another nervous period as the Greek drama continues. Diageo is top of the FTSE 100 risers, up 122p or nearly 7% at 1882.5p after weekend reports it could be the subject of interest from 3G Capital, headed by Brazilian billionair Jorge Paulo Lemann. Lehman already owns Burger King, bought from Diageo in 2010, and HJ Heinz, in partnership with US investor Warren Buffett, and is involved in InBev, which bought Anheuser-Busch in 2008. It is also in the process of buying Kraft. Analysts were not completely convinced. Phil Carroll at Shore Capital said: The story appears to have originated from the Brazilian press with Veja, a newsweekly, reporting 3G Capital are in the initial stages of studying a buyout offer for Diageo although no source is provided. This news sent Diageo’s ADR shares in the later trading on Friday up 8%. The story has since made it into the weekend press in the UK including the Times and The Telegraph as far as we are aware. As to how likely a bid might be for Diageo it is difficult to say. We would have thought that through its ownership of AB InBev a bid for SABMiller is more likely especially given the greater level of potential synergies on offer. We would highlight this potential deal is something that has also seen recent speculation too. As for Diageo, it is trading at a discount to most of the large cap beverage companies (excluding Carlsberg) and is going through something of a transition so that could be perceived as an opportunity. We also believe there is strong potential for cost removal in the Diageo business generally which is something that 3G Capital seems to specialise in through its use of zero budgeting. However, although Diageo looks less expensive in the short-term than say SABMiller.. we believe the latter’s cost synergy potential and stronger top line growth prospects alongside along with its recent share price decline would offer the greater attraction assuming it is not too busy still working through the Kraft / Heinz deal. Furthermore, Diageo still has operational issues in certain key regions that are impacting its revenue growth potential. These are issues that are likely to remain the case for much of the remainder of calendar 2015 at least, in our opinion, and we believe that given they are macro-economic in nature (emerging market currency weakness versus product prices in developed market currency), so they are not going to be quickly rectified by any likely new owner. In summary, we expect Diageo shares to be strong today but we do not expect 3G to make a bid for the company. Martin Deboo at Jefferies said: To undertake a leveraged buyout of Diageo, assuming a take out at a 30% premium, and 6 times leverage, 3G would need to raise around £48bn ($73bn) in equity. This is more than double the equity component of the biggest LBO in history, TXU in 2007, which was $32bn. Moreover, 3G’s style has been to keep their direct equity participation small and look to the likes of Berkshire Hathaway to do the heavy lifting. 3G invested directly only around $3bn in Burger King, $4bn in Heinz and $5bn in Heinz/Kraft. Diageo is a very long way beyond that, even were Warren Buffett to be involved. What might be more likely is that 3G might be contemplating supporting a move for Diageo by ABI, the world’s largest brewer, in which Lehmann and Telles have substantial stakes. We think a stand-alone bid for Diageo by ABI would be a stretch without fresh equity.. But perhaps ABI, supported by 3G, would perceive plenty of opportunity for brewing/spirits synergy (we don’t) and/or potential for a ‘zero based budgeting’ approach to Diageo’s cost base (much more plausible, and lucrative, in our view.) But a catalyst for a re-evaluation of Diageo at these levels, bid or no? At 1761p and a PE of 19 times, Diageo remains about as unloved as we can remember, with market sentiment strikingly negative. But where the market continues to obsess around sluggish markets and an inventory overhang that is bound to clear sometime, the likes of 3G might be more inclined to focus on the upsides represented by cost savings, unleveraged cashflows, portfolio rationalisation and tax arbitrage. We think this is a timely reminder, then, of the value lurking in blue chip consumer staples assets like Diageo, on the rare occasions that their valuations dislocate from the peer group, as Diageo’s has now. Elsewhere Vodafone is up 3.65p at 245.70p on suggestions that US group Liberty Global could still be contemplating a full link-up despite last week’s news of an asset swap between the two groups. And BT is 5.35p better at 444.75p on talk of possible interest from Deutsche Telekom. Among the fallers Shire is down 90p at £53.65 following reports the pharmaceutical group was considering an $18bn offer for Swiss group Actelion. Overall, with worries about Greece running out of money before any deal with its creditors can be reached, the FTSE 100 is currently down 6.40 points at 6797.20. Comments from both sides over the weekend showed the Greek government and the eurozone remained as far apart as ever as the deadline for an agreement approaches. Meanwhile Chinese trade data also proved disappointing, renewing fears that it may not hit its economic targets. Foxtons is leading the mid-cap losers, down 9.9p at 237.7p on concerns about a possible class action suit on behalf of private landlords. But Entertainment One has added 11p to 339p after JP Morgan Cazenove raised its price target from 375p to 382p with an overweight rating. And the takeover speculation was not limited to the FTSE 100. Mid cap infrastructure group Balfour Beatty is up 9p at 258p after weekend reports it could be in the sights of a Chinese bidders. Liberum analysts said: The Sunday Times, which has a good record of predicting bids, indicated that China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCEC) might bid for Balfours at £2bn, or 290p. This would represent an unattractive 16% premium to Balfours Friday close. We believe that a potential bid is credible. Balfours has deep technical expertise. China has its own significant need for infrastructure investment. The Chinese have become much more active in the UK Construction market (note Hinckley Nuclear Power station, the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon and One Nine Elms (with Interserve). Also... we note some of the significant opportunities in the UK market at the moment. That said, the level of the potential bid seems too low. A bidder might argue that it is not necessary to pay a significant premium to the PPP assets (valued as a portfolio by management at £1.3bn and as a business by us at £1.5bn), give that PPP assets tend to trade in a tight range. The deal would likely be cash, which might arguably be more attractive than another construction company’s paper. However, as we have said many times, there is huge recovery potential in this business, given expected 2015 Construction sales of £6.6bn and a reasonable target margin of 2%. The shares remain attractive on a sum of the parts basis. Crudely, the market cap of £1.7bn is similar to our £1.5bn estimate of the PPP business value, which attributes little value to the Construction business which should be capable of at least £120m of EBIT, or the Support Service business which should be worth more than £400m.

Even if the nuclear industry delivers on time, new reactors won't be ready until the 2020s, and could end up costing consumers tens of billions of pounds. Meanwhile, the government's dash for gas is driving up our fuel bills, and giving new gas plants a free pass to pollute by allowing them to pump out climate-changing carbon till 2045. It's outrageous that nuclear and gas should be given such lengthy guarantees when renewable energy faces a funding cliff-edge after 2020. Britain has abundant wind and marine energy resources, and should be a world leader in developing and exporting expertise. MPs must act decisively where the government hasn't, and back a 2030 clean power target in the energy bill that will tackle climate change, create green jobs and provide energy we can all afford. Andrew Pendleton Head of campaigns, Friends of the Earth • The £240bn pledged in subsidies for new nuclear power stations in Britain would give £10,000 to each home in Britain so they could all install solar hot water, solar electric systems, controls and new boilers, where necessary with insulation and draught-stripping, and help take every home in Britain out of fuel poverty. The solar option helps cut energy demand from homes by 50%-75%, saving huge amounts in NHS costs for mental and physical health. Solar systems generate electricity at less than half the C02 life-cycle costs for nuclear. Most importantly the nuclear route puts more people, every year, into fuel poverty as prices rise, putting profits into the pockets of Big Energy and Big Construction. The solar option actually builds local businesses and community resilience. The Arab spring showed us the power of people who can't pay their bills. Can anyone tell me one good reason for choosing the nuclear over the solar option if our aim is to build a stronger, safer, cleaner, healthier Britain? Professor Sue Roaf Edinburgh • There should be only two guarantees to nuclear operators: (a) that they can sell electricity at the price required to cover their costs, and (b) that they are guaranteed to be able to sell some agreed fraction (say 50%) of the output of their reactors while operational, regardless of the cost they have to charge. If the operators have to charge double the standard rate, then tough – it would expose the myth that nuclear fission is an economically competitive way of generating electricity. International treaties enable the huge economic impact of a nuclear incident to be covered by governments, and thence the general public, instead of the operators. Operators should not be allowed to go bankrupt in the event of a serious incident but instead be required to charge whatever higher price for electricity from other reactors is necessary to cover the full cost. If this is 10 times the normal cost of electricity, again, tough. Chris Osman Oxford • Your correspondent Alan Rigby (Letters, 22 February) asks whether anyone has formally reported to the EU Competition commissioner the implications of providing EDF, the French state nuclear generator and distributor, with billions in subsidies to build and run nuclear plants in the UK. On 24 February 2011 Energy Fair (energyfair.org.uk) made just such representations to the European Commission. Included in the items we considered were state-sponsored subsidies for the nuclear industry, we listed subsidies for the short-to-medium-term cost of disposing of nuclear waste; and institutional support for nuclear power generation, by means of government offices and staff involved in institutional coordination, research and safety-related activities. Brigitta Renner-Loquenz, head of the competition directorate-general's unit responsible for state aid in the energy and environment sectors, replied: \"We are in contact with the UK authorities and asked them for their own summary of the facts, as well as for the reasons why they do not consider the alleged aid to be unlawful aid.\" She added: \"The above-mentioned letter … also includes questions concerning the nuclear third-party liability regime as well as the issues brought forward in another complaint.\" Dr David Lowry Member, Energy Fair • Electricity from coal is very dirty but costs about 5p/kwh. From gas it's fairly dirty and will soon cost more. Clean renewables are very expensive and intermittent. Replacing obsolete nuclear reactors with their carbon-clean but inefficient modern equivalent will cost about 10p/kwh, and produce much long-term radioactive waste. Safe and efficient molten salt reactors, burning abundant thorium and/or nuclear waste will generate clean electricity cheaper than from coal, and their waste is virtually all short-term and valuable. Alvin Weinberg's team at Oak Ridge labs ran such a reactor for five years. China, India, Japan and France are working on molten salt and/or thorium. The UK and US governments appear to have their heads in the sand. Interesting that sand is rich in both salt and thorium. John McGrother Buxton, Derbyshire • Looking out across Morecambe Bay from the pier at the end of Ulverston canal, one can plainly see at least one of the two nuclear reactors at Heysham, Lancashire. Twenty three miles from Heysham by road, and quite a bit closer as the crow flies, is Hesketh Bank, where the most advanced of the UK's exploratory fracking operations is situated.I can't help wondering whether carrying out industrial operations designed to interfere with geological strata in the vicinity of nuclear installations isn't a teeny bit stoops.

It is also a critical year for the world on climate change. Within months of Britain voting, the UN is holding a summit in Paris to agree a binding global agreement to tackle climate change. But there is a real danger that this great chance to achieve action is going to slip by, without the world even noticing. That might suit some politicians at home but it will be a disaster for our country and the world. Over recent months the EU, the US and, most importantly, China, have all made substantial commitments to cut the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. They represent important progress but we need to challenge every country to be as ambitious as possible. Because even if agreement can be achieved, it may not be enough to address the scale of the challenge we face. This would make it all the more likely that we will not do what is necessary to meet our obligations to future generations. As the floods in Britain showed last year, this is an issue of national – as well as global – security. We must be guided by the science, which shows that emissions are higher than anticipated and some effects are coming through more quickly than foreseen. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said, if the world is to hold warming below 2C, global emissions need to peak not long after 2020 and then decline rapidly to reach net zero in the second half of this century. The weaker the action now, the more rapid and costly the reductions will need to be later. I do not want to see Britain or any country having to adopt crisis measures to halt the slide into global catastrophe because we missed this critical opportunity now. A strong coalition for a weak deal will fail us all. So this is the agreement I will work for if I am prime minister: • Ambitious emissions targets for all countries, reviewed every five years, based on a scientific assessment of the progress towards the 2C goal. • A goal of net zero global emissions in the second half of this century. • Transparent, universal rules for measuring, verifying and reporting emissions with all countries adopting climate change adaptation plans. • An equitable deal in which richer countries provide support to poorer nations in their efforts to combat climate change. To support me in this task I have asked John Prescott to advise me on how we can achieve the best deal at the summit in Paris. His abilities and experience, as one of the architects of the Kyoto protocol in 1997, must be used at this critical time for our future and there is no one better than John at bashing heads together to get a deal. I also hope the millions of British people who care about climate change will join with others across the world to hold governments and political leaders including me, to account. This moment of opportunity must not be missed. Climate change has never been just an environmental issue. It affects the economy, migration and living standards too. There is no trade-off between tackling climate change and building an economy in which working families succeed. Indeed, success on one will help us achieve the other. Before the last election, the UK was a world leader in the transition to a green economy, with strong growth and investment in offshore wind turbine and nuclear power equipment manufacture. This government, which has long abandoned the pretence of being the “greenest ever”, has cut and delayed investment in green technology. While Tory MPs flirt with climate change denial, confused and contradictory signals on energy policy from ministers have caused deep uncertainty for investors. If Labour wins in May, we will put that right. The last Labour government was the first in the world to put carbon targets into law. The next Labour government will commit Britain to making our electricity supply carbon free by 2030. The last Labour government helped to create new markets for thousands of British companies and more than a million new jobs in the green sector. The next Labour government will give business certainty to invest so we can create another million such jobs over the next decade. All this will be a part of Labour’s better plan for working families: resetting the energy market to keep household bills as low as possible, creating new high-skill, high-wage jobs that can help to pay down the deficit, and investing in green technology that can power Britain’s economy into the future. I know the challenge of tackling climate change is not just a global responsibility, it is an economic necessity. It is the single most important thing we can do for our children and our grandchildren. And it will be one of the highest priorities in the government I lead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2014/jun/14/iran-deadline-nuclear-programme-deal-hassan-rouhani","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-14T13:59:42Z","webTitle":"Iran sets deadline for nuclear programme deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/14/iran-deadline-nuclear-programme-deal-hassan-rouhani","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jun/14/iran-deadline-nuclear-programme-deal-hassan-rouhani","fields":{"headline":"Iran sets deadline for nuclear programme deal","bodyText":"Iran is seeking a deal with major world powers within weeks that would end years of dispute over the country's nuclear programme and economic sanctions imposed on it by western powers, President Hassan Rouhani has said. He said he wanted to reach an agreement by 20 July, adding that the the international sanctions regime had crumbled and would not be rebuilt – even if no final nuclear deal could be reached. Rouhani also said he would be willing to work with the White House to meet the danger posed by Islamist extremists who have taken towns in northern Iraq, in a sign of shifting attitudes towards the US in Tehran. \"The disputes can be resolved with goodwill and flexibility … I believe that the 20 July deadline can be met despite remaining disputes. If not, we can continue the talks for a month or more,\" he said, addressing the nation in a live broadcast on state television. \"During the nuclear negotiations we have displayed our strong commitment to diplomacy (but even) if a deal can't be reached by July 20, conditions will never be like the past. The sanctions regime has been broken.\" We believe the issue can be settled by 20 July. We are very serious at the talks.\" Iran and the five permanent members of the UN security council – the US, Britain, France, Russia and China – and Germany will hold another four days of talks in mid-June in a bid to break a deadlock, which has raised the threat of the deadline pasisng without a deal. An outright failure of the talks would strengthen the position of conservative hardliners in Iran's clerical establishment against Rouhani, who has tried to improve relations with the country once termed the \"great Satan\". The countries severed ties during a hostage crisis after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. \"The west should use this opportunity to reach a final deal in the remaining weeks. American hawks and Israel will be blamed for (any) failure of the talks,\" Rouhani said, according to Reuters. Iran insists it needs to maintain a domestic uranium enrichment capability to produce fuel for a planned network of nuclear power plants without having to rely on foreign suppliers. But some western officials believe it will need many years to build any nuclear power station and that its underlying goal in enriching uranium is to be able to yield material for nuclear bombs at short notice, an allegation the Islamic state denies. The latest round of negotiations in Vienna last month ran into difficulties when it became clear that the number of centrifuge enrichment machines that Iran wanted to maintain was well beyond what would be acceptable to the west."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jul/28/is-hillary-clintons-ambitious-solar-energy-goal-for-the-us-workable","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-28T13:03:32Z","webTitle":"Is Hillary Clinton's ambitious solar energy goal for the US workable? | Karl Mathiesen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/28/is-hillary-clintons-ambitious-solar-energy-goal-for-the-us-workable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jul/28/is-hillary-clintons-ambitious-solar-energy-goal-for-the-us-workable","fields":{"headline":"Is Hillary Clinton's ambitious solar energy goal for the US workable?","bodyText":"On Sunday, Hillary Clinton took a first swing at the many-headed carbon hydra. By the end of her first term, she said, the US would have seven times more solar energy capacity than it does today. And by 2027, renewable energy would supply a third of the nation’s electricity. Clinton’s announcement, which the campaign said would be the first of many on climate change from the presidential hopeful, extends the carbon-saving ambition in a significant sector of the economy. Burning fossil fuels for electricity accounts for 31% of US greenhouse gas emissions. One estimate found Clinton’s 33% renewable target could slice another 4% off the US’s existing pledge to cut emissions by 26-28% by 2025. Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s Americas chief, Ethan Zindler, said the ambition was high, but within reach. “It appears to be on the upper end but it’s entirely doable given the rapidly improving economics of renewables generally and solar particularly.” The momentum is already swinging towards low carbon electricity. Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, due for activation in August, is predicted to push the renewable sector from its current 13% share of the electricity market to 25% by 2027. In 2015, solar photovoltaic installations are forecast to rise by 27%, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). This rise has been aided by the soon-to-expire solar investment tax credit (ITC), which the industry said Clinton will have to revive. “Clinton’s ambitious goal for solar is only possible if solar continues its impressive trajectory. SEIA is working to extend the solar ITC and remove statewide barriers that inhibit the growth of solar,” said SEIA president and CEO, Rhone Resch. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Clinton noted that further federal investment would be needed to incentivise the sector’s push to 33%. In a fact sheet, the campaign flagged the resuscitation of tax credits and some innovation and regulatory incentives. “That [the return of tax credits] is hardly a sure thing, given that at least one chamber of Congress will inevitably be Republican controlled during at least the first two years of any new president’s term,” said Zindler. Jürgen Weiss, head of climate change at the Brattle Group consultancy, said incentives were important as the industry remained relatively tiny, with low public awareness. A large percentage of costs for installers of residential solar are wrapped up in selling the technology to a sceptical public who have relatively low electricity costs and little concern for climate change. “The big part is convincing people to sign up in the first place. People in the US may care less about climate change than they do about cost,” he said. Although the technology, regulatory and labour costs are roughly similar, the price of installing residential solar in Germany (where high electricity costs, strong public acceptance and large government incentives have driven a huge push to solar) is around $1.50 (£1) per watt cheaper than in the US. Even if half of Clinton’s target of 140GW of solar by 2021 were to come from residential (as opposed to utility) solar panels, that equates to a cost difference of more than $100bn, mostly spent on advertising and sales. John Reilly, an energy economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the targets would be a challenge “in terms of providing incentives to build that much”. Weiss said: “I do think those costs will come down as the market matures and people get more informed.” The danger, he said, was providing too much tax-payer funded incentive early on. In Germany and the UK, the solar industry has come under political pressure for being too successful when subsidies were high and now suffers from accusations of being a ‘subsidy junky’. It’s important to clear up some ambiguity in the Clinton rhetoric. From her renewables campaign video, “a 10-year goal of generating enough renewable energy to power every single home in America” does not mean every home is going to have its own clean energy supply. The residential sector uses roughly a third of the total electricity generated. So a 33% renewable goal means the country will be generating this much clean energy, but not all of it will end up in homes. But factories and office buildings don’t vote and the promise, as my colleague Suzanne Goldenberg points out, allows Clinton to sound like she’s liberating bill payers from utilities. It is also clear that Clinton’s focus on solar (as opposed to wind) is aimed at the voting bill payer. Solar even garners support among some Republicans because of the freedom it offers from regulation and bills. But the other side of the clean power revolution might be justified in feeling a little left out by Clinton’s policy announcement. Wind energy is by far the big brother to solar. In 2014, wind generated 4.4% of the country’s electricity compared with 0.4% from the sun. In Iowa, where Clinton made her announcement, wind’s share is more than a quarter. It’s cheaper than solar, although the gap is narrowing, and the nation’s first offshore wind farm began construction on Monday. “Recent cost declines have made wind energy the lowest-cost zero carbon solution, and one of the lowest cost generation options overall. As a result ... wind will account for the majority of all generation additions going forward,” said the American Wind Energy Association’s Rob Gramlich. The Department of Energy has found that wind energy can affordably reach 20% of electricity generation by 2030. And, under Obama’s Clean Power Plan, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts it will be the biggest contributor of new renewable capacity throughout the 2020s. As part of her announcement, Clinton pledged to uphold the Obama administration’s heavily-opposed restrictions on the carbon emissions of power stations, which are expected to accelerate the already rapid shut-down of coal plants across the country. This capacity will mostly be taken up by cheap gas, but there will be space for renewables if they can compete. Alex Trembath, a senior analyst at the Breakthrough Institute, said: “Action on carbon emissions will largely come by making clean energy cheap, as opposed to making dirty energy more expensive, for a variety of reasons.” The boost to renewables raises important questions about the ability of the grid, which is built to carry power from continuously-burning large power stations rather than millions of diffuse and variable solar panels, to handle such high levels of variable electricity supply. Reilly said the 33% target was achievable. “If we did build that much, then in terms of the grid we would likely have a lot of spare capacity sitting around, so it would be possible to balance it out. The challenge as time goes by and that capacity retires is whether the back-up capacity is actually built,” he said. But Weiss said the likely reality of a renewables explosion would not be uniform: “Average 33% across the country is a different story from having a 70% renewable share in some places and a 10% renewable share someplace else.” Going beyond 33% is when things get really tough for the grid. A study Reilly authored in 2012 estimated that reaching 80% renewable generation would add around 40% to the cost of electricity. Jesse Jenkins and Trembath recently suggested that reaching levels of variable renewables above their ‘capacity factor’ becomes increasingly expensive. Capacity factor is the amount of time your source actually spends generating electricity - for wind 25-35% and solar 10-20%. So going above a third of the market is where the heavy lifting really begins. This would ramp up the costs of preparing the grid for new types of generation, which the Clinton campaign flagged as a spending priority. Weiss estimated this could cost in the range of $100bn over the next 10-15 years, roughly a 5-10% increase on current electricity spending. “My main issue with her target is that it is narrowly constrained to solar,” said Trembath. “The biggest omission I continue to see from Democrats is support for nuclear power, which needs federal support in different ways than most renewable energy technologies do.” In total, Clinton’s pledge will push the zero carbon electricity sector (including nuclear) from 32% today, to about 50% in 2027. Any credible economy-wide climate scheme will need to encompass a great swathe of measures to reduce carbon, said Zindler. “There are other means for lowering CO2 emissions in the US. Our comparatively profligate use of gasoline has been one area of focus and average consumer vehicle fuel efficiency has actually been rising in the US in recent years. More improvements in transport are definitely possible, particularly in the area of trucks. More efficient use of electricity in homes and businesses is also an area that clearly offers opportunities that do not even necessarily need to be policy driven as they offer consumers the opportunity to save money,” he said. Environmentalists were also quick to point out that Clinton was still skirting the big federal policy questions on support for the fossil fuel industry - the Arctic and Keystone XL pipeline. Can Clinton be a climate Heracles “taking on the global threat of climate change”? It’s a start and the rhetoric is certainly bold. But this amounts to a partial decapitation of one head. It will take many more swings to kill the beast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2017/feb/14/german-growth-italy-uk-inflation-pound-greece-janet-yellen-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-14T18:06:36Z","webTitle":"Janet Yellen says Fed on course to raise US rates, UK inflation jumps to 1.8% - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/feb/14/german-growth-italy-uk-inflation-pound-greece-janet-yellen-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2017/feb/14/german-growth-italy-uk-inflation-pound-greece-janet-yellen-live","fields":{"headline":"Janet Yellen says Fed on course to raise US rates, UK inflation jumps to 1.8% - as it happened","bodyText":"Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen opened the door to further US interest rate rises if the economy continued on track, telling US senators waiting too long to act would be “unwise”. The comments saw the dollar move higher, with analysts suggesting Yellen had been more hawkish than expected. Against a basket of currencies the US currency added 0.36%. But Yellen also warned that the economic outlook was uncertain, although she repeatedly refused to be drawn on what effect President Trump’s proposed policies would have on the economy. Yellen maintained bank lending had grown despite the Dodd Frank regulations designed to avoid a new financial crisis, prompting Senator Elizabeth Warren to say Trump and his advisors were wrong to think of rolling them back. But not everyone agreed that banks were lending as freely as was claimed. On immigration, Yellen said slowing the pace of immigration would slow economic growth. Here is our full report on the Yellen hearing, leading on the disagreements over Dodd Frank: Earlier, UK inflation rose at its fastest pace for two-and-a-half years but Germany’s economy grew more slowly than expected. And with that, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. Senator Chris Van Hollen asks about wage gowth. Yellen: Somewhat faster wage growth would be consistent with our inflation objective. Ultimately real wage growth is limited by productivity growth which is why I’ve lamented it [productivity growth] has been so slow. I would like congress to focus on policies which would increase productivity... She adds that there are a number of areas which impact productivity, including policies which promote education, innovation etc. And with that the hearing is over. Senator John Kennedy asks about slow growth, and what blame the Fed has. Yellen: We have put in place a monetary policy to get economy growing at its potential. She says this has boosted employment but productivity needs to improve. Kennedy changes tack: If community banks did nothing in financial crisis why are they subject to Dodd Frank. Yellen says they are not subject to exactly the same rules and large parts of Dodd Frank do not apply to them. We have done our best to tailor our regulations so they are appropriate according to the risk. Kennedy: Does it bother you no one responsible for the financial crisis went to jail? Yellen: I think those who were accountable should have had appropriate punishment. It is up to the Justice Department to impose criminal sanctions and in many cases I understand they thought they could not get convictions. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto asks about the benefits of immigration, and the contribution for the economy given President Trump’s recent orders. What impact would [Trump’s moves] have on our growth and competitiveness Yellen: Slowing the pace of immigration would probably slow growth. Masto: If the Mexican economy went into recession, what effect would that have on the US. Yellen: Our economies are closely tied, our developments here have a spillover flow to them and there could be flows in the opposite direction. Senator Dean Heller says he wasn’t there earlier so did Yellen say there might be a rate rise in March. Yellen (who suddenly and coincidentally has a small outbreak of coughing) tries to pay it straight and says: I indicated that at our coming meetings we will try to evaluate whether economy is progressing in line with expectations and if it is it will probably be appropriate to raise interest rates further. A gradual rise in rates is likely to be appropriate. Heller: Is it the same answer for an interest rate rise at the June meeting? Yellen: The economic outlook is uncertain, but in December we said a few interest rate rises would be appropriate this year. Every meeting is live. Heller: what effect would fiscal stimulus have? Yellen repeats it is too soon to know what these measures are, and fiscal policy is only one of many things we have to consider. Heller: what is better, tax cuts or spending. Yellen: a decision for Congress. Heller: Do you support a border tax. Yellen also brushes this off as a matter for Congress. [Nice try Senator Heller.] Senator Brian Schatz asks about climate change. To what extent does Fed take this into account in assessing risks. Yellen: In monetary policy our forecasts do not go out so far that climate change would affect economy. If have a hurricane etc, that may have impact we take into account. Schatz: I’d like to disagree. That’s not the case any more. We’re not talking about severe weather in 15 years, we’re talking about what’s happened in the last few years. It’s having a material impact on the economy now. Yellen: Various economic fora are looking into effects of climate change on economy. We recognise that risk events such as severe weather could have effects on the financial system. We’ve been trying to build resilience so financial companies can deal with risk events. Senator Thom Tillis: On bank lending, there is other research [from that quoted by Yellen earlier] showing a decrease in the amount of loans post-crisis. Is it possible that far fewer people are actually asking for loans. Yellen: I think that is true and a lot of small businesses say growth does not justify significant expansion plans. Tillis: Isn’t it problematic to make us think only a small number are not getting loans. I think there is pent up demand. Yellen: Sometimes small businesses borrow against homes etc, so because there was a reduction in residential property values [there was less ability to borrow] Our objective is for banks to lend, safe and sound loans. Tillis: on one hand we say banks can lend to anyone, then say you can’t lend outside these narrow parameters. [Can’t say] anyone can borrow. The Dodd Frank bill expanded into [a huge amount of regulations]. Here’s a good graphic from ING Bank on Yellen’s comments: Senator Tim Scott talks about ways to mitigate regulatory burden for smaller banks. Yellen says this is important. Congress might want to except community banks from some of the provisions. Senator Elizabeth Warren brings up the Trump plan to row back on the Dodd-Frank regulations on banks. She says Trump said Dodd Frank was a “disaster’ and banks were not lending, and wants Yellen’s view. Yellen says lending has grown, It exceeds its 2008 peak, and the same is true of total loans held by banks. We have seen healthy growth in actual lending in the economy. Over half of small businesses in a survey said they did not need to borrow. Warren: So the data do not back up the President. Warren than asks about comments that banks have having to hoard capital. Does this prevent banks lending? Yellen says its not a requirement that they take the money and don’t use it, the capital is used to make loans. Warren asks how US banks have done in comparison to foreign competitors since Dodd-Franks. Yellen says she believes our banks are more profitable, are capturing market share from European banks, are well capitalised and seen as safe and strong. Warren says if we are considering changing regulations, we need to start with facts and these show Trump and his advisors are wrong on every reason they’ve given for tearing up Dodd Franks. We did this kind of [lack of] regulation before and it resulted in the worst financial crisis since the great depression. Senator Tom Cotton says wage growth has been largely stagnant over the last few years although there have been some signs of increase. Yellen says wage growth depends on productivity growth, which has been relatively depressed in recent years. We’ve seen much higher wage growth for skilled workers, compared to less skilled. Wage growth has picked up somewhat [as the labour market gets tighter]. We have put in place conditions intended to lower unemployment rate.. and the labour market has in a general sense started to improve. As Yellen continues, Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, believes her comments on interest rates were stronger than expected: Yellen’s tone to the newly elected Congress was definitely “ballsy”, it suggest that she will maintain the Fed’s independence, and will stand her ground when it comes to any risks that the Trump administration may (or may not) pose to financial and economic stability in the US. She was a touch more hawkish than expected, which, when combined with comments from non-voter Lacker who said that the case is building for a rate hike in March, boosted the dollar, weighed on equities and on bonds... Watch out for who Trump picks to fill the vacant spots on the Fed. Yellen called for diversity, but if Trump fills those spots with people akin to his own world view – low rates and lower dollar – then the path of Fed policy could change sharply going forward. Back with senator Shelby who asks about the trade imbalance and the long term effects. Yellen says the current account deficit on goods and services has increased, it leads to a build up in our endebtedness to foreigners so it is a long term concern. It is currently close to $500bn a year. Whether it is troubling depends on what the long term trends are. Toomey ends by calling for the Fed not to make any new regulations until the new members of the Fed are appointed. Senator Pat Toomey asks about the Fed’s growth forecast. He says the new President committed to tax reform, rollback of regulation, an infrastructure spending bill and people believed that would give stronger economic growth, with equities rising. Yet the December Fed meeting had no change in their opinion for the prospects for economic growth. It looks like the Fed believes these things will either not happen or are not pro-growth. Yellen says we don’t yet have clarity. Most of my colleagues decided not to speculate on the economic policy changes and their consequences. Some said they assumed there would be a mild fiscal stimulus, but most decided we wanted more clarity before incorporating them into our forecasts. Asked about consumer lending, Yellen says it is critical to monitor for abuses in consumer lending, and says she wishes the Fed had been more active previously. Senator Bob Menendez asks about the plans to repeal Obamacare and its effects on the economy. Yellen says we would have to look at the effect, a loss of access to health insurance could have an impact on household spending and on the economy. Access to healthcare has likely improved people’s mobility, and losing this could have implications for job mobility. Senator Bob Corker asks about future policy changes (from the government) and their effect on the economy (referring to Trump’s plans to boost infrastructure spending, tax reforms etc). Yellen says: We recognise there may be significant economic policy changes and they could affect outlook. We don’t yet have enought clarity on what changes will be put in place to factor them in. We don’t want to base current policy on speculation on what may come down the line. [Policy changes] could affect monetary policy but it depends on what they are and the timing. We will certainly pay attention to it. Some of the policiies being discussed may raise the deficit and have an effect on economic growth. But I would say fiscal sustainability has been a long standing problem. Reed asks about cyber security and how important it is for companies to have expertise. Yellen says cyber security is a major major risk that financial firms face. Boards are aware and appreciate the seriousness of the risk. But it is very important for boards to have appropriate expertise. Senator Jack Reed asks about Taylor’s rule for setting interest rates and what effect that would have. Yellen says: Taylor’s rule would call for a rate between 3.5 to 4%, higher than current Fed rate. I believe we would have a weaker economy if we had followed the dictates of that rule. Senator Richard Shelby asks about the three forthcoming openings at the Fed, and whether Yellen will see out her term which ends early next year. Yellen says firmly: I do intend to complete my term as chair. On the three forthcoming new members, Yellen says the role of the chair is to work constructively with all the governors. On removing rules and regulations - including Trump’s executive order calling for removing two existing rules for every new one - Yellen says independent agencies are not bound by this. Yellen finishes her prepared remarks. Now the questions. Senator Sherrod Brown asks whether banks are not lending (something members of Trump’s administration have suggested) Yellen says only 2% of small businesses said in a survey they could not get the lending they needed. Brown: So just because people in high places say it, doesn’t make it so. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Yellen largely maintained the same tone seen in the central bank’s January meeting, claiming that a rate hike would be appropriate if inflation and wage growth matches the its current expectations, while hinting that Donald Trump’s fiscal policies could change the course of the Fed’s 2017 journey. Differing views about an imminent US rate rise. Deutsche Bank’s chief US economist says: But: Here is Yellen’s opening statement in full. On interest rates, Yellen said: As I noted on previous occasions, waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the FOMC to eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession. Incoming data suggest that labor market conditions continue to strengthen and inflation is moving up to 2 percent, consistent with the Committee’s expectations. At our upcoming meetings, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with these expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate. On the possible policy changes which could come from president Trump: That said, the economic outlook is uncertain, and monetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to the economic outlook and associated risks as informed by incoming data. Also, changes in fiscal policy or other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook. Of course, it is too early to know what policy changes will be put in place or how their economic effects will unfold. While it is not my intention to opine on specific tax or spending proposals, I would point to the importance of improving the pace of longer-run economic growth and raising American living standards with policies aimed at improving productivity. I would also hope that fiscal policy changes will be consistent with putting U.S. fiscal accounts on a sustainable trajectory. In any event, it is important to remember that fiscal policy is only one of the many factors that can influence the economic outlook and the appropriate course of monetary policy. Overall, the FOMC’s monetary policy decisions will be directed to the attainment of its congressionally mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability. In her opening testimony to the senate, US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said a rate increase would be appropriate at one of its forthcoming meetings if employment and inflation evolved in line with expectations. She said waiting too long to remove monetary policy accommodation would be unwise, and could require rapid, disruptive rate rises which could push the US economy into recession. As it stands gradual increases in rates would probably be appropriate. The jobs market is continuing to strengthen, and inflation is moving up to the 2% target. On Trump’s fiscal policy, she said changes could affect the economic outlook but it was too early to know how this would unfold. US markets have dipped slightly as investors await Fed chair Janet Yellen’s comments to Congress, due to start shortly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is 13 points or 0.07% lower while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.13% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.15%. Late last month, congressman Patrick McHenry wrote to Fed chair Janet Yellen calling on the central bank to stop negotiating agreements with other regulators. He said: “The Federal Reserve must cease all attempts to negotiate binding standards burdening American business until President Trump has had an opportunity to nominate and appoint officials that prioritize America’s best interests.” Now Reuters is reporting a reply from Yellen, saying such global negotiations benefit the US and the Fed has the authority and responsibility to consult with its foreign counterparts. Another topic for today’s hearing, no doubt. Over in Greece... farmers are holding protests against the government’s austerity-driven tax rises. The group have reached Syntagma Square, site of the Athens parliament, chanting “people don’t bow your heads. The only way forward is organisation and struggle.” Lambros Papaconstantinou, a farmer from Karditsa, told the Guardian: “We are determined to go to the end because there is no other way. How can we survive when 70 percent of our earnings go on taxes, fuel costs, social contributions?” And ahead of Yellen’s testimony: Michael Flynn may have hit the headlines by resigning as President Trump’s national security advisor, but markets are more likely to be focused on a testimony to the Senate later from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. The Fed has indicated it could raise US rates three times this year, so any hints from Yellen in this direction - and whether the first increase will come in March - will be keenly watched. With Trump previously criticising the Fed for its low interest rate policy, her views on the president’s tax and spending plans could also form part of the questioning. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, said: The last meeting of the US central bank saw monetary policy kept on hold, with little alteration made on the previous statement. With forward guidance implying that the rate-setting body believe there will be three rate hikes this year, the market is once more predicting a more dovish path. With an approximately 35% chance currently being given for a March hike, today’s speech could provide an opportunity for Ms. Yellen to show that she is serious in making significant progress in the normalisation of monetary policy before her term expires next year. A failure to do so could see more pressure come on the US dollar going forward, with the hugely popular call before the turn of the year for a further appreciation in the buck in 2017 starting to look in need of a more hawkish Fed. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: Overall, the market is looking for three things: is the Fed still thinking about three rate hikes this year? Has anything occurred that could de-rail this expectation? Will Yellen give the markets a reality check by voicing some scepticism about potential fiscal change under President Trump? Here’s Katie Allen’s news story on this morning’s inflation report: UK inflation climbed to 1.8% in January, driven by a jump in fuel prices, while the weak pound and rising oil price sent costs for firms soaring. The Office for National Statistics said inflation was at its highest level since June 2014 and followed a reading of 1.6% in December. But it was below a forecast for 1.9% in a Reuters poll of economists, as falling clothes prices offset some of the upward pressure on inflation from fuel and food. The more modest than expected inflation reading bolstered expectations that the Bank of England will be in no hurry to raise interest rates to keep price rises in check. Reflecting that view, the pound dipped. It had been above $1.25 against the dollar before the figures and fell to $1.2464 by late morning, down 0.5% on the day. However, economists say inflation will rise further this year, going through the Bank of England’s target within months. Fuelling the rise is the pound’s sharp fall since the Brexit vote, which makes imports to the UK more expensive, and also the rise in oil prices on the back of lower production. “We expect headline inflation to break through the 2% target as early as February and keep rising to around 3% by autumn this year,” said Oliver White, economist at Fathom Consulting..... More here: Peter Dowd MP, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, says the solution to higher inflation includes curbs on utility firms and a higher minimum wage: “Today’s further rise in inflation to its highest level since June 2014 shows that after seven wasted years of Tory spending cuts and failure to invest, it’s working people that are being squeezed. With shocking increases in the price of household utilities announced last week, it’s time for this government to get tough on the profiteers. “Only Labour will take the firm action needed to end the Tories’ rigged economy, by taking action to tackle gas and electricity price rises, bringing the railways back into public ownership to end the ticket price rip-off, and bringing in a £10 per hour Real Living Wage.” Rising inflationary pressures may drive more manufacturers into ‘shrink-flation’, where they discretely trim the size of their products but don’t change the price. James Brown from pricing expert Simon-Kucher explains: We expect to see fewer or lighter promotions, and smaller or lighter products on the shelves over the coming months. The implication for shoppers is that we end up paying more for the same. Take Quality Street tins, for example, which have been getting steadily slimmer as the years go by: But the ONS won’t be fooled. They have an army of trained price collectors, who scour the shops to check prices, and also keep tabs on whether we’re getting less for our money. Katie Allen took a trip with one ‘inflation food soldier’ last week. Here’s her report: James Wells of the the ONS points out that Britain isn’t the only country facing higher prices. Germany’s inflation rate jumped to 1.9% last month..... Both countries will have been hit by the jump in oil prices over the last year. But monetarists, such as Tim Goldsmith, blame central banks for creating too much money.... We’ve also had some disappointing economic data from the eurozone this morning. The single currency bloc only grew by 0.4% in the last quarter of 2016, not the punchier 0.5% that was initially estimated last month. Eurostat, the statistics body, has revised down its figures following weaker-than-expected growth figures from Germany (0.4%) and Italy (0.2%) this morning. And in another blow...Greece is shrinking again. New figures show that its GDP shrank by 0.4% in October-December. The cost of living squeeze is already forcing some families to seek help handing their debts, warns the Money Advice Trust. Jane Tully, director of external affairs, fears that rising inflation will drag more people into difficulties: “Household budgets are being chipped away by this new squeeze on personal finances – and many people who are only ‘just about managing’ risk falling into problem debt as a result. “Demand for debt advice is already surging this year, and this demand is likely to continue to grow as the squeeze continues. Rising inflation and high levels of household borrowing mean that it has never been more important for government, advice agencies and lenders to work together to make sure people get the help they need. “Anyone struggling to cope should seek free advice from a charity-run service like National Debtline as soon as possible.” There are two main factors that drove Britain’s inflation rate jumped from 1.6% to 1.8% last month -- fuel costs surged, and the long run of falling food prices is levelling out. The ONS says that: Transport: prices, overall, fell by 0.6% between December 2016 and January 2017, compared with a larger fall of 2.5% a year ago. Within transport, the largest upward effect came from motor fuels, with prices rising by 3.4% between December 2016 and January 2017, having fallen by 2.6% a year earlier. Food and non-alcoholic beverages: Food prices were unchanged between December 2016 and January 2017, having fallen by 0.6% a year ago. Following a sustained period of deflation of food prices since mid-2014, during which the 12-month rate was often lower than negative 3.0%, the rate has increased for 4 consecutive months, reaching negative 0.4% in January 2017. This is the highest it has been since June 2014. But...this was partly countered by cheaper clothing costs, thanks to the post-Christmas sales. The ONS explains that: Clothing and footwear: the downward effect was due to prices for a wide range of items of clothing and footwear. Overall, prices fell by 4.2% between December 2016 and January 2017, compared with a smaller fall of 3.1% last year. Sales patterns may have contributed to this, as the proportion of items on sale increased by more between December 2016 and January 2017 than it did a year ago. Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, has some advice for readers worrying about inflation: “The Brex-effect is starting to bite into our wallets and put extra pressure on our household budgets. With the cost of fuel shooting up there’s never been a better time to rethink your travel arrangements. Now might be the time to look at car sharing, cycling or at least clearing out your boot to make your driving more economical. “This news will hurt anyone with savings; if your account isn’t paying you at least 1.8% your money will be losing buying power. Don’t let your bank keep your hard earned cash without giving you a decent return; use savings to pay off expensive debts or get a high interest current account.” How high could inflation go this year? Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, reckons it could spike to 3% - well over the Bank of England’s target (and probably exceeding many people’s pay rises). He says: “The trend is clearly towards higher inflation, however, and we should expect the rate of price increases to rise above the 2% Bank of England target in the next few months. By the end of this year, inflation is likely to be around 3pc and possibly even higher. Rising energy prices and the weakness of the pound are the main factors behind this expected increase. Britain isn’t the only economy facing higher inflation, points out Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte. He says: “Rising inflation is not just a UK phenomenon and is not just currency-related. Prices are rising across the West, as higher fuel and other commodity prices feed through to consumers. In fact, German prices have risen faster than UK prices in the last year and last month Germany’s inflation rate was higher than the UK’s [at 1.9%].” This ‘reflation’ trade is one reason that world stock markets are climbing, with Wall Street hitting record highs again last night. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady is very concerned that inflation is going to take a big chunk out of workers’ earnings - particularly public sector workers, whose pay rises are capped at 1%. “The last thing working people need is another pay squeeze. But prices are shooting up and real wage growth is stalling. “Next month’s Budget must set out a clear plan for preventing another living standards crisis – families still haven’t recovered from the last one. “This should include ending the current pay restrictions on nurses, teachers and other public servants.” Jeremy Cook of World First is in the Valentine’s spirit: Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, fears that inflation will overtake wage rises this year - meaning real incomes will start falling again. He points to the surge in the cost of imported raw materials: Sterling has fallen around 12% on a trade-weighted basis since last June’s referendum, and as a result producers are facing sharply higher input costs – up 20.5% on a year earlier. It’s almost unthinkable that cost increases of this magnitude can be fully absorbed, leaving firms with little choice but to pass at least some of the burden onto consumers. By the end of the year price inflation looks set to outstrip wage growth, which will squeeze household budgets in the short term. Good grief! The prices paid by UK manufacturers for imported raw materials and fuel jumped by 20% in January, compared to a year earlier. That’s largely due to the fall in sterling (down 13%), and and the higher cost of crude oil (up 82% year-on-year). Factories are now passing some of this cost onto their customers. Output prices rose by 3.5%, which is likely to push consumer price inflation up in the months ahead. This jump in inflation shows that Britain is now suffering the impact of the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote. So says Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International, who believes the cost of living will keep climbing. “The fall in the pound is really starting to stoke inflation as the rising cost of imports bites. A sharp rise in UK CPI now sees inflation within a whisker of the Bank of England’s 2% target. Sterling weakness has continued to push fuel and food prices higher, resulting in today’s CPI reading of 1.8%. “With Britain seemingly heading for a hard Brexit, it’s likely we will see the pound continue to wobble over the next two years, resulting in higher inflation in the short term. Indeed, price rises are expected to reach 2.8% by the end of the year. “With inflation forecast to exceed the Bank of England’s target this year, still slow wage growth and Mark Carney showing no intention of raising rates any time soon, millions of households will begin to feel the financial squeeze in their pockets. Rising prices and relatively stagnant incomes are a painful combination. Today’s rise in inflation will leave many people worrying that their disposable income is shrinking, especially if their pay isn’t rising at a similar rate. The Treasury admits that this is a worry, with a spokesperson saying that: “Employment has reached record levels and earnings have risen faster than inflation for more than 2 years. The government appreciates that families are concerned about the cost of living and that is why we are cutting taxes for millions of working people and have frozen fuel duty, saving an average driver £130 a year compared to previous plans.” The pound has fallen by half a cent against the US dollar since the inflation figures came out, to $1.247. That’s because City economists had expected an even sharper rise in inflation, to 1.9%. Britain’s inflation rate is being driven up by the rising cost of motor fuels, says the Office for National Statistics. That’s because the oil price has risen sharply over the last year, from $33 per barrel to around $55 today. Food prices also had an upward impact on the cost of living in January. But clothing and footwear prices fell by more than a year ago. Britain’s CPI inflation rate is now at its highest level since June 2014: Breaking! Britain’s inflation rate has jumped to 1.8% in January, up from 1.6% in December. That’s takes the Consumer Prices Index closer to the Bank of England’s 2% target, and suggests that the weak pound is continuing to drive up the cost of living. More to follow! It’s nearly time for the latest UK inflation figures, which will show how the cost of living increased in January. In the meantime, market research firm GfK has just reported that 34% of people expect future consumer price increases will happen “more rapidly” than the past 12 months. This is more than three times as many as the 11% that thought this in January 2016. Joe Staton, Head of Market Dynamics at GfK, says: “The fall in the value of the Pound since the Brexit vote has fuelled speculation among both business leaders and consumers alike that we will see accelerated price inflation filter through to the High Street this year. Consumers have already been hit by higher food and energy prices because the weakness of sterling is raising prices and reducing consumer spending power. This has affected a range of typical purchases from Marmite to Majorca summer holidays. This chart, from economist Rupert Seggins, shows how the pound (in red) has weakened since last summer’s referendum. Italy’s growth figures are out...and, like Germany’s, they’re weaker than hoped. The Italian economy (rarely the most vigorous of beasts) expanded by a meagre 0.2% in the last thee months of 2016. Some economists had hoped Italy might hit the dizzy heights of 0.3% growth, which would still have been below the euro average. Back to today’s growth figures...and the Netherland’s economy has slowed. Dutch GDP rose by 0.5% in the last three months of 2016, a decent-enough number, but rather slower than the 0.8% growth recorded in July-September. There’s drama in Tokyo this morning, where Toshiba has revealed it is taking a $6.3bn writedown on its troubled nuclear power division, and announced that its chairman is stepping down. Toshiba has also been forced to delay the publication of its latest earnings report, as it tries to assess the full damage following its mishandled purchase of a US construction firm. Here’s the full story: Commerzbank analyst Joerg Kraemer argues that Germany’s economy is still in good shape, even though growth missed forecasts in the last quarter. He says: “The fourth quarter was not as strong as most economists had expected, but sentiment surveys rose sharply in the past months and orders are also pointing upward,” “Therefore growth could slightly pick up in the first quarter of 2017.” It’s a historic day for Rolls-Royce, for the wrong reasons. The engine-maker has reported its biggest ever loss, a whopping £4.6bn, this morning, due to sterling’s weakness and the company’s £671m fine for bribery. CEO Warren East argued that Rolls is making good progress with its cost-cutting programme. But the City isn’t impressed, sending its shares down 3% in early trading.... In another blow to the eurozone, Finland’s economy is shrinking again. Finnish GDP contracted by 0.5% in the final three months of 2016, new figures show, wiping out the 0.4% growth in July-September. Austerity, the demise of Nokia, and the sanctions imposed on Russia have all hurt Finland’s economy; today’s figures show its economy is only 0.2% larger than a year ago. Frederik Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet fears that Germany could drag the overall eurozone growth rate down, from the ‘flash’ estimate of 0.5% in Q4. Holger Zschaepitz of Welt points out that net trade had a negative impact on German growth (because imports grew faster than exports) Germany’s economy didn’t perform as well as hoped in the final three months of last year. New figures show that German GDP expanded by 0.4% in the October-December period, weaker than the 0.5% which economists had predicted. That means Europe’s ‘powerhouse economy’ lagged behind the UK, which grew by 0.6% in the same period. In a double-whammy, German growth in the third quarter of 2016 has been revised down too, from +0.2% to just 0.1%. German’s statistics office says that foreign trade held back growth in the last three months of the year, with imports growing much faster than exports. But growth was supported by government spending, and a small pick-up in consumer spending too. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There’s lots on the agenda today. For starters, we’re getting growth figures from Germany (out now) and Italy (9am GMT) for the last three months of 2016. That’s followed by a new estimate for eurozone GDP at 10am. Then at 9.30am it’s the latest UK inflation data, which is likely to show another jump in the cost of living. Economists expect that inflation rose by around 1.9% in January, up from 1.6% in December. On the corporate front, engine maker Rolls-Royce is reporting results for the first time since it took a £671m fine to settle bribery claims. Then this afternoon, America’s top central banker Janet Yellen is testifying to Congress, from 3pm GMT. She can expect questions on the state of the US economy, president Trump’s fiscal plans, and the prospect of interest rate rises soon. Some on Wall Street reckon the Fed won’t manage its target of three hikes this year, so Yellen’s comments could move the dollar. RBC Capital Markets say: Given the uncertainty of timing on the fiscal agenda and the relatively modest uptick in inflation thus far this year, we think it will be difficult for the committee to get enough members onboard for a hike in March (not to mention that the French election in late April/early May looms large as a potential catalyst for global volatility). But Yellen could certainly move the “perception” needle on this. There may be drama in Greece; hundreds of farmers are expected to protest against the government’s austerity measure in Athens today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/sep/01/fukushima-radiation-levels-higher-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-01T09:22:57Z","webTitle":"Fukushima radiation levels 18 times higher than previously thought","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/01/fukushima-radiation-levels-higher-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/sep/01/fukushima-radiation-levels-higher-japan","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima radiation levels 18 times higher than previously thought","bodyText":"Radiation levels 18 times higher than previously reported have been found near a water storage tank at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, causing fresh concern about the safety of the wrecked facility. The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said radiation near the bottom of the tank measured 1,800 millisieverts an hour – high enough to kill an exposed person in four hours. Tepco said water levels inside the tank had not changed, indicating there had not been a leak. But the company said it had yet to discover the cause of the radiation spike. Last month Tepco said another storage tank – of the same design as the container causing concern at the weekend – had leaked 300 tonnes of radioactive water, possibly into the sea. Japan's nuclear watchdog confirmed last week it had raised the severity of that leak from level 1, an \"anomaly\", to level 3, a \"serious incident\", on an eight-point scale used by the International Atomic Energy Agency for radiological releases. Earlier, the utility belatedly confirmed reports that a toxic mixture of groundwater and water being used to cool melted fuel lying deep inside the damaged reactors was seeping into the sea at a rate of about 300 tonnes a day. Experts said those leaks, which are separate from the most recent incidents, may have started soon after the plant was struck by a powerful tsunami on 11 March 2011. The tsunami smashed into the plant after Japan's north-east coast was rocked by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake. The waves killed almost 19,000 people, while the resulting triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi forced 160,000 people to abandon their homes. The high radiation levels announced on Sunday highlighted the dangers facing thousands of workers as they attempt to contain, treat and store water safely, while preventing fuel assemblies damaged in the accident from going back into meltdown. Japan's nuclear workers are allowed an annual accumulative radiation exposure of 50 millisieverts. Tepco said radiation of 230 millisieverts an hour had been measured at another tank, up from 70 millisieverts last month. A third storage tank was emitting 70 millisieverts an hour, Tepco said. Radiation near a pipe connecting two other tanks had been measured at 230 millisieverts. Tepco admitted recently that only two workers had initially been assigned to check more than 1,000 storage tanks on the site. Neither of the workers carried dosimeters to measure their exposure to radiation, and some inspections had not been properly recorded. The firm responded to growing criticism of its handling of the water problem by increasing the number of workers patrolling the tanks from the current total of eight to 50. The firm's inability to safely store contaminated water and prevent more damage to the environment has prompted doubts about its ability to lead the Fukushima Daiichi cleanup. Decommissioning the plant is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars and last around 40 years. Tepco recently set up a committee to focus on the water leaks and said it would seek advice from foreign decommissioning experts. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has said the government will play a bigger role in preventing water contamination. The chairman of the country's Nuclear Regulation Authority, Shunichi Tanaka, said: \"We cannot fully stop contaminated water leaks right away. That's the reality. The water is still leaking in to the sea, and we should better assess its environmental impact.\" Tepco's handling of the leaks has drawn an angry response from local fishermen, who had to abandon plans to conduct a trial catch at the end of August. Fishermen south of Fukushima Daiichi have not been able to fish commercially since the disaster, while those north of the plant can catch only octopus and whelks. \"We think that contaminated water management by your company has completely fallen apart,\" Hiroshi Kishi, chairman of the Japan Fisheries Co-operative, told Tepco's president, Naomi Hirose, during a meeting in Tokyo last week. \"This has dealt an immeasurable blow to the future of Japan's fishing industry, and we are extremely concerned.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/sep/22/unions-pride-billy-elliott-brassed-off-capital-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-22T05:00:08Z","webTitle":"The battle between capital and labour is still raging on film | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/22/unions-pride-billy-elliott-brassed-off-capital-labour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/22/unions-pride-billy-elliott-brassed-off-capital-labour","fields":{"headline":"The battle between capital and labour is still raging on film","bodyText":"I’m trying to figure out why I loved Pride so much (the film, not the event). I don’t want to get too cultural studies about this – it’s mainly because it’s good. Yet I’m struck by the number of times I’ve sat sniffing in a multiplex over a film about the miners’ strike; the number of times we’ve revisited this clash in film; the magnificent performances, from Pete Postlethwaite’s lung-shot Danny in Brassed Off to Paddy Considine’s nearly-too-human Dai in Pride. This is no mere nostalgia trip – we don’t make films about CND (though, arguably, the world would be a safer place if we did). OK, there are some elements of coal mining that make it seem very much of its time. What makes it such rich territory creatively is that it isn’t a straightforward clash of good and evil in which evil persistently comes out on top. Imagine how miserable that would be, sitting through Margaret Thatcher’s triumph, again and again, with no wider message other than “Thatcher triumphed”. I’d rather see Sex and the City Two. Mining has this magnetic profundity (no, really), a tragic foreboding in the fault at its core: all heavy industry pitches identity, work and masculinity as a package, inseparable and insuperable. Lose one and you lose all three. That’s what gives these mass redundancies their emotional power, the fact that the jobs were more than just jobs; they were selves. But it’s also what gave unions such a giant problem dealing with contributions from lesbian and gay activists, and brass bands such qualms about letting in women. This opens up complication in the characters, ignites the possibility that perhaps some of them were nicer people than others, that maybe some were victim and bigot simultaneously, that sometimes the hardest thing in life is to figure out which bits of modernity are progress and which are deterioration. When I was growing up, we had a poster on the kitchen wall saying “support the miners”, another saying “nuclear power, no thanks!” and then something about how women were like mountains (old and strong, we went on and on. I’m not joking). We didn’t have anything about climate change because we didn’t call it that then, but certainly everybody knew about carbon emissions and anthropogenic global warming. The irony of campaigning to keep coal mines open, while at the same time rejecting nuclear power and worrying about carbon, went completely unremarked. And this does make the issue seem dated, passé even. I cannot imagine today being able to mention coal without anybody pointing out that it might be better to leave it where it is, jobs or no jobs. And yet, at the centre of it all is this key enmity that isn’t dated: the fight between capital and labour. It is back with a vengeance, this struggle. It was a foolishness to think it had ever gone away. The weekend began with a promise to raise the minimum wage to £8 an hour. It sounds like a positive move, until you read the small print and see that it’s “by 2020”. Party manifestos have more and more in common with car rental agreements – two sentences of promise, 2,000 words in tiny type telling you what to expect really. It is extraordinary to consider that we now need a political party to promise a pay rise, six years hence; that it has become so inevitable that, without legislation, pay stagnates. The demise of the unions has had terrible consequences for the bottom 25% of workers in this country. It has brought in “flexibility” that really means insecurity, worker surveillance (can you imagine what the National Union of Mineworkers would have said, had anyone suggested tagging employees to see how fast they worked?) and, most importantly, low wages. How this went unforeseen is baffling, given how head-smackingly obvious it is. Yet, Gordon Brown, in 2006, predicted that by 2020 there would only be 600,000 low-paid jobs in the country. Today, there are between 8m and 11m. This is what happens when unionisation has been written off as a pre-1980s irrelevance, a quirk, like life before avocados. It turns out governments can’t fight these battles for you, especially if they’re not trying to. There is an air of defeat from Westminster on poverty pay, a sense that this is simply the way things are in a global economy and we just have to shame the people living on low incomes into thinking that’s all they’re worth. In fact, there is no inevitability to it: it’s a straight split between profit and wages. From the end of the second world war until the start of the 80s, between 58% and 64% of productivity went to wages. Now it is down to half. Shareholders and chief executives are taking too much; stronger unions would put up more of a fight. It’s a story as old as a soup kitchen, as modern as a food bank. Consider the intelligence of art, compared with the dim-wittedness of politics. The reason Brassed Off stands up nearly two decades on, the reason Billy Elliott went global, the reason Pride feels so vivid now, is that all these films see the crushing of the union for what it was: not progress, not a welcome end to an outdated enmity, but the beginning of new phase in a war that is no more likely to end than man against nature, religion versus science. If drama is conflict, then the conflicts that arrest us, that we constantly return to, are the ones that matter. Politicians wrote off the battle between capital and labour, somehow believing that they had focus-grouped their way out of it. Film-makers knew it hadn’t gone anywhere. It is as elemental and timeless as a love story."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2015/jan/31/pakistan-india-share-venice-biennale-pavilion","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-31T02:30:08Z","webTitle":"Pakistan and India to share exhibit at Venice Biennale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jan/31/pakistan-india-share-venice-biennale-pavilion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2015/jan/31/pakistan-india-share-venice-biennale-pavilion","fields":{"headline":"Pakistan and India to share exhibit at Venice Biennale","bodyText":"Where the politicians and diplomats have failed, the artists hope to succeed. Pakistan and India are to be united at the Venice Biennale this year when a top contemporary artist from each nation will share an exhibit, in an unprecedented initiative aimed at bringing the two neighbours closer together. The show, entitled My East is Your West, has been funded by a Indian private philanthropic organisation. The respective governments, which have been exchanging intermittent artillery fire and verbal barbs for months, are not involved. “We just thought, let’s stop complaining about what others should be doing, let’s just do our best and say that from a common past and a divided present, we would like a peaceful future,” said Feroze Gujral, cofounder of the Gujral Foundation. The two participating artists are both stars of the burgeoning contemporary art scenes in their respective countries. Mumbai-based Shilpa Gupta has exhibited at the Tate Modern, the Serpentine Gallery and the Guggenheim. Rashid Rana, who lives and works in Lahore, is considered one of the most important current Pakistani artists. “This is something coming from the art world. We have just had [Barack] Obama in Delhi watching a huge parade of weapons and talking about nuclear power. So it’s wonderful to have this unofficial dream of peace,” Gupta said. India and Pakistan were divided in 1947 when Britain was forced to give up its south Asian empire. The two nuclear powers have fought three major wars since and have skirmished, militarily and diplomatically, continually. A nascent peace process has been frozen since 2008 after Pakistan-based militants attacked India’s commercial capital, Mumbai. At least 14 million people were displaced in the partition of the two countries 68 years ago as Muslims fled to Pakistan and Hindus and Sikhs headed to India. Up to a million were killed in mob violence. “Partition hasn’t really been addressed at all in either nation,” said Gupta, whose previous work has investigated ideas of nationhood and frontiers. Gujral said this shared history was one reason for her decision to organise the joint show in Venice. Her father-in-law, Satish Gujral, one of the most important Indian artists of recent decades, was born in Jhelum, in modern Pakistan, and fled to India in 1947, narrowly escaping death. “His losses were irreplaceable … so this is a very special project. There is never any healing but there can be a celebration, a cultural conversation, that can cross borders,” she said. India exhibited at the Venice Biennale for the first time four years ago. Pakistan last did in 1956. That artists and patrons should pick up where officials have failed is less surprising than it may seem to outsiders. Despite poverty, political instability and sometimes violence, artists from south Asia are beginning to make a global name for themselves, attracting interest from international buyers, curators and museum directors. This weekend tens of thousands of visitors are expected to attend the India Art Fair, now in its seventh year. The event has attracted artists and dealers from across the world, all keen to get a slice of the still booming Indian market. British and European artists have proved popular among India’s new wealthy art collectors, though bureaucratic restrictions mean some gallery owners prefer to bring works to show rather than sell. This year’s event, with 85 galleries, is more focused on local artists and those in smaller towns beyond India’s sprawling cities. One Pakistani gallery, from the southern port city of Karachi, has surmounted a series of logistical obstacles to show at the event. “It is special being here, there’s a lot of history obviously, though getting visas is tough,” said Camilla Chaudhary, of ArtChowk. Rashid Rana, who will share the Venice Biennale exhibit with Gupta, said the exhibition would be more about the south Asian region as a whole rather than just the complex relationship between India and Pakistan. “I am interested in messing with time and location … As artists we can defy these borders,” Rana said. The venture has been greeted with some scepticism. Kanwal Sibal, a former foreign secretary of India, said cultural initiatives could help “form a pool of public opinion “that could help improve relations between states, but little more”. He said: “It has some value, but in terms of true impact on policy it is less than marginal.” • This headline of this article was changed on 31 January 2015.

The disaster, caused when the tsunami that followed the devastating earthquake in 2011 knocked out backup generators pumping water to cool the fuel rods, has cost more than $200bn (£128bn) and is now expected to cost billions more. The human cost, so slow is the impact of radiation, won't be measurable for a generation. It has profoundly shaken confidence in the future of nuclear power, from Taiwan – where earlier this month MPs resorted to fisticuffs as they debated a referendum on a new nuclear power station – to Berlin, and it's changing the landscape of new nuclear here in Britain. Until Fukushima, the risk of catastrophic meltdown of the sort that occurred first at Chernobyl was supposed to be one in 100,000. But Fukushima occurred almost exactly 25 years after Chernobyl and that slashes the estimate to one in 5,000. In addition, the kind of cascade of devastating events that hit Fukushima hadn't previously been factored into risk probability assessments. Now regulatory authorities all over the world have been forced to consider whether, however unlikely, more than one accident could happen in quick succession, and what the consequences would be. The whole risk and safety assessment framework is being redesigned. Britain and France are almost the only countries in Europe still determined to expand nuclear (and France is reducing dependence) rather than focus on holding down demand for electricity, but costs are soaring. Earlier this year, Centrica pulled out of a deal with the French-owned EDF, blaming in part redesigns forced by Fukushima. The coalition, which had promised no new subsidies to nuclear power in 2010, is now offering £10bn of financial guarantees to make sure the extra capacity comes on stream, and may offer a hidden subsidy in guaranteed electricity prices. Meanwhile, subsidy-hating George Osborne will be watching the fate of Angela Merkel in next month's federal elections. Only days after Fukushima, the German chancellor reversed her long-held support for nuclear power and, a year after announcing a 10-year extension, she promised to phase it out by 2022. Two years on, the huge expansion of windpower she promised is behind schedule and electricity bills have risen by 20% to pay for the changeover. German industry is feeling the pain too. Voters will judge between the huge costs and potential risks of nuclear, and the still-developing potential of green energy. In 2015, British voters won't have that choice. • This article was amended on 22 August 2013 because the original said Tepco admitted that 3,000 tonnes of highly toxic water had leaked from purpose-built storage tanks.

Parties diverge on how to save the planet","bodyText":"As the row over the green levies added to energy bills was building towards its climax a couple of years ago – with David Cameron reportedly ordering aides to “get rid of all the green crap” to lower prices – social scientist Nick Pidgeon was touring the UK. From Merthyr Tydfil to Glasgow and from London to Cumbria, Pidgeon’s workshops with members of the public wrestled with solving the triple challenge of keeping the lights on, energy bills affordable and global warming under control. To Pidgeon’s surprise, people attending the workshops overwhelmingly backed a transformation based on renewable energy, energy efficiency and cutting fossil fuel use. “They said why on earth are we not doing this already?” said Pidgeon, a professor of environmental psychology at Cardiff University, who also tested nationwide opinions via polling. “When the complex problems were explained, people had a vision of the future that was clearly more ambitious than any of the political parties. They believed that fossil fuels were old-fashioned and finite and had all these other [pollution and security] problems associated with them. They felt there is no future for their kids if we are stuck with fossil fuels.” The 2013 “green crap” row, which resulted in £50 being knocked off bills, commanded the political spotlight for a while, having been electrified by Ed Miliband’s popular pledge to freeze energy bills. But it was a “phoney war”, according to Matthew Spencer, director of the influential Green Alliance thinktank, as the levies set to be added to future bills to drive the green transformation remain firmly on an upward curve and are expected to more than double to £187 a year by 2020 (though the overall bill may fall if energy efficiency measures bite). “Whoever wins the election, the costs of the low-carbon transition will rise sharply over the parliament and this will need to be carefully managed if that programme is to succeed,” said Jimmy Aldridge, at the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank. The impact of the government’s choice will stretch even further than 2020, according to Pidgeon: “Energy is the biggest infrastructure challenge we face. Decisions taken in the next parliament will affect people for the next 50 years.” In Germany’s 2013 general election, those decisions were second only to the eurozone crisis as an issue. In the UK, the environment lags behind the perennial big hitters of the NHS, economy and immigration in issue tracking polls by Ipsos Mori and YouGov. However, it ranks alongside tax, the EU and crime and, although the three main parties have jointly pledged to tackle climate change to protect the UK’s national and economic security, the party manifestos have less in common in 2015 than in 2010. The starkest change has been in the Conservative position. In 2006, the high point of environmental concerns in recent decades, Cameron went to the Arctic and hugged a husky. The “vote blue, go green” message was a key part of the Tory brand decontamination strategy and featured prominently in the 2010 manifesto. But within 18 months of the election, the green drive was dead, with George Osborne saying: “We’re not going to save the planet by putting our country out of business.” The energy minister, Greg Barker, was forced to argue at the time that the party was acting green, if no longer talking green: “We are all trousers and no mouth.” But by their final party conference, Tory ministers had nothing new to say about the environment or energy at all. The 2015 manifesto has only one significant new energy policy: a ban on new subsidies for onshore wind farms and a veto for local communities. This was immediately dismissed as “bad news for British billpayers” by former “big six” energy boss Ian Marchant, as more expensive green energy would be needed instead to meet the UK’s legal carbon reduction targets. “I suspect [the wind farm policy] is targeted at local constituencies where there is a particular local issue,” said Anthony Wells at YouGov, as the overwhelming majority of the UK public supports wind farms. Tom Burke, a former special adviser to three Tory environment secretaries and head of Friends of the Earth, said of the “ridiculous” anti-wind farm policy: “It may be tactical, but you want your prime minister to be delivering a safe climate for 60 million Britons, not giving a sop to 20 marginal constituencies.” Burke also accused the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, of “abuse of power”, having pulled in and rejected dozens of local wind farm planning applications. The Lib Dems, while once again placing the environment on their manifesto front page, have undergone a full U-turn on nuclear power. The energy secretary, Ed Davey, who once said that “in addition to posing safety and environmental risks, nuclear power will only be possible with vast taxpayer subsidies or a rigged market”, now backs nuclear as needed to tackle climate change. Pidgeon said this attitude of “reluctant acceptance” prevails among much of the public. The Lib Dems ran energy and climate change policy in the last parliament – though Osborne frequently intervened – and now point to a tripling of renewable energy. But, having started from a very low base, the UK still ranks near the bottom of the 28 EU nations, with only Luxembourg and Malta producing less green energy in the latest statistics. Similarly, millions of homes benefited from energy efficiency improvements in the last parliament, but the UK still has some of the highest energy bills and rates of fuel poverty among comparable EU states. Lib Dem efforts to use regulations to improve the UK’s cold and leaky homes were repeatedly blocked or weakened by the Conservatives, even when successfully piloted by Tory councils. Labour argues that coalition rows have undermined the huge investment needed to transform the energy system: Davey once had to take legal advice about the contradictory anti-wind farm statements of his then junior minister John Hayes, a Tory. The Labour manifesto is therefore heavy on energy promises, including 5m home retrofits to increase efficiency and making electricity virtually zero-carbon by 2030. On fracking, one the most high-profile green issues, only the Green party is opposed among the parties standing across the UK. But the fact that 161 Labour and 149 Lib Dem parliamentary candidates openly oppose their parties’ support indicates that the shale gas row is far from over, as does the fracking moratorium imposed in Scotland by the SNP. Robert Ede, an energy and environment expert at the Whitehouse Consultancy, thinks fracking could be put on hold by a Labour party seeking to form government with SNP and Green help. “A moratorium on shale would seem a likely concession,” he said. Also offering a distinctive manifesto is Ukip, which dismisses the notion of man-made climate change and wants to “rejuvenate the coal industry”. However, fewer than 10% of the UK public thinks global warming is not happening or is entirely natural. Yet, even the relatively low level of climate scepticism in the UK is higher than in most of the world and higher than a decade ago. The decline of environmental concern from its husky heyday may be reversing, according to Pidgeon. He pointed to the only event in the past five years to send the environment soaring up the issue tracker polls: the widespread floods of early 2014, which followed the wettest winter for 250 years. In YouGov’s fortnightly poll, the sight of large parts of England under water pushed the environment up from 9% to 23%. “There are times when issues like environment can shoot up the agenda,” said Wells. “There is potential there, but no politician has really made use of that.” The following YouGov poll saw the environment fall to 13%. Labour criticised the coalition for cutting spending on flood defences and climate change adaptation but has not committed to spend more in these areas. In the countryside, party differences are clear. Labour has committed to ending the badger cull, a top-five issue in constituents’ complaints to their MPs. The Conservatives promise a free vote to end the ban on hunting with dogs. The Tory manifesto’s other pledges on protecting the natural world, including large reserves to protect the seas, gained praise from Spencer: “It could be a way to redeem themselves as conservationists. It could be the start of the Conservative party rediscovering its mojo on the natural environment.” Spencer said the environment was important to voters, even if it was in the second rank of issues in tracking polls. “What you get from opinion polls is what is urgent, not what is important,” he said. “People are sophisticated: they expect governments to be responsible. They expect politics to be thinking and planning for the country’s long-term security as they do with defence, which like environment doesn’t come up as an urgent concern in polls.” Matthew Evans at Ipsos Mori agreed: “When we ask specifically about environment, there are high levels of concern and it has risen again recently.” “There is nothing wrong with the British people on the environment – they just haven’t had much of a political offer to buy,” said Burke. “But it’s not an issue that shifts votes – yet.” The parties’ policies on the environment Conservatives The Tories claim to have led the greenest government ever and promise to push for global agreement on tackling climate change. However, many Conservative MPs have long been opposed to the sight of wind turbines in their constituencies, so it is little surprise to see a cap on onshore wind farms to prevent their spread. The party has also promised a large expansion of marine reserve areas around UK foreign territories. For its rural heartland there is a free vote promised on whether to reinstate hunting with dogs, while on transport the party has promised the biggest investment in rail since Victorian times and for “almost every” car and van to be a zero-emission vehicle by 2050. Ian Marchant, chairman of Infinis Energy, on behalf of the British Wind industry association, criticised the planned cap on onshore wind farms, saying they were the cheapest large-scale renewable energy generation source in the UK,. He added: “This would artificially protect more expensive technologies and the big six energy companies from much-needed competition.” Greens As expected, climate change is at the centre of all Green policies, with proposals for a rapid transition to a zero-carbon, sustainable economy. The party has pledged an outright ban on fracking and a phasing out of coal-power stations. When it comes to public transport, the Greens want to renationalise the railways and cut fares by 10%. Unsurprisingly, Friends of the Earth is full of praise for the manifesto, saying it “stands out from the others as a plan not just to do the right things on the environment but to stop doing the wrong things as well. It commits to end the age of fossil fuels in the way necessary for our generation to avert runaway climate change.” Labour Labour has pledged to double the number of green jobs by 2025, supported by what it says are ambitious carbon reduction targets, including the decarbonisation of the UK’s energy supply by 2030. The party is also promising a robust regulatory regime for shale and more certainty on tax rates for offshore oil and gas. It plans an energy security board to deliver an energy mix including renewables, nuclear, green gas, carbon capture and storage, and clean coal. One of Ed Miliband’s best-known policies is the freeze on energy bills until 2017. In response, Matthew Farrow, executive director of the Environmental Industries Commission, said: “It is heartening that Labour recognise the potential of the green economy and the importance of using government policy to create a stable investment framework. The strategy needs to cover the full range of environmental business, including for example air pollution control and contaminated land remediation, and should include joint work with the green business sector to identify and access the enormous export opportunities.” Lib Dems The Liberal Democrats say they want to build on their environmental record in government and promise to have green commitments on the table from the first day of the next parliament. The party’s proposals include net greenhouse gas emissions to be zero by 2050 and no unabated coal power generation after 2025, with 250,000 new green jobs by 2020. It has also promised to cut council tax for green homes by at least £100 a year for 10 years. The proposals on energy and nature protection were welcomed by Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, who said they “would be a huge win for the environment”. However, he added: “Now we need to know where the red lines are in any negotiations with potential coalition partners and how high up the priority list environmental improvement is for the Lib Dems.” SNP The Scottish National party wants the UK government to adopt Scotland’s carbon reduction targets and has pledged to maintain its support for a moratorium on fracking. The party also wants to maximise support for offshore wind and to support community energy generation, as well as backing community heating schemes. Its manifesto’s pledges to Scotland’s rural communities include the promise to improve transport links across the north, along with a cut in fuel tax of 10p a gallon. Ukip Central to Ukip’s manifesto is the pledge for the UK to leave the EU, dropping many of its environmental regulations, including emissions trading. It also plans to repeal the 2008 Climate Change Act, which sets legally binding carbon budgets, and to promote fracking and rejuvenate the coal industry. On transport, Nigel Farage’s main pledge is to scrap HS2. For the fishing industry, Ukip wants to reform regulations to enforce “no take” zones and end “destructive industrial fishing practices”. Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green party, called the party’s environmental policies “an insult to the many people across the globe already suffering the effects of climate change”. She added: “Their environmental policies, just like their attitudes to immigration, are nothing short of dangerous.” Fiona Harvey"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2015/jan/29/evolution-gm-food-climate-change-us-survey","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-29T19:00:09Z","webTitle":"Many Americans reject evolution, deny climate change and find GM food unsafe, survey finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/29/evolution-gm-food-climate-change-us-survey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2015/jan/29/evolution-gm-food-climate-change-us-survey","fields":{"headline":"Many Americans reject evolution, deny climate change and find GM food unsafe, survey finds","bodyText":"A major survey of US opinions has revealed that huge numbers of people reject Darwinian evolution, consider GM foods unsafe to eat, and doubt that human activity is warming the planet. The report by the Pew Research Center in Washington DC was conducted with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and sought to compare the opinions of a cross-section of the US public with those held by the AAAS’s scientific members. Published in the journal Science, the survey found that 31% of the US public believed that humans had existed in their present form since the beginning, with a further 24% stating that humans had evolved under the guiding hand of a supreme being. In contrast, only 2% of AAAS scientists said humans had not evolved in their time on Earth. The proportion of the public who believed evolution had happened through natural processes, as described by Charles Darwin more than 150 years ago, was only slightly greater than a third at 35%. The survey drew on phone interviews with 2,002 US adults chosen to be representative of the nation, and online questions of 3,748 US-based members of the AAAS. The US has embraced genetically modifed crops, with 69m hectares (170.4m acres) given over to their cultivation, but the survey suggests the technology is still regarded as contentious by a significant portion of US society. A striking 57% of the public surveyed by Pew believed that GM foods were unsafe to eat. The overwhelming view of the scientists, was that the food was safe, with 88% having no concerns about eating GM. Perhaps the most contentious issue the survey touched on was climate change, where only half of the population agreed with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change view that climate change was mostly driven by human activity, such as the burning of fossil fuels. Nearly half said there was either no good evidence for global warming, or that the recent warming of the Earth was due to natural climate variability. Scientists and the broader public disagreed most strongly about the safety of GM foods, though their views differed substantially on global warming too, with 87% of scientists believing that climate change was mostly caused by human activity. Alan Leshner, the chief executive of the AAAS, said the survey revealed a worrying gulf between the opinions held by scientists and the general public. “There is a disconnect between the way in which the public perceives the state of science and science’s position on a variety of issues,” he said. “And that’s a cause of concern.” Cary Funk, lead author of the report, said the number of issues that scientists and the public disagreed on, and the amount to which they disagreed, were both surprising. One of the few issues the two groups did agreed on was that the International Space Station had been a good investment for the country. There were some other areas where scientists and the public shared concerns. Both delivered damning verdicts on US science education, the K-12 primary and secondary school system. Among the general public, 68% considered US science education average or below average, and an overwhelming proportion of scientists, 84%, agreed with them. In some cases, a poor science education was at the heart of the differences in opinion, Leshner said. “Sometimes it’s simply a lack of understanding, sometimes it’s an economic or a politicial issue, and sometimes it’s a conflict between, say, core religious belief, or core values, and what science is showing,” he said. “In all of these cases, science is being trumped by these other factors and scientists need to do something to turn that around.” “It’s not about whether the public is dumb or not. It’s partly a function of the American educational system that does a terrible job ... at educating young people in science, math and technology,” he added. Perhaps reflecting a common scepticism over climate change, the survey found greater support among the public for fracking and offshore drilling than among the scientists. Enthusiasm for building more nuclear power plants was far higher among the scientists than the public, with 65% versus 45% in favour. In an accompanying editorial, Leshner issued a call to arms, urging scientists to strike up “respectful dialogues” with groups in community clubs, science museums and religious institutions. “The opinion gap must not be allowed to swell into an unbridgeable chasm,” he warned. “We need to have what scence is showing be represented accurately and for people to at least have that in their toolbox when they make their own decisions,” Leshner said. “It works against the benefit of humankind for people to have distorted views of what the actual facts are.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/sep/16/japan-nuclear-shutdown-raises-energy-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-15T23:03:00Z","webTitle":"Japan turns off last nuclear reactor amid fears of surge in gas prices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/16/japan-nuclear-shutdown-raises-energy-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/sep/16/japan-nuclear-shutdown-raises-energy-prices","fields":{"headline":"Japan turns off last nuclear reactor amid fears of surge in gas prices","bodyText":"Japan will switch off its last nuclear reactor on Monday, amid fears that a growing dependence on gas imports there could push up electricity bills in the UK. Kansai Electric Power's only functioning reactor was scheduled to be disconnected from the power grid and then shut for planned maintenance, ending hopes that an industry that until three years ago provided 30% of the electricity to power the world's third largest economy would stage a quick recovery. Continuing problems at the Fukushima plant, where radioactive water has continued to spill into the sea, and a reluctance by voters to back what looks like a badly managed industry, have led to more than 50 nuclear plants being closed, sending Japanese imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) back to levels last seen after the 2011 tsunami. Energy analysts said that Japan's shutdown, combined with Germany's commitment to end nuclear power production by 2022, was pushing up gas prices on the international markets. Rising demand for gas combined with the cost of subsidies for renewable energy, much of which is added to household and business bills, is expected to push up energy prices in the west. According to the CBI, there is a growing unease among UK businesses that energy costs look likely to rise. A survey and report published by the business lobby group the CBI found that around 95% of British business leaders are worried about the cost of energy and that more than three-quarters of them have little faith that matters will improve in the next five years. The pessimistic view about government policy – and inaction – may be related to the way in which energy has overtaken transport as the chief area of concern among the 526 executives polled by the CBI and the business services firm KPMG. \"The huge number of businesses concerned about energy supply and costs is alarming,\" said John Cridland, the CBI's director general. \"The government must get the energy bill on to the statute books and bring forward secondary legislation to give potential investors the certainty to deliver the energy infrastructure we need to keep our lights on.\" German businesses have complained that they pay the highest energy bills in the EU following the pioneering decision to subsidise renewable production. Much of the subsidy cost is passed on through higher bills, forcing major manufacturers BMW, Mercedes and Siemens to pay double the cost of electricity in the US. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has promised to cut subsidies to solar and wind farm operators, but has yet to specify the size of the cut or the timescale. It is also unclear what will replace the more environmentally friendly forms of electricity if operators are discouraged from further investments by lower subsidies. At the moment Germany and the UK have dramatically increased their consumption of coal and gas to make up the shortfall from nuclear production. At their conference in Glasgow, the Liberal Democrats said the prospect of rising gas prices meant it was necessary for the UK to back further investment in nuclear power. The UK's trade deficit widened in 2003 when the country became a net importer of oil and gas, and the situation is projected to deteriorate as production falls over the next 10 years. Japan, which ran huge trade surpluses until the Fukishima disaster, has seen its balance of payments thrown into reverse by the costs of purchasing LNG. Japan consumes about a third of the world's LNG and it is likely that demand will grow to record levels over the next couple of years. LNG imports rose 4.4% to a record 86m tonnes, and 14.9% in value to a record 6.21tn yen (£39bn) in the year to March. Imports are likely to rise to around 88m tonnes this year and around 90m tonnes in the year to March 2015, according to projections by the Institute of Energy Economics Japan, based on 16 reactors being back online by March 2015. Thirty months on from the Fukushima disaster, such is the level of public concern about nuclear safety that the government is struggling to come up with a long-term energy policy – a delay that is having a profound impact on the economy and underlining just how costly a nuclear-power-free future may be. \"There's talk the Abe administration is putting heavy pressure on the regulator [to restart reactors],\" said Osamu Fujisawa, a Japanese-based independent oil economist. \"It's obviously the economy the administration is [concerned about] [rather than safety]. Otherwise, the business community will look away, [which would be] an end to the Abe administration.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2012/sep/28/nuclear-power-betamax-energy-world","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-28T10:41:28Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power is the Betamax of the energy world | Natalie Bennett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/sep/28/nuclear-power-betamax-energy-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2012/sep/28/nuclear-power-betamax-energy-world","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power is the Betamax of the energy world","bodyText":"In my first month as the new Green party leader, I've spent lots of time talking about pressing economic and social issues - the need for the minimum wage to be a living wage, how benefits should be available to all who need them, and how costly and destructive the privatisation of the NHS will be. But with the government's energy bill on the horizon, serious questions around the coalition's wobbly-looking commitment not to subsidise new nuclear, and an anti-nuclear protest at Hinkley Point on 8 October, I've also spent lots of my time explaining why I think renewable energy - wind, solar and, in the future, tide and wave - combined with energy conservation, provide an excellent way forward for British energy. I talk about the fact that the first two are technologies that are ready to scale up right now, providing jobs and affordable supplies for Britain. And about the fact that we know exactly what all of their \"fuel\" supplies will cost indefinitely into the future - ie nothing. I talk about the way they can provide a decentralised, resilient energy system that is able to withstand climate or other shocks. And I discuss how nuclear is a distraction from the need to promote and invest in renewables. Fuelled by a fierce and well-funded industry lobby claiming that nuclear would address the dire, if exaggerated, warnings about \"the lights going out\", as well as the urgent need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, the nuclear idea has gained some traction recently in the UK. So I think it is worth spending a little time talking about why nuclear power is the Betamax of the energy world - a technology that was briefly in the hunt, but now could be ready to fade away into a museum curiosity. And you don't have to just believe me on this - consider this recent front page from the Economist. First, it is immensely and unpredictably expensive. Even a group called Supporters of Nuclear Energy is now questioning the cost of nuclear to the UK. Paying £165/MWh for power from Hinkley Point would make new nuclear more costly than either onshore or offshore wind - a cost that would be felt in the pockets of millions of already hard-stretched British households. The two European Pressurised Reactors, as proposed for Britain, now being built in Finland and France, are both already running four years behind their construction schedule, and at roughly double the original budget. The French National Audit Office recently recommended that the programme - the very one Britain is looking like signing up for - be abandoned. Second, it is slow to build - very, very slow. The four new nuclear reactors built by EDF since 1990 have taken on average 14 years to completion and 17.5 years to come online. That's not nearly quick enough to meet Britain's needs, either for power or for emissions reduction. Third, it is by its nature monopolistic. Enormously expensive and, technologically, immensely complicated, no community would be able to decide to install one even if they wanted to. Local communities aren't going to be able to install one to boost local education spending in the same way that a Scottish Green party councillor is suggesting with wind turbines in Aberdeenshire. Fourth, it isn't renewable. Arguments are many and varied about the supplies of nuclear fuels and how long they might last, but whatever figures you accept, the fact is we're talking about a quite limited supply. But the wind and the sun are never going to run out - at least not in a time frame we have to worry about. Fifth, it is unreliable. If a handful of plants are responsible for a large percentage of Britain's power, sudden shutdowns could have hugely disruptive effects - as sweating Japanese salarymen in their suddenly non-airconditioned offices found after the Fukushima disaster. A power system reliant on nuclear can never be a reliable, resilient system. Then there is safety. There is, as we saw at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima, the potential for enormous catastrophe. Again, you'll find lots of arguments about just how many people died or were badly affected as a result of these catastrophes. But those who like to claim figures of near zero fail to mention the loss of homes and land, tens of thousands of people displaced, and agricultural land lost to use for centuries from the small land mass of Japan (an island nation pretty similar in scale to Britain). But it is difficult to weigh the risks of rare yet highly catastrophic events, such as a full nuclear meltdown. The good news is that we don't have to - it doesn't even have to be part of the argument against nuclear power. The costs, the unreliability, and the slowness of nuclear power alone mean that it can't be the answer to Britain's energy needs. If there weren't already a solution at hand, we'd have to be frantically hunting around for one. But the fact is that there is - renewables, combined with a serious drive for energy conservation, which would also have the added benefits of making our homes more comfortable and our air more breathable. And put money into the pockets of local communities, not export it to a multinational energy giant. We need to stop getting distracted by this 20th-century Betamax option, and get on with putting in place the 21st-century renewables solution."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/mar/11/russian-nuclear-firm-build-power-station-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-11T20:33:27Z","webTitle":"Russian state nuclear firm in talks to build power station in the UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/11/russian-nuclear-firm-build-power-station-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/mar/11/russian-nuclear-firm-build-power-station-uk","fields":{"headline":"Russian state nuclear firm in talks to build power station in the UK","bodyText":"Britain is in talks with the Russian state nuclear company about building a nuclear power station in the UK, an official said on Tuesday. Hergen Haye, head of new nuclear development at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), told students at Edinburgh University that active discussions were taking place in London after a memorandum of understanding had been signed with Russia. \"I can tell you that, behind closed doors and with microphones switched off, there are interesting debates happening in Whitehall,\" he said. \"Russia wants to build a nuclear power station in the UK.\" Haye chairs a UK-Russian working group on nuclear power, and was in Russia recently for discussions. Haye regards the Russian VVER reactor proposed for the UK as \"perfectly safe\", but he cautioned that there would be problems convincing the public that a deal with Russia was acceptable, especially given the current crisis in the Crimea. \"It's a long road, a very long road,\" he said. He offered his personal view that a Russian nuclear station in the UK may be \"a bridge too far – at least for the next ten years.\" But he stressed that it wasn't his decision to make. A memorandum of understanding between DECC and the Russian state nuclear corporation, Rosatom, was signed in September 2013. It agreed a programme of co-operation \"designed to be the most effective means of enabling Rosatom to prepare for entry into the United Kingdom civil nuclear market.\" The plan was to give Rosatom access to the UK government's watchdogs, the Office for Nuclear Regulation and the Environment Agency, so that it could understand British regulatory and licencing requirements. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills \"will have detailed discussions with Rosatom to facilitate commercial links with United Kingdom's industry,\" the memorandum said. Rosatom has already formed a partnership with the British nuclear engineering company, Rolls Royce. \"The participants hope that this relationship will lead to joint projects in the United Kingdom and overseas,\" said the memorandum. Russia is also reported to have signed a deal with the Finnish power company, Fortum. It operates two Russian VVER reactors near Loviisa in Finland. In his lecture, Haye highlighted the difficulties of getting private companies to invest in something as commercially risky as nuclear power. He defended the £89.50 per megawatt hour \"strike price\" for electricity agreed with the French state nuclear company, EDF, for 35 years. This was essential to secure investment in the construction of a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, he argued. The UK is also seeking Chinese investment in the nuclear station, and has signed a memorandum of understanding with China. According to Haye, securing money from the Chinese was one of the remaining barriers to actually starting work on the Hinkley station. Another was winning agreement from the European Commission that the strike price deal didn't breach state aid rules. The commission has announced that it is investigating the funding arrangements for Hinkley. Hay said he was about to embark upon a tour of European capitals to try and win backing for the UK's position. If Chinese funding was secured and the European Commission gave the go-ahead, the earliest work could start at Hinkley was next year, Haye said. Then it could start generating power by 2023. A DECC spokesperson said: \"Last year Russia and the UK committed to working towards greater co-operation in the field of civil nuclear. It is to be expected that government staff will have discussions about how that might develop. Any new nuclear plants will need to meet stringent UK regulations enforced by independent regulators.\" \"The UK actively welcomes inward investment to our energy sector, but any energy company, nuclear or otherwise, that had an interest would need to meet all independent regulatory standards required in the UK and EU.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/feb/26/climate-change-serious-threat-david-cameron-prime-ministers-questions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-02-26T13:45:00Z","webTitle":"Climate change one of the most serious threats we face, says David Cameron","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/26/climate-change-serious-threat-david-cameron-prime-ministers-questions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/feb/26/climate-change-serious-threat-david-cameron-prime-ministers-questions","fields":{"headline":"Climate change one of the most serious threats we face, says David Cameron","bodyText":"David Cameron has issued his strongest declaration that climate change is man-made when he said it was one of the most serious threats facing Britain and the rest of the world. The prime minister, who appeared to be wary in recent weeks of drawing a direct link between the effects of industrialisation and climate change, issued his unequivocal statement after Ed Miliband suggested he was unwilling to take tough action. Cameron replied: \"I believe man-made climate change is one of the most serious threats that this country and this world faces. That is why we have the world's first green investment bank here in Britain. \"That is why, unlike 13 wasted years of Labour, we are building the first nuclear power station for 30 years in our country. That is why we have cut carbon emissions emitted by the government by 14% since we came to office. \"That is why we have set out, year after year, carbon budgets in this country. They talk a good game about it but it actually takes people to come in, govern effectively and deal with it.\" Cameron's remarks were immediately welcomed by green Tories, some of whom had feared the government was losing interest in combating climate change. Greg Barker, the climate change minister, tweeted Cameron's remarks and added: \"Great to hear PM lauding the coalition's real achievements on climate change at #PMQs #RealGreenDelivery.\" Recently, the prime minister privately reassured green Tories he was still committed to tackling climate change after being quoted by a minister as saying he wanted to get rid of the \"green crap\" on energy bills. But he said the government had to act cautiously as Britain recovers from the downturn. George Osborne, who was criticised by green Tories in 2011 when he said Britain should not cut its carbon emissions at a faster rate than its EU partners, prepared the ground for the PM's remarks when he said last week he accepted climate change was man-made. But the chancellor told business leaders in Hong Kong it should be tackled in \"as cheap a possible way\". Miliband said the PM's remarks were \"excellent\" but named a number of ministers who had questioned the need to tackle environmental change. The Labour leader quoted the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, as saying: \"People get very emotional about this. People should just accept the climate's been changing for centuries.\" Miliband quoted the energy minister Michael Fallon answering a question about climate change: \"You are not going to draw me on that. I haven't had time to get into the climate change debate.\" The Labour leader asked Cameron: \"Is he happy to have climate change deniers in his government?\" Cameron said: \"The most serious form of denial we have today in Britain's politics is the reality deniers of the party opposite. What is their plan for their deficit? Nothing. What is their plan for welfare reform? Nothing. \"What is their plan for long-term investment because that is what climate change requires? Long-term investment like high-speed rail, long-term investment like nuclear power, long-term investment like fixing our economy. That is what this government is doing. All he does is get up and deliver a lot of hot air.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2015/jun/23/is-science-policy-a-theological-matter","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T10:34:50Z","webTitle":"Is science policy a theological matter?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2015/jun/23/is-science-policy-a-theological-matter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2015/jun/23/is-science-policy-a-theological-matter","fields":{"headline":"Is science policy a theological matter?","bodyText":"The Encyclical Letter Laudato Si’ released by Pope Francis last week has generated a wide range of reactions ranging from enthusiastic praise to uneasy criticism. For some, the Pope’s key message was about climate change, for others about the downsides of economic growth, and some saw in it a reconciliation of science and religion. But the Encyclical also lays bare a debate much larger than each of these perspectives, one that is fundamentally about what kind of world we want to inhabit. The Pope’s message is just the latest intervention in a debate over technologies that has been going on for centuries. Pope Francis writes of the “human roots of the ecological crisis” defined in terms of deference to a “technocratic paradigm” which contains “the deepest roots of our present failures, which have to do with the direction, goals, meaning and social implications of technological and economic growth.” The Pope’s choice of language is evocative of historian Lynn White, Jr.’s classic essay, “The Historic Roots of our Ecologic Crisis,” written almost 50 years ago in Science. White argued that technological innovation was a “realization of the Christian dogma of man’s transcendence of, and rightful mastery over, nature.” A consequence of this mastery, White suggested, is to “give mankind powers which, to judge by many of the ecologic effects, are out of control. If so, Christianity bears a huge burden of guilt.” White’s proposed alternative to the dominant Christian narrative anticipated the Pope’s Encyclical: “we should ponder the greatest radical in Christian history since Christ: Saint Francis of Assisi” (from whom the Pope took his name). White continued: “the present increasing disruption of the global environment is the product of a dynamic technology and science which were originating in the Western medieval world against which Saint Francis was rebelling in so original a way. Their growth cannot be understood historically apart from distinctive attitudes toward nature which are deeply grounded in Christian dogma.” What Lynn White was pointing to in the 1960s and Pope Francis writes of today can be viewed as a struggle over the meaning of humanity on planet Earth. What is our role? Do we dominate nature? Or are we of nature, even subservient to it? What kind of world do we want? What should we together value? These are not questions that can be answered with science or technology. They are ultimately religious. But our answers to these questions shape how we view the roles of science and technology in society. For many scientists, especially those who outwardly eschew religion, to learn that their battles over technological adoption or restriction are fundamentally religious may come as a bit of a surprise. But as White explained , “The fact that most people do not think of these attitudes as Christian is irrelevant.” For instance, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the scientist who helped Pope Francis prepare the Encyclical Letter, wrote in an accompanying essay in explicitly Biblical terms, warning of “having eaten from the fruit of fossil fuel burning.” Schellnhuber’s association of the Fall of Man from the Garden of Eden with technological innovation is exactly the sort of counter-narrative to conventional Christianity’s tale of human dominion over nature that White and Francis (both the Saint and the Pope) have proposed. It is also compatible with a dominant strand of contemporary Western environmentalism that has scientists in roles that Church leaders used to play. But for many, embracing an overt religious framing for existential debates over technology can quickly become problematic, or at least deeply inconsistent. Consider technologies of family planning. Consistent with Catholic history, Pope Francis largely dismisses concern about global population as a contributor to environmental problems, “To blame population growth instead of extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some, is one way of refusing to face the issues.” Yet, in an earlier Encyclical Letter from the Church (Humanae Vitae 1968) Pope Paul VI appealed to scientists to help develop technologies consistent with Church doctrine to allow for a “sufficiently secure basis for the chaste limitation of offspring.” Pope Paul VI, clearly not a Franciscan, applauded “man’s stupendous progress in the domination and rational organization of the forces of nature,” and looked to science and technology to help reconcile religious values with global problems. But like Francis today, Paul also asked for moral and spiritual change among people. Despite this admonition, across broader society among Catholics and non-Catholics alike, birth control technologies have not come to be viewed as a forbidden fruit, but as a technology of empowerment, especially for women. Scientists offered little support for developing methods of birth control compatible with Church strictures. Today, I suspect that many of those who are celebrating Pope Francis criticisms of science and technology are just as likely quick to dismiss the church’s views on reproductive technologies. Our views on whether certain technologies are good or bad are a reflection of what kind of world we collectively want. Nuclear power? GMOs? Birth control pills? Fracking? Human germline editing? Solar thermal stations? Vaccinations? Coal power? Good luck finding someone, anyone, with a consistently pro- or anti- technology position across just this small set of innovations. People around the world show a remarkable degree of inconsistency when applying religious principles to technological innovation. Of course, one person’s inconsistency is another’s pragmatism, and the pragmatic way to settle conflicts in through the difficult and frustrating process of politics. The lesson of birth control technologies since Pope Paul VI issued his 1968 Encyclical offers a cautionary tale for those who think that Franciscan Catholicism will somehow result in fundamental change in our contemporary environmental debates. Pope Francis asks that we “replace consumption with sacrifice, greed with generosity, wastefulness with a spirit of sharing.” He asks for “asceticism.” He warns that “The earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth.” On the one hand, one does not have to look far to find Earth looking like an immense pile of filth. For example, several weeks ago the city of Accra in Ghana experienced massive flooding, killing more than 150 people, many in a massive petrol fire. The flooding was a consequence of storm drains clogged with trash, the detritus of growing wealth. But on the other hand, Ghanaians do not appear to be looking toward any sort of “asceticism” as a response. Rather the President has said that the nation is “looking to set up silt traps in Ghana’s rivers, dredge sewers, relocate neighborhoods occupying floodplains and replace storm drains” – in others words, to technologies to address the problems caused by technology. More broadly, Ghana is going full speed ahead with a program of economic growth, much of it focused on exploiting fossil fuels, viewed not as a forbidden fruit but as a technology of empowerment, just as women have viewed birth control. Western debates over technologies are indeed grounded in and even sometimes a proxy for deeper religious conflicts that go back centuries. At the same time, despite these roots, decisions about technological innovation, adoption and limitation are made based on far more prosaic considerations. In a world where 2 billion people lack basic access to electricity and an even greater number desire continued economic growth, it is difficult to imagine that either technology or economic growth will be reconsidered anytime soon. Of course, the essentially religious debate over these issues will not be going away anytime soon. With his encyclical Pope Francis has done the world a service by helping us to see that our choices about technology and economic growth are part of a deeper set of questions focused on what kind of world we wish to live in together. Answering such questions collectively through action will be messy, inconsistent and deeply political. If history is any guide, religious teachings will inform these answers but not determine them. That will mean disappointment for fundamentalists of all stripes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/gallery/2014/mar/10/fukushima-children-play-indoors-earthquake-tsunami-nuclear-in-pictures","type":"gallery","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-10T12:15:43Z","webTitle":"The Fukushima children who have to play indoors – in pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2014/mar/10/fukushima-children-play-indoors-earthquake-tsunami-nuclear-in-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/gallery/2014/mar/10/fukushima-children-play-indoors-earthquake-tsunami-nuclear-in-pictures","fields":{"headline":"The Fukushima children who have to play indoors – in pictures","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/nov/23/red-light-cameron-dashboard-britain-help-repairs","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-23T00:05:07Z","webTitle":"The red light on Cameron’s dashboard won’t go out until he helps with repairs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/23/red-light-cameron-dashboard-britain-help-repairs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/nov/23/red-light-cameron-dashboard-britain-help-repairs","fields":{"headline":"The red light on Cameron’s dashboard won’t go out until he helps with repairs","bodyText":"The interest rate cut in China that came at the end of last week could be another red warning light flashing on David Cameron’s global economy “dashboard”. Or the cheaper cost of credit in Beijing could provide a much-needed boost for the world’s second-largest economy following months of slowing output. Likewise, a snap election in Japan, called by prime minister Shinzo Abe during the week, could illustrate panic in the world’s third-largest economy after two decades of stagnation, or be a sensible way to prepare the ground for a second and decisive stage of his Abenomics. On his return from the G20 in Brisbane, Cameron appeared in the gloomiest of moods, highlighting how slowing growth in emerging markets, of which China is the biggest, and stagnation in Europe were threats to the stability of the global financial system alongside the escalating dispute over eastern Ukraine and the Ebola crisis. We have been here before. Cameron’s comments echo those of George Soros the last time there was a sense of gathering doom. The billionaire financier said in 2011: “Financial markets are driving the world towards another Great Depression with incalculable political consequences. The authorities, particularly in Europe, have lost control of the situation.” Back then the world’s central banks came to the rescue. The US Federal Reserve began pumping funds into the financial system at such a rate that its total contribution was soon to reach nearly $4 trillion. The Bank of England and Japan’s central bank joined the fight. The only major institution to stay away was the European Central Bank (ECB), which was blocked by politicians in Brussels and Berlin from joining the quantitative easing game. They preferred prayer to action. ECB boss Mario Draghi was only allowed to issue a promise that he would do “whatever it takes” to save the euro. This promise, made in the summer of 2012, stemmed the flow of funds out of the eurozone, but only delayed a reckoning. Now he must honour the promise and begin buying sovereign bonds under his own QE programme. Last week he hinted that that was imminent. Not that Draghi has the power to cleanse the system. Cameron’s red lights are still everywhere. The Ukraine conflict is hurting Russia and its satellites. Germany and the eastern side of Europe, which has substantial trade links with Russia, are suffering too. Even bright spots like Spain are enjoying what could be likened to a fake tan – a gloss easily washed away in the event of an economic storm. The US is the only safe haven. A simplistic measure of its current situation would declare President Obama’s Keynesian policies a success. The dollar is rising against nearly all currencies as investors get their gold bars out, ready to cash them in for a chance to back the US recovery. A rising currency is a sure sign of returning confidence and the US, which could soon be putting up interest rates, has it in spades. However, the US has its weak spots, not least a banking sector that is getting up to its old tricks, a household sector that is ramping up its borrowing again and a political system riven with conflict. Much of its recovery is going in profits to the super-rich, stoking up social problems in riot-torn Ferguson, Missouri and elsewhere. Which brings us back to Cameron. In last weekend’s downbeat memo, he depicted the UK as a bright spot, not a red light. Yet his support for austerity has discouraged public and private investment and turned what should have been sustainable momentum into a sugar-rush of activity fuelled by low-skilled and low-paid workers. Sustainable UK growth is highly dependent on healthy exports. As such it needs greater cooperation through the offices of the G20, not less. Cameron appeared to be happy to end a wholly ineffective summit by saying, in effect, “world, cure thyself”. Yet as leader of the world’s sixth-largest economy, it will only happen if he participates in creating a new world order. Toxic week for nuclear power The nuclear industry has had a bad week, ending with a report on Friday from the Dounreay plant in the north of Scotland of “unacceptable staff behaviour” and an unauthorised radioactive release. On Wednesday, Areva, the French atomic plant designer and shareholder and atin Hinkley Point C, issued a profit warning and said it might need a cash injection as its shares plunged by nearly a quarter. The day before, EDF, the biggest shareholder and planned operator of Hinkley, admitted that it was once again delaying the schedule on the opening of the Flamanville plant in Normandy. None of this inspires confidence in an industry that is still struggling for public acceptance as work has got under way on the first atomic power plant to be built in Britain for more than two decades. Safety is the ultimate issue, but while the Dounreay episode is deeply regrettable, it appears to have been managed in an appropriate way by the regulators. The Flamanville rescheduling is, in isolation, equally regrettable but not disastrous. EDF insists it is learning from its mistakes, and Areva will not ultimately crash and burn because it is protected by the French state, which is still its major shareholder. Nevertheless, Areva’s problems crystallise a major concern. As well as Flamanville, it is beset by delays at Olkiluoto in Finland, where it is also helping to build one of its European pressurised reactors, similar to the one planned for Hinkley. Areva is also affected by the wider downturn in expected demand for new nuclear plants, and concerns that even the Paris government wants to scale down its dependence on nuclear. All this highlights the huge gamble the British government is taking in backing nuclear power. The subsidies on offer already make Hinkley extremely expensive for consumers, and yet no one can say with any certainty when the first power will eventually be produced. Juncker must go The political classes of Westminster were yet again under attack this week, accused of being irreparably out of touch with the building frustrations of voters in Rochester and Strood at seemingly unchecked EU immigration and the relentless way they had ceded powers to Brussels. Parallels have been drawn with MPs’ apparent collective failure to appreciate Scottish political views highlighted by the independence referendum debate. And it was against this backdrop that a rather desperate European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, chose to repeat his calls for greater EU fiscal integration. The argument was made as the former Luxembourg prime minister faced damning reports about a welter of generous tax deals handed out to multinationals by the Grand Duchy tax department during his long tenure in his home country. These deals have for years helped multinationals avoid tax in other European countries. Juncker insisted there was no “Luxembourg model” for doing deals – and, even if there had been, he was not its architect. This is just not credible, and for that reason Juncker should go. But in some ways that is regrettable. International cooperation on tax is the only way to rein in big corporations determined to shirk their fair share of tax. Multinationals around the world have seen booming corporate profits in recent decades but are increasingly finding ways to position themselves beyond the taxable reach of nation states. It is a silent scandal. But it is not one that is going to be solved by Britain parting ways with the EU and accelerating its journey towards full tax haven status. Nor would it be helped by Scotland going it alone, equally destined to end up a tax haven. The forces of big business in a globalised economy are more powerful than nation states. We need to wise up to that simple truth and look for the right international platform to counterbalance that shift in power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/video/2012/oct/30/hitachi-uk-nuclear-power-plants-video","type":"video","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-30T16:02:00Z","webTitle":"Hitachi signs £700m deal to build UK nuclear power plants - video","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2012/oct/30/hitachi-uk-nuclear-power-plants-video","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/video/2012/oct/30/hitachi-uk-nuclear-power-plants-video","fields":{"headline":"Hitachi signs £700m deal to build UK nuclear power plants - video","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/feb/26/uk-backs-315m-renewable-energy-projects","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-26T13:21:28Z","webTitle":"UK backs £315m renewable energy projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/26/uk-backs-315m-renewable-energy-projects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/feb/26/uk-backs-315m-renewable-energy-projects","fields":{"headline":"UK backs £315m renewable energy projects","bodyText":"More than a dozen new onshore wind farms are to receive financial backing through the coalition government’s reformed renewable incentive scheme, along with two offshore wind projects and five solar farms. The contracts for the new renewable energy projects amount to more than £315m in total, spread across five renewable technologies, and taken together should produce more than 2GW of new generation capacity, enough to power 1.4m homes. But green campaigners and parts of the renewable energy industry were disappointed by the auction process used to award the contracts, arguing that some technologies and projects had lost out in the reforms. The support for onshore wind comes even as the Conservatives have promised to cut or abandon subsidies for the technology, with David Cameron saying people have been “fed up” with turbines on land. It is not clear how the projects could be affected if a Conservative government is re-elected in May. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat energy secretary, said: “These projects could create thousands of green jobs and give a massive boost to homegrown energy while reducing our reliance on volatile foreign markets.” However, the solar power industry was quick to point out the sizeable difference in the number of wind projects awarded contracts compared with solar schemes. Solar farms tend to be brought forward by smaller companies, which lack the financial muscle to compete against big players, whereas many wind farms are championed by large international energy utilities. Paul Barwell, chief executive of the Solar Trade Association, said: “Unfortunately, this result is as disappointing as we predicted. The soon-to-be cheapest and most popular renewable - solar - has lost out in a complex auction that favours big players and genuinely established technologies. It is essential that changes are made to the next round of auctions in October to ensure that smaller UK solar companies have the confidence to enter.” Richard Dixon, of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said offshore wind had also received less support than it should have, given the potential of the technology. “These results are very disappointing [with only two offshore wind farms supported showing] how little interest the current government has in cleaning up our energy supply. Today is another nail in the coffin of the coalition’s claim to being the greenest government ever.” Under the coalition’s electricity market reforms, large renewable energy projects no longer receive direct subsidies funded by the electricity bill-payer. Instead, they compete in auctions for “contracts for difference”, by which they undertake to generate a certain quantity of energy replacing what would otherwise have come from fossil fuels. Davey said the auctioning mechanism had driven down the cost to billpayers of generating more low-carbon electricity. The Department of Energy and Climate Change has estimated that the projects will cost £110m less in bill-payer support than they would have done without the auctions. Each renewable technology in the competition was awarded a guide “strike price”, which set the maximum support available. But all the forms of renewables represented, apart from energy from waste, came in at substantially less than the strike price. This was in marked contrast to the strike price for nuclear power, which will result in one nuclear reactor being built - at Hinckley in Somerset, by the French state-backed utility EDF - for £80bn calculated on the strike price alone. Solar power, which has seen costs plummet as worldwide use of panels has risen, settled for 58% lower, with offshore wind 18% and onshore wind 17% under their respective strike prices. Davey said the way the reforms operated would result in 550MW more renewable generation capacity being built than would have happened without the competitive mechanism. He also said that small generators had been among the project developers bidding successfully for the contracts, in a nod to renewable experts who feared small companies would be the biggest losers under the reformed scheme. Jim Watson, research director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said falling prices were a positive consequence of competition but warned that past auctions had encouraged underbidding and fanfare over low prices should remain tempered until the proposed projects are realised. “In a sense it shows that this competitive process of getting companies to bid in against each other in an auction is working,” said Watson. “Whether these successful bidders have bid too low in their eagerness to get the contract only time will tell. In the 1990s when we used to have auctions for renewables we got a lot of low bids but a number of the companies couldn’t actually build the projects because they bid too low.” In response to the first Contracts for Difference auctions for renewables, Greenpeace Chief Scientist Dr Doug Parr said: “Today’s announcements show renewables’ costs are plummeting, and will mount a growing challenge to conventional sources of power in delivering energy security for the UK. “Those who say we should tackle climate change but are opposed to wind and solar farms need to explain how they plan to cut carbon emissions whilst keeping consumer bills as low as possible. “We’ve known onshore wind is much cheaper than nuclear for a while, but now we learn that solar power is already cheaper than new gas generation in some cases. It makes you wonder what could have been achieved with less party-political manoeuvring and more stable Government support for the clean technologies already being embraced by the world’s largest economies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/oct/17/tattoo-trolls-awful-words","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-17T19:16:07Z","webTitle":"If I were king for a day I’d tattoo trolls with their own awful words | Simon Armitage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/17/tattoo-trolls-awful-words","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/17/tattoo-trolls-awful-words","fields":{"headline":"If I were king for a day I’d tattoo trolls with their own awful words","bodyText":"As with all aristocratic dictators, the laws of my land will exist to serve both firmly held political positions and indefensible personal preferences.

As we enter his parents’ garage and approach his precious jumble of electrical equipment, it emits an ominous beep. Wilson is in full flow, explaining the old-fashioned control panel in the corner, and ignores it. “This is one of the original atom smashers,” he says with pride. “It would accelerate particles up to, um, 2.5m volts – so kind of up there, for early nuclear physics work.” He pats the knobs. It was in this garage that, at the age of 14, Wilson built a working nuclear fusion reactor, bringing the temperature of its plasma core to 580mC – 40 times as hot as the core of the sun. This skinny kid from Arkansas, the son of a Coca-Cola bottler and a yoga instructor, experimented for years, painstakingly acquiring materials, instruments and expertise until he was able to join the elite club of scientists who have created a miniature sun on Earth. Not long after, Wilson won $50,000 at a science fair, for a device that can detect nuclear materials in cargo containers – a counter-terrorism innovation he later showed to a wowed Barack Obama at a White House-sponsored science fair. Wilson’s two TED talks (Yup, I Built A Nuclear Fusion Reactor and My Radical Plan For Small Nuclear Fission Reactors) have been viewed almost 4m times. A Hollywood biopic is planned, based on an imminent biography. Meanwhile, corporations have wooed him and the government has offered to buy some of his inventions. Former US under-secretary for energy, Kristina Johnson, told his biographer, Tom Clynes: “I would say someone like him comes along maybe once in a generation. He’s not just smart – he’s cool and articulate. I think he may be the most amazing kid I’ve ever met.” Seven years on from fusing the atom, the gangly teen with a mop of blond hair is now a gangly 21-year-old with a mop of blond hair, who shuttles between his garage-cum-lab in the family’s home in Reno, Nevada, and other more conventional labs. In addition to figuring out how to intercept dirty bombs, he looks at ways of improving cancer treatment and lowering energy prices – while plotting a hi-tech business empire around the patents. As we tour his parents’ garage, Wilson shows me what appears to be a collection of nuggets. His watch sounds another alert, but he continues lovingly to detail his inventory. “The first thing I got for my fusion project was a mass spectrometer from an ex-astronaut in Houston, Texas,” he explains. This was a treasure he obtained simply by writing a letter asking for it. He ambles over to a large steel safe, with a yellow and black nuclear hazard sticker on the front. He spins the handle, opens the door and extracts a vial with pale powder in it. “That’s some yellowcake I made – the famous stuff that Saddam Hussein was supposedly buying from Niger. This is basically the starting point for nuclear, whether it’s a weapons programme or civilian energy production.” He gives the vial a shake. A vision of dodgy dossiers, atomic intrigue and mushroom clouds swims before me, a reverie broken by fresh beeping. “That’ll be the allanite. It’s a rare earth mineral,” Wilson explains. He picks up a dark, knobbly little rock streaked with silver. “It has thorium, a potential nuclear fuel.” I think now may be a good moment to exit the garage, but the tour is not over. “One of the things people are surprised by is how ubiquitous radiation and radioactivity is,” Wilson says, giving me a reassuring look. “I’m very cautious. I’m actually a bit of a hypochondriac. It’s all about relative risk.” He paces over to a plump steel tube, elevated to chest level – an object that resembles an industrial vacuum cleaner, and gleams in the gloom. This is the jewel in Wilson’s crown, the reactor he built at 14, and he gives it a tender caress. “This is safer than many things,” he says, gesturing to his Aladdin’s cave of atomic accessories. “For instance, horse riding. People fear radioactivity because it is very mysterious. You want to have respect for it, but not be paralysed by fear.” *** The Wilson family home is a handsome, hacienda-style house tucked into foothills outside Reno. Unusually for the high desert at this time of year, grey clouds with bellies of rain rumble overhead. Wilson, by contrast, is all sunny smiles. He is still the slightly ethereal figure you see in the TED talks (I have to stop myself from offering him a sandwich), but the handshake is firm, the eye contact good and the energy enviable – even though Wilson has just flown back from a weekend visiting friends in Los Angeles. “I had an hour’s sleep last night. Three hours the night before that,” he says, with a hint of pride. He does not drink or smoke, is a natty dresser (in suede jacket, skinny tie, jeans and Converse-style trainers) and he is a talker. From the moment we meet until we part hours later, he talks and talks, great billows of words about the origin of his gift and the responsibility it brings; about trying to be normal when he knows he’s special; about Fukushima, nuclear power and climate change; about fame and ego, and seeing his entire life chronicled in a book for all the world to see when he’s barely an adult and still wrestling with how to ask a girl out on a date. The future feels urgent and mysterious. “My life has been this series of events that I didn’t see coming. It’s both exciting and daunting to know you’re going to be constantly trying to one-up yourself,” he says. “People can have their opinions about what I should do next, but my biggest pressure is internal. I hate resting on laurels. If I burn out, I burn out – but I don’t see that happening. I’ve more ideas than I have time to execute.” Wilson credits his parents with huge influence, but wavers on the nature versus nurture debate: was he born brilliant or educated into it? “I don’t have an answer. I go back and forth.” The pace of technological change makes predicting his future a fool’s errand, he says. “It’s amazing – amazing – what I can do today that I couldn’t have done if I was born 10 years earlier.” And his ambitions are sky-high: he mentions, among many other plans, bringing electricity and state-of-the-art healthcare to the developing world. These laudable (and sometimes contradictory) goals have stumped governments, corporations and aid agencies, but for Wilson they are no wishlist. “I want to play major league baseball,” he says. “I want to make a difference.” Coming from any other 21-year-old this might be filed under hubris, but Wilson is different – as determined as he is smart. “When I said I wanted to build a nuclear fusion reactor in the garage, I think most parents would say no. But my personality is persistent and persuasive.” He shrugs. “It’s important to distinguish IQ from what you do with it.” The first child born to Kenneth and Tiffany Wilson in May 1994, in Texarkana, Arkansas, there was little reason to anticipate Taylor’s scientific vocation. The American south is better known for its poultry and cotton farming than applied physics. Tiffany ran a yoga studio; Kenneth, a red-meat-loving former college athlete, ran a cola bottling business. How they ended up with a little Einstein remains a mystery. “Neither of us knows a dang thing about science,” Kenneth confesses. The initial trigger was curiosity. Aged four, Wilson abandoned toy dump trucks to play with real traffic cones and barricades. He stood in front of the house directing traffic, wearing a reflective orange vest, yellow boots and a hard hat. For his fifth birthday, he demanded a crane – a real one. So Kenneth called a friend who owned a construction company and on the day of the party a six-tonne crane duly arrived, the operator letting Wilson sit in his lap and work the controls. The crane set a pattern. Tiffany and Kenneth, ignoring friends who muttered about spoiling, resolved to encourage and facilitate the passions of Taylor and his brother Joey, three years younger. At the age of nine, Taylor announced he would become an astronaut. He set aside books about fantasy and magic to swot up on space exploration. He wrote to astronauts, requesting pictures and autographs, and began building and launching little rockets. At school he gave ebullient talks about space exploration. “Everyone loved watching him, and when he was in the room, he just took control,” Dee Miller, the school’s former head, told his biographer. As Wilson’s rockets became more elaborate, he detoured into propulsion and making his own fuels. He pinned posters of the periodic table on his wall and pestered his dad for spare parts from the bottling factory. Rockets led to fireworks and (mostly) controlled explosions; sugar was mixed with potassium nitrate to make thunderous bangs that sent mushroom clouds over the yard. The neighbours either freaked out, or came to watch. For his 10th birthday his grandmother bought him The Radioactive Boy Scout, a book about a teenager in Michigan called David Hahn, who tried to build a nuclear breeder reactor in a back-yard shed in 1994. His experiment ended badly: arrest, disgrace and cleanup workers in hazmat suits. Naturally, Wilson saw the story as a challenge rather than a cautionary tale. His grandmother lived to regret the gift. Unlike Hahn, who worked in the shadows to evade a parental ban, Taylor was able to work openly – and under supervision. After becoming obsessed with atoms, the universe’s building blocks, he bought a Geiger counter and started collecting radioactive objects – antique vacuum tubes, figurines, clocks and gadgets from fairs, stores and online – plus a radiation-shielding container made of thick lead. He pushed his parents’ trust and patience to the limit. His biographer recounts an occasion when Tiffany poked her head into the garage and saw her son, in his canary yellow nuclear technician’s coveralls, watching a pool of liquid spreading across the concrete floor. “Tay, it’s time for supper.” “I think I’m going to have to clean this up first.” “That’s not the stuff you said would kill us if it broke open, is it?” “I don’t think so. Not instantly.” Wilson was safety conscious, but his explanations about time doses, distance intensities and inverse-square laws baffled his parents. They took advice from university physicists who, after quizzing the teen, concluded he knew what he was doing. *** Back in the garage in Reno, the adult Taylor Wilson concludes his tour and we wander into the house where his Geiger watch, I gratefully note, stops beeping. The family moved here when he was 14 so he and Joey, a maths prodigy, could attend Davidson Academy, a non-fee-paying school for the brightest of the bright, located on the University of Nevada, Reno campus. Under the guidance of two mentors in the physics department, Ronald Phaneuf and Bill Brinsmead, Wilson moved his research to the university lab and there pursued his goal of nuclear fusion, charming and cajoling hospitals and other institutions to lend or donate spare parts to supplement the lab’s equipment. He needed to achieve extremely high temperatures and to manage safely the hot gases produced as part of the process. It would involve tens of thousands of electron volts and deadly x-rays: using a fusor was considered too technically challenging even for most doctoral candidates. But in March 2009, using an inertial electrostatic confinement device, Wilson did it. The atoms inside collided and fused, throwing off energy at 1.2m neutrons per second. The reactor now sits in his garage, but Wilson has on occasion embellished the tale by implying the fusion happened there. Wilson says that even at the moment of triumph, he was mulling his next steps. “I was instantly thinking: what are the applications? What can I do with this?” Several years later, he received $100,000 from the libertarian-tinged Thiel Fellowship, which funds bright young things for two years – on condition they spurn college during that time and focus on their own projects. His fellowship has now ended but Wilson still has no plans to go to college, preferring instead to work on inventions and to travel, giving talks and visiting friends. He has proposed building small, self-contained underground nuclear fission reactors that use decommissioned nuclear weapons to fuel power. Another project is to help hospitals irradiate materials for medical isotopes – vital tools that help diagnose cancer but are often too costly for hospitals, especially those in poor countries. Wilson’s innovation holds the promise of dramatically slashing the cost, an initiative he developed in tribute to his grandmother, who died of the disease when he was 11. And then there is the radiation detector designed to intercept terrorist dirty bombs. Wilson’s achievements are impressive in someone so young, says Steve Cowley, CEO of the UK Atomic Energy Authority and professor of physics at Imperial College London. “What he has achieved is not in itself ground-breaking, but his drive and ingenuity are remarkable. He clearly has a bright future.” It’s a future that will include nuclear power – something that, despite the “troubling” disaster at Japan’s Fukushima reactor in 2011, Wilson says remains vital when it comes to combating climate change. “Nuclear can be used for good or bad. There’s no putting the genie back in the bottle. My goal is to help prevent the bad and enhance the good.” (Just as well, because he also thinks “there’s something beautiful in a mushroom cloud”.) We head out for a coffee, Wilson driving us in his parents’ Land Rover. The sun has re-emerged and glints off the city in the valley below. To the east, Elon Musk, the 43-year-old buccaneering entrepreneur behind Tesla and SpaceX, is building a $5bn factory to make lithium-ion batteries for electric cars and home energy storage. Wilson riffs enthusiastically about electric cars, so I ask if he would work for Musk, whom he has met. He almost groans and shakes his head, then picks his words carefully. “I look up to Elon. That’s hard for me to say. Maybe we both just have big personalities. I have similar ambitions, to do what Elon is doing.” Translation: no matter that Musk is the real-life inspiration for Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man, Wilson plans to build his own business empire and do things his way. The cafe has pizza, cookies and cakes, but Wilson demurs. “I’m good on calories for today.” Coffee? He shakes his head. “I tend to avoid caffeine. I don’t really need it. You may have noticed.” The cashier, a middle-aged woman, clearly recognises him. So, too, do some diners, their eyes following Wilson as we take a table. He got this at the weekend in LA, he says: people know him either from the TED talks, or a much-shared interview he did with CNN in 2012 (Meet Taylor Wilson, Nuclear Prodigy). How does it feel? “I never got into science for the public persona. All that fame stuff, I take it in my stride. I don’t mind it.” Does he like it? A pause. “I don’t dislike it.” Wilson’s parents have moved back to Arkansas to concentrate on Joey – who, in the shadow of his atomic sibling, was becoming increasingly introverted – leaving him to live alone in the former family home. His strength of character and focus have at times worried and alienated those closest to him. “All teens can be narcissistic, and when you have people telling you every day you’re Einstein, your identity can get wrapped up in being a whiz-kid,” says Clynes, his biographer, speaking from Ann Arbor, Michigan. “Taylor went through some very dark times. I’m not sure if he knew it, but everyone around him did.” The book includes some stinging observations from relatives and colleagues, including this from his mentor, Phaneuf: “He’s gotten addicted to the spotlight.” Clynes himself, whose original Popular Science article amped up the spotlight, confesses to fearing he “helped to create a monster”. That fear has ebbed and Wilson is now on good terms with loved ones and colleagues, Clynes says. In the transition to adulthood, he matured and discovered some grace and humility – not least in accepting the biography, warts and all. “Reading it hit him hard,” Clynes says. “He was finding out for the first time: wow, I was a jerk. But he got through it and supports the conclusions. How many people would have the maturity to read such things about themselves and consider them accurate?” What does Wilson make of the accusations of arrogance and narcissism? He squirms before giving a geeky but apparently sincere reply. “It’s something I’m cognisant of. It’s maturity. The experiential gap between 16 and 21 is incredible.” He is not good at foreign languages or sport, he says, failings that give him humility. As does clumsiness in romance. “What makes me nervous? Asking a girl for her number.” He is currently single, he says, without elaborating. Close friends help keep the ego in check, he adds. “I have my normal friends and go to normal parties. I’m very self-conscious.” Self-conscious because he knows he is not typical of his peers. He abhors downtime, for instance. “I’m not very happy when I’m not doing anything.” He mulls the thought. “Maybe that’s a sign of neuroses.” There are perks to being the smartest person in the room. But if you’re processing thoughts others may not grasp, do you conceal them and go with the flow – or let rip? For Wilson, this triggers a battle between his newfound humility and his innate ebullience. An unequal contest. “Often when meeting new people, I make an effort to not talk about science and not say who I am,” he says. Wilson sighs and smiles. He’s a man now, but he will always be the boy who built a nuclear reactor in his parents’ garage.

But the intense power of uranium, the raw material of nuclear fuel, was demonstrated to the world by the Fukushima disaster last year. Its price on global markets has collapsed, from a record $136 a pound in 2007 to just $44 last week – a slump so severe that some of the world's biggest miners have decided they're better off leaving the mineral in the ground. The market suffered further blows in the last month or so as several developed-world governments announced or confirmed plans to move away from atomic power for good. But even as the west retreats, the nuclear industry may be about to rise again – in the developing world. In the last few days, China announced plans to restart its massive £170bn reactor building programme, intended to create generating capacity so large that it could power the whole of Spain. Last March, Japan went into lockdown and shut all of its nuclear plants, which had provided 30% of the nation's electricity. Fears of a nuclear apocalypse rippled across the globe, turning the lights out at reactors around the world, and many of them still lie idle 18 months later. Japan, which is now running a series of expensive and polluting diesel generators at 100% capacity to replace its nuclear fleet, has announced plans to completely end its reliance on nuclear power by 2040, at an estimated cost of $620bn. Germany and Belgium are also giving up on nuclear power, while Italy has cancelled a long-planned move back to it, and even France – the most pro-nuclear country in the world – is scaling things down. The future of the UK's nuclear ambitions also hangs in the balance after Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF Energy, the French company charged with building new reactors in the UK, told parliament the company had yet to make up its mind whether it was worth building plants without support from the government. Two German companies – RWE and E.ON – have already pulled out of the Horizon joint venture to build new nuclear plants in the UK. \"It is the same as after Chernobyl. There are huge question marks hanging over whether we should have [nuclear power] – a lot of countries are umm-ing and err-ing,\" says Heenal Patel, a senior industrial analyst at Bloomberg Industries. Patel says President François Hollande's decision to close France's oldest nuclear plant last month, and his commitment to lowering the country's dependence on nuclear power from 75% to 50% of total electricity demand, has caused the biggest waves in the industry: \"If the world's most pro-nuclear country is blowing cold it is noticed by other countries.\" Uranium miners have noticed the cool wind too. This summer, BHP Billiton, the giant Anglo-Australian mining group, shelved plans for the world's largest open-pit copper and uran, and announced it has no plans to build or acquire other uranium minesium mine in south Australia. The £12bn Olympic Dam mega-project would have transformed the mine 350 miles north of Adelaide into a massive pit capable of producing 19,000 tonnes of uranium a year. Explaining the decision to stall the project, Marius Kloppers, BHP's chief executive, said demand for uranium had \"collapsed\". BHP has also sold off its Yeelirrie uranium field in Western Australia. Canada's Cameco, the world's third-largest uranium miner, has said it is only worth pressing ahead with its Kintyre uranium project in Australia's Great Sandy Desert if the uranium price climbs back above $67 a pound. Patel said that if the uranium price keeps falling, \"manufacturers are going to look to keep it in the ground … That's the great thing about being a mining company: you can decide whether to produce or not. The uranium isn't going anywhere.\" Paladin Energy, which mines uranium in Malawi and Namibia (the largest sources of uranium oxide, or \"yellowcake\", after Kazakhstan, Canada and Australia), has warned that if the price stays depressed, supply will dip by 25% by 2020. Chief executive John Borshoff says his analysis \"confirms a supply industry in crisis, in which production is unable to meet emerging requirements in the short to medium term\". Another, more unusual, source of uranium could also run dry soon. At present, about 16% of the world's uranium (and half of supplies used in American reactors) come from Soviet nuclear weapons. The \"megatons to megawatts\" programme, which formed part of the 1993 US-Russia non-proliferation treaty, has seen highly enriched uranium from the equivalent of 18,000 Russian warheads converted to lower-grade fuel for use at power plants in the US cities at which they were once aimed. But the programme is due to come to an end next year. Despite the current collapse in demand, analysts say the uranium price will recover in the long term. The rapacious growth of China and India will be dependent on nuclear fuel, and the oil-rich Gulf nations are planning big forays into nuclear so that they can extend the lifetime of their highly profitable oil exports. There are 65 reactors being built around the world, and 69% of them are in the fast-growing Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China). Beijing's ambitious programme will increase nuclear from 2% to 5% of the country's electricity supply by 2020, and make China the world's biggest market for new nuclear equipment. India – which lacks fossil fuel resources and has been growing so fast that its electricity supply is falling 12% short at peak hours, causing frequent blackouts – is also planning a massive expansion programme. The country hopes nuclear will account for 50% of its electricity needs by 2050, up from just 3.7% last year. To raise nuclear output, India has had to convince uranium producers to provide supplies, despite long-held concerns over India's nuclear weapons programme. Four years ago, the 46-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group exempted India from a 30-year ban on exports to countries that have failed to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty after receiving assurances that no nuclear imports would find their way to the military. This month Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister, held talks with his Australian counterpart Julia Gillard, with the aim of reversing Australia's decision to maintain its own ban on exports to India. Lifting the ban will boost Australia's miners, which produced 7,529 tonnes of uranium worth A$782m (£500m) last year, but could cause problems at home: nuclear power is a sensitive topic in a country that has decide not to build any nuclear plants despite having the world's largest uranium reserves. Patel reckons Japan will be forced to follow China and India and re-embrace nuclear despite the memories of Fukushima. \"Like India, they don't have a huge amount of natural resources, and that's why Japan was so into nuclear … They have had to import a whole lot more oil and gas, which is expensive and not great for energy security.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/jul/07/kiwi-power-cuts-usage-high-demand-help-uk-energy-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-07T19:25:51Z","webTitle":"KiWi Power: the tech-savvy energy firm with a way out of Britain's power crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/07/kiwi-power-cuts-usage-high-demand-help-uk-energy-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jul/07/kiwi-power-cuts-usage-high-demand-help-uk-energy-crisis","fields":{"headline":"KiWi Power: the tech-savvy energy firm with a way out of Britain's power crisis","bodyText":"A small iron gate squeezed between a newsagent and printing shop off Carnaby Street in central London is not the obvious location for a business that could avert a British power crunch. Step inside the cramped, white-painted offices of KiWi Power and it looks more like a tech startup than an energy business – as exemplified by the open shirt and beaded necklace sported by co-founder Ziko Abram. In fact, it is the firm's tech-savvy product that offers a way out of the long-term threat of blackouts and shortages. A lack of investment in new power plants plus an accelerating closure programme for existing sites has meant spare capacity to deal with surges in demand caused by cold weather, gas import interruptions or plant failures has fallen from about 25% in the early 1990s to 5%-10% this year. However, higher than expected demand could see that margin fall to about 2%, industry regulator Ofgem admitted last week. The decrease has led to warnings from the industry of serious consequences unless the government encourages the building of new plants. The chairman of British Gas owner Centrica said this year that threats to impose price caps or break up the UK's biggest energy supplier was raising the real possibility of \"the lights going out in the Britain\". This is where Abram comes in. KiWi makes a laptop-sized piece of equipment that helps 650 plants or buildings in Britain save on energy bills by using less power. The firm monitors the energy being used by its customers and can cut their power usage at short notice. This could mean turning off lights or air conditioning during peak times of national energy demand for up to an hour at a time – if agreed by the customer. This is known as demand reduction (DR) and KiWi users – including several NHS hospitals, Marriott hotels and industrial groups – are paid by the National Grid for the energy they save. If the UK wants to keep the lights on at a time when power stations are being closed and not enough new ones are being built, this is one way to help do it, according to Abram. \"We can take offline around 200 megawatts [enough to power 100,000 kettles] from our participating customers almost at the flick of a switch but the market for this kind of thing could be so much bigger with the right policy arrangements.\" KiWi is also paid for the energy saved by the National Grid, which ensures that power networks in England and Wales stay open. Meanwhile, the big six energy companies – Centrica, EDF Energy, RWE npower, SSE, E.ON and Scottish Power – are complaining that low wholesale power prices mean they are often forced to shut existing gas-fired plants instead of building new ones. Yet the National Grid wants more power stations ready and firing rather than fewer, especially gas ones that can cause half as much carbon pollution as coal. The current crisis has been long in the making and was caused by a number of interlocking issues such as old nuclear power stations being shut, the need to go green to beat climate change and the challenge posed by cheap coal prices. Much of the coal has been imported to Britain from the US where it has been replaced by cheap domestic shale gas. Coal has also been made attractive again by a collapse in the carbon price on the EU's emissions trading scheme. Many coal-fired plants will have to be closed next year, but their owners are keeping them going for as long as possible rather than building more efficient gas plants because they are so profitable. But the clock is ticking on these sites. Under the Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD) passed by the Brussels parliament, coal or oil power stations not adapted to meet emissions-reduction targets will have to close by the end of 2015. There are no similar pollution issues with low-carbon nuclear but no new atomic plants have been built since Sizewell B in Suffolk almost 20 years ago. Most of the atomic fleet is at or is coming to the end of its life. One of the last half dozen stations, Wylfa in Anglesey, is due to shut in September after 40 years and all but Sizewell will be retired by 2024. In the meantime only one new nuclear power station is firmly being planned – at Hinkley Point in Somerset – and even that is being reviewed in Brussels amid claims its subsidy regime breaches competition rules. Renewable energy has taken up some slack, with new windfarms, solar parks and biomass facilities now able at times to generate up to 15% of the UK's electricity. This low- or no-carbon power is also key to meeting Britain's climate change targets but relies on significant public subsidies that push up business and consumer bills. Ironically, the surge in new windfarms has helped pushed down the price of electricity, making it unattractive to build or operate gas-fired stations. This is the \"trilemma\" facing the government: how to keep fuel poverty from rising at a time when an estimated £110bn of new investment by 2020 alone is needed to build new low CO2 capacity and meet rising electricity demand. This is the equivalent of building 20 Olympic Stadiums a year by the end of the decade. The government's answer to the threat of blackouts has been a reform programme criticised by the energy industry as fiendishly complex, lacking in detail and slow in being implemented. The reforms include \"contracts for difference\" which set a minimum price for nuclear power-generated electricity and a \"capacity market\" to encourage standby plants to be ready at peak time as well as a carbon floor price and measures for demand reduction. Feeding into the sense of uncertainty has been growing consumer anger about the soaring price of gas and electricity combined with a raft of mis-selling scandals. This has led to a huge loss of trust in the big six, which has been picked up by politicians and finally led to a scathing review of the industry by regulator Ofgem and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). A full-blown investigation into the energy market by the CMA was confirmed three weeks ago and the probe could last for at least 18 months. Centrica, the owner of British Gas, has argued this would freeze investment in the new power plants for the foreseeable future while others believe it is an essential step forward – if only to clear the toxic air. A report last week from credit ratings agency Moody's played down the chances of the lights going out. It said more windfarms, lower gas demand and energy efficiency projects should continue to keep wholesale power prices flat until the end of the decade. It will also make a capacity squeeze less likely, Moody's argued. Meanwhile, Britain will be crossing its fingers and relying on small newcomers such as KiWi to suck demand out of the system."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2015/jan/16/golden-age-peter-jane-ladybird-flight","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-16T07:00:09Z","webTitle":"The golden age of Peter and Jane: how Ladybird took flight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/16/golden-age-peter-jane-ladybird-flight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/jan/16/golden-age-peter-jane-ladybird-flight","fields":{"headline":"The golden age of Peter and Jane: how Ladybird took flight","bodyText":"A small boy in collar and tie teeters on homemade stilts made out of upturned flowerpots and bits of string, a stern-looking man in a nuclear facility barks something important into a red phone, a woodpecker perches on the side of a tree. For many of us who grew up between the 1960s and 80s, the images from Ladybird books were the first art we ever saw. And, without quite realising, we have loved it ever since. If you need reminding – or persuading – of the brilliance of Ladybird illustration, then head to Bexhill, East Sussex, where Ladybird By Design opens at the De La Warr pavilion on 24 January. Here you will find 200 pieces of original artwork from the “golden age” between 1958 and 1973 when the company was selling many millions of books every year. If you were aged between two and 12 during those decades, then the chances are you had several of those slender hardbacks on your bedroom shelves. Whether it was Things to Make, Florence Nightingale or The Story of Oil, the layout was always the same. On the left-hand side was text in a font and vocabulary appropriate to your reading age, and on the opposite side was a full-page illustration of near-photographic accuracy, packed with such colour and exuberance that, decades later, it is still possible to close your eyes and recall every detail. My favourite Ladybird was The Story of Clothes &amp; Costume, which is one of the hundreds of titles included in the De La Warr exhibition. It starts with people in prehistoric bearskins and finishes in the 1960s with a picnicking family in drip-dry polyester. Along the way there are monochrome Puritans, poodled-haired cavaliers and, best of all, the one that I traced endlessly, a Victorian lady at the theatre in an oyster evening dress decorated with a tumble of roses. The images are fully realised scenes, crammed with incident. On one page, an Elizabethan merchant gloats over a chest of gold; on the next, the Cavaliers skip with merriment during a stroll in the grounds of their stately home. Meanwhile, the Puritans cluster in prayer around the dinner table, sincerity etched on their grave faces. The illustrator is Robert Ayton, who was one of Ladybird’s chief contributors during the golden age. Born in 1915, Ayton trained at Harrow College of Art and initially worked in advertising, producing designs for Castrol and Rolls Royce. After demob in 1945 he turned to editorial work, contributing to the newly buoyant Ladybird brand (technically the imprint started in 1915, but the books didn’t emerge in their familiar form until the second world war). The Story of Printing was one of Ayton’s, as was Tricks and Magic, The Story of Furniture, Your Body, The Story of Nuclear Power, Toys and Games to Make, not forgetting The Night Sky and about 45 others. Ayton’s CV serves as a pattern for the other freelance illustrators who were responsible for turning Ladybird into a global phenomenon during the 1960s. John Berry designed the Tiger in Your Tank logo for Esso before producing the People at Work series for Ladybird, which gives an unparalleled account of the social landscape of late-industrial Britain, one filled with miners, potters and engine drivers. Then there’s Frank Hampson, creator of the Eagle’s Dan Dare, who illustrated that quintessential Ladybird series, Kings and Queens of England. Most distinguished of all was CF Tunnicliffe RA, the renowned wildlife illustrator who produced the lyrical What to Look For (in Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn) series. The craftsmanship of these men, along with that of Berry, Harry Wingfield and Robert Lumley, is all the more remarkable because they worked in an analogue age when a mistake meant starting again. “If my students could draw like that today I’d be over the moon,” says co-curator of the De La Warr exhibition Lawrence Zeegen, dean of the School of Design at the London College of Communication, before adding candidly, “actually, if I could draw like that I’d be over the moon”. Getting the Ladybird gig, though, didn’t mean that you were given carte blanche to create 24 images of your own imagining. The artwork needed to be instructive as well as illustrative, regardless of whether the reader was learning to sew, discovering nuclear power or taking up coarse fishing. For instance, Ayton’s images for Your Body, with their intricate cross-sectioning and precise labelling, would not be out of place in a biology textbook. Yet Ayton gives his cricket-playing skeleton and rose-sniffing skull such joie de vivre that you can see why there are hospital consultants working today who owe their vocation to Ladybird. Getting on the roster of commissioned artists was hard – Ladybird’s editorial director Douglas Keen knew what he wanted and, if you didn’t manage it within a couple of tries, then you would never hear from him again. Once accepted, though, you could find yourself doing a whole series, which meant 10 books or 240 images. Today, the children of golden-age Ladybird illustrators still remember the times of plenty that followed from a series commission – even though the artists were paid a flat fee rather than royalties, which must have vexed even the sunniest of souls, given Ladybird’s cumulative sales figures, rumoured at the time to be as high as £24m. This swollen statistic is all the more extraordinary, given the brand’s stuttering start. Although Wills &amp; Hepworth jobbing Loughborough printers, had been churning out mediocre children’s story books for decades, the classic Ladybird formula emerged from war‑time exigencies. In order to keep their presses rolling and make the most of their much reduced paper ration, Wills &amp; Hepworth began to produce 56‑page books that could, ingeniously, be printed on just one large sheet measuring 30 inches by 40. This allowed them to keep the price to a very reasonable 2s 6d for an extraordinary 30 years. Ladybird books were cheap enough for a child to buy with her own pocket money, or for a grandparent to give as a stocking filler, or for schools to award as prizes (that’s how I got my Story of Clothes and Costume). And the fact that the books increasingly dealt only with factual subjects allowed parents and teachers to reassure themselves that they were spending money on building a better child. Buying a Ladybird book became a kind of public service. To enter Ladybird’s world again is to relearn a universe that is both strange yet uncannily familiar. Inevitably the books express the values of their times. In the Peter and Jane series (aka Key Words Reading Scheme), Peter tends to hang out with Daddy in the garage, while Jane helps Mummy get the tea. Fair-haired and blue-eyed, every one in the children’s world looks exactly like them, apart from Pat the dog. Still, if Ladybird books were conservative on gender and race, they were positively brisk on class. The world of Peter and Jane – and all the other children who appear in the Ladybird universe doing magic tricks, going to the shops, taking batteries apart or learning to swim – is both modern and modest. As illustrated by Berry, Wingfield and Martin Aitchison, the children appear to live in one of the postwar new towns. Their home is probably privately owned but it could conceivably be a newly built council house. Their adventures involve going on a train or to the beach with Mummy and Daddy. There are no prep-school japes here, no solving of improbable mysteries or clifftop rescues. Perhaps this achievable utopia was a compensatory fantasy for the illustrators who, born around 1920, had mostly known childhoods far harder than this. Busy providing a safe, stable environment for their own little Peters and Janes, men such as Berry and Wingfield showed a world where things were, on the whole, getting better. Modernity increasingly presses into the frame: Jane and Peter eat off a table that looks like knock-off Habitat, Mummy wears slacks and Daddy even starts to help with the washing-up. More disruptive changes, though, are kept at a safe distance. Carnaby Street, with all its troubling freedoms, has no place in the Ladybird world, nor does the cold war or Vietnam. Visitors to the De La Warr pavilion – itself a wonderful mid-century construction, like a grand ocean liner that has run aground on Bexhill’s pebbled beach – will doubtless be pulled to the Ladybird exhibition by nostalgia. But it is other pleasures that will make them want to stay, suggests Jane Won, the exhibition’s co-curator. Won herself did not grow up in this country and was unfamiliar with Ladybird until she started work on the project. Nonetheless, she reports finding something fascinating about images such as the cover to Eric Winter’s Learning to Sew, in which needle and thimble take on a luminous presence, or Gerald Whitcomb’s picture of a pair of socks in Sound and Pictures, which appears to be vibrating on a higher frequency than the rest of the world. It is this quality of hyperreality that accounts for contemporary practitioners including Gavin Turk and Jeremy Deller collecting Ladybird art, finding in it a commentary on the binaries that they explore in their own work: authenticity v mundanity, artisanal v artistic, value v worth. Still, you don’t have to be driven by the rhetoric of cultural theory to find yourself compelled to linger at the exhibition. All you need is an ability to attend to your own puzzlement. There is something, you see, that has always troubled me about the last picture in my History of Clothes and Costume book. In the picnic scene, in which the polyestered family of four enjoys an alfresco lunch, the father is wearing a cravat. It worried me terribly at the time because, although I knew dads sometimes daringly donned cravats for a cheese and wine party, I hadn’t seen any at a picnic. And looking at the image again, I’m still convinced there’s something odd about it. Did the illustrator, Ayton, have an off-day, was his eye somewhere else, or is this his sly joke about Britain’s clumsiness in the new age of informality? Whatever the answer, it’s exactly this kind of small tear or snag in the smoothly ordered visual surface of the Ladybird universe that keeps you coming back for one more look. • Ladybird by Design opens at the De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill, East Sussex, next 24 January and runs to 10 May, see dlwp.com; Ladybird by Design by Lawrence Zeegen is published by Penguin in March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2014/jul/04/-sp-the-long-shadow-of-chernobyl","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-04T05:00:14Z","webTitle":"The long shadow of Chernobyl","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/04/-sp-the-long-shadow-of-chernobyl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jul/04/-sp-the-long-shadow-of-chernobyl","fields":{"headline":"The long shadow of Chernobyl","bodyText":"Victor Gaydack is now in his 70s and lives in a Kiev suburb. In April 1986 he was a major in the Russian army, on duty when reactor four at Chernobyl exploded. He was one of tens of thousands of fit, young “liquidators” sent in from all over the Soviet Union to try to make safe the stricken reactor. Since the accident, Gaydack has suffered two heart attacks, and developed severe stomach cancer. Who is to say that Gaydack’s conditions were not caused by the accident or would have happened without the explosion? Or that the many mentally disabled Belarussian children and the thousands of people born in the fallout region who today suffer from thyroid cancers and congenital diseases were not also Chernobyl victims? Estimates of the eventual deaths, cancers, heart diseases, ailments and malformations that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously and are still bitterly contested by scientists. What is certain is that about 350,000 people like Gaydack were evacuated and resettled from the high-level 2,600 square kilometre contamination zone that stretches from Ukraine into Belarus and Russia. It is certain, too, that the accident cost tens of billions of dollars in today’s money and that the area around the plant will be psychologically cursed for hundreds, if not tens of thousands of years. What has been less understood however is that Chernobyl changed the course of the world’s history and that its long shadow will hang over nuclear power for centuries. In an essay in National Geographic photographer Gerd Ludwig’s new book of the aftermath of the accident, Mikhail Gorbachev, the last president of the Soviet Union and on whose watch Chernobyl occurred, makes it clear - not for the first time - that the accident greatly accelerated the end of Soviet Union. He writes: The nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl even more than my launch of perestroika, was perhaps the real cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union five years later. Indeed, the Chernobyl catastrophe was an historic turning point: there was the era before the disaster, and there is the very different era that has followed ... the Chernobyl disaster, more than anything else, opened the possibility of much greater freedom of expression, to the point that the system as we knew it could no longer continue. It made absolutely clear how important it was to continue the policy of glasnost. There’s no photograph of Gorbachev, but there is one of Gaydack, in his flat watching, horrified, as the Fukushima disaster unfolds on television 26 years later. There are also plenty of heartbreaking images of children without limbs, dramatic shots of the physical disaster in the belly of the stricken reactor and the wild world that has been left beyond ground zero. “It is virtually impossible to connect specific illnesses to particular causes, but there is no doubt that the families and the doctors who work with the sufferers in radiation hospitals and who are brave enough to speak out have good reason to blame the disaster,” says Ludwig, who has documented the world’s worst nuclear disaster in nine visits over 20 years. “Women exposed to the fallout as children have now reached childbearing age and fear giving birth to babies with congenital defects, worrying how radiation may have affected their genes. While some in the scientific community question that birth defects and retardation are directly attributable to the disaster, noted scientist Alexei Okeanov [of the International Sakharov Environmental University in Minsk, Belarus] calls it ‘a ﬁre that can’t be put out in our lifetimes’.” Pictures and captions from The Long Shadow of Chernobyl Workers enter the so-called diarator stack, where they drill holes in the concrete to install support beams that are supposed to stabilise the outward leaning western wall which is in danger of collapsing. Their dark workspace is located close to the centre of the explosion and is so highly contaminated that they can only work in 15-minute shifts despite wearing highly protective gear and respirators. Entombing the radiation, a brick wall blocks the entrance to the control room of reactor four, where the fatal mistake occurred. It created a safer passage for workers who have to walk through the area. After the Chernobyl nuclear accident, a concrete and steel encasement, the so-called sarcophagus, was hastily erected to contain the radioactive remnants inside the failed reactor. Only intended to be temporary, it is leaky and structurally unsound. Scientists agree that it will ultimately give way, shaking loose enough radioactivity to cause a second disaster of even greater magnitude. A radiation sign along a road near Pripyat warns of radiation. The tranquility of the sight on an evening of heavy snowfall belies the lingering danger looming in the peaceful winter landscape. On April 26, 1986 at 1:23 am, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant's reactor number four blew up after operators botched a safety test, triggering the world's worst nuclear disaster to date. The nuclear accident at the in Ukraine contaminated thousands of square kilometres, forcing 150,000 inhabitants within an area now known as the exclusion zone to hastily abandon their homes. At the Thyroid Centre in Minsk, surgery is performed on a daily basis. Amongst the patients in room #4 was Dima Bogdanovich, 13, who had just undergone his first surgery for thyroid cancer, and liquidator Oleg Shapiro, 54. He was exposed to high doses of radiation while remanteling small wooden homes in the villages close to the reactor. His commission was originally for six months. Blood tests were administered after three months and the workers were mysteriously sent home. Oleg says that out of the 300 workers in his brigade, one-third have since died. He himself has already been through three thyroid operations. Despite scientific dispute over the cause of physical malformations, many homes in Belarus receive support from Chernobyl aid programmes funded by various international aid organisations around the world. Activist Adi Roche, is an Irish woman who founded the organisation, Chernobyl Children, and produced the 2004 Academy Award-winning documentary on Chernobyl victims called Chernobyl Heart. Adi has made the care of Chernobyl victims the centre of her life. Her organisation gives major help to the children's home in Vesnova, which cares for 150 abandoned and orphaned children with severe mental and physical disabilities. Some pictures show children with lesser disabilities harvesting fields and taking care of farm animals to produce food for the home. We helped Ludmila Kirichenko, 49, her daughter Tatyana, 22 and their friend Ludmila Shapovalova, 55 to be allowed to privately visit their former hometown of Prypyat. It was only the second time that Shapovalova came to Prypyat since she had to leave 19 years ago. Together they visited the graveyard, the kindergarten, the hospital where both women gave birth, both of their apartments and the Polissia Hotel. In between they stopped for a picnic in the main square. 92-year-old Kharytina Descha is one of the few elderly people who have returned to their village homes inside the exclusion zone. Although surrounded by devastation and isolation, she prefers to die on her own soil. As she has difficulties walking and hearing she does not have much communication with anybody in the village but seems to be quite content with her situation. After the catastrophe, close to 100,000 inhabitants who lived in villages inside the 30km zone were evacuated. Ignoring radiation levels, a (now diminishing) number of elderly people have returned to their homes. At first Ukrainian officials discouraged them, but soon they turned a blind eye. When Soviet authorities finally ordered the evacuation, the residents' hasty departure often meant leaving behind their most personal belongings. The Soviet Union only admitted to the world that an accident had occurred two days after the explosion, when the nuclear cloud reached Sweden and scientists there noticed contamination on their shoes before entering their own nuclear power plant. Victor Gaydak, 70, liquidator of the Chernobyl accident, is watching the news from the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan. A major in the military, he was on duty when the explosion occurred. Following the disaster he had two heart attacks, and developed severe stomach cancer. Evacuated from Pripyat, he now lives with his family in Troeschina, a suburb of Kiev, where more than 30% of the population are people relocated after the Chernobyl accident. An estimated 800,000 people, called liquidators participated in containing the Chernobyl disaster, cleaning up after the accident, and building the sarcophagus around the destroyed reactor. Most liquidators received high doses of radiation resulting in cancers and other diseases induced by their exposure, often only showing up decades after the event. The empty school rooms in Prypyat- once the largest town in the zone with 49,000 inhabitants - are being taken over by nature. On April 26, 1986, the nuclear accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine contaminated thousands of square miles, forcing 150.000 inhabitants within a 30km zone to hastily abandon their homes. Nineteen years later, the still empty school and kindergarten rooms in Prypyat- once the largest town in the zone with 49.000 inhabitants bear witness to the sudden and tragic departure. • This article was amended on 9 July 2014 to remove incorrect information about cesium 127."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/nov/16/al-gore-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-16T11:58:12Z","webTitle":"Al Gore: nuclear power will play 'limited role' in future energy mix","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/16/al-gore-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/nov/16/al-gore-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Al Gore: nuclear power will play 'limited role' in future energy mix","bodyText":"Nuclear power will only play a limited role in the world's energy future because of its \"absurdly high\" cost, Al Gore said on Thursday. Despite several countries, including the US, UK and China, pushing forward with plans for new nuclear reactors, the former vice-president said the economics of nuclear meant that it was unlikely to play a major role. \"It will play a role, but probably a limited role. I think the waste issue can probably be solved, and Fukushima notwithstanding, the safety of operation issue can probably be solved. But the cost is absurdly high and still rising,\" he wrote during a question and answer session on Reddit to promote his 24-hour Climate Reality webcast on the links between fossil fuels and extreme weather. Gore's comments seem to suggest he has changed his mind on how attractive nuclear is – in 2009, he said he saw it playing \"a somewhat larger role\" in the energy mix because of climate change and efforts to cut carbon emissions. \"I'm not a reflexive opponent of nuclear. I used to be enthusiastic about it, but I'm now sceptical about it,\" he told the Guardian at the time. In the Reddit conversation, he said that while nuclear was expensive, renewable energy technologies were fast becoming cheaper. \"Meanwhile, solar PV [photovoltaics] is riding a 'Moore's Law Jr' costdown curve. Wind and efficiency too, though not as steep. We need to get to scale on renewables quickly and make the transition.\" Gore also robustly defended climate science when asked \"what is the one undeniable scientific fact that you feel backs it [global warming] up the most effectively?\". After listing the national science academies and scientists who support the evidence of manmade climate change, he added: \"There is as strong a consensus as you will find in science, with the possible exception of the existence of gravity.\" He also reiterated his call, in a Guardian interview this week, for Barack Obama to \"start with climate\" as a priority during his second term. Gore on Tuesday said: \"\"He has the mandate. He has the opportunity, and he has the inherent ability to provide the leadership needed. I really hope that he will, and I will respectfully ask him to do exactly that.\" Gore also called on the Obama administration to push for a carbon tax during negotiations over the so-called fiscal cliff budget crisis. On Wednesday, Obama said he would take personal charge of finding a solution to action on climate change during his second term."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/apr/15/finland-boom-election-recession-oulu-miracle-timber-nokia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-15T17:30:08Z","webTitle":"Finland after the boom: 'Not as bad as Greece, yet, but for how long'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/15/finland-boom-election-recession-oulu-miracle-timber-nokia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/apr/15/finland-boom-election-recession-oulu-miracle-timber-nokia","fields":{"headline":"Finland after the boom: 'Not as bad as Greece, yet, but it's only matter of time'","bodyText":"A sudden flurry of spring snow has dusted the steps of an evangelical church in central Oulu, northern Finland, where about 100 people are crowded together for a Friday sermon. But perhaps the true object of their devotion is inside black binliners by the door. Once a week, food parcels and a free meal attract a mix of unemployed men, single mothers and pensioners to the church. The most highly prized items are packs of sausages just within their sell-by date. Shops used to donate meat, but now they too are feeling the pinch. “There is a group of people in Finland that has dropped out of the employment market,” says pastor Risto Wotschke, whose example has encouraged other churches to offer food handouts. The weakest economy in the eurozone this year might not prove to be Greece or Portugal, but Finland. The Nordic country is entering its fourth year of recession, with output still well below its 2008 peak. The north of Finland, home to the “Oulu miracle” that was built on the twin pillars of plentiful timber and mobile phone technology, has been hit in particular. Although a paper mill still dominates Oulu’s skyline, jobs in pulp and cellulose have moved abroad, while the collapse of Nokia’s handset business knocked the guts out of the local economy. With unemployment officially at more than 17% – almost twice the Finnish average – this once-booming city of 200,000 people has gone from a poster child of prosperity to a symbol of deepening cracks in the Nordic model. “It’s not yet as bad here as Greece, but that’s only a matter of time,” says Seppo, a 43-year-old software engineer who lost job along with 500 others last summer after Microsoft, the new owner of Nokia’s mobile devices and services division, abandoned Oulu. Seppo, who asked that his full name not be used, has since found work, but it is 375 miles (600km) away. Every Sunday night he leaves his family for a rented room. “The public finances are completely screwed, it can’t go on like this,” he says, as he stands outside a polling booth on the outskirts of Oulu, where people are already queuing to vote early in Finland’s general election on Sunday. “The politicians are promising everything to everybody, but they won’t take any hard decisions until we are in a really deep crisis.” Last summer was a low-point for the city, when Microsoft’s exit was swiftly followed by that of Broadcom, a US manufacturer of microchips for phones, taking a further 400 jobs. “That’s when the rest of Finland decided the Oulu miracle is over, the lights have gone out,” says Kyösti Karvonen, editor of the local newspaper, Kaleva. Fewer jobs have meant slimmer wallets. Stockmann, the Finnish Selfridges, announced in February it would close its department store in Oulu. Meanwhile, a new flea market in the city’s indoor athletics arena drew 10,000 shoppers overnight. Youth unemployment here is the highest in the country, says Maire Mäki, head of the city’s employment service, which encourages people to leave Oulu and seek work in Sweden and Norway. A controversial new nuclear power station in nearby Pyhäjoki, to be built by Russia’s Rosatom, will be a vital source of jobs, she adds. Talk among the political parties is about cutting Finland’s way out of recession. The country has been a cheerleader for austerity in Europe; Olli Rehn, the Finnish economics commissioner in Brussels during the eurozone crisis, was accused of imposing a “Rehn of terror” on profligate southern EU states. Now with mounting public debt at home, Finns are bracing themselves for a taste of their own medicine. Wages must not rise for the rest of the decade, early retirement should end and maternity support is too generous, says Juhana Vartiainen, head of the Government Institute for Economic Research in Helsinki and author of a recent review of Finland’s economy. “We have to adapt the Nordic model to a more market model, like Sweden,” says Vartiainen. So concerned is he about the urgency of the problems that last month he quit the Social Democrats to stand as a candidate for the National Coalition party, the centre-right party of the prime minister, Alexander Stubb. Stubb has warned that Finland’s “golden era” is over, and that the country faces a lost decade unless it makes far-reaching changes. But he leads a coalition with the left that has disintegrated over the past year, while failing to push through planned changes to healthcare and local government. Finland is ill-equipped to face up to globalisation, Vartiainen says, while Finns are “extremely conservative and suspicious” of the market reforms he believes are necessary. The population over 65 is set to double during the next two decades; productivity has fallen behind Sweden and Germany, while trade with Russia has slumped owing to EU sanctions over the Ukraine crisis and the falling rouble. Vartiainen caused controversy in October when ihe appeared to compare the unemployed to “weeds” in a tweet. At least Oulu is spared Finland’s problem with ageing. The city is a magnet for young people in the north and has one of the youngest populations in Europe. But when voters gathered at the weekend in the city centre to hear Juha Sipilä, a millionaire businessman whose Centre party is 10 points ahead in the polls, youthful faces were conspicuous by their absence. Ilmari, 34, had only stopped for a free sausage handed out by election workers. He lost his job in construction three months ago, and while his benefits are 60% of his previous wage, it is not enough for his young family – his wife just finished teacher training, but when she went for a job there were 46 applicants. “The overwhelming problem here is jobs for young people,” Ilmari says. “And when they don’t work there are social problems, like drink and drugs.” Spiliä pledges to curb “reckless” public spending and create 200,000 private-sector jobs over the next decade, double the number Finland has lost since 2008. But Amine, 22, is unconvinced – her boyfriend has been out of work for two years. “A change of government won’t make any difference – new faces, same shit,” she says. There is no doubting the potential for a new Oulu to emerge, with its young and skilled workforce. But the hi-tech startups in which the city is putting so much store are still in their infancy. “We lost the game with mobile phones, it was awful,” says Juha Roininen, 40, who left the local steel industry to become a tech entrepreneur. Finns remember the previous economic crisis in the 1990s, he says, so they are wary about the future. “It will take a while for Oulu to bounce back,” he says. “But there is a feeling that we have to do it, there is no other way.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/shortcuts/2014/sep/07/brown-out-britain-new-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-07T16:30:05Z","webTitle":"What exactly is a brown-out – and is Britain going to have them?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2014/sep/07/brown-out-britain-new-technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/shortcuts/2014/sep/07/brown-out-britain-new-technology","fields":{"headline":"What exactly is a brown-out – and is Britain going to have them?","bodyText":"Name: Brown-out. Age: as old as electricity, but rarely seen since the 1970s. What are you talking about? It happens to me all the time. Really? Yeah. It’s like a blackout, but not as severe. Actually, that’s correct. I mean, it’s not like I was so drunk I don’t remember anything about the party; I just need reminding from someone who was there. That’s not quite what we’re talking about. Like that time when I set the curtains on fire, and had a bit of an accident inside my Santa costume, and then when I woke up I was still … I’m going to stop you there – this kind of brown-out has to do with electricity. Are you sure? I don’t recall that night at all. A brown-out is when the National Grid intentionally reduces voltage to ration electricity supplies. Why would it do that? To prevent a blackout. And it could happen this winter, due to predicted power shortages. What are we running short of? Gas? Coal? Oil? Wind? Nuclear power. We’re running out of atoms? No, but four EDF-owned nuclear reactors that were shut down for safety reasons in August are taking longer to repair than expected, and may now stay offline until 2015. One analyst has suggested that, as a result, the chance of a brown-out has jumped from the usual 0.1% to 10%. And what exactly happens during a brown-out? The lights go dim, hence the name. Is that all? Bring it on. That’s not all. Some appliances with motors may respond to the sag in voltage by drawing more current, and could burn out as a result. I don’t understand that, but whatever – I won’t use the blender. In addition, modern digital devices – TV set-top boxes, computers, Wi-Fi routers, etc – may malfunction or sustain damage at lower voltages. So what should I do in the event of a brown-out? Unplug anything invented in the last 20 years. Do say: “Look darling, the lights have dimmed!

Rouhani told his cabinet on Wednesday that the Iranian team would not retreat from the “people’s rights” when it travelled to Vienna to meet with diplomats from six major powers for what many see as a make-or-break moment. “Iran has made its utmost efforts and made the necessary adjustments to its demands and we hope that all the P5+1 countries, particularly the US, which occasionally seeks excessive demands in the nuclear talks, will understand the circumstances,” Rouhani said, according to the state-run Press TV. Since sealing an interim nuclear agreement last year, Iran and the US, France, Germany, China, Russia and Britain – the group known as P5+1 – have held intensive talks aimed at finding a final deal to end the decades-long dispute over Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Both sides have set 24 November as a self-imposed deadline for the talks and despite big differences, they are hoping to reach agreement by then. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, met Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, and the EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton in the Omani capital, Muscat, earlier this week. It was not clear how those talks went and there was no indication of a breakthrough. Rouhani told his ministers that countries looking for excuses to prevent Iran making further nuclear advances would fail to do so. “Our nation will never give up the path of development and its rights,” the Iranian president said, adding that he hoped for an agreement that would benefit Iran and other countries. Iran has been adamant that it would not allow any agreement to prevent it obtaining nuclear technology permitted by the non-proliferation treaty (NPT). But Iran and the west have different interpretations of what type of advances are permitted under the NPT, especially over enrichment capacity. On Tuesday, Russia sealed a deal with Iran to build at least two more nuclear reactors in Bushehr, on the Gulf. This is already home to a Russian-built reactor that is the country’s only nuclear power station. The agreement was signed in Moscow between the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation, Ali Akbar Salehi, and Sergey Kirienko of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation (Rosatom). Salehi described the agreement, which encompasses the construction of six more reactors in the future, as a turning point in relations between Tehran and Moscow. The outcome of the Vienna talks will have direct consequences at home for Rouhani. He owes his victory in last year’s presidential elections to promises of ending the nuclear crisis, which would in turn lead to the gradual lifting of sanctions. Despite the interim agreement, the bulk of the sanctions regime remains intact and Tehran has severe problems selling oil, its primary export. Rouhani said the midterm elections in the US, which gave the Republicans outright control over the Senate, was a domestic issue for the Americans and should not interfere with talks. “It is none of our business that one of the countries of the P5+1 has internal problems and have lost or gain in an election. Countries have to solve their internal problems within themselves.“"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/apr/14/the-climate-deniers-guide-to-getting-rich-from-fossil-fuel-divestment","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-14T10:27:02Z","webTitle":"The climate denier's guide to getting rich from fossil fuel divestment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/14/the-climate-deniers-guide-to-getting-rich-from-fossil-fuel-divestment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/apr/14/the-climate-deniers-guide-to-getting-rich-from-fossil-fuel-divestment","fields":{"headline":"The climate denier's guide to getting rich from fossil fuel divestment","bodyText":"Don’t believe in climate change? Okay, let’s pretend it’s a hoax. From a purely financial perspective it doesn’t matter. If it is a hoax, you’ll make a lot of money. If it’s the real and worsening catastrophe climate scientists believe it to be, you’ll still make a lot of money. Now let me present some facts to you on the financial case for getting out of fossil fuels (I am fine if you just view it as some bar talk). There’s a strong and growing business case for climate protection. The 2014 report “Climate Action and Profitability” by the Carbon Disclosure Project showed how companies that integrate sustainability into their business strategies are outperforming companies who fail to show such leadership. Companies that are managing their carbon emissions and are planning for climate change enjoy 18% higher returns on their investment than companies that aren’t, and 67% higher than companies which refuse to disclose their emissions. Something tells me, though, you are sentimental about your personal ownership in fossil fuels, right? If improving your company’s returns on investment does not interest you, how about the prospect of stranded assets? That’s investments that quickly turn out to be worth much less than expected. In early 2012 Seeking Alpha, an energy industries financial advisory service with more than three million registered clients cautioned against panicking and selling coal stocks, concluding that even though Peabody Coal’s stock value had fallen 45%, it was nicely undervalued, and after all, such companies had always grown: “Currently, Peabody Energy’s share price is at just over $36 (£25), but I think it has the potential to hit the $45 barrier before the end of 2012 because its Australian interests are likely to be snapped up by China and Indian Steel companies”, the advisors wrote. Seems like a strong argument for staying invested in coal, doesn’t it? Unfortunately for Peabody’s investors, their trust in China’s insatiable hunger for coal was ill-advised: A 2015 report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, (IEEFA) noted that although “China’s coal demand grew 10% annually over the decade to 2011, the rate of growth halved to 4-6% in 2012 and 2013. In 2014, China’s coal demand has actually declined by 2.1% year-on-year.” I know these are a lot of numbers for a simple bar talk. And, usually, the China argument doesn’t even come up before the third drink when everyone feels they can win any fight just by quoting a big number. But the changing reality in China might make you want to wait with that second sip. “While real economic growth exceeded 7%, electricity demand grew by less than 4%”, the IEEFA study said. Rapid supply diversification saw China’s coal consumption decline 2% and coal imports fall by 11% in 2014. China’s coal demand will permanently peak by 2016 and decline thereafter, the report predicts. “Coal companies’ underperformance against the global equity market is unprecedented,” said IEEFA’s Tim Buckley. “A more than 50% decline in coal prices has seen most listed coal companies globally lose 80-90% of their equity market value in the last four years. While the sun will undoubtedly rise for renewable energy in 2015, for coal, there remains a lot further to fall.” Today Peabody Energy, the world’s largest private-sector coal company, is trading below $5 per share. Investors betting that coal will rebound are very likely to find their assets stranded. Conversely, renewable industries are prospering. A recent study by Agora Energiewende, a German think-tank, found that solar electricity is already a low-cost renewable energy technology. Large-scale photovoltaic installations in Germany fell from over 40 cents per kilowatt-hour (c/kWh) in 2005 to 9 c/kWh in 2014. Even lower prices have been reported in sunnier regions of the world. Most interesting for investors, solar will soon be the cheapest form of electricity in many regions of the world. Even conservative scenarios which assumed no dramatic technological breakthroughs saw no end to cost reduction, with costs of 4-6 c/kWh expected by 2025, and 2-4 c/kWh by 2050. Deutsche Bank analyst, Vishal Shah, agrees, predicting that rooftop solar will be the cheapest electricity option for everyone in the US by 2016. This builds on the Energy Darwinism report from Citi Group which forecast unsubsidised renewables to become cheaper than gas within 10 years. New developments, such as solar cloth, a lightweight solar fabric stretched across parking lots and rooftops, could make solar ubiquitous and cheap. Sometimes, change happens very fast. Within just one year, California went from utility-scale solar installations supplying 1.9% of its electricity to 5% in 2014. The German study mentioned above warned, “Most scenarios underestimate the role of solar power in future energy systems.” Sure, bottom feeders will swoop in and grab any fossil stocks you sell – at least you hope they will. Otherwise any delay in selling your fossil holdings may leave you in a market with no buyers. And, of course, people will continue to burn gasoline in their cars for many years to come. California, a state which is already facing severe consequences of climate change, has committed to cut oil use in cars by half by 2030 and Stanford professor Mark Jacobson’s Solutions Project shows how energy efficiency and renewables can meet all of the energy needs of the entire world better and cheaper than any coal or nuclear power by as early as 2035. Does your denial of climate change really justify holding on to those fossil stocks in your portfolio? Consider that the Fossil Free Indexes US (FFIUS ), a stock market index excluding top fossil fuel companies outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 1.5% last year. The FFIUS is almost identical to the S&amp;P 500, but excludes shares in the world’s largest coal, oil, and gas companies, including Peabody Energy, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips. The Fossil Free Indexes report concluded: “With oil prices performing wildly and leading analysts warning that fossil fuel companies are a risky long-term investment, the market-based argument for fossil free investing is sound.” At least this little fact should be a happy conversation piece at any bar in the world, wouldn’t you agree? But in the end, it shouldn’t really matter whether you are a climate change denier or are spending your life proving just how scary the increasing extremes of weather are, how the California drought indeed is being caused by the changing climate, and just how little time we have left to act. This isn’t just about polar bears or disappearing islands, but about humanity. Let’s go make money, create jobs, enhance our security and resilience, let’s enable communities around the world to prosper and our children to grasp a finer future. We can still argue over drinks at the pub whether there would have been a mess if we hadn’t acted, when we’re done."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/nov/12/slump-oil-prices-fall-investment-shortages-iea","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-12T18:15:18Z","webTitle":"Slump in oil prices could mean fall in investment and future shortages – IEA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/12/slump-oil-prices-fall-investment-shortages-iea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/nov/12/slump-oil-prices-fall-investment-shortages-iea","fields":{"headline":"Slump in oil prices could mean fall in investment and future shortages – IEA","bodyText":"The International Energy Agency has warned that the current slump in oil prices will hold back investment and could create shortages in the future as overall energy demand is forecast to grow by 37% in the next 25 years. But at the same time, the organisation, which was set up in the aftermath of previous price shocks, said that while more drilling was needed, it was still important that governments wound down the world’s $550bn (£346bn) of annual fossil fuel subsidies and switched support to renewable power. The IEA said oil and gas would play a continuing role as demand continued to rise, but that politicians should not shirk the need to tackle climate change, as the current trajectory of carbon use would leave humanity facing “a very different” world. “Today’s price level may offer some comfort to consumers but it will not last very long,” said Fatih Birol, IEA chief economist. “A well-supplied oil market in the short term should not disguise the challenges that lie ahead, as the world is set to rely more heavily on a relatively small number of producing countries.” Birol, speaking at the IEA’s annual World Energy Outlook, said there were already signs of a 10% cut in US spending by oil companies as a result of the slump in oil prices there to $80 per barrel. This came at a time when investment in other key future crude producers such as Iraq was close to zero. American shale oil and gas had transformed the market but post-2020 the world would increasingly find itself relying on Canada, Brazil and the politically volatile Middle East for world oil supplies, he said. Birol said countries such as Russia, China and India needed to wind down their consumer-price subsidies for fossil fuels, which deterred renewable power investment, squandered valuable energy resources and gave their citizens “all the wrong messages.” The IEA estimates that wind, solar and other renewable technologies received subsidies of $121bn last year and this figure would rise to $230bn by 2030 before falling back to $205bn in 2040. The organisation hailed the performance of renewables as “incredible” and expected it to provide half of global electricity generation by 2040, with the bulk of the advances being made in China. “As our global energy system grows and transforms, signs of stress continue to emerge,” said Maria van der Hoeven, the IEA’s executive director. “But renewables are expected to go from strength to strength, and it is incredible that we can now see a point where they become the world’s number one source of electricity generation.” The IEA also gave its support to the development of new nuclear power projects, but said it was vital that governments found a permanent solution to dealing with high level radioactive waste. A separate report warned that uncertainty in the UK over subsidies for offshore windfarms had forced the industry to shelve a series of new projects. The study by the independent thinktank Green Alliance, titled UK Offshore Wind in the 2020s, argued that without a long-term commitment, the industry would be unable to achieve the economies of scale needed to bring down costs. Energy secretary Ed Davey said this week that onshore wind power was already suffering after communities secretary Eric Pickles called in 50 planning applications. Davey said the Tory minister was undermining investor confidence in an industry that employs more than 15,000 workers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2015/dec/17/the-walking-dead-the-perfect-allegory-for-western-fear","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-17T15:30:13Z","webTitle":"Fences, eco-panic and devastation: The Walking Dead was the most topical show of the year​","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/17/the-walking-dead-the-perfect-allegory-for-western-fear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/17/the-walking-dead-the-perfect-allegory-for-western-fear","fields":{"headline":"Fences, eco-panic and devastation: The Walking Dead was the most topical show of the year​","bodyText":"Whatever humans do, the zombies just keep coming. Slowly, true, but implacably. In the opening episode of the sixth season of The Walking Dead, the humans are strengthening a security fence around the Alexandria free zone, somewhere in Virginia, to keep out a new horde of the undead and ensure that their semblance of civilisation is not overrun by the barbarian other. It is hard not to be struck by real-world parallels: Donald Trump or Nigel Farage’s foreign policy platforms, the fence between Hungary to keep Syrian refugees out, the breached fences at the Eurotunnel terminal near Calais, or fears this year among British villagers near Heathrow of being overwhelmed by asylum seekers. That oxymoron, western civilisation, is more terrified of the other than ever. No wonder the zombie genre is in rude health: its appeal, in part, is because it is an allegory for western fear of a world collapsing into terror, anarchy and savagery. Ever since our hero, Georgia cop Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), awoke in hospital five seasons ago in 2010 to realise he was living in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse, The Walking Dead has teemed with uncomfortable political and environmental resonances. The refugee crisis, resentment over immigration, beheadings by Isis, Islamophobia, distrust of government, the ruination of our planet – all have their parallels, for anyone with the wit to watch the show as more than horror thriller. But The Walking Dead has never been more topical than in this new season. As Grimes, the cop-turned-leader of an embattled group of human survivors, struggles to repel the latest horde of zombies, the drama parallels how the western world yearns to pull up the drawbridge to keep the undesirables out. US presidential hopeful Trump, for instance, said in a speech earlier this year: “I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.” No matter that a US Government Accountability Office report in 2009 estimated that the cost of building one mile of fencing along the 1,933-mile long US-Mexican border averaged between $2.8m and $3.9m (you do the math, or as we say over here, maths). But 2015’s fetish for fences, and the fear of the other that their construction demonstrates, are not new. They are structural features of life in modern western societies. In this, zombie dramas are allegories of human ruthlessness under capitalism; Europe is a fortress to keep out the other, as is the US, and also the Alexandria free zone in The Walking Dead. In his 2005 book, Im Weltinnenraum des Kapitals (In the World Interior of Capital), the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk argued that capitalism functions, in part, by creating exclusive spaces – be they gated estates, malls with security guards, or fortress Europe – to keep out the undesirable and unmoneyed, those who look different and don’t speak the local language. He didn’t mention zombies, but he could have done. The blueprint for capitalism’s ruthless exclusion of the other was, Sloterdijk argued, Joseph Paxton’s Crystal Palace, built to house London’s Great Exhibition of 1851 “that invoked the idea of an enclosure so spacious that one might never have to leave it”. Inside the latter, the world’s most diverting flora, fauna and industrial products were displayed in climate-controlled, obligingly sanitary conditions under one roof, thus precluding the necessity for travel, while whatever remained outside (war, genocide, slavery, unpleasant tropical diseases) dwindled into irrelevance. In that respect, Crystal Palace was the blueprint for how capitalism has functioned since. “Who can deny,” Sloterdijk writes, “that in its primary aspects, the western world – especially the European Union – embodies such a great interior today?” The only problem is, as The Walking Dead tells us, that it is very difficult to keep the undesirables from getting in, from ruining what we hold dear and gnawing on our very vitals. Truly, The Walking Dead tells us, we are just one bite away from becoming zombies ourselves, from dying and being reanimated as the undesirable other, from losing our humanity and becoming a pest that needs and deserves to be stabbed to death for the good of civilisation. In seasons two and three of The Walking Dead, the human survivors, led by Grimes, hole up in a former prison. The irony of the situation is hardly lost on the new inmates: to be free from the undead threat, the humans need to lock themselves up in a jail. In the bowels of the prison they find a bunch of prisoners who have been locked up for months and so are unaware that the zombie apocalypse has taken place in the wider world. “There’s no government, no hospitals, no police. It’s all gone,” Grimes explains to the disbelieving inmates. “No phones, no computers. As far as we can see, at least half the population has been wiped out.” Grimes’ hope is that he and his band of human survivors can establish a secure home in this prison, ring-fenced from a world that has reverted to the war of all against all, a state of nature in which there are, as Thomas Hobbes put it, “no arts, no letters, no society, and which is, worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death, and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short”. Plus zombies. But then more zombies invade the prison, driving Grimes and his gang from their fortress and on into their seemingly hopeless quest to find a safe haven from the undesirables. Their drama, for western viewers worried about their own security in the face of terror threats and immigration, is compellingly resonant. One of the things that makes The Walking Dead poignant is that the ring-fenced interior of the capital has fallen apart: there is, as Bob Dylan put it, no direction home. In it, the west’s worst nightmare is realised – that we have been driven from our comfortable homes, forced to fend for ourselves using survivalist skills that we would have learned if we had paid closer attention to Bear Grylls. Your Facebook friends and Twitter followers won’t help you now. It’s time to neglect personal daintiness and cover yourself with zombie blood if you are to survive the zombie end times. This is one reason why the US series has been so popular, and why there is a Walking Dead computer game, a post-episode microanalysis called Talking Dead, dozens of live blogging sites and, my personal favourite, a site called Interrogating the Ideology with a Chainsaw, which explores the philosophical lessons of the series. The zombie genre is one of the most fruitful of horror narratives because in it, each of us is one bite away from becoming the other. Time and again in The Walking Dead, a human will be bitten by a zombie and then one of their family will have to kill them as they reanimate. In season one, shockingly, Andrea sat in vigil overnight beside her zombie-bitten sister and, when the latter awoke, stabbed her in the head. In this, again, the drama has horribly poignant resonances for the nature of capitalism in an age in which social exclusion is common, in which compassion is a luxury and humans risk becoming dehumanised creatures that are either useful or expendable. It’s resonant because we fear that our human relations could be similarly destroyed; worse, that we might become dehumanised things even to those we love. The world, too, has become a thing that we destroy in The Walking Dead. In the very first episode, Grimes saddled up and rode a horse along the freeway into Atlanta. On the opposite carriageway were miles of cars abandoned during the zombie apocalypse, and the city itself was a ruin ruled by the undead. Recently, when Polish photographer Arkadiusz Podniesinski was given a permit to enter the 20km exclusion zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station that suffered a tsunami-triggered triple meltdown in 2011, he recorded a similar landscape: abandoned cars, playgrounds turning to rust and ruin, a human world despoiled and apocalyptic. “Post-apocalyptic photos of Fukushima look like scenes from Walking Dead,” was the inevitable headline. Perhaps most resonantly, The Walking Dead works as an unremitting critique of the effeteness of life within the capitalist interior. It asks its too-comfortable viewers the difficult existential questions: would you survive in a post-apocalyptic scenario without broadband, dental floss and artisanal cheeses? When all the canned foods have been looted from the grocery stores, would you have the right stuff to carry on and rebuild society? Or would you envy the dead and do what is necessary to join them? In exploring such questions, The Walking Dead is akin to many post-apocalyptic horror dramas such as Danny Boyle’s 2001 film, 28 Days Later, the 2008 BBC series Survivors, or John Wyndham’s 1955 novel, The Chrysalids, about a post-nuclear apocalypse society. Each takes us out of our comfort zones and into uncomfortable ones. It’s striking, for instance, that in The Chrysalids, the survivors live in a society reminiscent of the American frontier during the 18th century, with the technological status echoing the Amish. In The Walking Dead, that frontier spirit is a useful virtue to have. In this allegorical world, too, democracy is expendable. Grimes and the Governor (the one-eyed dictator played by David Morrissey who leads a rival group of human survivors) both rule through brutal dictatorial power, manufacturing consent by force of will and arms. One of The Walking Dead’s most difficult resonances is that it expresses a very American distrust of government and the sense that, in extremis, democracy gets in the way of a well-ordered society. It is also unremittingly violent and that too has real-world resonances. Stabbing zombies through the eyes, just like offing vampires with a stake through the heart, expresses our desire to terminate the other with extreme prejudice and no consequences. Ukip’s election manifesto just didn’t have the courage to express its supporters’ repressed desires. The zombie genre gives us a safe fictional space to explore our fears and our furies. The anthropologist and Zucotti Park activist David Graeber once told me that the threat of violence underpins society: it’s there, we just don’t see it. In zombie dramas such as The Walking Dead, scarcely a scene goes by without a zombie being stabbed in the eye, having its cranium sliced in two with an axe or being shot in the face with a crossbow. Consider, for instance, my favourite character, Michonne. Before the apocalypse, she was a lawyer. Now, in the eschatological age, she’s a terrifying warrior, fast-handed with her katana, a long sword used by Japanese samurai. With her sword and perma-glower, she looks like an online avatar on to which one projects one’s fantasies. Maybe mutating from bloodsucking lawyer to bloodletting zombie killer wasn’t much of a career change. But what’s striking is that she uses a katana rather than a gun to kill her prey. Although there are enough discharged firearms in The Walking Dead to keep the National Rifle Association drooling, the favoured weapons against the undead are axes, knives, swords and crossbows. Why? Because shooting a zombie is so noisy that it risks attracting more zombies, and because to kill a zombie you have to stick something – blade, axe, sharp stick – in its brain. That kind of termination is better done up close and personal. As a result, killing becomes an intimate activity. Michonne’s drama is painfully resonant for us, posing difficult questions for effete westerners: what would you do to survive? Would you kill your nearest and dearest? Would you keep them alive even if they were zombies? Would you turn your loved ones into pets to help you survive? The Walking Dead thereby gives us an allegory of what capitalism does to human beings – it dehumanises us, reduces us to mere things that can be used. At the end of the premiere of the last season, Grimes and his gang of survivors have strengthened the perimeter fence around the Alexandria free zone, but realise they need to do more if they are to survive the looming zombie assault. Thousands of zombies have escaped from a quarry where they had been milling aimlessly for ages (it must be great fun to be one of the many zombie extras in The Walking Dead, although, ultimately, all that slow walking, growling and biting must get a bit samey for those with ambitions to win Emmys) and are now mincing – is mincing the right word? – towards the free zone. What can the humans do? Grimes realises that the zombies can be lured away from Alexandria if humans offer themselves up as bait. Grimes enlists Daryl Dixon (played by Norman Reedus) to drive very slowly on his motorbike in front of a column of zombies. As they slowly follow him and other humans down the blacktop, Dixon looks like the Pied Piper of Hamlyn on a Harley. The zombies are tempted away from the free zone by the scent of human flesh, and the hope is he and other humans will steer them 20 miles away, thus ending the zombie threat to the Alexandria free zone. Perhaps the humans can finally live free from the other. But at the very end of the episode, this cunning plan goes disastrously wrong. From within the free zone, someone sounds a horn. The zombie hordes, en masse, turn towards the noise and start shambling towards it. They are moving, slowly, implacably, towards the human settlement where, quite possibly, they will break through the fences and feast on the human flesh within. The credits roll, leaving us on a cliffhanger with lots of questions – will the zombies get in? Who sounded the horn? And why? The enemy, it seems, is within. This has long been a staple of the horror genre. You lock the doors, bolt the windows, sharpen the razor wire and find you’ve locked the evil inside. Again, this has uncomfortable political resonances. Domestic Islamophobia is often premised on the fear that British values are being corrupted from inside and that British resolve against a hostile other is impaired by the enemy within. The resentment for Mexican immigrants that Trump clearly hopes to capitalise on for his presidential bid involves fears of similar corruption. So far, we haven’t considered the zombies’ perspective. What do they want? Not much. Just to chew, if not ingest, human flesh. In order to have that, they need at least some of us humans to survive. That is the only good news that one might take from The Walking Dead. If the zombies are our enemies, then at least they don’t want to kill us all off. The same, it’s worth pointing out, is not true of golfers. In the otherwise depressing post-apocalyptic scenario explored in The Walking Dead, I find that thought a consolation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/sep/04/fukushima-farce-nuclear-industry-flaw","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-04T09:45:14Z","webTitle":"Fukushima farce reveals nuclear industry's fatal flaw | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/sep/04/fukushima-farce-nuclear-industry-flaw","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/sep/04/fukushima-farce-nuclear-industry-flaw","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima farce reveals nuclear industry's fatal flaw","bodyText":"Once upon a time, when the nuclear industry was shiny and new, it simply burned uranium. Now, old and tarnished, it burns money. From the promise of nuclear electricity being too cheap to meter, we now have costs that are too great to count. At the site of the Fukushima meltdown in Japan, the government is being forced to spend over £200m on a fanciful-sounding underground ice wall in the latest desperate attempt to halt the radiation-contaminated water that is leaking into the sea. When mere stopgaps cost this much, it is clear any real solution will cost the earth. Japanese taxpayers have already had to bail out the operator Tepco to the tune of £6.5bn. The final clean up will cost tens of billions and take 40 years. Yet supporters maintain that nuclear power offers affordable low-carbon electricity and is a vital tool in the fight to curb climate change. The UK government, already spending most of its energy budget on nuclear clean up, has crashed through deadline after deadline in a fruitless search to find anybody willing to build new nuclear power stations at reasonable cost. The only serious players left in the game are those backed by the French, Chinese and Russian states, whose interest in power is as much political as electrical. Commercial companies have fled the scene. The fundamental reason why the price of nuclear power climbs each day as surely as the rising sun is a straightforward one. Keeping a lid on costs is impossible if the task in hand is keeping the lid on an exploding atomic bomb. For that is what a nuclear reactor is, a slow motion detonation. That intrinsic danger means that as each new risk to reactors is discovered, more and more expensive measures need to be put in place as mitigation. When accidents happen, as they will over a half century or more of operation, the intrinsic risk of radioactive materials means more money is piled on the bonfire to ensure the risk to the public is limited. The answer from the nuclear industry to all these criticisms is always the same: it will be different next time. But the rolling farce in Fukushima proves yet again the opposite. The only reliability the industry can offer is consistently breaking promises and busting budgets. Today, it was revealed that radiation levels by the tanks of contaminated cooling water at Fukushima are 2,200 millisieverts an hour - a level that could kill an unprotected person in hours – and 22 times higher than previously thought. Why were previous measurements so useless? Because, Tepco belatedly admitted, they were taken using equipment that could not record radiation levels above 100 millisieverts an hour. When you remember that this crass disregard for safety is occurring in one the most technologically advanced democracies in the world, the prospect of reactors proliferating around the world is alarming. But perhaps this time it really can be different. Just two of Japan's 50 working nuclear reactors are currently in operation and both are expected to be offline for maintenance by 15 September. That will leaving Japan without nuclear energy for only the second time in almost half a century. The UK government may at some point have to admit defeat in its attempts to start a nuclear renaissance. As the false nuclear dawn fades, a new brighter horizon may be revealed, where the intrinsically safe and therefore ultimately cheaper technologies of energy efficiency and renewable energy can used to build a power system fit for the 21st century, not one harking back to the 20th."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/nov/07/uganda-gay-rights-activist-stonewall-lgbt-hero-of-the-year","type":"article","sectionId":"working-in-development","sectionName":"Working in development","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-07T18:46:25Z","webTitle":"World in a week: Ugandan gay rights activist named hero of the year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/nov/07/uganda-gay-rights-activist-stonewall-lgbt-hero-of-the-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/nov/07/uganda-gay-rights-activist-stonewall-lgbt-hero-of-the-year","fields":{"headline":"World in a week: Ugandan gay rights activist named hero of the year","bodyText":"Good week Pepe Julian Onziema, a Ugandan gay rights activist, who has been recognised as Stonewall’s hero of the year.

Boris Johnson is the new foreign secretary, David Davis is the Brexit minister and Liam Fox’s career has seen a remarkable revival with his appointment as international trade secretary. May has not been reluctant to remove big beasts from their jobs. Michael Gove was sacked, as were George Osborne, Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan, among others. She also gave jobs to her former leadership rival Andrea Leadsom and one of her earliest backers Chris Grayling. There was speculation that May would appoint more women and, while the numbers are more representative than under David Cameron, they are still disproportionate. The same goes for the ratio of state to privately educated cabinet ministers. This live blog is now closing but you can read the list of appointments as we have it. We are not expecting any further ministerial appointments this evening but it is worth reading Joan Smith’s article on Theresa May’s cabinet selections so far. While she has promoted women, Smith writes, May is a Tory first and a feminist second. We have a final ministerial appointment of the day. Ben Gummer, formerly a junior health minister (and the son of Thatcher and Major era cabinet member John Gummer) is now minister for the Cabinet Office, Downing Street has announced. “There will be no further ministerial appointments this evening,” the statement adds. There are, of course, a whole series of junior posts still to fill or shuffle. Theresa May’s official spokeswoman said today’s appointments revealed a “bold” cabinet, and “what we’re seeing is the commitment of the prime minister to putting social reform at the heart of her government.” Barack Obama has already called May to congratulate her, the spokeswoman also revealed. The pair spoke for 15 minutes, during which they discussed security cooperation, and she “underlined the point that the decision to leave the European Union means that”. It remains unclear whether May actually used what has already become her catchphrase: “Brexit means Brexit”. With Labour’s leadership so far silent on the ministerial changes, the SNP’s Westminster Leader, Angus Robertson, has called it “one of the most right-wing cabinets in the modern era”. He said in a statement: From Boris Johnson as our foreign secretary – a man who will now be representing us on the world stage – to David Davis as Brexit minister and Liam Fox for trade, it will be Brexiteers who are taking forward UK foreign policy. We also have Jeremy Hunt being re-appointed as health secretary, despite the ongoing disputes with junior doctors, and Priti Patel as minister for international sevelopment, despite previously calling for the department to be abolished. The news that the department for energy and climate change is being merged with business, innovation and skills, is also particularly worrying given the current challenges facing the energy sector. Green campaigners were divided over the likely impact of the abolition of the department of energy and climate change, with some saying that folding its responsibilities into the new department for business, energy and industrial strategy would downgrade the importance of climate change and take ministerial attention away from the issue for the next parliament. Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth, said he was “shocked” by the move. “Less than a day into the job and it appears that the new prime minister has already downgraded action to tackle climate change, one of the biggest threats we face. This week the government’s own advisors warned of ever growing risks to our businesses, homes and food if we don’t do more to cut fossil fuel pollution. “If Theresa May supports strong action on climate change, as she’s previously said, it’s essential that this is made a top priority for the new business and energy department and across government.” But WWF struck a more conciliatory note. “The new department for business, energy, and industrial strategy can be a real powerhouse for change, joining up Whitehall teams to progress the resilient, sustainable, and low carbon infrastructure that we urgently need,” said David Nussbaum, chief executive of WWF-UK. “Climate change must be hard-wired into the new department of business, energy and industrial strategy and our economy need climate change to be at its very heart.” However, critics were concerned that the loss of the term climate change in the new department’s title was a signal of the lack of importance the new cabinet and prime minister placed on the issue. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, said: “Although, some might say, ‘What’s in a name?’ there is a very real worry that the progress made on tackling climate change could be relegated to the bottom of the in tray. Business, energy and industrial strategy must have green innovation and job creation at its heart.” This is Peter Walker, taking over from Andrew for a bit. My colleague Rowena Mason has made this tally of the gender split of the cabinet as it appears so far. She also calculates that five of 23 cabinet ministers were privately educated, fewer than in David Cameron’s cabinet, but still a proportion three times above the 7% figure for the country as a whole. Theresa May has virtually finished appointing her first cabinet. As I write, the full list has not yet been published, but all the key appointments are known. See here. The reshuffle has gone much further than expected. I was going to write a “what we’ve learnt” analysis, but it is hard to improve on the eight points identified by Robert Peston. (See 4.46pm.) The last 24 hours have revealed aspects of May’s character that were perhaps under-appreciated. She has proved more ruthless than people expected, sacking senior figures who are well regarded by some Tories, like George Osborne and Michael Gove, without compunction. And she has shown more willingness to take risks than people would have predicted, appointing Boris Johnson to the Foreign Office, but also putting some very inexperienced people (like Gavin Williamson and Natalie Evans) into senior roles. The new cabinet looks less public school and more meritocratic than the last one. It also looks more rightwing, although that may be a consequence of the need to appoint Brexiteers, and the overlap that seems to exist between strong Euroscepticism and low tax, low regulation Toryism. That’s all from me. My colleague Peter Walker is taking over now. David Lidington has become leader of the Commons and lord president of the council, Number 10 has announced. He was Europe minister. David Gauke, who was financial secretary to the Treasury, has been made chief secretary to the Treasury, Sky reports. David Mundell is staying as Scottish secretary, Number 10 has confirmed. Mark Harper, who until today was chief whip, has announced he is leaving the government. Robert Peston’s “eight things we’ve learned about Theresa May in the last 48 hours” take on the reshuffle is very good. The French president, François Hollande, has repeated his call for Theresa May to begin Britain’s exit from the European Union as fast as possible. “The sooner Mrs May actions Britain’s exit from the EU, the better the future relationship between the EU and the UK will be,” he said in his traditional Bastille Day TV appearance. Hollande added that he had told May by phone, “with all the necessary courtesy” that Britain must act fast to end the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, saying he didn’t want it to have consequences for the fragile French economy. But Hollande was firm on the terms of negotiation: “We have to be clear. The UK cannot have outside [the EU] what it had inside.” Hollande declined to comment on the appointment of Boris Johnson as foreign secretary, but the French foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault warned earlier today that Johnson had “told a lot of lies to the British people”. Here is more on what Andrea Leadsom, the new environment secretary, thinks about farming subsidies. This is what she said in a Guardian debate on the EU referendum in March. Net we send £9bn a year to the EU, gross it’s £19bn; the remainder we get back in subsidies are things we have to beg for, things we have to co-finance, pet projects of the EU so farmers - yes, they are supplicants asking for roughly 50% back of the money that they paid over in the first place. On voting to leave the EU, the UK government will absolutely continue in the short term to provide those subsidies whilst we think about what makes sense. And some of the things that would make sense would be environmental trading credits, because at the moment you have farmers who have to do a bit of environmental planning and a bit of farming just to meet the EU requirements. It would make so much more sense if those with the big fields do the sheep, and those with the hill farms do the butterflies. That would make a lot more sense for the UK and it’s perfectly possible but only if we leave the EU and sort it out for ourselves. Andrea Leadsom has been handed a hospital pass with the role of environment secretary, and not just because it is viewed as one of the less prestigious jobs in the cabinet. Farmers today get £2.4-3bn a year from the EU in subsidies – the amount varies on exchange rates – through the common agricultural policy (CAP). Whatever British agricultural policy (BAP?) comes next – and the National Farmers Union is already canvassing views on which this should look like – Leadsom will have the thankless task of lobbying the Treasury to replace those subsidies. They’re essential to prop up farmers, as the CAP payments made up 55% of an average farmers’ income of around £20,000 in 2014. Controversially, and perhaps worryingly for farmers, Leadsom also appears to have argued in the past for the end of farming subsidies. “Subsidies must be abolished,” she wrote in a 2007 article on how to rejuvenate British farming. The former energy minister also faces a fight in the courts in October, with a date set for a case brought by environment lawyers ClientEarth who think her department’s plans to clean-up illegal levels of air pollution are inadequate. From today Priti Patel is in charge of the Department for International Development. But three years ago she suggested it should be abolished. She told the Sunday Telegraph: A long-term strategic assessment is required, including the consideration to replace DfID with a Department for International Trade and Development in order to enable the UK to focus on enhancing trade with the developing world and seek out new investment opportunities in the global race. It is possible to bring more prosperity to the developing world and enable greater wealth transfers to be made from the UK by fostering greater trade and private sector investment opportunities. Damian Green inherits not just the UK’s biggest spending department but one of its most politically volatile. Planned social security cuts triggered two government crises in recent months: defeat for the chancellor George Osborne last autumn over tax credit reductions, and the abandonment in March of plans to cut £1.2bn a year cuts from disability benefits, following the resignation of the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith. Any political breathing space gained from those U-turns will be short-lived. The brief reign of Stephen Crabb - who hinted at a more humane, conciliatory, consultative approach after the harshness of the IDS years - brought a promise from the Treasury that there would be no fresh welfare cuts in this parliament. But billions of cuts remain in place, including the “two child” limit on tax credits, £30 a week cuts to benefits for some people in receipt of unemployment benefit after being found unfit for work, limits to housing benefit, and the extended household benefit cap. The prime minister, Theresa May, has made much of her concern for the plight of help low income families hit by rising living costs and flatlining incomes. Yet cuts last year to universal credit work allowances have stored up another tax-credits-style revolt towards the end of the decade as millions of working households begin to lose up to £3,000 a year as they migrate to the new benefit. Green must balance the need to keep a lid on the UK’s soaring welfare bill with managing middle-England’s increasing realisation that it is not just the jobless and feckless who lose out from welfare reform. The last Conservative election manifesto had an eye-catching commitment to get a million disabled people into jobs as part of its strategy to achieve full employment and reduce welfare spending. Duncan- Smith had prepared a disability employment white paper, but this was paused by Crabb, who instead hinted a green paper by the autumn. Green must decide whether this remains a priority, or whether to scale down the government’s ambition. Here is the up-to-date list of today’s cabinet appointments. It includes vacancies, and sackings/resignations. You may need to refresh the page to get it updated. We still don’t know who the leader of the Commons will be. Or the chief secretary to the Treasury. And it is not clear whether David Mundell remains as Scottish secretary, although that seems likely given the fact that Mundell is the only Conservative MP with a Scottish seat. Alan Cairns will remain as Welsh secretary, Number 10 has announced. Karen Bradley has been appointed culture secretary, Number 10 has announced. She was a Home Office minister. Priti Patel has become international development secretary, Number 10 has announced. She was employment minister. Greg Clark has been appointed business secretary. He was communities secretary. But he is not just business secretary, as the Number 10 announcement makes clear. The Queen has been pleased to approve the appointment of Rt Hon Greg Clark as Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. That suggests that the Department for Energy and Climate Change is being merged with the Department for Business (which had lost responsibility for higher education - see 2.27pm.) Clark is also secretary of state for “industrial strategy”. That’s a title that would gladden the heart of Tony Benn, but, as Theresa May made clear in her speech on Monday, she is a strong believer in the need for an industrial strategy. James Brokenshire has been appointed Northern Ireland secretary, Number 10 has announced. He was immigration minister. Like Damian Green, Brokenshire is someone who worked with Theresa May at the Home Office and who is considered a loyal ally. Jeremy Hunt will have to show “exceptional political leadership” as he confronts some very big problems in the NHS now that he is staying at the Department of Health, the King’s Fund says. Given the service’s deepening financial crisis, the NHS’s need for more money – beyond the extra £8bn already promised by 2020 – is, inevitably, top of that list, according to the influential thinktank. “Jeremy Hunt faces some formidable challenges. He is on record as saying the NHS will need more money and he must now lead an honest debate with the public about what the health service can deliver with its budget. This means reviewing current priorities and avoiding making new commitments which cannot be funded,” said Professor Chris Ham, the King’s Fund’s chief executive. “Tackling the growing crisis in social care will be a key test of the prime minister’s promise of a country that works for everyone and must move much higher up his agenda. He must reignite the stalled debate on funding reform and make the case to his cabinet colleagues for it to be a key priority for the government,” he aded. That is certainly something Simon Stevens, the boss of the NHS in England, wants to see a new consensus on by 2018, as he outlined in an interview with the Guardian back in January. But the politics of funding a new system are highly complicated. Priti Patel, the employment minister, is in Number 10. Number 10 has confirmed that Sajid Javid is the new communities secretary. Sajid Javid has been made the new communities secretary, the BBC reports. That means there is a vacancy at business. Here is some Twitter comment on Andrea Leadsom’s appointment. From ITV’s Robert Peston From the New Statesman’s George Eaton From the BBC’s Daniel Sandford Andrea Leadsom, who was an energy minister, has been made environment secretary, the BBC reports. That means Leadsom, a leading Vote Leave campaigner, will be responsible for dealing with farmers, the group that has most to lose in terms of subsidies from Brexit. (Vote Leave claimed farmers would not lose out, because the UK government would be able to carry on paying subsidies, but Leadsom herself suggested during the campaign that the way farming subsidies are paid out could be reviewed.) Damian Green has been made work and pensions secretary, No 10 has announced. It seems Nicky Morgan didn’t expect to be sacked as education secretary, having told colleagues as recently as yesterday that she was staying on. But now she has gone, possibly because of nominating Michael Gove for the Conservative party leadership. Her successor Justine Greening inherits a bigger department after the addition of higher education and skills moving from BIS to the DfE. Some argue schools and universities make uneasy bedfellows, and will inevitably lead to budget battles. But the advent of the £9,000 tuition fee has changed the funding dynamic, and it is universities who now fear being raided by their less-well-off primary and secondary colleagues. Greening needs urgently to get to grips with her brief, as the new higher education reform bill has its second reading in parliament on Tuesday. Greening doesn’t have an education policy background, although she does make history as the first secretary of state to be educated at a comprehensive school. Morgan’s departure means her “education excellence everywhere” white paper dies a death. Top of Greening’s in-tray will be picking up the pieces from that, as well as dealing with increased teacher shortages, both in training new teachers and getting them to the areas where they are most needed. Of Greening’s junior ministers, the fate of Nick Gibb and (Lord) John Nash – schools ministers who were keepers of the Gove flame during Morgan’s term – will be of immediate interest. UPDATE: Laura McInerney at Schools Week has written a good article looking in more detail at the educational background of previous education secretaries. No 10 has confirmed that Chris Grayling has been appointed transport secretary. Andrea Leadsom, Theresa May’s rival for the Tory leadership until she withdrew on Monday, has just gone into Downing Street. Chris Grayling has just left No 10. He was leader of the Commons when he went in. Now he is transport secretary, according to Sky. Here is a read-out of Boris Johnson’s first phone call with his US counterpart, John Kerry. Kerry advised Johnson to adopt a “sensible” approach to Brexit. Sky’s Beth Rigby thinks Damian Green could be going to culture. There has been a mixed reaction to the departure of Theresa Villiers from the post of Northern Ireland secretary in Theresa May’s first cabinet. The first minister, Arlene Foster, paid tribute to Villiers, saying she enjoyed working with her and wished her the best for the future. Like the outgoing secretary of state, Foster shared Villiers’ Euroscepticism and also called for a Brexit vote in the EU referendum. But the Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson said Villers’ cabinet exit “will be no loss”. Anderson added: “All British secretary of states should stay over there.” In a statement released on her Facebook page announcing her resignation from the cabinet, Villiers stated that Northern Ireland would still have “a special place in my heart”. Damian Green, a former Home Office minister and a strong support of Theresa May during the leadership contest, has arrived at No 10. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has described as “deeply disappointing” comments made by the new chancellor, Philip Hammond, saying that he cannot envisage a scenario where Scotland has a different relationship with the EU from the rest of the UK. Speaking on BBC Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme earlier on Thursday, Hammond insisted that “the best future for Scotland is inside the United Kingdom economy”, and that Scotland should be part of a UK-wide position of negotiating “from outside the European Union”. He also dismissed the idea that Scotland would have a separate relationship with the European single market. Sturgeon said: I have been absolutely clear on this issue – the people of Scotland voted decisively to stay part of the European Union and their wishes must be respected. That includes respect from the UK government, which is why Philip Hammond’s comments are deeply disappointing – I very much hope the new prime minister will be more open to constructive discussion. The Scottish government is pursuing every possible avenue to protect our place in Europe – which of course means protecting businesses’ freedom to trade, the ability of workers to be protected and our right to continue to influence EU decisions. Hammond’s comments were in contrast to Scottish secretary David Mundell, who yesterday told journalists at the Scotland Office: ““I’m open to Scotland having a slightly different deal if that’s doable.” Sir Christopher Meyer, a former ambassador to Germany and the US, has just told Sky News that Boris Johnson could be a very effective foreign secretary. I think this is actually a bold appointment, it’s an imaginative appointment, it’s a risky appointment, but it could well prove to be just what our foreign policy needs at this historic moment in our country’s history. There needs to be now a major retooling of our foreign policy, which flows from the referendum result and the fact that Brexit means Brexit. We need now to send a shot of adrenaline through our diplomatic system so we raise our game all round the world. And I think Boris Johnson is capable of doing precisely that. It is probably worth pointing out, before anyone else does, that Meyer’s wife Catherine is a friend of Theresa May’s. This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Stephen Crabb’s departure. Here is our updated list of appointments, vacancies, and sackings and resignations. You may have to refresh the page to get the updates. Stephen Crabb has resigned as work and pensions secretary, saying it is “in the best interests of my family”. This is clearly a reference to a Times story at the weekend revealing that Crabb had sent sexual text messages to a woman who was not his wife. Here is John Whittingdale leaving the Department for Culture after being sacked. This is from Carrie Symonds, his special adviser. This is from Sky’s Beth Rigby. No 10 has confirmed that the role of the Department for Education is going to be beefed up. Staff from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills working on higher and further education policy, apprenticeships and skills will move to education, where Justine Greening is in charge. Downing Street says the education department will take on responsibility for: Reforming the higher education sector to boost competition and continue to improve the quality of education that students receive; and delivering more apprenticeships through a fundamental change in the UK’s approach to skills in the workplace. Here is Boris Johnson addressing staff in the Foreign Office on his first day as foreign secretary. Helpfully for his new officials, the Independent has compiled an interactive map of all the countries in the world that Johnson has insulted. These are from the Spectator’s James Forsyth. This is from Sky’s Faisal Islam. Islam may be understating it. At least half of them have definitely been excluded: Michael Gove, John Whittingdale and Theresa Villiers. Chris Grayling is almost certainly going to remain in the cabinet. But Priti Patel has not been offered a job yet, and Iain Duncan Smith is not expected to make a government comeback. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has used Twitter to laugh off earlier reports that he was going to be moved. UPDATE: One of today’s better jokes ... This appointment has had journalists resorting to Wikipedia. The Queen has been pleased to approve the appointment of Baroness Evans of Bowes Park as Leader of the House of Lords. Natalie Evans, 40, has been in the House of Lords for less than two years. Previously she used to work for the Policy Exchange thinktank and the New Schools Network, a charity that promotes free schools. Until today she was a whip in the Lords. She replaces Tina Stowell. Jeremy Hunt remains as health secretary, Number 10 confirms. I’ve just updated our list of cabinet appointments, vacancies and sackings. Patrick McLoughlin’s move from transport to Conservative chairman has got the first “promoted/moved sideways” categorisation. (All the other appointments have been clear promotions.) Theresa Villiers has resigned as Northern Ireland secretary and left the government. She was offered an alternative job but did not want it, she says in a Facebook post. The Times’ Tim Montgomerie thinks the appointment of Gavin Williamson as chief whip is inspired. The Telegraph’s Christopher Hope says Theresa May is reorganising Whitehall. Patrick McLoughlin, who was transport secretary, has become Conservative chief whip. This is from Number 10: The Queen has been pleased to approve the appointment of Rt Hon Patrick McLoughlin MP as Conservative Party Chairman and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Being chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is a government title that involves some minor duties in relation to the Duchy of Lancaster, but it enables the holder to sit in the cabinet and receive a government salary. Patrick McLoughlin has just come out of No 10. He was transport secretary, but he would not tell the reporters what his new job is. Gavin Williamson has become chief whip. That is a big promotion. Previously, Williamson was David Cameron’s parliamentary private secretary (PPS), not even a member of the government. Williamson has just told Sky that he was “very surprised” and “very privileged” by his appointment. Now it looks as if Jeremy Hunt is staying at health. Hunt has just arrived at No 10. Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, has put out this statement about the appointment of Liz Truss as justice secretary. The problems to be found in our overcrowded prisons can be overcome with imaginative thinking and bold action to stop throwing so many people into these failing institutions, where they are swept away into deeper currents of crime by the boredom, drug abuse and violence behind bars. It is to be hoped that Elizabeth Truss is the person to take these opportunities on and we welcome today’s appointment by the new prime minister. It was heartening to see Theresa May highlight the issue of race and disproportionality in the justice system in her remarks outside Downing Street and we hope her government continues to regard tackling this as a priority, as well as the broader case for prison reform, as David Cameron did. I would also like to pay tribute to the tenure of Michael Gove as Justice Secretary. During his period at the Ministry of Justice, we have seen a welcome change in the rhetoric around prisons and prisoners and the reversal of some misguided policies of the previous coalition government. This is from Sky’s Sophy Ridge. At the moment the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is in charge of higher education. This suggests the Department for Business is being shrunk. It is still not clear how it will relate to the department Liam Fox, the new international trade secretary, is expected to head. In other news the Bank of England has decided to hold interest rates where they are. Normally that it not news - interest rates have remained unchanged for seven years - but there was a lot of speculation that today they would be cut. My colleague Graeme Wearden has more on the business live blog. Justine Greening has moved from international development to become the new education secretary, No 10 has confirmed. She is also becoming minister for women and equalities. Here is the latest list of cabinet appointments, vacancies and sackings. No 10 confirms that Liz Truss has become justice secretary, and the first female lord chancellor. The Queen has been pleased to approve the appointment of Rt Hon Liz Truss MP as the first female Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice. (The post of justice secretary is a relatively new one, but the post of lord chancellor goes back to the middle ages.) Liz Truss is the new justice secretary, Sky reports. Here is Richard Adams, the Guardian’s education editor, on the sacking of Nicky Morgan. Someone has sent flowers to Number 10 this morning. Not George Osborne or Michael Gove, one assumes ... This is from the BBC’s Vicki Young. Here is some comment on the reshuffle from journalists and commentators. From Steve Richards From the Guardian’s Gaby Hinsliff From the BBC’s Sam Macrory From the Sunday Times’ James Lyons From Philip Cowley, a politics professor Justine Greening, the international development secretary, has arrived at No 10. This is from the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope. Michael Gove, the outgoing justice secretary, only joined Twitter last month. Here is his 94th tweet. Liz Truss, the environment secretary, has arrived at No 10. Here is the updated list of cabinet appointments, vacancies and sacked ministers. Jeremy Hunt is leaving his health secretary post, but moving to a different job, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg reports. Theresa May has arrived at No 10. It is assumed that she was in her Commons office this morning sacking ministers in person. (Prime ministers sometimes do their sackings in the Commons because ministers are then spared the “walk of shame” up Downing Street.) That is Elizabeth Truss, the environment secretary, and Justine Greening, the international development secretary. If people are being invited to walk up the street into No 10, then that normally means they are being promoted. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, is out, according to the BBC. UPDATE: No 10 has just sent out a statement confirming that four cabinet ministers have been sacked this morning. This morning the following cabinet ministers left the government. Rt Hon Michael Gove MP, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice Rt Hon Oliver Letwin MP, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Rt Hon John Whittingdale, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Rt Hon Nicky Morgan MP, Secretary of State for Education and Minister for Women and Equalities Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French foreign minister, has described Boris Johnson, Britain’s new foreign secretary, as a liar. According to Reuters he told Europe 1 radio this morning: I am not at all worried about Boris Johnson, but during the campaign he lied a lot to the British people and now it is he who has his back against the wall ... [He has] his back against the wall to defend his country but also with his back against the wall the relationship with Europe should be clear. I need a partner with whom I can negotiate and who is clear, credible and reliable. This is from the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope. Ed Ram, whose Twitter profile says he is a journalist working at the BBC, has hastily deleted this tweet. He says it was just a joke. Sarah Brown, Gordon’s wife, has used Twitter to send her best wishes to Theresa May’s husband. Sky’s Beth Rigby says she thinks Oliver Letwin, the Cabinet Office minister, is out too. You can read an up-to-date list of cabinet appointments, sackings and vacancies here. I am updating the post as we go along, and so you may need to refresh the page to get the latest updates. John Whittingdale has left his post as culture secretary. Again, it is unclear whether or not he has got an alternative post. This is from the Times Educational Supplement’s Richard Vaughan. This is from ITV’s Robert Peston. Nicky Morgan has confirmed that she is no longer education secretary. It is not clear from this whether or not she has been offered an alternative government job. Nicky Morgan, the education secretary, is also expected to be sacked, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg reports. This is from ITV’s Robert Peston. Michael Gove has been sacked as justice secretary, the BBC is reporting. The most important task facing the new government is negotiating Brexit and the person in charge of that is David Davis, the new Brexit secretary. What is he going to do? Ultimately, Theresa May will make the final decisions, but we have a very good insight into Davis’s thinking because he wrote a long article on exactly this topic for ConservativeHome on Monday. Here are some of the points he made. Davis said he expected the EU to continue to allow the UK tariff-free access to the single market, even with the UK imposing new border controls. This leaves the question of single market access. The ideal outcome, (and in my view the most likely, after a lot of wrangling), is continued tariff-free access. Once the European nations realise that we are not going to budge on control of our borders, they will want to talk, in their own interest. There may be some complexities about rules of origin and narrowly based regulatory compliance for exports into the EU, but that is all manageable. He said triggering article 50, the move that starts the two-year EU withdrawal process, should be delayed until around the end of the year. But what if it they are irrational, as so many remain-supporting commentators asserted they would be in the run-up to the referendum? This is one of the reasons for taking a little time before triggering Article 50. The negotiating strategy has to be properly designed, and there is some serious consultation to be done first. Constitutional propriety requires us to consult with the Scots, Welsh, and Northern Irish governments first, and common sense implies that we should consult with stakeholders like the City, CBI, TUC, small business bodies, the NFU, universities and research foundations and the like. None of them should have any sort of veto, but we should try to accommodate their concerns so long as it does not compromise the main aim. This whole process should be completed to allow triggering of article 50 before or by the beginning of next year. He said that, if the EU insists on denying the UK tariff-free access to the single market, the UK should use the income from tariffs on EU imports to support British industry. And he suggested the government should publish a pre-negotiation white paper before invoking article 50. In this process, we should work out what we do in the improbable event of the EU taking a dog in the manger attitude to single market tariff-free access, and insist on WTO rules and levies, including 10 per cent levies on car exports. Let us be clear: I do not believe for a moment that that will happen, but let us humour the pre-referendum Treasury fantasy. In that eventuality, people seem to forget that the British government will be in receipt of over £2 billion of levies on EU cars alone. There is nothing to stop us supporting our indigenous car industry to make it more competitive if we so chose. WTO rules would not allow us to explicitly offset the levies charged, but we could do a great deal to support the industry if we wanted to. Research support, investment tax breaks, lower vehicle taxes – there are a whole range of possibilities to protect the industry, and if need be, the consumer. Such a package would naturally be designed to favour British consumers and British industry. Which of course is another reason that the EU will not force this outcome, particularly if we publicise it heavily in a pre-negotiation white paper. He said that he wanted talks on securing trade deals with the UK’s main partners to start immediately, in the hope of concluding them within two years. So be under no doubt: we can do deals with our trading partners, and we can do them quickly. I would expect the new prime minister on September 9th [this was written before Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the Tory leadership contest] to immediately trigger a large round of global trade deals with all our most favoured trade partners. I would expect that the negotiation phase of most of them to be concluded within between 12 and 24 months. So within two years, before the negotiation with the EU is likely to be complete, and therefore before anything material has changed, we can negotiate a free trade area massively larger than the EU. Trade deals with the US and China alone will give us a trade area almost twice the size of the EU, and of course we will also be seeking deals with Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, India, Japan, the UAE, Indonesia – and many others. He said that he was not in favour of cutting employment rights. There is also a political, or perhaps sentimental point. The great British industrial working classes voted overwhelmingly for Brexit. I am not at all attracted by the idea of rewarding them by cutting their rights. Angela Eagle, the Labour leadership contender, was filmed last night responding with disbelief when she heard Boris Johnson had been made foreign secretary. Explaining why she was so appalled she told the Press Association: I couldn’t believe that somebody who went round the country telling blatant lies could be rewarded in that way, and I thought immediately of the Hillsborough families because he repeated the slurs about them and then he went up to Merseyside and insulted Merseyside and was forced by Michael Howard to go back up and apologise. And then I thought about what he’d said about President Obama, that somehow his Kenyan roots had made him more pro-European. I don’t think that that’s the kind of behaviour of a British foreign secretary. ITV’s Robert Peston thinks Michael Gove will be sacked. Here is a summary of the key points from Philip Hammond’s morning interviews as the new chancellor. Hammond ruled out holding an emergency budget. He confirmed that George Osborne’s deficit reduction timetable has been abandoned. Asked if he was still committed to deficit reduction, he said: Our economy will change as we go forward in the future and it will require a different set of parameters to measure success. Of course we have got to reduce the deficit further but looking at how and when and at what pace we do that and how we measure our progress in doing that is something that we now need to consider in light of the new circumstances that the economy is facing. He said Britain would leave the single market but then negotiate access to it. We will come out of the single market as a result of our decision to leave the European Union. The question is how we negotiate with the European Union, not from the point of view of being members but from the point of view of being close neighbours and trade partners. He said that restoring business confidence was now a priority. In the short term, the decision to exit the European Union came as a surprise to the markets, a surprise to a lot of people actually, a surprise to business. And therefore it’s rattled confidence, it’s cause people to put plans on hold while they wait to see how things clarify. The fact that we’ve moved quickly to resolve the question of the leadership of the Conservative party and get a new prime minister installed I think will help to restore business and consumer confidence. What we’ve got to do now is show as a team how we’re going to take this negotiation with the European Union forward, how we’re going to satbilise and support the economy through the coming months in order to help that confidence to be restored as quickly as possible. He said he was “confident” the new Hinkley Point nuclear power station would go ahead. He sidestepped a question about whether he supported the proposed third runway at Heathrow. Philip Hammond, the new chancellor, was at school with the broadcaster Richard Madeley. Three years ago Madeley said that Hammond was a Goth back then, and that he ‘used to arrive in class in leather trench-coat with The Guardian under his arm’. On ITV’s Good Morning Britain Hammond jokingly agreed when Piers Morgan put it to him that this could be “career-wrecking” for a Conservative (reading the Guardian, not being a Goth). Hammond said: After making these shocking allegations, Richard Madeley did contact me to concede that actually on reflection, it probably was the Financial Times, not The Guardian. And he said that Goths “hadn’t even been invented in those days”. We’ll start getting new cabinet appointments at about 11am, Sky’s Beth Rigby reports. Boris Johnson’s red box may contain a briefing on Brexit. But if he wants a reliable guide to the options available, he could do a lot worse than read Patrick Wintour’s article about Britain could do. Andrea Leadsom, the energy minister, will be taking energy questions in the Commons, the Department for Energy says. Robert Moore, ITV’s Washington correspondent, says the appointment of Boris Johnson as foreign secretary has gone down badly with the White House. Here’s an extract from his blog. To put it politely, it has not gone down well. Don’t even listen to the State Department spokesman saying it is business as usual. The President’s foreign policy team read and was deeply offended by the Boris article that talked of Barack Obama as “incoherent, inconsistent and downright hypocritical ... a part-Kenyan President.” You can say it doesn’t much matter. President Obama has only six months left in office. But I don’t think that Mrs Clinton will view him differently. One veteran Obama official put it this way: Brexit has diminished Britain in this town. Germany is now going to be more central to US policy in Europe. That is doubly true with the Boris appointment. It’s energy questions in the Commons at 9.30am. Amber Rudd was made home secretary yesterday, and currently she has not been replaced as energy secretary. Presumably Andrea Leadsom, the energy minister, will have to answer all the questions. (I’ve called the Department for Energy for clarification, but they could not help.) Here are the cabinet appointments so far. (I will update this list as we go along, but you may need to refresh the page to get the updates to appear.) The new cabinet Theresa May - Prime minister Philip Hammond - Chancellor (promoted - was foreign secretary) Boris Johnson - Foreign secretary (promoted - was backbencher) Amber Rudd - Home secretary (promoted - was energy secretary) Michael Fallon - Defence secretary (no change) David Davis - Brexit secretary (promoted - was backbencher) Liam Fox - International trade secretary (promoted - was backbencher) Liz Truss - Justice secretary (promoted - was environment secretary) Justine Greening - Education secretary and minister for women and equalities (promoted - was international development secretary) Gavin Williamson - Chief whip (promoted - was David Cameron’s PPS. The chief whip attends cabinet, but often the chief whip is not technically a cabinet minister) Patrick McLoughlin - Conservative chairman (promoted/moved sideways - was transport secretary) Jeremy Hunt - Health secretary (no change) Natalie Evans - Leader of the Lords (promoted - was a Lords whip) Chris Grayling - Transport secretary (promoted/moved sideways - was leader of the Commons) Damian Green - Work and pensions secretary (promoted - was a backbencher) Andrea Leadsom - Environment secretary (promoted - was energy minister) Sajid Javid - Communities secretary (moved sideways/demoted - was business secretary) James Brokenshire - Northern Ireland secretary (promoted - was immigration minister) Greg Clark - Business and energy secretary (promoted - was communities secretary) Priti Patel - International development secretary (promoted - was employment minister) Karen Bradley - Culture secretary (promoted - was Home Office minister) Alun Cairns - Welsh secretary (no change) David Mundell - Scottish secretary (no change) David Gauke - Chief secretary to the Treasury (promoted - was financial secretary to the Treasury) David Lidington - Leader of the Commons and lord president of the council (promoted - was Europe minister) Vacancies Cabinet Office minister (if Oliver Letwin being replaced) Out George Osborne - Was chancellor Michael Gove - Was justice secretary Nicky Morgan - Was education secretary John Whittingdale - Was culture secretary Oliver Letwin - Was Cabinet Office minister Theresa Villiers - Was Northern Ireland secretary Tina Stowell - No longer leader of the Lords Stephen Crabb - Was work and pensions secretary Mark Harper - Was chief whip Greg Hands - No longer chief secretary to the Treasury Here is some Twitter reaction to the Philip Hammond interview. From ITV’s Robert Peston From BuzzFeed’s Siraj Datoo From the Sunday Times’ James Lyons From Paul Mason, a Guardian columnist Hammond says London provides a crucial economic support service to European businesses. So it is in their interests that the City is protect. Q: Will the Heathrow third runway go ahead? Hammond says that is a decision for the new government. It has not been discussed yet. He will want to look at the evidence. Q: Will new Hinkely Point nuclear power station go ahead? Hammond says he is “confident” that this will go ahead. He says he hopes that this decision will be finalised “very soon”. Q: But the cost has risen to £30bn. Would it be worth it? Hammond says having a reliable power supply is essential for a modern economy. Hinkey Point will generate 6% of the country’s energy. Q: Amber Rudd said she would not trust Boris Johnson to drive her home. Now he is in charge of MI6. How will that work? Hammond says the tone of the government will be set by Theresa May. Any new minister going into a department has a huge amount of support. And there is “very strong continuity” provided by civil servants. And that’s it. Hammond’s interview is over. Q: Do you still believe in eliminating the deficit? Hammond says the approach taken in 2010 was the right one. Britain is in an “immeasurably stronger” position than it was then. But now we are in a new phase. The economy will change as a result of the Brexit vote. Q: So you have happy to live with the deficit as it is? No, says Hammond. Q: So when will you get rid of it? Hammond says that it something to consider in the new situation. Hammond refuses to set a timetable for deficit reduction. Q: Do you still think it could take longer than the second world war to negotiate Brexit? Hammond says ratifying the new treaty will take some time. But he says he hopes the government can reach an agreement on what the deal will look like more quickly. He says business wants to know on what terms it will be able to sell into the single market. Philip Hammond, the new chancellor, is on the Today programme. Mishal Husain is interviewing him. Hammond says he does not anticipate an emergency budget. But the Brexit vote has sent a shock through the system. He wants to send signs of reassurance. Q: But you were part of Project Fear. You said Brexit would have a chilling effect. Hammond says there has been a chilling effect on markets. Investment has been affected. But a new government is being put in place, and it will deliver certainty. Britain is in a stronger position than it would have been if it had had to wait until 9 September for a new government. Q: So, if there is a chilling effect, why not do something now. Will you cut corporation tax as a stimulus? Hammond says he won’t set out his plans now. Q: But do you accept the case for a stimulus? Hammond says he will meet the governor of the Bank of England later. He will listen to advice. But his immediate view is that investment decisions have been halted. He wants to sent a signal of reassurance to business. They must know Britain will remain an attractive location for investment. I’m Andrew Sparrow, and I’m blogging now for the day. Philip Hammond, the new chancellor, is about to be interviewed on the Today programme. I will be covering that in full. He has already given some interviews to other programmes. Here are the highlights. Hammond ruled out an emergency budget. There is no plan for an emergency budget, as Theresa May made clear. There will be an autumn statement in the normal way and then there will be a budget in the normal way. But the markets do need signals of reassurance, they need to know we will do whatever is necessary to keep the economy on track. He said Boris Johnson would be “very good” in his post as foreign secretary. When it was pointed out that Johnson’s approach would be different to his (Hammond was foreign secretary until yesterday), Hammond replied: We have all got different styles and that is why we make a strong team. We are very different people and when you are building a team for anything you want different kinds of people with different kinds of skills. And I think Boris will be very good in this job - Boris is a very big figure in the Conservative Party, he is a big figure in the country, he is a national figure. He will be an asset to both the party and the country working as part of a team closely together with the rest of us to make sure we deliver for Britain in the circumstances we find ourselves in. Good morning and welcome to our daily politics live blog. The big picture So the UK now has a new prime minister in Theresa May after the former home secretary went to Buckingham Palace and then told the nation that the monarch had invited her to form a new government. The really big surprise came with her decision to appoint the leading Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson as foreign secretary. There was also a surprise elevation for Amber Rudd, the energy secretary, who will succeed May as home secretary. Rudd has been an MP since 2010 and only joined the cabinet last May. Liam Fox also rejoins the ranks of Conservative heavyweights after years of being out in the cold after being appointed secretary of state for international trade. Does anyone have a Brexit plan yet? No, although that will now be down to David Davis, another leading leave campaigner, who becomes the catchily titled secretary of state for exiting the European Union. Expect that to soon become Brexit secretary. For the real story of May’s cabinet decisions, have a read of John Crace’s sketch. You should also know: Owen Smith has set out his stall for the Labour leadership by saying he would offer the public a second referendum to ratify any Brexit deal Britain strikes with the EU. Jeremy Corbyn tacitly endorsed bullying and intimidation of Labour staff by voting against the proposal for a secret ballot on Wednesday night, an NEC member said. The Labour leadership is facing the prospect of a split on what action to take against Tony Blair over the invasion of Iraq as Emily Thornberry, the new shadow foreign secretary, opposed a censure motion against the former prime minister. Diary 12pm: Bank of England may cut interest rates to 0.25% in a bid to bolster the post-Brexit economy. 5pm: NHS Solidarity march in central London s to encourage action to defend the NHS from privatisation. 930am: Unite policy conference continues at the Brighton Centre. Read these Anne Perkins dissects Theresa May’s speech: what she said and what she meant. Simon Jenkins says that although May took on the police, but her new foes are far fiercer. Polly Toynbee writes that David Cameron has washed his hands of No 10 - but he’s left an almighty mess behind. Baffling claim of the day Inevitably, it has to be new foreign secretary Boris Johnson: Clearly now we have a massive opportunity in this country to make a great success of our relationship with Europe and with the world and I’m very excited to be asked to play a part in that.” And another thing Would you like to wake up to this briefing in your inbox?

The study was done by Drew Shindell, formerly of Nasa, now professor of climate sciences at Duke University, and Chair of the Scientific Advisory Panel to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition. Shindell recently published research noting that aerosols and ozone have a bigger effect on the climate in the northern hemisphere, where humans produce more of those pollutants. That research led Shindell to question current estimates of the true costs of our energy sources. Much research has gone into estimating the social cost of carbon, which attempts to account for the additional costs from burning fossil fuels via the climate damages their carbon pollution causes. However, this research doesn’t account for the costs associated with other air pollutants released during fossil fuel combustion. For example, depending on how much more we value a dollar today than in the future (a factor known as ‘discount rate’), Shindell estimates carbon pollution costs us $32 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted in climate damages, and another $45 in additional climate-health impacts like malnutrition that aren’t normally accounted for. But Shindell also estimates that carbon emissions are relatively cheap compared to other fossil fuel air pollutants. For example, sulfur dioxide costs $42,000 per ton, and nitrous oxides $67,000 per ton! However, less of these other pollutants are released into the atmosphere during modern fossil fuel combustion. Electric Cars Cheaper than Gasoline Powered For an average American car (26 miles per gallon), Shindell estimates that the air pollution emissions altogether cost us $1700 in damages per year. In comparison, emissions from energy to power an electric Nissan Leaf would cost us $840 even if purely powered by coal, and $290 if fueled by electricity supplied entirely from natural gas. These costs would become negligible if the electricity came from renewable or nuclear power. Electric vehicles (EVs) are clearly the winners in this cost comparison. Hence environmental damages are reduced substantially even if an EV is powered from coal-fired electricity, although they are much lower for other electricity sources The Needed Energy Transition May Have Begun in 2014 The key conclusion from Shindell’s study is that fossil fuels only seem cheap because their market prices don’t reflect their true costs. In reality they are remarkably expensive for society, but taxpayers pick up most of those costs via climate damages and other health effects. Those who argue that we need to continue relying on fossil fuels – like former popular science writer Matt Ridley – just aren’t accounting for the costs of pollution. These air pollution costs are effectively a massive subsidy, and Shindell likely underestimated their size. When I asked Shindell if he had accounted for recent research by Moore &amp; Diaz showing that climate change slows economic growth, he said, I saw the Moore and Diaz paper, which was quite interesting, but after my paper had already been accepted so it didn’t make it in there. Indeed if growth is slowed by climate change as in their study, the associated social costs could be much larger ... But in general, this is only one of several possible reasons that my values are likely conservative as I’ve left out many things that I didn’t know how to put a price on. That includes the influence of pollution on cognitive function decline, on IQ, and on mental health, the influence of energy on freshwater resources, on national security (e.g. military spending related to oil/gas supplies), the impact of climate change on biodiversity, the effects of ocean acidification, etc. This research shows that we need to transition away from fossil fuels not just to mitigate the risks associated with climate change, but to reduce the economic and health impacts of air pollution in general. Fortunately there was some good news this week suggesting that we may be on our way to making this transition. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported, global emissions of carbon dioxide from the energy sector stalled in 2014, marking the first time in 40 years in which there was a halt or reduction in emissions of the greenhouse gas that was not tied to an economic downturn ... In the 40 years in which the IEA has been collecting data on carbon dioxide emissions, there have only been three times in which emissions have stood still or fallen compared to the previous year, and all were associated with global economic weakness: the early 1980’s; 1992 and 2009. In 2014, however, the global economy expanded by 3%. When we examine the data, 2014 indeed stands out. With 3% GDP growth, it’s the first year on record that energy-related CO2 emissions didn’t increase and GDP nevertheless grew by more than 2%. The IEA reports that the stagnation in carbon pollution stemmed from a transition away from fossil fuels rather than a drop in energy use due to poor economic conditions, as had been the case in previous years where CO2 emissions didn’t grow. The IEA attributes the halt in emissions growth to changing patterns of energy consumption in China and OECD countries. In China, 2014 saw greater generation of electricity from renewable sources, such as hydropower, solar and wind, and less burning of coal. In OECD economies, recent efforts to promote more sustainable growth – including greater energy efficiency and more renewable energy – are producing the desired effect of decoupling economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. It’s important not to over-interpret a single data point, but it’s a promising sign that carbon pollution emissions didn’t grow in 2014 while the global economy did. This is the sort of “decoupling” of GDP and CO2 that needs to happen for a successful transition away from fossil fuels. Signs that we may have reached peak coal production are also encouraging. As Shindell’s research shows, it’s an important transition for us to make in order to preserve a livable climate and a healthy economy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2015/feb/11/climate-engineering-money-opportunity-business","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-11T15:54:09Z","webTitle":"Geoengineering: it could be a money-making opportunity for business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/feb/11/climate-engineering-money-opportunity-business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2015/feb/11/climate-engineering-money-opportunity-business","fields":{"headline":"Geoengineering: it could be a money-making opportunity for business","bodyText":"The CIA was one of the funders behind yesterday’s National Research Council (NRC) reports on geoengineering, or so the rumours have it. If the intelligence community feels it is important to learn more about “climate intervention”, might not the same be true for the business community? In other words, is there money to be made here? The NRC, the major body in the US providing scientific and technical information to policymakers, released two reports. They show two very different approaches to reducing climate change from greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2) removal and albedo modification. Removing carbon dioxide The gases in power plant smokestacks contain typically 10% or more CO2, whereas the atmosphere contains only 0.04% CO2. Why would anyone want to try to capture CO2 from a more dilute gas when more concentrated gases are all too readily available? Small start-up companies, such as Carbon Engineering and Climeworks, are attempting to develop technologies that could remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in centralised facilities. Since the price of CO2 on available carbon markets is less than what it costs to remove CO2 from the atmosphere using these technologies, existing carbon markets are probably insufficient to drive widespread deployment. However, there is demand for carbon dioxide for use in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations, and many of these operations are far from suitable sources of CO2. Enhanced oil recovery operations therefore represent a possible market for these technologies. It has even been suggested that if CO2 could be captured from air on a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the nuclear power could be used to split CO2 and water molecules, and the carbon and hydrogen could be combined in a chemical processing facility to produce aviation fuels. The military, therefore, is another potential market for CO2 air capture technologies. Reflecting sunlight Albedo modification technologies aim to cool the Earth by causing more sunlight to be reflected to outer space. With less sunlight absorbed by Earth, the planet will cool. One leading approach for doing this involves emulating the effects of large volcanoes. Large volcanoes cool the Earth by injecting large amounts of very fine particles into the stratosphere that reflect sunlight back to space, so the Earth absorbs less sunlight. It is thought that a single fire hose constantly releasing materials into the stratosphere would be enough to offset all warming anticipated for the rest of this century. In practice, it would likely be most efficient to do this with a fleet of airplanes shuttling material up to the stratosphere. It has been estimated that the total direct cost would be about $10bn (£6.5bn) per year and require a scale of effort that would be about 1% the scale of today’s commercial aviation industry. Since no one is likely to do this soon, and there are no existing commercial drivers of this activity, it is hard to see how to make much money from these ideas. Nevertheless, there has been some activity in this area by for-profit corporations. For example, Intellectual Ventures has applied for a patent on a balloon-based system to release materials into the stratosphere – although it is unclear whether there is a direct way for the company to profit from this patent. Another way to reflect sunlight to space might be to brighten clouds over the ocean, for example by making a very fine mist of seawater. Armand Neukermans, who was part of the team that developed ink jet printers for Hewlett Packard, has recently produced a nozzle that can produce a fine enough spray to make the tiny particles needed to make clouds brighter. Neukermans knows a lot about nozzle design in a profit-driven environment, but his motives for developing this nozzle are, I believe, altruistic. While there is no market for brightening marine clouds, could this extraordinary nozzle technology find commercial applications in high-tech industrial processes? Making money from climate intervention In an economically efficient world, carbon prices would equal the damage caused by the release of an equivalent amount of carbon into the atmosphere. If carbon prices get high enough and the cost of carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere could be made low enough, there may be potential for profit in the business of removing carbon dioxide. In contrast, it is hard to see how substantial profits can be made from global-scale albedo modification efforts. However, both of types of climate intervention research and development could potentially create important spin-off technologies. Insofar as these approaches can reduce the risk of dangerous climate change, they should affect prices in economically efficient carbon markets. If we think society will get serious about the climate problem soon, then investing in near-zero emission energy technologies could be the winning ticket. Unfortunately, the global community is not terribly serious about reducing emissions, and much venture capital has been lost on creative new start-ups in the energy sector. The longer we take to transform our energy system so it no longer uses the sky as a waste dump, the more likely that we will have to rely on climate intervention technologies. Perhaps then there will be greater potential to profit from investments in these technologies. The technology and innovation hub is funded by BT.

The far right eco-nationalist grouping was launched by Marine Le Pen, with a ‘patriotic’ platform of opposition to international climate talks and support for France’s nuclear industry. The FN has made political capital about cruelty to animals in the preparation of halal and kosher meat in the past, and its MEPs are preparing a resolution that would limit shale gas exploration, despite the party voting against a shale moratorium in the last parliament. “The New Ecology movement is based on national interest and patriotism. We have to be closer to our people and not against our country’s interests,” the FN MEP and environment committee member Mireille d’Ornano told the Guardian Marine Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, was a climate sceptic who once cut open a watermelon to illustrate how environmentalists were supposedly red communists underneath. But the issue of whether human activity caused global warming was “a very technical question,” d’Ornano said. “We have to find a balanced position and we don’t have to be politically correct or ideologically biased about it. There are pros and cons to the scientific evidence. We have to find out what really comes from human activity, or doesn’t.” The world’s leading climate scientists in the UN’s Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change last year said that the evidence linking human activity to global warming was “unequivocal”. But d’Ornano dismissed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the international climate talks process, as a “communist project,” adding: “We don’t want a global agreement or global rule for the environment.” Yannick Jadot, a French Green MEP, said that the new FN grouping was a sham. “They never talk about biodiversity because that means respecting diversity,” he told the Guardian. “They oppose animal cruelty, but they also defend hunters and big agricultural industries. They pretend to defend fish but vote in favour of deep sea fisheries. Again today [Wednesday] they voted in favour of allowing Canadian tar sands in EU fuel.” The FN also takes a strong stand in favour of nuclear power, which d’Ornano described as an issue of “national sovereignty”, although all the uranium used in France’s reactors comes from abroad, according to EurActiv France. In philosophical terms, the FN was presenting idealised visions of a past natural order to mask the monocultural hierarchy that they would replace it with, Jadot argued. “The extreme right say it was better before because we were all white and Christian - Catholic - and gay weddings were not an issue and we were somehow in a better relation with nature. This is now part of a fake image that they are trying to sell about the former order in terms of family, nature and race,” he said. New Ecology’s launch closely follows a spectacular, if unsuccessful, campaign by ‘eco-nationalists’ in Switzerland to cap immigration levels at 0.2% of the resident population. In Hungary, the neo-Nazi Jobbik party has campaigned against invasive flora from abroad which they say is destroying Hungarian plants and animals as it spreads unchecked. The far-right Danish People’s Party is virulently opposed to immigration, multi-culturalism and multi-ethnicity. But it also pledges “to ensure that the way in which the earth’s resources are used bears the stamp of consideration, care and a sense of responsibility for the natural world and all its living creatures.” With rising discontent among the young unemployed in France finding expression in the Sivens Dam campaign, and a traditional constituency among small farmers, Jadot said that the FN’s environmental tilt was not an isolated example. “Clearly, there is a trend,” he said. “Five years ago most of the European extreme right parties were very different, but now they want to have power and be in governments so they have to widen their voting base.” “I would warn people that they have no legitimacy and they lack credibility. They pretend to defend a cause but have no solutions. They should not be considered environmentalists or part of any Green movement at all.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/mar/02/should-the-uk-be-subsidising-the-worlds-first-tidal-lagoons","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-02T17:20:12Z","webTitle":"Should the UK be subsidising the world's first tidal lagoons?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/02/should-the-uk-be-subsidising-the-worlds-first-tidal-lagoons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/mar/02/should-the-uk-be-subsidising-the-worlds-first-tidal-lagoons","fields":{"headline":"Should the UK be subsidising the world's first tidal lagoons?","bodyText":"The company planning to build a series of massive tidal lagoons in the UK claim their project can generate electricity that will be competitive with offshore wind and nuclear power. But experts have urged the government to take a cautious approach to the massive capital investment. The world’s first tidal lagoon power station is ready to begin construction in Swansea, Wales should it attain planning approval. The project has been criticised for its exorbitant electricity costs, estimated to be £168/MWh. When the project begins generation in 2018, onshore wind will be producing electricity for less than half of this price. But Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP), the company behind the projects, says the Swansea development is simply a proof of concept and tidal power at scale will produce affordable power. On Monday the company announced the beginning of the approval process for a second site near Cardiff where construction could begin by 2018 and power generation by 2022. The second lagoon will cover an area seven times larger than Swansea’s and will have a capacity of between 1,800-2,800MW, enough to power 1.5m homes (compared with 150,000 for the first lagoon). Most importantly, the company says, the larger scale will allow them to produce power at £90-95/MWh, which will make the project cheaper than offshore wind and competitive with nuclear. Mark Shorrock, TLP’s chief executive says the fall in cost will occur because of the expertise accrued through the construction of the Swansea plant combined with the economies of scale of building the much larger lagoon. “Full-scale tidal lagoon infrastructure gives the UK an opportunity to generate electricity from our amazing tidal range at a cost comparable to fossil fuel or nuclear generation. We have the best tidal resource in Europe and the second best worldwide. We now have a sustainable way to make the most of this natural advantage,” says Shorrock. The secretary of state for energy and climate change Ed Davey has repeatedly expressed his enthusiasm for the technology. “I’ve looked at a whole range of different forms of renewable electricity options for the future for large scale deployment. And obviously we are doing an awful lot on offshore wind, which has huge promise at very very big scale. But when you look at the alternatives the one technology that looks like it could be a runner to give us a big amount of renewable electricity looks to me like tidal lagoons,” he says. Will Straw, a research director at the Institute for Public Policy Research, says the investment is imperative to meeting the UK’s emissions reduction target of 80% by 2050. “I don’t think we have a choice but to invest in some new renewable technologies as well as existing proven renewable technologies. I simply don’t think that we have the physical space and public acceptability for the amount of existing renewable that we would need to meet our longer term 2050 objectives.” But there are key hurdles before either of the projects are realised. Davey’s department is consulting on how best to negotiate government support for tidal lagoon power. One proposal to engage in a bilateral haggle with the company has been criticised by the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) for choking competition and transparency. The money to subsidise the projects will come from a pot of money levied on energy bills. TLP say their projects will need about 1% of the money given to renewable projects each year. Colin Brown, the director of engineering at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, says the technology itself does not pose a major challenge but that the size of even the pilot means the costs of unforeseen delays or malfunctions will be very high. “It’s absolutely deliverable. It’s the cost that its deliverable at [that is the issue]. In the crudest terms it’s a few turbines that we would use in a hydroelectric plant ... It’s walls of rock and stone. I don’t think we’d need to split the atom here, this is relatively straightforward stuff. The issue is it’s on such a huge scale and such a high capital scale that if they do find that they’ve got a maintenance charge that’s out by 5% it’ll hugely change the cost of the electricity that comes out of it,” he says. The potential for things to go wrong at huge scale and the novelty of the technology means the government should proceed with caution, says Professor Jim Watson, research director at the UK Energy Research Centre. TLP says the Cardiff project could begin construction by 2018 and be generating power by 2022, meaning there would be some overlap with the first lagoon pilot period. It would be imprudent, says Watson, to commit consumers’ money to the second project before the pilot is proven to come in at cost and in time. “It would be taking a very big risk to do both at once because the second one is very large indeed and therefore the scope for it going wrong is much bigger. So I think a step-by-step approach would work given that this is new,” said Watson. But Watson says the exciting prospect of a technology that its advocates believe could produce up to 8% of the UK’s electricity is worth investing in. “If the 8% of UK electricity figure is quoted is true that’s very, very significant indeed ... Because of that potential being quite significant then it does pay to use some public money to support the early stages of the technology and see whether it can deliver.” In spite of his obvious excitement about the technology, Davey agrees: “Until you deploy one, you can’t be sure this is the right way to go.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/oct/24/japan-trade-minister-tepco-shares-yoichi-miyazawa","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-24T09:14:50Z","webTitle":"Japan trade minister in conflict of interest row over Tepco shares","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/24/japan-trade-minister-tepco-shares-yoichi-miyazawa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/oct/24/japan-trade-minister-tepco-shares-yoichi-miyazawa","fields":{"headline":"Japan trade minister in conflict of interest row over Tepco shares","bodyText":"Japan’s government is reeling from its third scandal in a week after the trade minister, who oversees nuclear energy, faced questions over his shares in the company that runs the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Yoichi Miyazawa had already faced embarrassment on Thursday when it was revealed that members of his staff had claimed expenses for a visit to a bondage bar. On Friday, Miyazawa denied there was any conflict of interest over his shares in Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), saying he had decided to place them in a trust rather than sell them. Miyazawa was appointed only days ago after his predecessor, Yuko Obuchi, resigned over a political funding scandal involving her support groups. Hours after Obuchi quit, the justice minister, Midori Matsushima, resigned amid claims that she had violated election laws by distributing paper fans bearing her image to constituents. The double resignation, combined with the furore over Miyazawa’s shares, have dealt a significant blow to the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, as he nears a decision on an unpopular tax rise and attempts to win public support for the restart of a small number of nuclear reactors. Miyazawa attempted to brush off criticism of his ownership of 600 Tepco shares – worth more than $1,800 – which he reportedly bought before the March 2011 triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi. Japan’s remaining nuclear reactors were switched off after the disaster. “Keeping [the shares] means I’m supporting Tepco as the minister in charge,” Miyazawa told reporters. Senior colleagues closed ranks around the embattled minister. “I don’t think there is any problem at all,” the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said. “If someone is sworn in as a minister, the rules say he or she should refrain from trading shares during their term and entrust those shares to a trust bank … minister Miyazawa has already started on that process,” he added. Miyazawa said he had spoken to the staff who had claimed ¥18,230 in expenses for a 2010 visit to a Hiroshima sex bar, where male customers pay to whip tied female employees. Miyazawa stressed that he had not visited the bar. “I have scolded my people and ordered them to pay back the cost” of the visit, he said. Abe had hoped that by acting quickly over the alleged spending irregularities involving Obuchi and Matsushima he could quickly regain the political momentum that saw his first cabinet last almost two years without a reshuffle or resignation. Instead, he is confronting uncomfortable reminders of his first term as prime minister, from late 2006, which ended after just a year. Four of his ministers resigned, and one killed himself. Atsuo Ito, a political analyst, said even if the share controversy did not force Miyazawa out, it was a distraction. “It takes energy away from the administration’s difficult policies, such as raising the sales tax and restarting nuclear reactors,” he told Reuters. “The ruling party wants to avoid further resignations. But this could be a repeat of the first Abe administration that was heavily criticised by the public when he defended his ministers for a long time, even after scandals.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/mar/18/quiet-revolution-changing-way-we-use-energy-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-18T12:09:25Z","webTitle":"The quiet revolution that's changing the way we use energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/18/quiet-revolution-changing-way-we-use-energy-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/mar/18/quiet-revolution-changing-way-we-use-energy-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"The quiet revolution that's changing the way we use energy","bodyText":"There is a quiet revolution underway in the way we produce and consume energy. This revolution has been kickstarted by laws, regulations and the arrival of new technologies. It’s been influenced by people – no less passionate than those protesting on the streets – who’ve chosen to engage in the existing economic system to divert it toward more sustainable ends. It’s not glamorous, and can be slow and technical, but more people are applying themselves to the task internationally – and it is producing results. This quiet revolution began in the UK in 1990 with the first regulations supporting renewable electricity. The rules obliging energy companies to support non-fossil-fuel-based electricity were originally conceived to support nuclear power after privatisation, with renewable sources such as wind power added subsequently. Twenty-five years and a couple of policy re-designs later, including significantly the Climate Change Act passed by Ed Miliband, the UK has a renewables sector which, though still dependent on subsidies, is starting to make serious in-roads into conventional energy systems. The renewables sector contains many big players using the capitalist system to increase their market share and push out incumbents. It is attracting criticism from those with vested interests and is thwarted on occasion by members of what author Naomi Klein refers to as “blockadia” – people stopping things – but on the whole its continued growth looks certain. Costs have tumbled and the need for subsidies is receding. In the UK, the Conservative party may bark about closing the door on renewables but even David Cameron and his chancellor, George Osborne, can see that any private entities prepared to pour hard cash into concrete and steel, whatever its purpose, are incredibly valuable. If Labour wins the election in May we will set a target to almost fully decarbonise electricity generation by 2030. Policies in support of renewables and energy efficiency, together with policies that make fossil fuels more expensive – such as applying air quality standards – are bringing emissions down fast in Europe. Of course two other factors – the financial crisis and warmer weather – have also contributed, but the signs are that as economic growth recovers, emissions are not returning. Many of the regulations driving emissions down here are EU-wide, though in the UK our Climate Change Act and carbon taxation policy keep us slightly ahead. The new European parliament and commission are embarking on a programme to create an “energy union” that has decarbonisation at its heart. The penny has finally dropped that low carbon can also mean low import dependency and increased security. Different approaches are being tried in different countries with the UK looking to also invest in carbon capture and storage (CCS), and nuclear energy. Europe has always gained strength from countries diversely applying themselves to shared endeavours and this next industrial revolution will be no exception. Outside Europe too, progress is being made in quiet, steady ways. In China, pro-environment policymaking is on the increase and, for the first time last year, demand for coal appeared to have peaked as a result. A massive planned rollout of renewables, gas and nuclear energy looks very likely to continue the trend. Realising renewable energy is the fastest technology to deploy, bar none, Narendra Modi is determined to electrify his nation using a policy to double India’s coal tax and support renewables. In Chile a new carbon tax is imminent but high energy prices and enormous amounts of sun are already making solar power profitable. South Korea has a cap and trade scheme that is a match for the EU’s. Even in the Middle East huge sums are being invested in all forms of zero carbon technology, nuclear and CCS included. A recent tender for new capacity in Dubai saw solar power undercutting conventional sources by a wide margin. In North America, where the hijacking and paralysis of federal governments has led many to all but give up on national policy, state-level innovative policies continue to be introduced. The US Environmental Protection Agency is also overseeing a nationwide process to control emissions that stands a reasonable chance of being enacted if it can dodge the lawsuits. And for once the president is seriously engaged in trying to find a global solution. It is these improved national conditions that give hope that a deal can be reached in Paris this year. It is easy to criticise the UN climate negotiations process and it is certainly far from perfect, but if there were a magic bullet it would have been discovered. Climate change is a unique challenge and international politics is messy. The negotiations will only codify what countries believe to be possible today but, over time, ambitions will increase as confidence grows. What really needs to be achieved is an inclusive deal that boosts confidence in the revolution already underway. A huge proportion of fossil fuels will remain unburned because many of the tools we need to make this happen have been created and are being improved. They need to be applied more widely and with more ambition but it is already clear that we can, and do, drive capitalism in the directions we choose. Public pressure helps make this happen but so too do individuals working within the current system to divert its course. It’s been said that human beings are somehow wired to ignore climate change, but the human brain is the ultimate problem-solving device. Like a brain, as more people are added to the network, with quicker connections between them, the solution-seeking parts of society will become more effective. A few will ignore the signs of harm and pursue profits unencumbered by a conscience, but they will be outnumbered. Those wanting to help increase the pace of change can take to the streets demanding action but, in between the protests, they can dedicate their time, skills and money to improving the tools of change: laws and technology."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2015/may/04/russia-climate-change-vladimir-putin-sochi-olympics-gay-pride","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-04T16:57:40Z","webTitle":"Russia: the unsustainable superpower","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/04/russia-climate-change-vladimir-putin-sochi-olympics-gay-pride","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/04/russia-climate-change-vladimir-putin-sochi-olympics-gay-pride","fields":{"headline":"Russia: the unsustainable superpower","bodyText":"It’s been a world superpower for most of the past century, but Russia still faces enormous sustainable development challenges – challenges that are compounded by economic sanctions that are sending its economy into recession territory. The country’s infrastructure, building and manufacturing stock all suffer from extreme energy inefficiency: a recent World Bank study found that efficiency improvements in Russia could cut its energy consumption by 45%, an amount equal to France’s total annual energy consumption. Income inequality is a similarly profound obstacle to progress in Russia, with some reports suggesting that Russia’s wealth gap is the worst in the world. In particular, a report from Credit Suisse found that just 110 Russian citizens hold 35% of the nation’s household wealth. Then there are Russia’s environmental problems: in the Russian Federation, fossil fuels are king. Not only do oil, gas and coal produce 90% of the country’s energy, they are also responsible for more than half of the federal government’s budget. Aside from hydroelectric and nuclear power, Russia’s non-fossil fuel energy resources are fledgling, almost to the point of nonexistence. As global warming melts the world’s permafrost over the course of this century, up to two thirds of Russia’s gargantuan landmass may become swampland, further devastating infrastructure and livelihoods. The official Kremlin response to global warming he been less than encouraging: in the past, Vladimir Putin has said that “two or three degrees” of warming could be good for Russia because residents wouldn’t need to spend as much on fur coats. That philosophy can’t withstand the real-world effects of climate change in the country, perhaps most notably the incredible 2010 drought – which NASA scientist James Hansen and others have statistically linked to climate change in several studies – that decimated Russia’s wheat crop and sent global wheat prices soaring. But if Russia faces the same panoply of environmental challenges as the rest of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries – and the rest of the world – those challenges are being dwarfed by the country’s social and political challenges. Lately isolated from the West by economic sanctions in the wake of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, the country’s government has responded by cracking down on foreign participation in domestic affairs. In 2012, the Russian government adopted a strict new Foreign Agents Law that requires politically active NGOs that receive international funding to register as foreign agents, which is, as Human Rights Watch explains, “a term generally understood in Russia to mean ‘traitor’ or ‘spy’”. The definition of political activity has been so broadly applied that it includes policy advocacy aimed at addressing social and environmental woes. Several human rights and environmental groups face fines and criminal prosecution after being labeled as foreign agents in July. In its database, Radio Free Europe – which is compiling a comprehensive list of NGOs facing punishment as foreign agents in Russia – notes that, among many other groups, Transparency International Russia received a foreign agents warning in April stating that it “seeks to shape public opinion on state policies, particularly on law enforcement and the legislative process”. In the past three years, the law has resulted in a crackdown on pro-democracy groups. Citations under the law have led the US Agency for International Development being expelled after 20 years of work in Russia. The country also has come under fire for its civil rights issues. It faced allegations of corruption around the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. It also became a battleground for gay rights during the games, with widespread boycotts, protests and demonstrations, after the country enacted an anti-gay law and Putin said gay people would not be harassed as long as they “leave children alone”. Those controversies compounded international objections that began after Russian punk band Pussy Riot was jailed for nearly two years for a musical protest at a cathedral in Moscow. In this political environment, the social and environmental may look bleak – and it’s long odds that anything will change dramatically very soon. But that’s not to say there isn’t any good news coming out of Russia. Despite the foreign agents law, the country is home to a broad network of environmental and social NGOs working locally and regionally, and winning some success. In the wake of the Chernobyl meltdown in 1986, the country enshrined strong environmental protection principles in its constitution. The challenge, of course, is whether those protections will be enforced – a distant likelihood in a country that consistently ranks in the world’s bottom third on the Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index, which measures perceptions of corruption in countries and territories by domestic and international observers. The industries where Russia depends on foreign markets for support appear to be furthest along the path of sustainability. Russia is home to some of the world’s most important fisheries, for instance, and the country’s fishing firms have made sustainability commitments. The walleye pollock fishery in the Sea of Okhotsk has earned the Marine Stewardship Council sustainability certification, and the cod fishery in the Barents Sea also serves as a model of international cooperation on sustainability. Forestry is another area where Russia is a world-leading power: the forests that cover 45% of Russian land account for 22% of the world’s forests. Although progress is slower on sustainable forestry than fishing, more than 33m hectares of Russian forests have already earned the Forestry Stewardship Council certification for responsible forest management, and environmental nonprofit World Wildlife Fund Russia is partnering with Russian forestry companies and multinationals, including TetraPak and Avon, to spread the adoption of FSC’s sustainable forestry management practices. Despite its isolation, Russia casts a big shadow across both Europe and Asia, not least because of its position at the center of the former Soviet Union. And while Ukraine stands most fully in Russia’s shadow – not only because of its ongoing geopolitical conflict with Russia, but also from the economic devastation that has resulted from that conflict – Ukraine is not alone in that shadow. The sanctions levied against Russia by the European Union, the US and others in the wake of the Ukraine crisis have affected countries farther afield as well. After all, Russia retaliated by levying its own sanctions, including a ban on food imports from EU members. This has eliminated about €320m ($358m) in produce sales from Poland to Russia, devastating Polish apple producers. Even as some European producers have been harmed by Russia’s sanction, some Russian producers have seen it as a great boon, even if sanctions in both directions have made the markets more volatile. In Russia’s Far East, the nation is entangled with China, Mongolia and other Asian nations, especially in energy and fisheries projects. Ongoing sanctions from the West could end up strengthening ties between Russia and its Asian neighbors: last month, China and Russia announced the formation a $200m joint clean tech incubator. Although Russia’s transformation into a hub of clean energy innovation seems like a long shot, it also seems equally necessary. As its economy shrinks, a dramatic change of course may be the only move that will prevent Russia from a backward slide out of the realm of global economic powerhouses.

Now agreement has been reached with EDF on the key commercial terms of an investment contract, we can look forward confidently to the first new nuclear power station in a generation being built at Hinkley Point. This is a very good deal for Britain – for the economy and for jobs, for energy security and for the environment and, crucially, for bill-payers. It is a clear sign of confidence in the energy market reforms the government is introducing. They are unlocking investment even before they become law. Britain needs to have one of the most attractive investment markets for electricity in the world. Why? Because to replace the old and dirty power stations closing down over the next decade, we need £110bn of investment in networks and new electricity generating capacity. And a great deal of this needs to be low-carbon power if we are to keep climate change to the manageable levels the world’s scientific community have agreed. This is the government’s biggest infrastructure challenge. Since 2010, we have seen £35 billion invested in new electricity infrastructure. But most of this has been in renewables and hardly any of this has been in nuclear power. Vital though renewables are, alone they cannot fill our future electricity gap. Given it is such a low carbon source of electricity that's where nuclear comes in. Nuclear power has been an ever present staple of Britain’s energy mix since the 1950s. At points in our history nuclear power has been responsible for as much as a quarter of our electricity. But since Sizewell B connected to the grid in 1995, no new power stations have been commissioned. And nuclear’s place in the electricity mix has been steadily falling. Eight of the nine operational nuclear power stations in the UK will reach the end of their planned life in the next decade. We have known for years that this was coming, but no one was willing to make the tough decisions about how to deal with it. This government has. Once completed, Hinkley Point C will provide a stable source of low-carbon, climate-friendly power for nearly six million homes – twice the number of homes in London. It will supply 7% of the UK’s electricity at full capacity. Nuclear represents a significant low-carbon opportunity. The electricity it produces is green and reliable. With new nuclear designs we can be assured that the safety lessons of the past have been learned. And from the outset, the operator will be required to put money aside to cover decommissioning costs and a share of the waste management costs. So the question has come down to affordability and whether we can produce nuclear power without over-burdening bill-payers. In reaching this point, the government has been careful to strike the right balance with EDF. We will continue to work to ensure that the final investment contract, based on these key terms, provides an attractive proposition for EDF and its investors as well as a good deal for UK consumers. The government’s policy is that no support will be given to new nuclear unless similar support is provided to other types of low-carbon generation – and that is precisely what our electricity market reforms achieve. And to protect consumers we have had unprecedented access to EDF’s books, allowing us to verify the balance of risk and return and make sure the developer has a fair, but not excessive, rate of return. The developers will receive a so-called strike price for the electricity produced at Hinkley Point C of £89.50 per megawatt hour, fully indexed to CPI. This is good value for money compared to the alternative. Our full nuclear programme would see consumer bills reduced by around 10% compared to a non-nuclear future. The strike price is competitive with large scale renewables and with gas-fired generation, based on current projections. It also provides price certainty in a volatile market. We have pre-agreed arrangements to make sure the deal stays fair over time, including ensuring consumers can benefit from any gains made from the project coming in under budget, or from future refinancing or equity sales. But these are not the only benefits for the people of Britain. Hinkley Point C will inject £16bn into the economy – with the potential for British firms to get the majority of the work. During construction, up to 25,000 jobs will be created, with a peak of around 5,600 jobs on-site. There will be around 900 permanent jobs at the plant during its operating life. It will increase long-term energy security and resilience. Hinkley Point C will be a reliable, home-grown source of electricity that reduces our reliance on foreign gas imports and the associated volatile prices. This this is not a deal at any price. This is a deal at the right price. This is a significant step on the path to realising a safe and dependable source of clean power for millions of homes, jobs for thousands of skilled workers, a boost to the economy and reductions in electricity bills over the long-term. It secures Britain’s nuclear future, and it secures Britain’s low-carbon future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/sep/19/japan-2040-nuclear-power-exit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-19T12:16:46Z","webTitle":"Japan drops plans to phase out nuclear power by 2040","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/19/japan-2040-nuclear-power-exit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/sep/19/japan-2040-nuclear-power-exit","fields":{"headline":"Japan drops plans to phase out nuclear power by 2040","bodyText":"Japan has effectively abandoned a commitment to end its reliance on nuclear power by 2040 amid pressure from the country's business lobby, dropping a deadline recommended by a cabinet panel only days ago. The cabinet on Tuesday gave only a vague endorsement of the panel's report, released last Friday, and dropped any mention of plans to complete the phase-out some time in the 2030s. The trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, acknowledged that meeting the target date could prove impossible. \"Whether we can become nuclear free by the 2030s is not something to be achieved only with a decision by policy-makers,\" he said. \"It also depends on the will of [electricity] users, technological innovation and the environment for energy internationally in the next decade or two.\" The U-turn came after sustained pressure from business and industry leaders, who said the move would harm the economy by forcing firms to shift production overseas due to the high price of imported oil and gas. The panel's recommendation was based on a two-month public consultation on Japan's future energy mix, in which the no-nuclear option proved far more popular than two other choices that involved a limited role for nuclear. Instead, the cabinet said it would take the policy document \"into consideration\" and listen to the views of the public, the nuclear industry, businesses, and communities that depend on atomic facilities for jobs. The energy review was ordered after the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi power plant in March 2011 shook public confidence in the safety of nuclear power plants. The deputy prime minister, Katsuya Okada, said ditching the deadline did not mean the government had abandoned its goal of a nuclear-free future. \"We aim to have zero nuclear power by the 2030s, but we have never said we will achieve zero by that date,\" he told a group of European journalists. But he conceded that a nuclear phase-out was \"the wish of a large number of Japanese people\". Data released last month showed 90% of comments solicited from the public during the consultation favoured the abolition of nuclear power, while only 4% wanted it to remain part of the country's future energy mix. Okada said the government had to consider the rising cost of power production many predict will result from the phase-out and a greater dependence on fossil fuels, as well as their impact on Japan's climate change commitments. The report says Japan should aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 20% from 1990 levels and to reduce energy consumption through greater efficiency by about 10% from 2010 levels. The plan also calls for renewable energy to comprise about 30% of Japan's future energy mix and the development of sustainable ways to use fossil fuels. All but two of Japan's nuclear 50 reactors have been shut down to undergo safety checks ordered after last year's earthquake and tsunami disaster triggered the world's worst nuclear accident for 25 years. Two nuclear plants under construction have been given permission to restart; the 40-year limit on the lifetime of nuclear reactors means those plants could remain in operation until the early 2050s. Japan depended on nuclear for about 30% of its electricity before the accident, and had plans to increase its share to 50%. Anti-nuclear campaigners criticised the launch on Wednesday of a new nuclear regulatory authority, whose predecessor was blamed for being part of a culture that contributed to the Fukushima disaster. Kazue Suzuki of Greenpeace Japan said that by appointing people to the body who were \"heavily involved\" in nuclear power generation, \"the government is once again setting up the regulator for failure and endangering the health and safety of Japan's people and its economy\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/gallery/2012/jul/02/nuclear-power-proests-japan-pictures","type":"gallery","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-02T11:07:00Z","webTitle":"Nuclear plant protests in Japan - in pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2012/jul/02/nuclear-power-proests-japan-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/gallery/2012/jul/02/nuclear-power-proests-japan-pictures","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power protests in Japan - in pictures","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2015/dec/26/2016-year-ahead-living-precariously-politics-sport-arts-environment-science","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-26T23:00:01Z","webTitle":"2016: The year of living precariously","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/dec/26/2016-year-ahead-living-precariously-politics-sport-arts-environment-science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2015/dec/26/2016-year-ahead-living-precariously-politics-sport-arts-environment-science","fields":{"headline":"2016: The year of living precariously","bodyText":"POLITICS Daniel Boffey, policy editor, sees a tough year ahead for the two main party leaders Earlier this month, David Cameron gave the clearest hint yet that the in/out EU referendum will take place in 2016, probably in June or July. “I believe 2016 will be the year we achieve something really vital, fundamentally changing the UK’s relationship with the EU and finally addressing the concerns of the British people about our membership,” said the prime minister of his planned renegotiations, which will be followed by the poll on whether the British public is happy to stay in on the new terms, whatever they may be. Over the past two years Cameron has headed off (just) the break-up of the UK through Scottish independence and enjoyed what he called his “sweetest” electoral victory. Dashing Ed Miliband’s hopes, of a shift leftwards in British political thinking, he delivered the first Tory majority government since New Labour pushed John Major out of Downing Street in 1997. But the nerves are jangling about this one. A series of polls in recent weeks place those who support leaving the EU quite comfortably ahead of those who would stay in. The Conservative pollster Lord Ashcroft has 47% of British voters keen to leave, markedly more than the 38% who said they wanted to maintain Britain’s membership. It is true that the standing of pollsters took a hit when the general election result bore little similarity to their predictions. It is also true that Cameron has yet to unveil, or indeed strike, a deal that renews Britain’s relationship with the EU. But even given these caveats, Downing Street aides, and those at the top of the Labour party, say they fear the result of the EU referendum may be frighteningly close. Cameron’s renegotiation with EU member states is scheduled to come to a close in February. A key test for many will be whether he is able to offer the British public any hope that migration within the EU can be controlled. The scenes witnessed on the fringes of Europe – on the Greek island of Lesbos, and elsewhere – where thousands of refugees have flocked to find security and build a new life have done little to assuage fears that the UK is currently incapable of looking after its borders. Cameron’s Plan A on EU migration – a ban on EU nationals claiming in-work benefits for their first four years in the UK – is unlikely to find many supporters. A compelling alternative has yet to emerge. From the EU poll result, much else will follow. Should the country choose to leave the EU against Cameron’s recommendation, it is inconceivable that he would stay on for very long, having already said he will leave by 2020. That will fire the starting gun proper on the Tory leadership contest. The shadow boxing between the chancellor George Osborne, home secretary Theresa May, London mayor Boris Johnson and education secretary Nicky Morgan, among others, will become a full-on blood sport. Should Britain stay in the EU, one can expect the prime minister to leave his departure to late in the five-year parliament, but the jockeying for position among the candidates could well prove debilitating for the government and for Cameron, who will struggle to dispel the impression that he is a lame-duck prime minister. Meanwhile, on the subject of leadership, the challenge for Jeremy Corbyn – after he (just about) overcame early hurdles including the Oldham byelection – will come in the May local elections and the London mayoral election. A loss of Labour councils and the defeat of Labour’s Sadiq Khan to the old Etonian Zac Goldsmith would be a tremendous blow to Corbyn’s claims to represent a new politics, capable of galvanising the non-voters. It would be the time for the plotters, and they are many, to strike. But only time will tell if Corbyn can upset the odds in 2016 as he did in 2015. Or, indeed, whether the plotters have the will to act when it comes to doing so. SCIENCE This could be the year dark matter comes in from the cold, writes Robin McKie The hunt is closing in on dark matter. And 2016 may well be the year in which this elusive set of particles, which account for a vast, invisible chunk of the universe’s mass, are detected. If so, one of the holy grails of modern physics will finally have been achieved. It is a prospect backed by Cambridge astrophysicist Gerry Gilmore. “Next year we will see a major transition in the hunt for dark matter,” he says. “Until now, the odds of finding it have been around one in 100. Next year, they will jump to one in five or better – so we could easily find dark matter in 2016.” Most of the universe’s mass – about 85% – is thought to be made of dark matter, a rain of invisible particles that provide galaxies with sufficient gravitational force to hold themselves together. This is the dark side of the force – in this case of the force of gravity – though the impact of dark matter is actually benign. Without it, galaxies would fly apart. We therefore owe our existence to dark matter, although the stuff has proved to be awkwardly elusive to date. However, three very different projects have reached fruition and could transform scientists’ fortunes in 2016. The first is the Large Hadron Collider, which has been upgraded since it was used to discover the Higgs boson in 2012. “It should start to generate particles that could include some of those responsible for dark matter – and in the very near future,” says Gilmore. In addition, underground laboratories are now being built with increasing sensitivity and could soon pinpoint naturally occurring dark matter particles as they fly through the Earth. At the same time, the European star-mapper satellite, Gaia, will this summer produce details of two million stars whose movements have been charted with extraordinary precision. These results will help scientists understand the influence of dark matter in the area of the galaxy around our solar system, and help refine the hunt. Intriguingly, the particles believed to make up dark matter are known as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, which means – if dark matter is found in the next 12 months – that 2016 would become the Year of the Wimp. “It’s a real prospect,” says Gilmore. Closer to home, the European Space Agency will be returning to Mars with the launch, in March, of its first ExoMars mission. Scheduled to reach the red planet in October, the robot craft will study the Martian atmosphere in a bid to identify trace gases, in particular methane – the latter being a possible signature of primitive, bacteria-like life forms that might be thriving on Mars. The mission will then be followed in 2018 with a second, even more ambitious ExoMars probe – one that will land a robot rover on the planet’s surface. Fitted with a drill and a suite of instruments, it will attempt to pinpoint and study any lifeforms. There will be two other highlights for space travel in 2016. The first will be the return to Earth of Tim Peake, Britain’s first official astronaut, after his six-month tour of duty on the International Space Station. He is scheduled to land in mid-June after completing a mission that is expected to include space walks and other activities. Then, in July, the US Juno probe will reach Jupiter after a five-year journey. The craft will study Jupiter’s atmosphere and its water content, its magnetic and gravity fields, and its deep structure in order to improve our understanding of the origins of the solar system. Back on Earth, in the wake of this month’s climate negotiations, government and companies will be trying to turn the promises that were made in Paris into reality. One focus of attention will be a Swiss company which, according to the journal Nature, is set to become the first firm to capture carbon dioxide from the air and sell it on a commercial scale, a key step that could become a useful tool in combating global warming. Around July, Climeworks will start capturing around 75 tonnes of CO2 per month at its plant near Zurich before selling the gas to greenhouses to boost crop growth. ARTS Vanessa Thorpe, arts correspondent, looks ahead to a year of anniversaries The blizzard of cultural anniversaries marked in recent months might have induced a certain fatigue, but 2016 does promise several dates that will be hard to ignore. Looming large are the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death and the Brontë Sisters’ bicentenary (marking 200 years since Charlotte’s birth). Stratford-upon-Avon and Haworth Parsonage, the two geographical centres for fans of the Bard and the Brontës respectively, have been gearing up for these landmarks for months. William Shakespeare, who died in April 1616, quite possibly while he was celebrating his 52nd birthday, will be honoured in a show at the British Library called Shakespeare in Ten Acts, running from 15 April to 6 September. It will examine 10 key performances in his life, with displays of diary entries, playbills, and the only surviving script in his own hand. The National Archives in London will get in a month earlier with a rare opportunity to look at the playwright’s will and other personal documents. The Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company will be bringing Shakespeare into cinemas in July with a live broadcast of a new production of Romeo and Juliet at the Garrick, starring Lily James and Richard Madden, last seen swirling around together in Branagh’s film Cinderella. There is further anniversary competition from two giants of British children’s literature: 2016 is the 100th anniversary of the birth of Roald Dahl and the 150th of Beatrix Potter’s and both lives will be widely celebrated. Cardiff, Dahl’s schoolboy home, is launching a series of events called City of the Unexpected, while in February the Beatrix Potter Gallery in Hawkshead, Cumbria, will mount a show called Realism and Romance: Beatrix Potter, a life inspired by nature. Egyptian history stays in vogue, with the British Museum following its successful shows of Egyptian artefacts by bringing up more booty from underwater. Sunken Cities: Egypt’s Lost Worlds opens on 19 May. There will be extra Egypt at London’s Coliseum in March, when the English National Opera stages Philip Glass’s Akhnaten, a study of the pharoah’s life, for the first time in London in almost three decades. Conductor Karen Kamensek, a Glass specialist, will make her ENO debut. The South Bank of the Thames will be shaken up on 17 June with the opening of Tate Modern’s grand extension into the old Switch House, increasing its display space by 60%. Meanwhile its sister, Tate Britain, will be looking back at the early days of Conceptual Art in Britain, from 1964-1979. The show will remind us of the deeper roots of this provocative school of work, and feature artists Michael Craig-Martin and Richard Long among many. In the summer the National Gallery will take the imaginative step of looking at the great art owned by other famous painters. Visitors will see Van Dyck’s Titian, Joshua Reynold’s Rembrandt, and Matisse’s Degas. We will learn how they got hold of these works and what influence they had in Painters’ Paintings, which opens on 22 June. At the Yorkshire Sculpture Park near Wakefield, the monumental style of the American artist known as KAWS will go on display from 6 February. Street art, designs, murals and large sculptures have made the Brooklyn-based pop artist a star, and his bright canvases and towering glass-fibre forms will be on show for the first time in Britain at the Longside Gallery. While the 40 years that have passed since the birth of the punk movement are to be celebrated across London next year (especially at the British Library show Punk 1976-78 from May), the biggest headlines in the capital are likely to be inspired either by the Rolling Stones show Exhibitionism, running from April at the Saatchi Gallery in Chelsea, or by the Victoria and Albert museum’s naughty exhibition Undressed: A Brief History of Underwear, which also starts in April. It looks as if the singer/songwriter trend will still be shaping rock and pop in the next 12 months. Highlights are likely to include Jake Bugg’s third album in the spring and appearances from James Bay at some of the big summer festivals, such as Manchester’s Sounds of the City in July, where he will join Guy Garvey of Elbow fame. Among the newcomers in this moody, but crowded, field are Barns Courtney, who was sleeping rough in London until earlier this year. He is now widely tipped to do exciting stuff in 2016 with a sound that has been likened to a blend of Johnny Cash and Beck, incorporating the American influences he picked up as a child living for a while in Seattle. Also coming up fast is British hip-hop performer Loyle Carner, while Norwegian DJ Kygo is a good bet to become the fastest artist ever to reach a billion Spotify streams. The music site named him as its breakthrough artist of the year. Kygo has already sold 1.4m singles in Britain and his two tour shows in Brixton, south London, in April are sold out. Anticipation is building among Libertines fans ahead of their January tour, while Elvis Costello’s loyal followers will have to wait until May for his four dates at the London Palladium. The Beliebers have a much longer wait before Justin Bieber’s’s much hyped Purpose World Tour makes it to London and then Birmingham in October. TECHNOLOGY Facebook will try to make our lives even easier, says Ian Tucker, but at a price There are now over 600 million people using Facebook’s Messenger – last year it was the fastest-growing app in the US, with a 31% increase in users. That’s an awful lot of people enjoying #topbantz, but if all goes to Facebook’s plan this coming year, the throng will be joined by an increasing number of business and services wanting to chat, too. How might this work? Imagine you and your Messenger pals are organising an evening out on the town. You need to book taxis, find a table at a restaurant and reserve a VIP area and several chilled magnums at your favourite after-party venue – wouldn’t it be easier if you could make your arrangements not only with your friends but also with taxi companies, restaurants and bars without leaving the app? That way all your friends could have a say in how the evening’s schedule takes shape, without entrusting the arrangements to one person and their dubious decision-making skills. As Jessica Ekholm of technology research company Gartner explains: “We are moving towards the post-app era, moving away from apps as channels towards a seamless experience – you can do several things from within the application rather than opening other apps.” Linking up with Messenger appeals to businesses because their data tells them that every prompt to download an app, register and input payment details leads to potential customers bailing out. It is fairly typical that 50-60% of an online retailer’s traffic is on mobile but that mobile only accounts of 10-12% of sales. Merchants need to convert smartphone users into buyers. Moreover, Facebook would like to keep you glued to its app to maximise the amount of data they can harvest from you for the purposes of placing more ads in front your eyeballs. Somewhat predictably, one of the first services to pop up inside Messenger is Uber, which has been announced as Messenger’s first transportation partner. It’s currently available only in selected US cities, but once the service is rolled out, users will be able to book a ride mid-convo and monitor its progress. That’s the first phase; the second would be corresponding with Uber customer services in chat-bubble style. A similar arrangement is soon to be launched by the airline KLM. Book your ticket, change your itinerary, check-in and receive your boarding pass – all in a few blobs of Messenger. Plenty of other retailers and brands are sure to follow – often with the chat being provided by AI rather than humans. But this enhanced Messenger poses a problem for businesses: do they bother trying to encourage people to download their app or just insert themselves into Messenger’s ready-made 600-million-strong market place? As Andreessen Horowitz analyst Benedict Evans has pointed out, if you plug your startup into Messenger, “you’re not going to be a $10bn company because they aren’t your users; they are all Facebook’s users”. No wonder some commentators have suggested that Messenger could be the app that destroys the app ecosystem. Wired UK suggested Messenger could be “one app to run your life”. And if users are spending the majority of their smartphone time on Facebook and Messenger, Zuckerberg’s employees are gatekeepers to what we see and which businesses can flourish on mobile. They will be setting the terms by which we experience the mobile internet. Also look out for Oculus Rift, Facebook’s much anticipated and delayed virtual reality headset, which is due to be launched in the first quarter of 2016, according to some recent tweets from founder Palmer Luckey. It’s expected to cost around £250 and you will also need a high-end PC to power it. Expect more news to emerge about the Oculus and the rival PlayStation VR and HTC Vive headsets at the CES electronics trade show taking place in Las Vegas in the first week of January. And 2016 may be the year 5G comes of age. The latest turbo-charged version of the mobile network will begin initial testing in the US by Verizon in 2016. Aside from being around 100 times faster than 4G, the new technology will stabilise the operation of self-driving cars and other devices connected to the “internet of things”. Mobile providers in South Korea and Japan also have plans to trial 5G – if all goes to plan it should be generally available by 2020. SPORT Fifa and the Olympics both have tarnished reputations to repair, writes Owen Gibson The two biggest international sporting events of 2016 – football’s European Championship in France and the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro – will begin with clouds over them, albeit for very different reasons. In France, Euro 2016 has become an exercise in defiance. Despite the travails afflicting Fifa, the championship was supposed to be the last grand party before international supporters packed their bags for the expense of the World Cup in Russia in 2018 and the unknown of the tournament in Qatar in 2022. The events of 13 November changed all that, with fears that what promised to be a freewheeling celebration of football across 10 French cities – featuring unlikely qualifiers including Iceland, Wales and Albania – would have to be cloaked in heavy security. But at December’s group draw, French ministers and football officials were insistent that fans should travel in large numbers in defiance of the terrorists that tried to attack the Stade de France. On the pitch, the expansion to 24 teams that has enlivened the qualification process has given rise to a format that could prove somewhat turgid in the group stage but does at least give England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Ireland a chance of progressing. A few weeks later, more than 10,500 athletes will converge on Rio for the first Olympics in South America. When, in 2009, the city won the right to host the biggest jamboree in sport, it was supposed to signal Brazil’s coming of age as an economic superpower on the international stage. It hasn’t quite worked out that way, with an ongoing economic slump forcing budget cuts and giving rise to fears over poor ticket sales. Alongside the now traditional uncertainty over whether the venues will be ready on time, there is a mix of corruption probes, worries over human rights issues and concerns about the pollution in the bay where the sailing will take place. This has left the feelgood buzz that the organisers were hoping for a long way off. As with the World Cup in Brazil in 2014, the hope is that Rio’s natural beauty and the welcoming nature of the hosts will carry the event, even if concerns over an Olympic legacy are more deep-seated than ever, given the growing antipathy towards hosting so-called “mega-events” in many cities around the world. For Team GB, with funding from the lottery and the Treasury recently guaranteed, the task will be to ensure that the heroics of the Games in Beijing in 2008 and London in 2012 don’t come to be seen as a high-water mark in performance terms. Yet there will also be important issues on the track, with the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) facing a crucial decision in March over whether to re-admit Russia after it was suspended as a member in November over a doping scandal. With athletics fans around the world nursing suspicions over the action in front of them, it is possible that not even more heroics from Usain Bolt – competing in his final Games – will be enough to dispel the ill feeling. Forced into action by a dogged investigation by German journalist Hajo Seppelt, and the bravery of Russian whistleblowers, the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) commissioned an inquiry headed by Dick Pound that uncovered the scale of doping in Russia and alleged corruption at the highest levels of the IAAF. Faced with cleaning up a mess created when he himself was vice-president, the IAAF’s new president, Sebastian Coe, has instead found himself increasingly drawn into the crisis. The second part of Wada’s report is due early in the new year and a French criminal investigation into the former IAAF president, Lamine Diack, and his coterie continues. For Coe, too, the glow of London 2012 will feel a long way away. In Switzerland and the US, meanwhile, criminal investigations into the conduct of Fifa executives past and present continue: 35 football officials have already been charged with crimes including money laundering, racketeering and tax evasion. Sepp Blatter, the disgraced Fifa overlord, and his one-time heir apparent, the Uefa president Michel Platini, have both been given lengthy bans from football. But the backdrop of sleaze and suspicion will hang over the game’s governing body long after a new president is elected at the end of February. Structural reform is promised, but without a parallel overhaul of culture and personnel, it is unlikely to have the desired result. For optimists, the hope is that the new year will bring a turning point in the way global sport is run. ENVIRONMENT 2016 is all about following up on this year’s historic climate deal, writes John Vidal So will it be Gatwick or Heathrow? The big cliffhanger of 2016 will be the location of a major new runway in south-east England. The inevitable air and noise pollution resulting from tens of thousands of extra flights a year will be a deciding factor. Whichever airport is chosen, the decision – which will probably be taken in the summer after the government called for more consultation – will inevitably divide the Tory party and lead to protests, resignations, recriminations and evictions. All four leading candidates in May’s London mayoral elections are, unsurprisingly, campaigning hard in favour of Gatwick; George Osborne and David Cameron are known to favour Heathrow on economic grounds. Two international agreements, if secured, will also have long-lasting effects on the British environment. If a referendum on Europe is called, the Brexit camp will have to decide whether to dismantle European environmental legislation, which has set progressively higher standards for air and water pollution, and ruled on matters such as habitat protection, energy efficiency, waste, recycling, noise and farming. If Britain really does leave Europe, much of this could be up for grabs, with deregulation and lower standards a real possibility. Negotiations for a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a free-trade agreement between the US and EU, should be concluded in 2016. The two sides have made limited progress after 11 negotiating rounds, with food, farming and the environment the thorniest issues left to decide. So far, no obligations to ratify international environmental conventions are proposed, and means of enforcing goals on biodiversity, chemicals and the illegal wildlife trade are absent. Campaigners fear that existing rights of countries or regions to regulate industries such as fracking, farming, and food imports could be swept away. Globally, 2016 is expected by the Met Office and others to be the warmest year on record, largely as a result of El Niño, which has led to droughts and food shortages across Africa, Latin America and Asia. It will peak in the next few weeks but can be expected to lead to floods and humanitarian disasters throughout the first half of the year. Following the Paris agreement this month, climate change commitments will drop down the agenda for many pressure groups. In their place are likely to come older, more immediate issues that have been overlooked or played down in the push to get a new climate deal. Air pollution, confirmed as the world’s greatest environmental killer in 2015 by the World Health Organisation, will rise up the agenda, as will conservation and nature protection, which have been slashed to the bone by austerity cuts. Next year will also see a new push by campaigners to ensure adherence to strict EU air pollution laws. Many cities can expect to see new low-emission zones imposed, better air quality monitoring and greater traffic regulation. In London, there will be a fight over proposals for new Thames river crossings and the expansion of City Airport. The future of the Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset will finally be settled, with China expected to demand even greater financial guarantees if it is to help to build other nuclear power stations in the UK. The Treasury, which has come under attack for the £24bn deal done with French company EDF Energy on Hinkley, may have to give ground. Ash dieback and other tree and plant diseases are expected to accelerate in 2016 and Britain will see badger culling extended beyond Devon, Somerset and Gloucestershire. If the price of milk does not rise significantly, Britain could see a massive reduction in the number of small dairy farms. One issue that could go on to the back burner is fracking. Although the UK government is the most enthusiastic advocate of fracking in Europe, it is unlikely to take off in Britain until the oil price recovers. FASHION Modesty is set to be the new buzzword on the catwalk, writes Hannah Marriott Fashion has never been short of divas, egos or peacocks. So it is heartening that the designer most likely to set the agenda in 2016 is a low-key 34-year-old who slouches about in hoodies and trainers, carries his belongings in a paper shopping bag and is barely known outside of the industry. Demna Gvasalia – the unassuming Georgian at the helm of Vetements, the cult Parisian design collective – will present his first collection for Balenciaga in March. Not only does his appointment signal a new direction for one of fashion’s most historic and influential houses, it also highlights wider preoccupations about the way that we think about clothes and what the role of a fashion designer should be. Gvasalia has recently been eulogised by those in the know for producing weirdly fascinating designs – reconstructed fire service T-shirts and floral plastic-coated aprons – at Vetements, a label that has wowed the industry while confounding its expectations. While most fashion houses aim to create dreams and narratives with their collections, Vetements focuses on the nuts and bolts of products. While others look to esoteric references and exotic illusions, Vetements takes inspiration from the street. And while most Parisian fashion houses present their collections in the sumptuous antechambers of historic buildings, Vetements’ shows feature non-professional male and female models in slightly grubby venues – most recently drawing fashion editors and Kanye West to an out-of-town Chinese restaurant. “For me, fashion is something practical,” Gvasalia recently told fashion trade journal WWD. “It’s made to be worn rather than to change things, otherwise you will be an artist. I think and consider myself more like a dress-making brand.” Perhaps the biggest departure from the norm is Vetements’ collaborative ethos: the label is a collection of almost 20 designers, from all corners of the world, many of whom – like Gvasalia – previously worked at Maison Martin Margiela. This ego-free approach to running a label is at odds with the more traditional model of razzle-dazzle showman designer as the sun around which the rest of the team must orbit. Gvasalia’s predecessor at Balenciaga, Alexander Wang, was a young, well-connected selfie-snapping designer with the world’s best-known model on speed dial. Tellingly, when François-Henri Pinault, boss at Balenciaga’s parent company, Kering, announced Gvasalia’s appointment, he praised him for remaining “humble and rigorous in his creative work”. Hiring a “humble” designer to focus on clothes, not fanfare, is something much of the industry is now considering following the huge and unexpected success of the hitherto unknown Alessandro Michele at Gucci. After a raft of departures at fashion’s biggest names in 2015 – Raf Simons left Dior in the hands of its in-house creative team in October; Lanvin is short of a creative director after the acrimonious departure of Alber Elbaz – the big question will be whether these houses will turn to similarly under-the-radar names to safeguard their futures. In any case, the biggest fashion buzzwords of 2016 – modesty, anonymity, industry – are likely to be delivered in a whisper. ECONOMICS Phillip Inman forecasts another year of rising house prices and low interest rates George Osborne has set a path for steady expansion built on slightly looser austerity (after the Lords’ tax credit victory), ushering in another year of surging house prices and the likelihood of a bumper year for migrants after Britain reached another employment milestone in 2015 – a record 31 million people in work. Net migration surged past the 300,000 barrier this year and is expected to do so again in 2016. As usual, house prices will be a major talking point, largely as a result of Britain’s stuck-in-the-mud housebuilding industry and ultra-low interest rates. Ministers have, with little to show for their efforts, tackled one supply-side blockage after another in an effort to boost house building. As most people in the industry recognise, a doubling of the current 130,000 new homes a year to meet new targets is going to need a massive injection of funding to the public sector and housing associations, which is not planned until 2020. Another spur for house prices will be the Bank of England’s ultra-low interest rates, which will stay in place for another year. There may be a rise of 0.25 percentage points in line with the recent US rate increase, but that is unlikely to deter first-time buyers. Nesta, the innovation thinktank, said in its look ahead to 2016 that the pace of change in the economy is only likely to get faster. It said some headline-grabbing companies, which have disrupted longstanding rivals to make their profits, are going to be disrupted themselves. It believes the likes of Amazon, eBay, Uber and the Chinese trading site Alibaba, which have done so much to undermine the revenues of high street shops and traditional black cabs, could come under attack from software that dispenses with the need for intermediaries. “What if there were a technological solution to fully disintermediate between people wishing to transact with each other?” it asks. “A way of directly transacting with anyone, in a way that was invulnerable to fraud, in a system that nobody actually owned, so no one took a commission?” That day is not far off. Solar power is another “disruptive” that Osborne decided might disturb his plans for mass fracking in the north, west and across the South Downs. The chancellor cut the subsidies to solar generators by 65%; he originally proposed slashing them by 85%. But solar panels can now be made so cheaply that they will become an ordinary sight in many countries, especially those within 30 degrees of the equator. • This article was amended on 28 December 2015. 2016 marks the 400th anniversary of Sharkespeare’s death, not his birth as we had it in the original version of this story."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/blog/2012/jul/02/does-japan-need-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-02T11:56:09Z","webTitle":"Open thread: does Japan need nuclear power?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2012/jul/02/does-japan-need-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/blog/2012/jul/02/does-japan-need-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Open thread: does Japan need nuclear power?","bodyText":"After the Fukushima nuclear disaster caused by last year's earthquake and tsunami, all 50 of Japan's working nuclear reactors were turned off. The decision was taken to take the reactors offline to complete routine maintenance. As a result the country has been without nuclear power since 5 May this year – the first time since 1970, when the then reactors were shut for maintenance for five days. Remarking on the decision in June to turn the Ohi reactor back on, the Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, said: \"Cheap and stable electricity is vital. If all the reactors that previously provided 30% of Japan's electricity supply are halted, or kept idle, Japanese society cannot survive.\" Supporters of the restart have warned that, without nuclear power, utilities would be more dependent on fossil fuels, driving up electricity bills and putting Japan's climate change obligations at risk. On Sunday the Ohi nuclear plant's reactor No 3 was restarted, despite protests from anti-nuclear activists and concerns from the Japanese public over the safety of nuclear power since Fukushima. Are the protesters' concerns valid? Would Japan be able to operate without nuclear power?

Despite the clear scientific consensus, a veritable brigade of self-proclaimed, underinformed armchair experts lurk on comment threads the world over, eager to pour scorn on climate science. Barrages of ad hominem attacks all too often await both the scientists working in climate research and journalists who communicate the research findings. The nay-sayers insist loudly that they're \"climate sceptics\", but this is a calculated misnomer – scientific scepticism is the method of investigating whether a particular hypothesis is supported by the evidence. Climate sceptics, by contrast, persist in ignoring empirical evidence that renders their position untenable. This isn't scepticism, it's unadulterated denialism, the very antithesis of critical thought. Were climate change denialism confined solely to the foaming comment threads of the internet it would be bad enough, but this is not the case – publications such as the Daily Mail, Wall Street Journal and other Murdoch publications give editorial support to this view. Worse still, a depressingly large number of denialists hold office around the world. Australia's Tony Abbot decreed climate change to be \"a load of crap\", and a sizable chunk of the US Republican Party declare it a fiction. Even in the UK, spending on climate change countermeasures has halved under the environment secretary Owen Paterson, who doubts the reality of anthropogenic climate change, despite the fact the vast majority of scientists say unequivocally that the smoking gun is in our hands. So given the evidence is so strong against them, then why do these beliefs garner such passionate, vocal support? It's tempting to say the problem is a simple misunderstanding, because increasing average global temperature can have paradoxical and counterintuitive repercussions, such as causing extreme cold snaps. The obvious response to this misunderstanding is to elucidate the scientific details more clearly and more often. The problem is that the well-meaning and considered approach hinges on the presupposition that the intended audience is always rational, willing to base or change its position on the balance of evidence. However, recent investigations suggests this might be a supposition too far. A study in 2011 found that conservative white males in the US were far more likely than other Americans to deny climate change. Another study found denialism in the UK was more common among politically conservative individuals with traditional values. A series of investigations published last year by Prof Stephan Lewandowsky and his colleagues – including one with the fantastic title, Nasa Faked the Moon Landing – Therefore, (Climate) Science Is a Hoax: An Anatomy of the Motivated Rejection of Science – found that while subjects subscribing to conspiracist thought tended to reject all scientific propositions they encountered, those with strong traits of conservatism or pronounced free-market world views only tended to reject scientific findings with regulatory implications. It should be no surprise that the voters and politicians opposed to climate change tend to be of a conservative bent, keen to support free-market ideology. This is part of a phenomenon known as motivated reasoning, where instead of evidence being evaluated critically, it is deliberately interpreted in such a way as to reaffirm a pre-existing belief, demanding impossibly stringent examination of unwelcome evidence while accepting uncritically even the flimsiest information that suits one's needs. The great psychologist Leon Festinger observed in 1956 that \"a man with a conviction is a hard man to change. Tell him you disagree and he turns away. Show him facts or figures and he questions your sources. Appeal to logic and he fails to see your point.\" This is the essence of the problem, and sadly, Festinger's words ring true today: the conviction of humans is all too often impervious to the very evidence in front of them. Motivated reasoning is not solely the preserve of conservatives. While nuclear power has been recognised by the IPCC as important in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, staunch and uninformed opposition to nuclear power arises often from the liberal aisle. In the furore over the Fukushima nuclear disaster (which has claimed no lives and probably never will) many environmentalists lost sight of the fact that it was a natural disaster, very possibly exacerbated by climate change, that cost thousands of lives. Instead, they've rushed to condemn nuclear power plants. Angela Merkel's decision to cut nuclear power stations was celebrated by Green activists, but this victory was utterly pyrrhic as they were replaced by heavily polluting coal plants. Nor could it be considered a health victory, as while nuclear power kills virtually no one, 1.3 million people a year die as a result of pollution from coal-burning plants. Greenpeace remains stubbornly opposed to even considering nuclear power, and has said it is simply too dangerous claiming a figure of over 200,000 deaths and hugely increased incidence of cancers due to the Chernobyl disaster, a statistic exposed as an utter shambles by the journal Radiation Protection Dosimetry. The health effects of Chernobyl have been well studied over 25 years by the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation: 28 workers died from acute radiation syndrome, and there were 15 fatal thyroid cancers in children. Those who ingested radioiodine immediately after the disaster are at elevated risk of thyroid cancer. No increase has been observed in solid cancers or birth defects. That this toll is considerably less than people might expect does not take away from the tragedy, but highlights the fact that motivated reasoning occurs on all sides. The problem is that a vital discussion on a scientific issue can be hijacked as a proxy for deep-seated ideological differences. Depressingly, increasing communication of science merely tends to harden existing opinion. Part of the solution may be to take into consideration the values that impede meaningful progress; there is some evidence that climate change denialists become less hostile when given options which do not obviously threaten their world view. If the facts of the matter inspire an emotional threat reaction, perhaps this can be mitigated by framing it as something not incompatible to one's world view. A free-market advocate, for example, might respond better to an argument outlining the economic cost of climate change or the fact inaction has a higher price tag than action. Nor is there any inherent contradiction in an environmentalist being in favour of nuclear power – George Monbiot, Mark Lynas and James Lovelock have written eloquently on the importance of nuclear power in mitigating the ravages of climate change. If we truly wish to avoid catastrophe, we must be pragmatic and take action. Ideological differences need to take a back seat if decisive action is to be taken. When one's house is on fire, the immediate priority should be putting the flames out, not squabbling about the insurance. Let us hope we realise this before it's too late.

The UK government analysis also assumes that billions of people will remain in dire poverty at mid-century, despite efforts to lift them to greater prosperity, as the population rises to an estimated nine billion people. Dealing with greenhouse gas emissions will require a transformation of electricity generation, including an expansion of renewable energy and nuclear power, as well as more public transport and changes to the built environment, according to the key findings of the Global Calculator, an online software tool developed by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), with partners. The calculator is intended to show the likely outcomes of a variety of choices that policymakers and the public can make to tackle global warming, such as investing in nuclear, insulating houses, making electrical appliances more efficient and using electric vehicles. Some of the findings are likely to be controversial. The analysis suggests that to cope with the food demands of a rising population, much more land will need to be brought under cultivation, which could have harmful side effects on biodiversity, and genetically modified crops may be needed to boost yields. Far more intensive agriculture will be necessary, with the amount of beef raised in confined systems – vast cattle warehouses in which the animals rarely or never see grass – accounting for as much as 15% of the global herd by mid-century. Consumers must also switch away from eating beef to poultry and vegetables. The analysis also found that deforestation must be halted and the extent of forested land increased by between 5% and 15% by 2050 – a mammoth task, given the failure of efforts so far to halt forest destruction. However, the analysis depends on several key factors. For instance, within the emissions limits required to hold global warming to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels, in theory it ought to be possible for everyone in the world to travel 12,400km a year, up from an average of 8,300km a year at present. Currently, people in the US travel an average of 16,000km a year, and in the EU about 10,000km, while the average Indian travels 6,000km and Chinese less than 2,000km a year. So the increases in air travel in the developed world seen in recent years, thanks to the proliferation of cheap flights, will have to be severely limited in future to stay within these levels. Similarly, nutrition that fulfils our daily needs, of 2,100 calories a day, is possible for the entire planet, but is unlikely to reach everyone without a transformation in global equity. According to the models used to develop the calculator, billions of people are likely to remain in poverty at mid-century, and they are unlikely to benefit much in the form of the better nutrition, better housing or increases in travel which are theoretically possible. Decc officials were unable to tell the Guardian what the emissions outcomes were likely to be if campaigners succeeded in “making poverty history”. The cost of meeting the 2C scenario was likely to be about 2% to 3% of global GDP annually, on average, between now and 2050, the officials said. Anyone can use the tool to experiment with different possible future scenarios, for instance by seeing how much renewable energy would have to be generated in a future where nuclear energy was avoided, where other emissions cuts would have to come from if people took many more flights than they do today, or how much land could be freed up for forests if more people adhered to a mostly vegetarian diet. Ed Davey, secretary of state for energy and climate change, said: “For the first time, this calculator shows that everyone in the world can prosper while limiting global temperature rises to 2C, preventing the most serious impacts of climate change. Yet the calculator is also very clear that we must act now to change how we use and generate energy and how we use our land if we are going to achieve this green growth.” Campaigners welcomed the tool as showing that action on climate change was compatible with prosperous lifestyles for much of the world. Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said: “The need for urgent action to avoid dangerous climate change is well accepted, but the steps we should take are often hotly contested. This excellent tool enables everyone to play the role of world leader and make decisions on the action we should take in key areas such as energy, manufacturing and farming. “It shows we can still avoid the world warming by much less than 2C above pre-industrial levels – all we need is the will to act. This calculator demonstrates to our political leaders that a cleaner, safer, fairer world is possible.” The tool is being offered to other governments, for use in the run-up to crunch negotiations in Paris at the end of this year, at which a new global agreement on emissions, to come into force after 2020, is supposed to be signed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jan/06/uk-accused-hypocrisy-plans-limit-enforcement-eu-climate-goals","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-06T16:18:31Z","webTitle":"UK accused of hypocrisy over plans to limit enforcement of EU climate goals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/06/uk-accused-hypocrisy-plans-limit-enforcement-eu-climate-goals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jan/06/uk-accused-hypocrisy-plans-limit-enforcement-eu-climate-goals","fields":{"headline":"UK accused of hypocrisy over plans to limit enforcement of EU climate goals","bodyText":"British lobbying to reduce monitoring of EU countries’ action on climate change has sparked outrage among MEPs and environmentalists. EU states agreed last October to cut their carbon emissions 40% by 2030, but a UK plan co-authored with the Czech Republic proposes that countries’ emissions cuts should only be overseen with a ‘light touch’ regime with a diminished role for Brussels. The unpublished paper places equal emphasis on business competitiveness and greenhouse gas reductions. It also calls for nuclear power and experimental carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to be given the same status as renewable sources, such as wind and solar power, and energy efficiency. “It is very worrying that the UK government is now discussing how to ensure a light touch on the 2030 targets,” the Labour MEP Seb Dance told the Guardian. “In the past, the UK has led the way towards decarbonisation but that has to be combined with developing renewable and low carbon alternatives.” “This paper is further proof, if anyone needed it, that the Tory[-led] government has totally given up on being ‘the greenest government ever’, as they once claimed,” he added. Key to the UK proposal is a shifting of climate governance responsibilities from the EU – which can take countries to court if they breach commitments – to ‘national plans’ which states themselves would police. A spokesperson for the UK’s Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ”The UK has been leading the climate debate pushing for an ambitious deal in Europe and by building alliances and working constructively with our European partners, and last year we agreed an ambitious package of measures that meet all the UK’s top priorities. “Currently there is no governance framework and one needs to be designed, so claiming something is ‘light touch’ is wrong and misleading. The current reporting system is confused and we want the governance to focus on ensuring all member states have a clear and coherent plan to meet their 2030 greenhouse gas targets, much like our own Climate Change Act does now.” Under the British proposal, Brussels would be stripped of powers to act over non-implementation of climate policies. The commission would report to EU leaders on the bloc’s combined progress every three years or so, while the European Parliament would be removed from the equation altogether. Climate campaigners fear that in practice, this would allow fossil fuel-friendly nations such as Poland and the Czech Republic to wriggle out of their obligations at the European Council, where they would possess a veto. “Fighting climate change is a huge challenge which calls for more, not less regulation,” said Brook Riley a spokesman for Friends of the Earth Europe. “It is very hypocritical for the UK to say that urgent action on climate change is needed and then oppose the common EU policies required to deliver it. This is exactly the kind of leave-us-alone approach the UK will be condemning at the Paris climate summit later this year.” Europe’s collective offer at that conference will be the pledge of a 40% emissions cut by 2030. Last October, Britain successfully prevented any binding renewable energy or efficiency targets being included, raising questions as to how the greenhouse gas reduction would be achieved. The new paper advocates EU support for countries that want to use nuclear energy or CCS and calls for the commission “to present a new CCS strategy for Europe as early as possible” in 2015. CCS is strongly supported by energy companies like Shell. It involves the sequestration and piping of carbon dioxide into underground fissures and currently aids fossil fuel extraction, as well as allowing their continued burning long into the 21st century. One study by Durham University found that ‘enhanced oil recovery’ using CCS could allow £150bn of oil to be extracted from the North Sea that would otherwise have been left in the ground. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has suggested that CCS may need to contribute up to 22% of global emissions reductions by 2050. But the world’s leading energy scientists do not expect it to be commercially viable before the mid to late 2020’s, which could be too late for countries that pin their CO2-cutting hopes on it. “It it is clear that behind the British government position, you have BP, Shell, E.On and EDF,” the Green MEP Claude Turmes said. “But why are we bounced into bad politics by a government that may not even exist after May? Where is their leverage?” The British alliance with a Czech government seen as pro-coal and anti-renewable energy “shows that they have no interest in a better energy policy at all, just renationalising powers and destroying a strong EU [climate] approach,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/jul/15/uk-environment-ministers-opposed-green-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-15T13:38:39Z","webTitle":"UK's new energy and environment ministers opposed green energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/15/uk-environment-ministers-opposed-green-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jul/15/uk-environment-ministers-opposed-green-energy","fields":{"headline":"UK's new energy and environment ministers opposed green energy","bodyText":"The new set of Conservative environment and energy ministers announced on Tuesday bring a track record of opposing renewable energy, having fought against wind and solar farms, enthusiastically backed fracking and argued that green subsidies damage the economy. New energy minister, Matthew Hancock, signed a letter to David Cameron in 2012 demanding that subsidies for onshore windfarms were slashed. “I support renewable energy but we need to do it in a way that gives the most value for money and that does not destroy our natural environment,” he said at the time. Hancock, who takes over from Michael Fallon, also opposed new turbines in his Suffolk constituency, arguing: “The visual and other impact of the proposed turbines is completely unacceptable in this attractive rural corner of Suffolk.” New environment secretary and former Shell employee, Liz Truss, dismissed clean renewable energy as “extremely expensive” and said it was damaging the economy during an appearance on BBC Question Time last October. “We do need to look at the green taxes because at the moment they are incentivising particular forms of energy that are extremely expensive,” she said. “I would like to see the rolling back of green taxes because it is wrong that we are implementing green taxes faster than other countries. We may be potentially exporting jobs out of the country as our energy is so expensive.” In 2009, as deputy director of the free-market thinktank Reform, Truss said energy infrastructure in Britain was being damaged by politicians' obsession with green technology: “Vast amounts of taxpayers' money are being spent subsidising uneconomic activity,\" she said. Research from the London School of Economics recently concluded that green policies were not harming economic growth. Truss will have a key role in regulating the environmental safety of shale gas exploration and has said fracking would benefit people living nearby. “We need to make sure shale gas is being exploited in this country, which will benefit local communities,” she said on BBC Question Time. As well as fracking, Truss backed “renewable” nuclear power as a way to “hit green targets”. In her first statement since being appointed as environment secretary, Truss said: “I look forward to tackling the important issues facing our rural communities including championing British food, protecting people from flooding and improving the environment.” She did not mention fracking or the controversial badger cull, which she has supported in parliamentary votes. Truss, Hancock and another new appointee to the Department of Energy and Climate Change, Amber Rudd, all face conflicts between their new ministerial responsibilities and their previous constituency work. Truss has spoken out about insufficient flood protection for farmland in her Norfolk South West constituency. But she is now responsible for flood defences and faces a £500m hole in the budget needed to keep pace with the rising flood risk being driven by climate change. Truss has also been a vocal opponent of an energy-from-waste project – an incinerator – at Kings Lynn. She has opposed solar farms being built and also complained the energy secretary Ed Davey that subsidies helping crops to used to generate energy was making straw difficult to get for pig farmers. One of the most contentious issues Truss faces will be over the badger cull. Her East Anglian constituency is far from the bovine TB hotspots in the west of the UK, but she has been keenly involved in rural issues - for instance, she is pro-hunting. Lord Krebs, chair of the sub-group of the Committee on Climate Change that looks at adaptation to the effects of global warming, said at a meeting of the all-party environment group in Westminster on Tuesday that he would wait for a private conversation with Truss before advising her on that. But he did say that he would offer his advice on badgers and bovine TB - a subject which the prominent zoologist examined in detail for the previous Labour government, finding that a cull was not likely to solve the problem. He told the Guardian: \"I would say don't be so focused on killing badgers (as a way of controlling the disease) but go back and look at all the policy options.\" Hancock has opposed both windfarms and new housing developments, while Rudd has raised her constituents safety fears about the Dungeness nuclear power plant in her constituency. Rudd, whose represents the coastal constituency of Hastings and Rye, has been praised by campaigners for supporting sustainable fishing and has raised questions about how government energy efficiency programmes would help social housing. The Renewable Energy Association said it looked forward to working with Truss, Hancock and Rudd. The trade body's chief executive, Dr Nina Skorupska, said of the outgoing Greg Barker, who Rudd replaces: \"Not only did he bring stability to the department, he also brought passion and enthusiasm.\" Truss, Hancock and Rudd appear not to have made any public statements about climate change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/mar/01/boris-nemtsov","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-01T13:31:28Z","webTitle":"Boris Nemtsov obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/01/boris-nemtsov","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/mar/01/boris-nemtsov","fields":{"headline":"Boris Nemtsov obituary","bodyText":"Boris Nemtsov, who has died aged 55 after being shot, was a leading pro-market reformer in the first, tumultuous post-Soviet decade and a popular politician and regional governor who at one point appeared to have been earmarked by President Boris Yeltsin as his successor. An articulate and handsome figure who appeared regularly on television talk shows, he served briefly as deputy prime minister, but was sacked after the financial collapse of 1998, which was blamed on him and other neo-liberals in the Russian government. After Vladimir Putin came to power in 2000, Nemtsov fell out of favour with the Kremlin and turned to out-and-out opposition politics. In 1999, with Anatoly Chubais, one of the main architects of “shock therapy” economics and the rapid privatisation of Russia’s state-owned economy, Nemtsov had been a co-founder of the Union of Rightwing Forces political party, which won 8% of the vote for the Russian Duma in that year’s elections. But the party lost ground and was unable to get into the Duma in 2003. While favouring a more open political system with fewer restrictions on independent parties, it called for radical reductions in subsidies on rents, utility bills and medical services – reforms that Putin later introduced. The party never favoured the social democratic approach of Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of the Yabloko party, with whom Nemtsov was often bracketed in foreign media as charismatic “young democrats”. Nemtsov was not an oligarch but he counted many of the richest “new Russians” as his friends. Chubais had invented the loans-for-shares scheme under which businessmen took control of large chunks of the country’s lucrative oil, gas and minerals sector in exchange for buying government debt at low cost. Nemtsov showed political courage in collecting a million signatures against Yeltsin’s war on Chechnya in spite of his links to the president, and he continued this independent line under Putin by coming out against the annexation of Crimea even though it was widely supported in Russia. He was killed close to his home near the Kremlin two days before he was due to lead a street protest in Moscow against Russia’s covert military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Nemtsov was born in the Black Sea resort of Sochi to a Jewish mother, Dina, a paediatrician, and a Russian Orthodox father, Yefim, who was deputy director of a state-owned building firm. In the early 1980s he studied quantum physics at the state university of Gorky, and then worked as a research fellow at the Gorky radio physics research institute. Active in popular movements against nuclear power, he was elected in 1990 to the Supreme Soviet of the Russian republic, where he caught the eye of Yeltsin and in 1991 was appointed as governor of Nizhny Novgorod, the post-Soviet name for Gorky. For six years he was one of the most successful regional leaders in attracting foreign investment by reducing bureaucracy and licensing. He was then made a deputy prime minister by Yeltsin in 1997, and put in charge of the energy sector. In his time as governor he remained loyal to the Kremlin during the two most authoritarian episodes of Yeltsin’s rule: the use of tanks against opposition politicians who had occupied the Russian parliament in 1993, and the unscrupulous use of state media, government funding and aggressive marketing to manipulate the presidential election of 1996. In 1994 Yeltsin took him to Washington and told President Bill Clinton that Nemtsov would be a worthy successor – although this may have been part of Yeltsin’s habit of publicly playing on the ambitions and fears of the younger men around him, who were frequently promoted or demoted on a whim. During this period Russia was consumed with fierce public debates over whether the country should maintain a powerful Kremlin, embodied in a constitutional presidency, or create a strong parliamentary system as the best way to enshrine and develop multi-party politics. Nemtsov was a firm supporter of the first system, arguing that “those who insist on transforming Russia into a parliamentary republic are consciously or unconsciously pushing the country towards chaos”. However, while he supported a powerful presidency, Nemtsov also favoured a properly functioning Duma. Even in opposition he continued to have faith in electoral politics and street demonstrations. In 2004 he split with Chubais, in part because Chubais was not sufficiently willing to criticise Putin. Nemtsov had ambitions to become president himself, but in 2008, when the main Kremlin candidate was Dmitry Medvedev (after Putin switched to being prime minister) Nemtsov gave way to Mikhail Kasyanov, allowing Kasyanov to be the centre-right opposition’s candidate. In 2010, with Kasyanov, he formed the People’s Freedom Party. In recent years Nemtsov attended numerous protest marches in Moscow and was repeatedly arrested for periods of several days. He worked with other leading oppositionists, including Garry Kasparov, the former world chess champion, to form a movement against corruption and lawlessness. It was named Solidarnost after the trade union that toppled the Polish communist party in the 1980s. In 2009 he ran for election to be mayor of Sochi, and accused the authorities there of corruption in awarding contracts for building facilities for the 2014 Winter Olympics in the city. He won only 14% of the vote and claimed the election campaign had been unfairly slanted against him. Nemtsov took a special interest in Ukraine and became an economic adviser to the strongly pro-Western and neo-liberal president Viktor Yushchenko, who served as president in Kiev from 2005 to 2010. His stated aim was to improve business co-operation between Ukraine and Russia, but the move was clearly a dig at Putin’s policy. Although Nemtsov argued that “by supporting Ukraine, we are supporting ourselves”, hardline Russian nationalists may well have regarded Nemtsov’s backing for Ukraine as treacherous. He is survived by his mother, his wife, Raisa Akhmetovna, and four children. • Boris Yefimovich Nemtsov, politician, born 9 October 1959; died 27 February 2015"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/jan/25/obama-modi-limit-us-liability-nuclear-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-25T14:27:33Z","webTitle":"Obama and Modi agree to limit US liability in case of nuclear disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/25/obama-modi-limit-us-liability-nuclear-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/jan/25/obama-modi-limit-us-liability-nuclear-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Obama and Modi agree to limit US liability in case of nuclear disaster","bodyText":"US industrial interests took centre-stage at the start of Barack Obama’s visit to India as he and the prime minister, Narendra Modi, outlined a deal to limit the legal liability of US suppliers in the event of a nuclear power plant catastrophe. Thirty years after an infamous chemical leak killed thousands at Union Carbide’s factory in Bhopal, the threat of tough Indian compensation laws has frustrated US hopes of an export boom in the energy sector – despite an agreement by former US president George W Bush to share civil nuclear technology in 2005. After pressure from US diplomats, the Indian government was thought to have agreed a state-backed insurance scheme that would cap the exposure of nuclear suppliers and open the door to billions of dollars of new contracts. India will also allow closer tracking of spent fuel to limit the risk of it falling into terrorist hands. “Today we achieved a breakthrough understanding on two issues that were holding up our civil nuclear cooperation,” Obama said on Sunday. “The [2005] civil nuclear agreement was the centrepiece of our transformed relationship, which demonstrated new trust and economic opportunities and expanded our option for clean energy,” added Modi. “In the course of the past four months we have worked with a sense of common purpose to move it forward … I am pleased we have agreed the next stage, consistent with our law and technical and commercial viability.” Details of the deal remain vague, however, and officials stressed they were still working out the finer arrangements of the scheme, which is designed to avoid the need to change Indian law. “We think we came to an understanding of the liability” issue, said the US ambassador to Delhi, Richard Verma, which will operate “through a memorandum of law within the Indian system”. To fuel its rapidly industrialising economy, India hopes to increase the share of electricity generated from nuclear sources from 4% to 25% by 2050, and the issue has taken on added significance after separate environmental talks failed to agree carbon reduction targets of the sort the US reached with China. Modi said he supported efforts to tackle climate change, but pointedly refused to accept comparisons with the recent US deal with China, which India views as further ahead in its industrialisation phase. “We expressed hope for a successful Paris conference on climate change this year,” said the Indian prime minister. “The agreement that has been concluded between the US and China does not impose pressure on us; India is an independent country. But climate change and global warning itself is huge pressure.” The two leaders trumpeted more limited deals on air pollution and renewable energy that the US president said would help “promote clean energy and confront climate change”. The US said it would share data and tools to help improve air quality. Smog is a growing problem in many Indian cities and was evident as Air Force One arrived earlier on Sunday in Delhi – a city that has also been heavily disrupted by security cordons. But Obama’s visit, which comes just four months after Modi came to Washington and New York and is his second as president, is seen as a sign of rapidly improving bilateral relations and the two leaders delighted photographers with protracted backslapping on the tarmac. The trip is timed to coincide with India’s Republic Day on Monday and Obama was afforded full pomp and circumstance as his 49-vehicle motorcade was greeted at the president’s palace by a 21-gun salute and escorts on horseback. Later, Obama and Modi were seen supping tea during three hours of talks in the cool gardens of Hyderabad House, a state guest facility in the centre of Delhi, before taking brief questions from reporters during a press conference. Obama said his decision to become the first American president to attend the Republic Day parade reflected his commitment to deepen the US’s relationship with India. “A strong relationship with India is critical to America’s success in the 21st century,” he said. The two governments also said they had struck deals to share defence technology and improve dialogue in future, with a security hotline between Obama and Modi. But ahead of the summit, US analysts expected the nuclear deal to be the key “deliverable” of Obama’s visit and negotiators extended preliminary talks in London last week to hammer out final details. “Nuclear liability remains the cinder in the eye of the relationship right now,” Rick Rossow, of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said in Washington last week. “Nuclear cooperation was the high-water mark for our bilateral history and the fact that India’s nuclear liability law precludes American involvement, it stings.” US suggestions of full legal indemnity for suppliers were knocked by the Indian government, which is wary of trying to overturn a 2010 nuclear liability law in parliament. Instead, US lobbyists and commentators have stressed nuclear power’s role in reducing India’s dependency on coal and other polluting energy sources. “We’re very cognisant of the fact that India has suffered the worst industrial tragedy [at Bhopal] but at the same time, environmental degradation is another form of industrial tragedy and nuclear is a cleaner source,” added Rossow. “The family that’s heating their home by using a dung cake and doesn’t have piping, right, they’re slowly killing themselves. So nuclear’s not perfect, but you also have to look at the alternatives.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2015/feb/11/utopia-or-reality-can-south-america-lead-a-fossil-free-future","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-11T11:33:30Z","webTitle":"Utopia or reality: can South America lead a fossil-free future?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/feb/11/utopia-or-reality-can-south-america-lead-a-fossil-free-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2015/feb/11/utopia-or-reality-can-south-america-lead-a-fossil-free-future","fields":{"headline":"Utopia or reality: can South America lead a fossil-free future?","bodyText":"Business, as a rule, doesn’t do utopia. The reason is simple: as the French author and philosopher Albert Camus put it, “utopia is that which is in contradiction with reality.” And reality, as far as conventional capitalism sees it, is about the no-nonsense pursuit of financial profit. On the face of it, therefore, an abstract philosophy based around indigenous Andean precepts of harmony between humans and nature has little to say to rational, money-minded economists and business executives in the twenty-first century. Yet proponents of the South American philosophy of Buen Vivir (literally, “living well”) beg to differ. To prove it, proponents of the belief system have laid out a series of tangible policy steps that they say portend a shift towards a more sustainable, more balanced economy. Manifesto for ‘living well’ Central to the 54-page manifesto (pdf) entitled ‘Climate Change and Transitions to Buen Vivir’, circulated during the UN climate conference in Lima last year, is a transition away from fossil-fuel dependency. Top of the list, therefore, is an immediate moratorium on all oil and gas projects that cause environmental harm. As for those hydrocarbons that remain, these should only be traded within the Andean bloc and sales revenues should be used to fund investment in renewables. “When these countries run out of hydrocarbons, they won’t have the likes of wind or solar to replace them,” says the report’s co-author and leading Buen Vivir writer and activist Eduardo Gudynas, who warns of a pending energy crisis on top of the very real threat of severe climate change impacts. A second, related goal is the cutting of greenhouse gas emissions. The manifesto calls for a massive investment in public transport (particularly buses in cities) and a phased transition away from private car ownership. The Colombian capital of Bogotá provides a model in its car-free day. Introducing mandatory green building regulations in major cities is also proposed. A third focus of the proposal is around agriculture. Using fertile land to grow cash crops for export and then importing food from overseas “makes no sense”, Uruguay-born Gudynas maintains. Ecuador’s export-oriented fresh-flower industry serves as an archetypal example of the “strange” logic of exporting cash crops to earn dollars so as to import staple foods. “Ecuadorians don’t eat flowers”, he notes. Instead, the Buen Vivir-inspired proposals suggest a return to more organic (or “agro-ecological”) modes of agricultural production. There is food and job security in a post-oil society, the logic runs. Likewise there is no longer a dependency on fuel-thirsty machinery or expensive, petroleum-based chemicals. A more manual style of farming, meanwhile, will provide work for those formally employed in the extractive sectors and related industries. The proposals, which are aimed at the Andean countries and Amazon region primarily, are unashamedly utopian. “The specific objectives for this programme are zero poverty and zero extinction of the species,” says Gudynas, who notes that one fifth of the Amazon biome has already been lost and one fifth seriously deteriorated. Urgent transition A sense of urgency is also a feature of the manifesto. “Our message to the Andean regions is that they can’t wait for a global change [in the economic system] because when that change comes it will be too late,” states Gudynas. Why? “Because the impacts of climate change are already being felt in these countries. And secondly, because they are going to run out of oil soon.” For the best part of a decade, the resource-rich states of the Andes – Bolivia, Peru, Colombia and Ecuador – have seen sharp escalations in economic growth thanks to surging world demand for basic commodities. Not only is that external demand beginning to slow, but their capacity to keep pace with supply isn’t infinite. Several of the Andean states are already facing “peak oil”, he argues. That may be up for debate, but what appears incontrovertible are the social and environmental costs of Latin America’s current “extractivist” model. Nowhere is that clearer than in Ecuador. Despite enshrining the rights of the environment into in its constitution, the green light was given last year to extend oil exploration in the Amazon. For all his radicalism, Gudynas is not blind to life’s realities. “We realise that you can’t do this from one day to the next, and it’s for this reason that the proposal promotes the notion of ‘transition’”, he states. That said, he doesn’t buy the line that the Andean economies would collapse tomorrow without extractive export revenues. “Ten years of growth means that domestic consumption and sales taxes are now more important that duties or royalties,” he states. Neither he nor his fellow proponents are under any illusion about the region’s entrenched attachment to a neoliberal form of development. Even in Bolivia, whose national constitution also reflects elements of Buen Vivir thinking, the government is considering a nuclear power station to fuel industrial growth. “I mean, how much more anti-Pachamama can you get?”, Gudynas asks, referring to the Mother Earth figure of indigenous belief. It may be too late in the day to stave off a climate crisis, Gudynas fears. But Buen Vivir-inspired policy measures represent the best defence against what lies down the road. Action cannot be delayed, however. That way, as Camus said, “some kind of future, if perhaps not the ideal one, will remain possible.” The social impact hub is funded by Anglo American.

The remarkable figure – 10 times the number the government is openly discussing – is revealed in documents submitted to the Department of Energy and Climate Change by one of its own advisory bodies. The documents are likely to raise questions as to what extent the government's energy policy is weighted in favour of nuclear and away from renewables such as wind turbines. It comes as Brussels begins an investigation into whether Britain is providing up to £17bn of potentially illegal public guarantees for the first nuclear power plant in a generation, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, which aims to provide 7% of the country's electricity. In a submission to a consultation on geological waste disposal, the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management has said an upper limit of 75 gigawatts of nuclear power is \"being examined\" by the DECC in London. The current programme announced by ministers is to build 12 reactors to supply 16 gigawatts at five sites. The higher figure equates to more than 50 new large-scale modern reactors. The committee has been given the task of assessing the number of disposal facilities that might be required for the waste that will be produced by new nuclear power stations. It notes that the 16-gigawatt programme is only the \"first tranche\" and is \"substantially below the 75 gigawatts upper limit being examined in [the Department of Energy and Climate Change]\". The upper limit echoes a scenario outlined by the energy department in a 2011 report, outlining its vision for a low-carbon future. It suggested 75 gigawatts of nuclear power – enough to provide 86% of UK electricity – could be brought on line by 2050. \"Nuclear energy is vital for our energy security and we want it to be part of the energy mix in the future, alongside renewables and clean coal and gas,\" a department spokeswoman said. \"It's important to model potential scenarios to plan for our future energy needs, but we haven't set any targets for the amount of new nuclear to be developed.\" But Dr David Lowry, an environmental policy consultant and nuclear specialist, said the 75-gigawatt scenario was a \"nuclear fantasia at it worst\", and failed to explain how huge amounts of radioactive waste generated by the plants would be stored."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/oct/23/future-nuclear-power-uk-edf","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-23T15:23:57Z","webTitle":"Future of UK nuclear power hangs in the balance, says EDF boss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/23/future-nuclear-power-uk-edf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/oct/23/future-nuclear-power-uk-edf","fields":{"headline":"Future of UK nuclear power hangs in the balance, says EDF boss","bodyText":"The future of nuclear power in the UK is hanging in the balance, the chief executive of the company charged with building new reactors has said. Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy, told MPs at a select committee hearing on Tuesday that he had still not made up his mind whether to go ahead with a construction programme that would see the first new nuclear power stations in the UK for decades. He said the company was waiting for further reassurances from the government on what assistance the company will receive. This includes assurances on the disposal of waste and the decommissioning of plants at the end of their life, and a regulatory regime that should favour nuclear power through the provision of long-term \"contracts for difference\" that will penalise fossil fuels in favour of low-carbon forms of energy. \"We are on the brink of delivering an infrastructure project similar in scale to the London Olympics. We are poised to deliver immense benefits in terms of jobs, skills and economic growth – locally and nationally,\" said de Rivaz, appearing before the parliamentary select committee on energy and climate change. \"But like all investors in capital intensive infrastructure projects we need to have a compelling business case. In this respect our final investment decision requires more progress to be made.\" This new regulatory system, known as electricity market reform (EMR), has been criticised by renewable power companies as unwieldy and overly complex. They fear it will favour big companies and squeeze smaller players out of the market. The French state company EDF is the government's best hope of having new nuclear power stations built in the UK, because two German utilities – RWE and E.ON – pulled out of plans to build new nuclear power stations earlier this year. Their consortium, called Horizon, was put up for sale but failed to garner the expected interest. Companies are understood to be concerned that new plants will face protests and will be expensive to build and run, while the electricity regulatory regime has been subject to drastic changes from successive governments in recent years, generating uncertainty and raising the risks to investors. EDF owns and operates eight of the UK's 10 existing nuclear power stations, and any new reactors are likely to be built on or next to existing sites. If de Rivaz does decide to go ahead, the first new plant to be built will be at Hinkley Point in Somerset. Another prospective nuclear consortium, NuGen – owned by Iberdrola of Spain and GDF Suez, another French company – is considering new reactors in Cumbria, but is unlikely to make a final decision soon, having said it could wait until 2015 before proceeding. A further setback to the proposed \"nuclear renaissance\" in the UK came this month, when three councils in Cumbria delayed a decision on whether to allow new nuclear waste sites to go ahead. But a Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) spokeswoman said: \"There is strong interest in UK nuclear from a number of potential investors. We are confident that UK's stable policy environment and the measures in the energy bill to be published next month, will provide the detail and certainty that investors need. \"We are in the midst of a commercial negotiation with EDF so it is not appropriate for us to comment on the details of it. In our discussions with new nuclear investors, our focus will be on delivering a fair deal for consumers, which is affordable, provides clear value for money, and is consistent with the coalition agreement's commitment to no public subsidy for new nuclear power. And we will be transparent around any agreement reached\". EDF's main concern is to make sure that the \"contracts for difference\" under EMR are arranged in such a way as to benefit nuclear power generation. Rival utilities and opponents of nuclear power have argued that these contracts will be effectively a form of subsidy to the nuclear industry, a charge the government has denied. In the European parliament, the Green grouping of MEPs is challenging EMR as a form of state aid. De Rivaz told MPs a decision would be made within months: \"We have workers in high-visibility jackets, standing ready to go to work on our site. The responsibility now is on the government and us to deliver the [contracts for difference] and transitional arrangements, the framework to make it possible for our project to move to the next stage around the end of the year.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2014/jun/27/plantwatch-how-fool-bee","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-27T20:30:00Z","webTitle":"Plantwatch: How to fool a bee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jun/27/plantwatch-how-fool-bee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2014/jun/27/plantwatch-how-fool-bee","fields":{"headline":"Plantwatch: How to fool a bee","bodyText":"Bee orchids are one of the most extraordinary British wildflowers, and they made a good display this month. The beautiful bulbous lip of the flower imitates a female bee to fool male bees into trying to mate with it. Instead, the males get stuck with bags of pollen on their backs, which they carry to another bee orchid flower and cross-pollinate, although in Britain the orchid routinely pollinates itself without any need for an insect go-between. Like many of our native orchids, the bee orchid is much more common in the warmer climates of Europe and is at its northernmost limit in Britain. But over the past 40 years the number of bee orchids has soared and they have also spread more than 350km northwards. In 2010 a bee orchid appeared for the first time in Scotland in the grounds of a nuclear power station in Dumfriesshire, and is now colonising more northern parts of Scotland. With its tiny, dust-like seeds, the orchid can spread rapidly, and is taking advantage of the warming climate of the UK. The pyramidal orchid has a cone-shaped spike of purple-pink flowers, and this too is thriving and spreading northwards with the warmer climate. Perhaps most remarkable of all is the lizard orchid, with its magnificent lizard-like lower petal.

It’s believed that widespread opposition to the plans, which many argued would deter companies from taking on apprentices, caused skills minister Nick Boles to go back to the drawing board. Under the current model, the government provides 100% of the funding for apprentices aged between 16 and 18, and 50% for 19- to 24-year-olds, and gives a contribution for those that are 25 and older. Employers pay apprentices’ wages, but are not required to make any additional payments. Although details of the new model have not yet been finalised, Teresa Frith, senior skills policy manager at the Association of Colleges, believes one crucial component could be that employers will be expected to contribute a third of the funding for an apprentice – for every £1 a business invests, the Skills Funding Agency (SFA) will contribute £2. As with the existing system, funding will continue to go into the bank account of the training provider or college organising the apprenticeship. But employers will be given purchasing power, which means they’ll get more say on how the money is spent and with whom. Rather than providers being allocated a set amount of funding by the government, they will have to compete to win contracts from employers. This will give good providers greater opportunity to deliver more apprenticeships and work across the country. It’s worth noting that there could be exceptions with where the funding is paid. As is the case at the moment, employers may be able to put in a bid to the SFA to receive funding directly if they’d prefer. It’s believed that the majority of businesses won’t do this because of the bureaucracy it entails. Frith says the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has also indicated there could be bonus payments for small companies and those employing an apprentice aged 16 to 18 years old. Elsewhere on the grapevine, Stewart Segal, chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers (AELP), has heard that anyone hoping to employ an apprentice will first of all need to be given “entitlement to funding” by the government. This will probably be a basic registration process that checks the company and the apprentice are who they say they are. Last year the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats all promised to increase the number of apprenticeships if they won the next general election. As well as giving employers greater control of funding, the quest to get more companies involved with the scheme has been a significant driving force behind the reforms. But Noel Johnson, director of Prospect Training, believes that asking businesses to contribute a third of funding will have a “really detrimental impact” on this. “It’s a step too far,” he says. “The majority of apprenticeship provision is with small- and medium-sized businesses, and they don’t have the cashflow to pay a third of the funding.” He points out that employers already invest a lot in addition to paying the wage of an apprentice. As well as training costs, many businesses purchase equipment for apprentices and money can be lost when mistakes are made (an inevitable part of a young person learning on the job). When Johnson’s company, which has been running government funding training schemes for 25 years, raised the idea at consultation events in the Humber region, many businesses said they’d probably train people themselves informally rather than sign up to such a programme. Segal argues that employer contributions should be increased, but not necessarily by asking for cash. He says it’s for providers to ensure employers invest adequately in the cost of training, be it through buying equipment or with a monetary payment. He also highlights that the government has recognised it may be a barrier. At the membership organisation’s annual conference last year, Nick Boles said he was “nervous” about employer contributions. Another major concern is about how the new funding model will affect the quality of provision. Frith worries that we’re “getting too concerned about what individual employers want and not enough about what a sector needs”. If an employer is parting with extra cash, she suggests that they may be “a lot more picky” about how an apprentice spends their time. “If I was training a leisure manager, for example, I might want to teach them about working in a local authority as much about working in a commercial environment,” she says. “But if I’m a private gym, why would I be interested in my member of staff disappearing for half a day to work in a local authority? Why should I pay for that?” Frith stresses that the government must send a clear message that apprenticeships are for sectors of industry, not simply for specific employers. “At the moment there’s just not enough detail inside the standards that are being developed to be confident that every provider is going to interpret what’s required in the same way.” Richard Atkins, the principal of Exeter College and president of the AoC, is similarly anxious and believes the structure of qualifications needs to changed to tackle the problem. Currently, apprenticeship qualifications are developed nationally and there is no flexibility on what’s covered. Instead, he’d like around 20% of courses to be set aside for negotiation between the employer and training provider. This would mean that if an apprentice needed to go to another company, for example to learn how to use a piece of equipment that wasn’t provided by their employer, it would be easier to arrange. And it would put providers in a better position to respond to the needs of the local sector. “A nuclear power station is being built near my college and it’s going to draw in hundreds if not thousands of workers in the next 10 years,” he says. “Certain skills will be required and you could embed those in that 20% of the qualification.” What Frith, Segal and Johnson do think is a good idea, however, is giving employers purchasing power. “They already get quite a bit of a say on what the funding is spent on with us,” says Johnson. “But I do know that there are larger providers and colleges where that doesn’t happen as it should.” The Confederation of British Industry argues that the current system “doesn’t work for many businesses” and has campaigned hard for change. High up on its agenda has been the call for employers to be in control of funding. Rob Wall, the organisation’s head of employment and education policy, says it sounds like the new model is “moving in the right direction”. • This article was amended on 16 March 2015 to correct the age range of those receiving 50% of the government funding.

A statement from the governor’s office said he died at home of heart failure, with his family by his side. He had been unwell for some time. Cuomo, a renowned liberal and gifted orator, died on Thursday after his son, Andrew, was inaugurated for a second term as governor. His last public appearance was at an election-night celebration for his son in November. President Barack Obama led the tributes to Cuomo, who was born in Queens, New York to immigrant parents and whose popularity twice made him a possible contender for the White House during a long career in the frontline of politics. He was a “determined champion of progressive values, and an unflinching voice for tolerance, inclusiveness, fairness, dignity, and opportunity”, Obama said, whose life showed that the “country’s success rests on the success of all of us, not just a fortunate few”. Former president Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, said in a joint statement: “It was Mario Cuomo’s great gift and our good fortune that he was both a sterling orator and a passionate public servant. His life was a blessing.” “Mario’s life was the very embodiment of the American dream.” The mayor of New York city, Bill de Blasio, said in a statement: “Tonight, New York has lost a giant. Mario Cuomo was a man of unwavering principle who possessed a compassion for humankind without equal.” In his inauguration address on Thursday, Andrew Cuomo said he had read his speech to his father the night before. “He said it was good, especially for a second termer,” the younger Cuomo said. Cuomo, a Democrat, was governor of New York between 1983 and 1994, losing to George Pataki in his attempt to be returned for a fourth term. He flirted with running for the White House in 1988 and 1992. For the perceived indecision which supposedly once left a plane idling on a runway before he finally decided not to travel to New Hampshire for the presidential primary, he earned the nickname “Hamlet on the Hudson”. A lawyer by training and profession, in 1993 he also came close to being nominated to the supreme court by President Bill Clinton. It was his legal practice that first led him into politics in the mid-1960s when he helped residents fight a city plan to level small scrap-processing plants near the site of the 1964 World’s Fair. Cuomo won the fight and saved hundreds of jobs. For the next 10 years he repeatedly fought the power structure, winning concessions for residents in housing, education and welfare. When a law school friend, Hugh Carey, was elected governor in 1974, Cuomo joined his administration as secretary of state. In 1977 he returned to New York City to run for mayor. He finished a close second but lost the run-off to Ed Koch, who blistered Cuomo’s opposition to the death penalty in what became a long-running Democratic rivalry. He then beat Koch in their run for the governorship in 1982 with heavy support from upstate New York. His speech to the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco confirming Walter Mondale as the nominee to take on President Ronald Reagan made his name on the national scene. The speech, which articulated his liberal principles, took aim at Reagan’s economic policies, especially his comments that America was “shining city on a hill”. Cuomo countered by saying: “A shining city is perhaps all the president sees from the portico of the White House and the veranda of his ranch, where everyone seems to be doing well. “But there’s another city; there’s another part to the shining city; the part where some people can’t pay their mortgages, and most young people can’t afford one; where students can’t afford the education they need, and middle-class parents watch the dreams they hold for their children evaporate.” His speech defining Republicans as looking out only for the well-off and Democrats as champions of the middle class and the poor propelled Cuomo to the forefront of the party leadership. Cuomo easily won re-election for governor in 1986 and 1990. He repeatedly vetoed legislation that would have restored the death penalty in New York, and he closed down the Shoreham nuclear power plant on Long Island. He also built 30 new prisons. Under Cuomo, the state budget grew from $28bn to $62bn. In 2004, Cuomo authored Why Lincoln Matters, a book which sought to show how Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president and an icon of the Republican party, would have applied liberal solutions to contemporary challenges. He is survived by his wife, Matilda; Andrew; another son, the CNN journalist Chris Cuomo; and three daughters, Margaret, Maria and Madeline."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2014/nov/22/st-george-flags-white-van-rochester-byelection","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-22T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"St George’s flags, a white van and the Rochester byelection | @guardianletters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/22/st-george-flags-white-van-rochester-byelection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2014/nov/22/st-george-flags-white-van-rochester-byelection","fields":{"headline":"St George’s flags, a white van and the Rochester byelection","bodyText":"Before the Rochester picture affair is allowed to fade, it badly needs some deeper consideration (Labour rocked by ‘sneering’ blunder, 21 November). A house draped in statements of national allegiance, upstaged by a big white van representing a way of earning a living, is clearly an arresting image, and Emily Thornberry responded accordingly. Her caption was factual, minimal and comment-free. The household concerned decided to put this striking image into the public domain, so can have no complaint. The result was an instant witchhunt conducted by a political party leader who aspires to run the country. The image was real. The politician who “naively” acknowledged this particular aspect of reality had to be humiliated and disowned. Labour had to get desperate about its survival before it would admit that there were aspects of UK reality it had been systematically denying. Now it is revealing how quickly the preference for avoiding even talking about reality has reasserted itself. It is Thornberry who is sane and reasonable, and all the rest who are deranged. Dave Bradney Llanrhystud, Ceredigion • Why shouldn’t Emily Thornberry, MP for Islington South, declare publicly that she considers St George’s flags to be awfully low-brow and probably indicative of closet BNP voters, that Islington is just so much more multicultural and tolerant, and that it’s vastly preferable better to live somewhere where one can get organic Ocado deliveries all day long? The public are crying out for authenticity in politicians. Jeremy Brier London • From Gordon Brown’s “bigotgate” to Emily Thornberry’s tweet, Labour has consistently ignored concerns about the squeeze that mass immigration has had on jobs, schools and hospitals. Those of us whose generations of family have worked to pay for these resources might justifiably feel frustration at their current disintegration. The flag wavers are not all bigots and racists. Many are just frustrated that UK passports seem to have been handed out like cheap candy. Lucie Payne Sutton, Surrey • Poor Emily Thornberry. I taught with her mother Sally in Guildford in the early 1970s. Money was scarce in the Thornberry household on the Park Barn council estate: socialist ideals were not. She will bounce back. John Mair Oxford • Could Emily Thornberry be persuaded to defect to the Green party and cause a by-election in Islington? Rev Richard Syms Knebworth, Hertfordshire • I attended my first Green party meeting this week. How refreshing to spend almost all the time discussing nuclear power, housing, public transport and the environment instead of the minutes of the last meeting and matters arising. And then to do so well in Rochester. Richard Bull Woodbridge, Suffolk • It seems inconceivable that the Lib Dems’ support should have disappeared entirely in Rochester and Strood. A lot of the Lib Dem vote, and a large part of the Labour vote, undoubtedly migrated temporarily to the Tories in an attempt to prevent the election of the Ukip candidate. The swing from Tory to Ukip may have been much greater than the figures suggest. Terry Graham Grasmere, Cumbria • The rise of Ukip and the likely advent of regular coalition government are symptoms of the inability of the first past the post system to deliver representative parliaments. When only the marginals, one-sixth of seats, determines the outcome, it is inevitable that significant parts of the electorate will be disenfranchised. They’ve now put in motion a process of change that will end in proportional representation. Richard Cohen London • Almost 80% of the electorate of Rochester and Strood did not vote for the successful Ukip candidate. Time for electoral reform? Patrick Billingham Brighton • Ukip’s plan to quit the EU to give the UK more control over immigration takes no account of the fact that history has a habit of repeating itself. At the moment we’re doing better economically than other EU countries, particularly those in the eurozone. But one day the position will no doubt be reversed with high unemployment in this country forcing workers to look for jobs abroad as for example happened in the 1980s. But with the UK out of the EU there won’t be a repeat of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet. Roger Hinds Coulsdon, Surrey • This article was amended on 24 November 2014.

This is what has happened to Empire. While British TV is still struggling with diversity, across the Atlantic they’re getting on with it. The Fox series is a quota-busting, diversity-on-its-head, African-American show and proud of it. The audience figures are high, and rising – and 40% of them aren’t black. This at a time when it’s difficult to avoid the suspicion that some TV executives in the UK think black television – whatever that means these days – is a ratings killer. These are important debates, but they miss the point about Empire. The reason it’s cleaning up isn’t because it’s diverse or relevant, but because it’s fantastic entertainment – great fun and the wittiest thing on the small screen at the moment. Empire is a family saga about ghetto kid turned music mogul Lucious Lyon, his ex-wife (and ex-jailbird) Cookie and their three very different sons. Someone’s got to inherit the old man’s business, so who’s it going to be? Empire roams from high life to low life, often in the same character. It keeps faith with the big, bold, sassy traditions of US drama while being bang up to date. Think Dynasty meets The Wire. Co-creator Danny Strong is clear on why Empire works. When we speak, the first thing he mentions is the “soap” word (he doesn’t even call it “continuing drama”, would you believe?). Much of the show’s success, he says, comes from its use of key soap-opera elements. “It’s a layered story with twists and turns and great music. It takes on social issues, has humour – and it’s Shakespearean.” Certainly, if ambition, greed, politics, love and death are your bag, Empire has got the lot. But as any English teacher will tell you, even the grimmest Shakespeare tragedy has flashes of wit to lighten the darkness. Naomi Campbell, who turns in a killer performance as Camilla, for a while the girlfriend of youngest son Hakeem, told me it was the family angle that really worked for her: “The characters are all dealing with real-life issues that all families go through.” Some of the issues are indeed touchy – this isn’t The Waltons. Strong and his co-creator Lee Daniels didn’t want to shy away from these subjects. There’s been a reluctance in some black communities to discuss homophobia, sexism and mixed relationships, preferring to keep the focus on racism. Empire doesn’t make that mistake, but nor does it make the opposite one of addressing them in a dull or didactic way. Perhaps this is the clearest contrast with British TV: too often when it “does issues”, the approach is a muesli one: you’re not going to enjoy this, but you’re going to watch it anyway because it’s good for you. In the UK, if there’s a black cast, you can be reasonably sure they’ll either be kids in hoodies running around tower blocks dealing drugs, miserable migrants wishing they’d never come to the UK, or a positive (if rather boring) role model. And you can be sure there will be a message prominently flagged up. In Stephen Poliakoff’s stylish, toe-tapping 2013 drama Dancing on the Edge, a black musician takes a few minutes out to remind the audience that racism is a bad thing. Yes, we know. And if we don’t, a fictional character won’t be changing anyone’s mind. We don’t need TV that ignores marginalisation, migration and racism, but do we have to be so leaden about it? Empire has a lighter touch. In one of her many showpiece moments, Cookie barges into a boardroom and notices that one of the executives at the big round table is a solitary black woman. Cue a plea from Cookie for more women breaking the glass ceiling, or a remark about “Lehman Sisters”? No, what we get is Cookie calling out to the embarrassed exec: “Hey – sista girl!” We don’t need anything else. We get it. When Lucious calls the president to apologise for his son calling him “a sell-out”, there’s no heavy-handed rumination on the disappointments of the Obama administration. Instead it’s: “There’s no need for that kind of language, Barack.” This is one of the things British TV often misses about poor communities in general, and black ones in particular. When things are hard, people on the edge use satire and sarcasm to get by. Back in the 1960s, my mum used to to find the racist notion that she should “go home and swing on a banana tree” a laugh-out-loud moment, because banana trees are actually made of big leaves, not branches, and are too precarious for anyone to swing on. If they were going to insult her, they could at least get their vegetation right. But when British TV does bleak, it’s really bleak. I was a big admirer of The Village, about life in rural Derbyshire, but it certainly wasn’t on to cheer anyone up. I’m a Luther fangirl, but did he really need to beat the door up after an argument with his wife? What’s surprising about this bleak approach is that it’s so at variance with the traditions of British TV drama. In the early 1980s, when Liverpudlians were feeling the heat of Thatcherism, Boys from the Blackstuff, Alan Bleasdale’s seminal drama about a bunch of tarmac-layers who lose their jobs, remembered to include some cracking jokes. The premise of 1985’s Edge of Darkness, about the death of an envionmental activist and the murkiness of nuclear power, was chilling, but when an MP lists the crimes of a corporate executive, a senior civil servant sighs: “They’ll probably give him a medal for it.” Students in the future can watch both shows to learn about deindustrialisation and nuclear paranoia in the 1980s. They might want to watch Poldark, but only as light relief. I loved Poldark both times round, but those Cornish shenanigans weren’t exactly bang up to date, even back in the 1970s. The social structure of Downton Abbey, meanwhile, will certainly tell them something about British society over the past five years, though I suspect that might not have been intentional. When British TV gets serious, it almost feels as if it’s being filmed in black and white with a violin wailing in the background. But Empire is in colour in every sense. Chris Rock has a theory that African American women don’t care about their waistlines: if they like an outfit, they’re wearing it. You might have noticed that Cookie’s dress-lengths aren’t really age-appropriate, but she puts them on anyway, girlfriend. The fashion is eye-catching and there’s plenty of tongue-in-cheek bling. It’s no wonder Vogue is paying attention to it. The same goes for the music. No pick and mix on this show: they got Timbaland in to sort it out. Nor is the Empire phenomenon a one-off. It’s not even an African American one-off. Shonda Rhimes, the woman behind Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal, built her all-conquering reputation on glossy, popular dramas. The subtext of Scandal isn’t: “Oh look! There’s a black woman working in the White House. Are we being positive here or what?” Instead, Rhimes created a variety of characters, some black and some white. They’re layered, textured and ambiguous, with compelling narratives, and certainly couldn’t be called bubblegum shows. Breaking Bad had guns and drugs, but it also has the economic implosion of the middle class: teachers have to take second jobs or cook meth if they want to keep their heads above water and pay their medical bills. Empire doesn’t shy away from the racial faultline that runs through the US, but it’s done from the perspective of a rich and powerful black family, not just the ghetto. This is 21st-century TV that entertains while remaining rooted in the realities of the society in which it was created. Strong has a theory about why Empire was possible in the US. He says The Sopranos proved there was an audience for provocative and intelligent drama. Its success also meant getting a mass audience was no longer the only criteria for assessing whether a show would be commissioned or not. Another factor is the increasing number of platforms in US broadcasting. So what are Strong’s thoughts on the future of TV in America? “The sky’s the limit now.” • Empire is on E4 on Tuesday nights at 9pm"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2015/feb/19/google-x-glass-nest-makani-driverless-cars-bold-bets-tech","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-19T22:15:03Z","webTitle":"Self-driving cars and elevators to space: what will come of Google's bold 'moonshots'?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/feb/19/google-x-glass-nest-makani-driverless-cars-bold-bets-tech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2015/feb/19/google-x-glass-nest-makani-driverless-cars-bold-bets-tech","fields":{"headline":"Self-driving cars and elevators to space: what will come of Google's bold 'moonshots'?","bodyText":"In 2008, Google pranked everyone. It was April Fool’s Day and the tech giant uploaded a fake website claiming to be starting the first human settlement on Mars, with a little help from the airline company, Virgin. Project Virgle had a 100-year development plan and an application for would-be Mars colonists. In hindsight, though, Virgle does not sound quite as far-fetched now as it did then. More than any other company, Google has proven willing to support bold, costly and unorthodox projects far from its core business. But unlike the fictional Virgle, a plan to escape the Earth, many of Google’s biggest bets, including its investments of more than $1.5bn in renewable energy, aim to save it. These efforts are spread across the company – software to track forests at Google Earth Engine, clean tech investments at Google Ventures, and Nest and its energy-saving thermostat, which Google acquired last year for $3.2bn. The most audacious, though, are found in a unit known as Google[x], where inventors, scientists and engineers seek solutions to the world’s biggest problems. The Google[x] team is developing self-driving cars, which would make automobile travel radically more efficient, as well as energy-generating kites, self-flying vehicles to deliver goods and high-altitude balloons to provide cheap internet to people living in rural or remote areas. The Google[x] team even toyed with the notion of building elevators into space, although not to Mars. Google[x] is led by an executive named Astro Teller, whose title is captain of moonshots. What are moonshots? Teller says they are big and important projects that inspire the kind of passion, creativity and persistence that drove scientists on the Manhattan Project (among them, his grandfather, the physicist Edward Teller) to build an atomic weapon or codebreakers at the UK’s Bletchley Park to decipher German battle plans during the second world war and, of course, the US’s Apollo program to put a man on the moon, which was powered in part by cold war fervor. “Historically there have been times and places where a set of extraordinary people were put together with significant resources and gave birth to the pressure to go really fast and the freedom to be as weird as necessary to make something incredible happen,” Teller has said. “Why do we have to wait for a war to think really big, to think radically far outside the box to attack audaciously the world’s biggest and most pressing problems?” Describing Google[x], Teller says: “I have the incredible good fortune to work at a place that has made moonshot thinking its mission.” Google[x] isn’t focused on the environment – its best-known product is Google Glass – but its projects cannot be driven by short-term financial returns; they must aim to “make millions of people’s lives better”, the company says. A life sciences unit, for example, focuses on smart devices to detect, prevent and manage disease. Understanding just how unusual this is requires taking a step back. Google has embraced offbeat ideas for long enough that we weren’t shocked when the company acquired Makani, which is building lightweight wind turbines designed to fly high in the sky, back in 2013, and folded it into Google[x]. It didn’t hurt that Don Montague, a Makani founder, was a kiteboarding friend of Page and Brin. But still. Imagine if General Motors invested in drought-resistant crops, or Disney decided to build small nuclear power plants, or Microsoft got into the algae business. That is the kind of boundary crashing that has become commonplace at Google. What can we learn from Google’s propensity to make bold bets? First, and most importantly, it’s easier to take risks when your core business is minting money. Google (GOOG) generated $66bn in revenue and $14.4bn in net income in 2014, although its most recent earnings report disappointed analysts. The latest Global Innovation 1000 study published by Strategy&amp;, the consulting firm formerly known as Booz &amp; Co, says Google spent $8m on research and development, which ranked ninth in that category among the world’s public companies. Second, while Google[x] says its “primary goal is solving big problems, not making money”, the company is confident that its research will, ultimately, create new businesses. The business case behind Google[x] is strengthened by the fact almost no one else is taking its moonshot approach. Startups don’t have the resources. Most big companies are focused on short-term results. Governments are risk-averse. (As they should be in a world where failures become scandals. Recall Solyndra.) If, as a result, a Google[x] project like self-driving cars works out, the company will have a big head start on potential competitors – and a new business that, at least in theory, could be as big a deal as internet search. What’s more, as Teller notes, big, hard, world-changing missions attract and engage the best and the brightest. All of us, he says, “want to work on something thrilling, that really matters, that pushes us to our limits”. Third, failure cannot be a deterrent. Google Glass has been called a flop. Google Ventures’ cleantech investments, including Makani, Cool Planet Energy Systems, Relay Rides and Sidecar, have been slow to reach commercial scale. An internal Google effort to develop forms of renewable energy that could generate electricity for less than coal-fired power plants was dropped in 2011. Then again, Google’s investments its own money in wind and solar projects around the world, including 17 utility-scale projects, have generated healthy mid-teens returns, according to Rick Needham, who oversees the renewable energy portfolio. Meanwhile, Google has become so enamored of the idea of moonshots that it has launched an online platform and sponsored annual events to come up with new ideas. Solve for [x] today includes ideas for a satellite to deliver early warnings about climate change, low-cost energy storage using compressed air, and scalable, sustainable meat. Bold bets, all.

The move to close all 50 of the country's functioning reactors by around 2040 marks a dramatic change of course by a country that had previously championed atomic energy, putting Japan alongside Germany and Switzerland, which also turned away from nuclear power following the disaster. Japan, the world's third biggest user of nuclear power before the disaster, had planned to increase nuclear's share of the energy mix to 50% by 2030. But the country's attachment to nuclear power was severely weakened after the Fukushima accident sent radioactive materials into the ocean and atmosphere, contaminated the food and water supply, and forced the evacuation of 160,000 residents. \"Based on facing the reality of this grave accident and by learning lessons from the accident, the government has decided to review the national energy strategy from scratch,\" read a policy document released on Friday. \"One of the key pillars of the new strategy is to achieve a society that does not depend on nuclear energy as soon as possible.\" The decision comes after two months of public consultations and the largest anti-nuclear demonstrations Japan has ever seen. Local media reports said the cabinet had already agreed to approve the panel's recommendation, with a formal announcement expected soon. The plan calls for renewable energy to comprise about 30% of Japan's future energy mix – an eightfold rise from 2010 levels – and the development of sustainable ways to use fossil fuels. In the short-term, however, the shift will force Japan to increase its already heavy dependence on oil and natural gas, calling into question its ability to reach internationally agreed CO2 emissions targets. \"This is a strategy to create a new future,\" a policy statement said, after key ministers finalised the decision on Friday. \"It is not pie in the sky. It is a practical strategy.\" The report says Japan should aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 20% from 1990 levels and to reduce energy consumption through greater efficiency by about 10% from 2010 levels. Environmental campaigners welcomed the decision, but said the phase-out should have come much earlier. \"The government's strategy involves a nuclear phase-out nearly two decades later than needed,\" said Kazue Suzuki, Greenpeace Japan nuclear campaigner. \"It also provides clarity for the business community that renewable power, not nuclear, is the future. \"For too long Japan's leaders have ignored their people and gambled the health, safety and economic stability of every citizen on nuclear power, and as the people of Fukushima continue to suffer, so does the rest of our country. This announcement must become law, otherwise it will be seen as nothing but lip service to buy votes before the coming election.\" The report does not specify how the expensive shift to renewables would be funded, or how to minimise the environmental impact of greater fossil fuel use. The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, will be hoping that the decision boosts support for his unpopular administration ahead of a general election expected in November. Recent opinion polls showed most Japanese preferred a phase out over two other options proposed by the government that gave nuclear a limited role. \"We are only at the starting line,\" Noda said. \"Now we are going to begin an extremely difficult challenge. No matter how difficult it is, we can no longer put it off.\" However, if, as many expect, Noda's party is replaced by a more conservative administration after the next election, there is no guarantee that the no-nuclear policy will survive. Japan was briefly without nuclear power earlier this year after all 50 working reactors were closed for safety checks. No restarts were permitted until the reactors passed stress tests introduced in the wake of the Fukushima crisis and gained the approval of local authorities. The move away from nuclear has caused concern among Japan's allies. Japan provides nuclear technology expertise to companies in the US, while France and Britain, which reprocess its spent nuclear fuel, have sought assurances that it will continue to accept high-level radioactive waste created by reprocessing. In June, Noda approved the restart of two reactors in western Japan amid fears that the country would experience power cuts during the summer. He has come under sustained pressure from business leaders not to abandon nuclear, amid warnings that power shortfalls and the high cost of renewables could stifle production and derail attempts to kick-start the country's export-led economy. But some analysts said a serious shift towards renewables could benefit the economy. \"A total exit from nuclear is positive for the economy, on balance,\" said Andrew Dewit, a professor at Rikkyo University in Tokyo. \"It incentivises Japan's political economy to focus on efficiency and renewables. Japan lags in both these areas and they offer the greatest opportunities for growth.\" The phase-out will be achieved by retiring reactors, which were built between the early 1970s and 2006, when they reach the end of an agreed 40-year life span. The report said, however, that some could be restarted before they are closed permanently provided their safety is confirmed by a new regulatory body. \"We will launch all possible policy measures to achieve a nuclear-free society by the 2030s,\" the report said. \"Until the total phase-out we will only use nuclear reactors that are confirmed safe.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2015/oct/01/back-to-the-future-turns-30-great-scott","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-01T13:15:20Z","webTitle":"Great Scott!

Back to the Future turns 30 (and catches up with reality)","bodyText":"Lea Thompson smiles. “You can kill and kill and rape and maim and plunder,” she says sweetly. “But at some point you have to settle down and say: ‘Where’s the sewer?’” Thompson, who played Marty McFly’s mother Lorraine in the Back to the Future trilogy, is sitting next to a plate of Back to the Future cupcakes. Her eyes are kind, face full of dimples. Her topic is how infrastructural inefficacy could prove Isis’s downfall. “They may be able to conquer but they cannot rule,” she says. “People want families and bread and water and a bathroom and warmth. They need sewer systems.” Thompson and co-star Christopher Lloyd (Emmett “Doc” Brown), benign beside her, are approaching the finishing line on a four-day trip to London to talk about a trilogy of films which wrapped a quarter of a century ago. First there were three days on the selfie treadmill at Comic Con in Olympia. Now a day in aid of a new DVD box set and a one-day-only return to cinemas of the second instalment on 21 October. For this isn’t just the 30th anniversary of the release of the first movie, in which Michael J Fox’s skateboarding teen Marty McFly travels back to 1955 and accidentally endangers his own birth by being too cute (tagline: “Are you telling me that my mom’s got the hots for me?”). No. Stop the clocks, for 21 October 2015 is the date to which inventor Doc Brown (Lloyd) and Marty journey in Back to the Future II (1989), to a world of flying cars and self-tying sneakers, instant pizza and faxes in every room. Among fans, the excitement is impossible to overestimate. It’s teatime. Lloyd’s tummy is rumbling. Thompson requests vodka and I don’t think she’s kidding. They’re done talking pop-physics and flux capacitors, they’ve done mugging in front of mocked-up clock towers and agreeing that it’s about time someone marketed a viable hoverboard. Now they’ve moved on to more fundamentalist visions of the future. “What century are we in?” asks Thompson. “That weird medieval thing is insane. These beheadings. Why would you want to live in that kind of world?” She sighs. “But if you look at the numbers of people who want to live peacefully, they’re much greater. Most people just want to live in peace. And peace is a good warm bath.” Lloyd nods. “There’s so much discontent in the world. In America, so many young people don’t have an education or resources or jobs so they say: ‘Fuck it, here’s an Isis guy saying that I should do this and go there.’” He shakes his head sadly. “Isis don’t give a damn. It’s barbaric. It’s metastasising. It’s pervasive and it can catch fire.” Of the many remarkable things about Back to the Future – which is, I think, maybe the most remarkable mainstream movie trilogy of all time – one is that its stars are all still quite so singular, and so engaged. Fox has now raised more than $450m for Parkinson’s, the disease with which he was diagnosed in 1991. Crispin Glover, who played George McFly, Marty’s weedy dad, is a raw-food vegan with a castle in Transylvania and a sideline directing psychosexual fantasias about people with cerebral palsy. Lloyd, meanwhile, is, at 76, a terrific hippy; a relatively recent convert not just to the eco cause (he lost his home in the 2008 Californian forest fires) but also to movie conventions following decades of press abstention. As for Thompson: “I’m a little feminist!” she says, chirpy both in London and later, obligingly, on the phone from her LA ranch (horses, chickens, dogs, tortoise, parrot). “When I was cast, I disliked The Godfather. I was like: ‘Where’s the women’s stories? What is that? Why is that cool?’ I didn’t like Frank Sinatra. I adore men and I think things have gotten better but many women still can’t show their face, own land, drive a car. It’s crazy. They get stoned for being raped.” Anyway, that’s why Thompson intended her character in Back to the Future to be a “political statement” to show what happened to women when they were repressed. Lorraine was 17 in 1955, part of a generation who saw their mothers encouraged to work during the war, before such opportunity was whipped away. Presumably director Robert Zemeckis and writer Bob Gale approved all this? “I can’t tell you that I had any of these conversations with them about it. It was all completely my own work. It was that kind of behaviour that got in the way of both Eric Stoltz [the original Marty, fired after five weeks’ filming for not being funny enough] and Crispin Glover [who quit after the first film following rows over plot and pay]. I instinctively knew that it was just for me.” She laughs. So Thompson binged on vintage mags and contemporary pop, trying to soak up the messages. “The magazines were full of really crazy ads, ideas, recipes, telling you how to behave. The propaganda was: ‘Your man’s not going to love you unless you smell a certain way. And if you have a blender and wear a dress.’” “I remember that time,” says Lloyd. “The outburst of sexual freedom in the 60s was bound to happen, because the 50s were so oppressing. You had to live that way, women had to be like this – it was all locked into a false reality. And then the 60s just said: ‘Fuck this …’” He chuckles. In the flesh, Lloyd sounds miles more Jim Ignatowski – his whacked-out cabbie in Taxi – than the exposition-rattling Doc. “And that’s what I got to play,” says Thompson. “I had to be incredibly in love with my son. And that included horniness.” Back to the Future never demonises Lorraine’s lust, despite it being quite explicit, as well as incest. “It was an interesting high-wire act. I know they were nervous. But it is innocent in the sense that it is it’s just like a drive; she’s not making it lascivious. And it ended up being funny and strange and cute and sexy to people.” Thompson was a proper pin-up at the time; squeeze to Tom Cruise in All the Right Moves and Charlie Sheen in Red Dawn. That Back to the Future and its sequels aged her so vividly (raddled alkie; middle-aged cosmetically-enhanced sex slave; 87-year-old granny; Oirish peasant) has, she says, proved unexpectedly helpful. “Seeing a girl who was kind of known as an iconic pretty face get older can be hard. People get really upset, because it makes them feel older. They can be so mean about it! As if you could do anything to stop it! Luckily, I look better than they made me look, for the most part. And so I am in the unusual position where people aren’t shocked to see how old I am.” In fact, it goes for them both. Thompson – who stars in a long-running ABC drama, Switched at Birth, and is shooting her first film as director - looks like polished caramel. But Lloyd was only 46 when they shot the first film. Now, four years off 80, he wears jeans and silver chain, carries himself with the ease of a five-times-married gym-regular who’s love-bombed daily. One woman I speak to at Comic Con offers a compelling theory that the films’ secret weapon is that everyone secretly fancied Doc. Both sit upright and can seem more like athletes than actors. And stamina is required: those days at Olympia were long and noisy, heavy with expectation and heady with the kind of smell you might expect if you put thousands of people wearing latex cosplay in a Victorian conference centre. “It was a very stimulating weekend,” said Thompson. “I heard somebody say that the heat energy from each individual can light a 100 watt bulb. And you could feel that when you went into the main room.” Lloyd nods. “You go in there and you think: ‘Oh my God, I’m going to be signing for three hours?’ But then people come in with their energy and you pick up on it. It’s contagious.” He pauses. “I’m amazed the film has had such a long life, and that it doesn’t seem to be going to run down very soon. Interest keeps mounting and surging.” Theories about such longevity have spawned at least three books of critical theory. Of course, there’s the quality: inspired performances, immaculate screenplay, stirring score, kinetic direction, plus an adult edge (rape, incest, seeing your arm dissolve in front of you) that’s unusual in a family film. For Thompson, its allure lies in telling people “one moment can change your life. If you make the wrong move you’ll have a sad life and if you make the right move you’ll have a good life.” In the first film, the tipping point comes not when Marty accidentally hits 88mph, activating the time circuits and turning the film into a sci-fi, but when his father finally socks bullying Biff in the jaw. It is this which not only saves the day but switches history. So it’s potent, in an era dominated by the superhero movie, that Back to the Future tells us mere mortals we have the ability to save the world – no magic necessary. “That may be why it has such resonance,” says Thompson. “I think people are bored and that’s why they see these epic superhero movies where everyone’s dying. Plus a lot of people in America believe in the Rapture. They get to be there at the end of the world and watch it! I don’t know why anybody would want to, but people do.” Perhaps people today are keener than they were 30 years ago to dodge responsibility for their own fate? To sit back rather than embrace self-determination? “For me it’s important to realise that I can’t control everything,” she says. “That brings me a great deal of serenity. Plus, I’m obsessed with unintended consequences.” Such as? “Well, internet porn is heinous, does terrible things to people. But now, at least in America, there’s actually less rape. It turns out rapists are lazy. So instead of going out and doing horrible things to a person they’ll watch the internet and go to bed. And that’s an unintended consequence.” The consequences of Back to the Future in terms of how millions of us viewed a future we’re fast approaching are hard to quantify. Yet it’s hard not to think that the glossy optimism of that vision of 2015 led many of us to rose-tint it, too. Given the film’s impact, it can seem a shame it ignored the issue which now dictates discussions of the future: climate change. But Lloyd disputes this. The second movie did go there, he says, in the part set in a hellish alternate 1985, in which George is dead, Doc committed and the town a Mad Max hell of motorbikes and drive-by shootings, ruled by Biff, now a property, gambling, nuclear power and toxic waste tycoon (with a striking resemblance to Donald Trump). “The world he creates is totally exploitative,” says Lloyd. “All for his own financial gain. And much of it comes from fossil fuels. Now, changes in lifestyle have to be forced on us. We’ll always be wanting to exploit but we can’t afford this. The seas are rising and millions of people are going to be affected by that, and already are. We have to make sure there’s enough food, water and air … ” “From your lips to God’s ears,” chips in Thompson. “And it seems to me,” continues Lloyd, “eventually there has to be population control, because there aren’t the resources on the planet to take care of that many people. That’s going to be a huge thing. I mean, we condemn China for saying they can only have one child, and only a boy is important; now imagine how people in the US would react to being told they can only have two children per marriage? Nobody is gonna want to do that! But what are we gonna do? We can only feed so many people at a time.” So: the future is bleak. The second movie did foreshadow the world today – just not the part set in 2015; rather that section which led Zemeckis to call Back to the Future II the darkest film he’s ever made. And now our time is up, in all senses. As we all rise to leave, Thompson, ever friendly, tries to lighten the mood: “The good thing is, we’re old so we’re not gonna see the end of the world.” Lloyd grins sadly. “Well, I’m gonna go upstairs and shoot myself.” • The Back to the Future 30th Anniversary Trilogy DVD and Blu-ray is released on 5 October 2015. • Back to the Future: The Ultimate Visual History is out in the UK from Titan Books on 16 October 2015."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2014/jul/24/communities-could-be-paid-40m-for-considering-nuclear-waste-dump","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-24T12:56:52Z","webTitle":"Communities could be paid £40m for considering nuclear waste dump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/24/communities-could-be-paid-40m-for-considering-nuclear-waste-dump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/jul/24/communities-could-be-paid-40m-for-considering-nuclear-waste-dump","fields":{"headline":"Communities could be paid £40m for considering nuclear waste dump","bodyText":"Local communities could be paid over £40m by government for simply considering the building of an underground nuclear waste disposal facility in their area, ministers announced on Thursday. The renewed effort to find a permanent solution for the UK’s growing stockpile of nuclear waste comes after Cumbria council vetoed a proposed waste dump site in January 2013. But the new approach will not allow any one level of local government to veto future site decisions. The plan allows for communities to get up to £1m a year for about five years whilst local consultations take place. If the community moves to accepting exploratory drilling, which would take five to 15 years, they would get up to £2.5m a year, meaning a total of over £40m before a decision is taken on whether or not to build the waste burial facility. Additional and much higher community investment would follow a decision to build the facility. There is no cap on the number of communities that could apply for local consultation. The Liberal Democrat energy secretary, Ed Davey, said: “Geological disposal provides the secure, long-term solution we need to deal with the radioactive waste we have been creating for more than 60 years. \"Building and running a geological disposal facility will be a multi-billion pound infrastructure project, which will bring significant economic benefits to a community.” He said the new process was “based on a fundamental principle of listening to people”. But the plan was immediately attacked by the president of the LibDems, Tim Farron, who is a Cumbrian MP. “The geological disposal facility should not be foisted on a community without their wholehearted support. The mooted plans to remove the veto for local councils against a nuclear repository is undemocratic and makes an absolute mockery of the idea of localism.” Anti-nuclear campaigners dismissed the “no-strings-attached” payments to local communities as “bribes”. Following the government’s failure to persuade Cumbria to accept a deep nuclear waste disposal site, the new plan represents another return to the drawing board. Ministers have been trying without success to find a suitable site for over two decades. David Cameron said in 2007: “The problems of nuclear waste have not been dealt with and they have got to be dealt with to make any new investment possible.” However, the government has already given the green light for a new EDF nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The government said the new approach to waste disposal will involve two years of work to come up with a “more sophisticated” process by which the views of local communities affect decision taking, but it said the ability of a council to veto had gone. “All levels of local government must be involved but we are keen that no one level has an absolute veto,” said a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc). She said the new plan would give communities access to independent advice. “We hope putting in place these actions will mean volunteer communities will understand better what it is all about,” she said. “One of the lessons from our [Cumbria] experience and experience internationally is that the immediate reaction is negative, because ‘nuclear must be bad’, but once people to get to dig into the detail they get more positive.” Construction of the underground waste dump, sited between 250m and 1000m down, will then take 10-15 years, meaning it could be almost 2050 before any waste is buried. Germany, Sweden, Finland and the US are currently considering deep geological disposal for nuclear waste. The UK currently has around 600,000 cubic metres of nuclear waste, enough to fill the Royal Albert Hall six times over. Waste from any new nuclear plants will be more concentrated and current government projection for new reactors would mean another two more Albert Halls’ worth. The UK underground waste site is estimated to cost £12bn, more than the £9bn Olympic Games in London in 2012. The government says the sum is already accounted for in spending plans of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. Despite extensive previous geological examination, a new national screening process will take place to identify suitable regions, but it will not pinpoint a site. The chair of the campaign group Nuclear Free Local Authorities (NFLA), councillor Mark Hackett, said: “NFLA welcomes the new policy of carrying out a national geological screening exercise, rather than assuming waste can be buried near Cumbria where the geology has been shown to be unsuitable. We also welcome the idea of assisting communities to obtain independent third party expertise. \"Unfortunately there is still no recognition of the uncertainties associated with deep geological disposal highlighted by [government advisers], and the need to prioritise storage.” Keith Parker, chief executive af the Nuclear Industry Association, said: “This new approach should lead to much greater clarity on the key issues of underground storage, and more effective community engagement.” But Craig Bennett, at Friends of the Earth, said: “We’re still not even close to figuring out an adequate solution for the nuclear industry’s legacy of toxic radioactive waste. The fact that the government is now having to offer bribes to communities to even talk to them, while making it clear they will override their views anyway, makes it crystal clear that this is a technology of the past, not the future. UK governments have wasted immense amounts of money and political effort on nuclear power down the years. If even half of that had been put into renewables and energy efficiency, we’d all be in a much better place”. Greenpeace UK’s Louise Hutchins said: “This is a bullying and bribing approach by a government that is getting desperate about solving this problem. First David Cameron reneged on his promise [on nuclear waste], now he’s resorting to bribing reluctant communities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/dec/16/cheaper-oil-could-damage-renewable-energies-says-richard-branson","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-16T18:38:09Z","webTitle":"Cheaper oil could damage renewable energies, says Richard Branson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/16/cheaper-oil-could-damage-renewable-energies-says-richard-branson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/dec/16/cheaper-oil-could-damage-renewable-energies-says-richard-branson","fields":{"headline":"Cheaper oil could damage renewable energies, says Richard Branson","bodyText":"Saudi Arabia is encouraging the dramatic collapse of oil prices in order to damage the surging global clean energy industry, British entrepreneur Richard Branson has claimed. “They have done it before and it hurt. They don’t just want to damage the US fracking industry, but also the clean energy business. The collapse of oil prices is going to make it much more difficult for clean energy,” he warned, speaking from the Caribbean island of Necker. But the British entrepreneur said that now was the time for governments wanting to reduce their carbon emissions to introduce a carbon tax on fossil fuel users because the tax would be cushioned by the fall in prices.“If governments want a carbon tax [at the climate summit ] in Paris next year, then it would be the best time. What the clean energy business needs is a gap between it and coal and oil.” According to Branson, who part-owns Virgin airlines and has invested an estimated £300m in a succession of green fuel, solar and other clean-tech energy developments, the dramatic rise of renewables over the last few years has hurt oil producing countries as much as fracking. “Before the oil price collapsed, solar was actually cheaper [than oil]. If oil goes down to $30-$40 a barrel, then it will make it much harder for clean energy. Governments are going to have to think hard how to adapt to low oil prices,” he said. Branson was talking ahead of the merger of his not-for-profit low-carbon thinktank Carbon War Room with the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI). The latter was set up in 1982 by the west’s most celebrated energy-theorist, Amory Lovins. The two philanthropic organisations that Branson and Lovins head are unique in that they both advise businesses and governments how to reduce carbon emissions. “We both bring something. Carbon War Room is bold and agile, RMI has the rigour,” said Branson, who said he would continue to support the new operation financially. In a joint statement, the two organisations said they planned to expand into China and elsewhere to transform carbon-based economies “with a combination of science, technology and a‘let’s do it’ business spirit”. “We are closer than ever before to transforming the world’s economy to a lower-carbon trajectory. We need to accelerate demand and financing for low-carbon solutions, and quickly. We are both market-based, independent, nonpartisan, and working with technologies that are cost-effective today. We are excited by the role we have in what could be a historic economy-wide turning point for the world’s energy challenge”, said Lovins. “The climate challenge is no longer one of only gloom and doom, sacrifice, caps and taxes, or having less. The world has advanced considerably since the failed Copenhagen talks of 2009. Despite the economic recession, there are more and more proven, cost-effective, low-carbon solutions that are technically feasible and economically profitable today under current policy. The energy costs of wind and solar are now on parity with fossil fuels in the Caribbean, Hawaii, Alaska, and other diesel thirsty regions,” said Lovins, whose organisation helped to retrofit the Empire State building to safe energy. According to Lovins, the energy revolution is now in full swing, but many industries have not taken advantage of it. “The unsubsidised cost of electricity from the most cost-effective new onshore wind projects beats all other forms of generation. Solar PV modules have dropped in price by about 80% since 2008, while LED lights are 85% cheaper than five years ago. The integration of various clean technologies, like electric cars, batteries and solar panels, are mutually reinforcing the drive towards competitiveness.” “We believe this alliance offers the best philanthropic return on investment today, Our role will be a catalytic one – to drive business, industry by industry, to a tipping point where choosing anything but the clean option won’t make good business sense. Together, we will multiply our efforts to drive capital flow and reduce carbon by achieving industry-changing impact and international headlines that promote the breakthroughs and the pioneers achieving them,” said Jules Kortenhorst, who will serve as chief executive officer of the new organisation. Lovins is credited with helping to kickstart the global renewable energy revolution with a series of academic and policy papers in the 1960s and 70s. Since then, the Rocky Mountain Instistute has advised many of the world’s largest companies and dozens of countries how to reduce bills with renewables and has challenged the giant car, aviation and construction industries to rethink the way they operate. But Branson and Lovins are expected to disagree on some energy matters. The businessman is a known advocate of nuclear power, while Lovins earlier this year called Britain’s plans to build a new generation of reactors as“unbelievable”. “Nuclear prices only go up. Renewable energy prices come down. There is absolutely no business case for nuclear. The British policy has nothing to do with economic or any other rational base for decision making.”, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/video/2013/aug/20/fukushima-still-leaking-toxic-water-video","type":"video","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-20T15:07:00Z","webTitle":"Fukushima nuclear plant still leaking radioactive water, operator reveals - video","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2013/aug/20/fukushima-still-leaking-toxic-water-video","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/video/2013/aug/20/fukushima-still-leaking-toxic-water-video","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima nuclear plant still leaking radioactive water, operator reveals - video","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/feb/27/eu-energy-union-vladimir-putin-russia-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-27T06:30:01Z","webTitle":"The EU’s plan for an energy union would call Vladimir Putin’s bluff | Natalie Nougayrède","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/27/eu-energy-union-vladimir-putin-russia-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/27/eu-energy-union-vladimir-putin-russia-europe","fields":{"headline":"The EU’s plan for an energy union would call Vladimir Putin’s bluff","bodyText":"How many of us, as European citizens, turn on the gas to cook something and reflect that we are part of an enormous geopolitical and environmental picture? But we are. Europe’s energy dilemmas go back to the 1970s and 80s, when decisions were made to build huge gas infrastructure networks connecting the west of the continent to the Soviet Union’s gas fields. At the time, US presidents Jimmy Carter and then Ronald Reagan expressed worries that such plans would place European allies under Moscow’s sway. Fast forward to 2015 and the Ukrainian crisis: the latest message on Europe’s need to find smart ways to use energy and wean itself off its dependency on Russia’s Gazprom has just come from the European commission, with a new policy paper outlining ambitions for a European energy union. One of the reasons Europe has been so ineffective in dealing with Vladimir Putin is that it never quite anticipated to what degree he would use the energy card to further Russia’s nationalist goals. The question is: can Europe get it right now? It’s easy to understand why the proponents of an EU energy union would use slightly grandiose language to sell their ideas. They have cast this plan as the “most ambitious European energy project since the Coal and Steel Community” of the 1950s. After all, energy solidarity is what Europe was all about at the start. Having France and Germany share their coal and steel was seen, in the words of Robert Schuman, one of the founders of the European project, as the best way to “make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible”. Peace and prosperity were to flow from regional integration. Last year, war broke out in the country (Ukraine) through which most of Russia’s energy exports transit on their way to many of our homes. A key feature of Putin’s Ukraine strategy has been to make sure this country of transit would never quite escape Moscow’s domination – and that Gazprom would never lose the possibility of directly controlling Ukraine’s gas pipelines to Europe. The Brussels commission is right to push for a new union. Energy should be, along with freedom of movement for people, goods and services, a key dimension of the EU. It would help in dealing with Russia’s behaviour as well as in tackling climate change. It is of huge strategic importance. Yet it has not happened – so far – because it is so difficult to build politically, and it will be expensive. Energy is run nationally – not at EU level – at present. Key countries, especially the UK, France and Germany, have their own views on how energy policy should be run, and they are all different. The UK has a deregulated market, many private players, and no dependency on Gazprom. France is highly centralised, with a handful of , state-controlled big players and 75% of electricity generated by nuclear power (which is anathema to the Germans). Germany dislikes nuclear energy and wants to get rid of it, preferring to burn coal if they run out of gas or renewables. And they have had historically good relations with Gazprom. Poland burns a lot of coal (it prefers that to Russian gas), but Poles also want to look for shale gas. They don’t worry that much about greenhouse gases. The list goes on. There is a disorderly patchwork of energy policies across Europe. But questions that have been important for years need to be re-addressed. It is too late to settle scores over who wrecked Europe’s previous chances of setting up a common energy policy. But Germany does have a special responsibility here. Its large and powerful energy companies, E.ON and RWE, were the first in the early 2000s to carve out long-term contracts with Gazprom without much consultation with European partners. Later, Germany unilaterally signed up to Russia’s North Stream pipeline which the Baltic states and Poland could only perceive as an attempt to pressure them geopolitically. The new EU plan doesn’t aim to dismantle such realities but is pragmatic enough to try to deal with some of Europe’s obvious weaknesses. Because energy has been mostly a domestic issue there are very few, interconnecting pipelines and grids. The plan is to build more. This would allow compensation for energy cut offs – such as the ones that Russia created in 2006 and 2009, causing thousands of eastern European homes to be left without heating for weeks. Another idea is to diversify energy supplies by working on a southern gas corridor linking Europe to Turkey and Central Asia, or by setting up liquified natural gas hubs in northern Europe that could act as back-up in case of another gas crisis with Russia. The complexities are numerous. Some energy business insiders point out that negotiating with a Central Asian country such as Turkmenistan is like landing on another planet. One told me about a meeting with 30 Turkmen government officials sitting immobile behind long tables in the Hall of the Peoples of Turkmenistan’s capital, who didn’t say a word but just stared. Turkmenistan is a big gas producer whose operatives have been known to sell the same quantity of gas several times over to various buyers (Russians, Chinese, etc). The story that gets less attention than Ukraine’s military plight – or how Russia is yet again trying to strong arm it over gas payments – is that Gazprom is now clearly viewed as a security threat by just about everyone in Europe, including the Germans. For a few years now Gazprom has been getting a hard time from the EU, with antitrust proceedings on contracts and pricing clauses, dawn raids on their European offices and permits for some of their projects refused. A special anti-Gazprom clause was even included in a 2009 EU regulatory package that requires “unbundling” for the electricity and natural gas industry. Gazprom, say some experts (perhaps optimistically), has few friends left in Europe – except maybe in Viktor Orban’s Hungary, but they won’t count much in the big picture. If it negotiates as one bloc, Europe will not only be strategically stronger, but also in a better position to set an example on fulfilling its climate goals. The best way, for example, to encourage Poland to cut down on its use of coal is to ensure that its gas needs will not be subjected to external blackmailing. After all the criticism that has been aimed at EU institutions, the latest plan from Brussels deserves support."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2016/sep/19/corbyn-labour-leadership-says-huge-turnout-at-his-rallies-shows-he-can-win-an-election-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-19T15:26:01Z","webTitle":"Corbyn should have been given longer before being challenged, says Owen Smith – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/19/corbyn-labour-leadership-says-huge-turnout-at-his-rallies-shows-he-can-win-an-election-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/19/corbyn-labour-leadership-says-huge-turnout-at-his-rallies-shows-he-can-win-an-election-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Corbyn should have been given longer before being challenged, says Owen Smith – as it happened","bodyText":"Jon Ashworth, a member of the shadow cabinet and a member of Labour’s national executive committee, has cast doubt on the practicality of Jeremy Corbyn’s proposal to let party members elect some members of the shadow cabinet. Speaking on the World at One, Ashworth, the shadow minister without portfolio, said: This is an interesting proposal. We want greater democracy in the party. In the past Jeremy talked about more ballots of members on policy issues. That was a proposal put forward by Gordon Brown when he was the leader, but it got knocked back by people, indeed, particularly people who worried that it excluded the voice, the collective voice, of the affiliated unions. We will have to explore how these things work in practice. But there are practical issues that we need to understand. A ballot of the members, if it’s along the lines of the NEC ballot, costs £250,000. Is that money not better spent fighting our county council elections next year? Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, has challenged anyone wanting to oust him from his office to “bring it on”. At the weekend it was reported that Corbyn and his allies discussed a move against Watson at a private meeting at a country house in Surrey owned by Unite. In an interview with the House magazine, conducted before the weekend revelations were published and due to be published in full later this week, Watson said he would resist any attempt to force him out. He said: No one exists in democratic office forever. If there’s a move to nominate another candidate and trigger a deputy leadership race, then let’s bring it on. But I’m not entirely certain it would be a useful expenditure of collective political energy, particularly after the summer we’ve had. Sir Oliver Letwin, the former Cabinet Office minister, has revealed that the Conservatives did not have plans for a Queen’s speech for a Tory-majority government in the run-up to the last election. He told the World at One: We thought that there was a great likelihood of a coalition. I had several coalition agreements on my Blackberry, ready for different eventualities. As it turned out, we didn’t need them. Asked if he had a Tory Queen’s speech ready to go, he replied: “No, we didn’t, and one had to be prepared quite rapidly.” Theresa May will meet major US investors in New York in an attempt to reassure them about the Brexit process as part of her visit to the UN general assembly, she has said. British forces took part in a coalition air strike which the Syrian government claims left dozens of its troops dead at the weekend, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed. As the Press Association reports, an MoD spokesman said they were “fully co-operating” with the coalition investigation into what happened. The US military has already accepted it may have unintentionally struck Syrian troops while carrying out a raid against Islamic State forces on Saturday. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Tomorrow I will be blogging from the Lib Dem conference in Brighton, where Tim Farron, the party leader, will be speaking. While we’re on the subject of the repeated consumption of cultural products, it is worth pointing out that David Cameron also had masterpiece that he liked going back to. According to a Times profile some years ago, he has watched Where Eagles Dare at least 17 times. Jeremy Corbyn has finished his Mumsnet Q&amp;A. There were plenty of complaints on the page from readers unhappy about the quality of his responses, or the questions unanswered, but there always are, and so it would be a mistake to read too much into that. The most interesting revelation was that Corbyn says he has read Ulysses at least four times. I’m very impressed. I did a degree in English literature, and that’s at least three times more than I’ve read it. This is what Corbyn said when asked if he had a favourite book. Really hard choice as I love books and reading. I’ve just re-read Things Fall Apart, but I think the prize has to go to Ulysses on the grounds that it’s very hard to understand the first time and doesn’t get much easier on the third or fourth reading of it. I first read it as my companion on a complicated series of trains travelling from London to Marrakech. Otherwise, here are some of the other points of interest in what he said: Corbyn hinted that he was revising his views about wanting to decriminalise the sex industry. In a Q&amp;A earlier this year Corbyn said: “I am in favour of decriminalising the sex industry.” But today, when asked about this by a woman who said she did not agree, he adopted a more equivocal stance, saying that women working as prostitutes should not be criminalised, but suggesting, by implication, that he might be open to making buying sex illegal. Corbyn said: Thank you to Apulina and Raestory for your questions. I have voiced my support for decriminalisation in the past, motivated by not wanting those engaged in prostitution to become criminals, but I recognise there are a range of passionately-held views by those currently in sex work, and those such as Raestory, who identify themselves as survivors, by campaigners, and women’s rights activists. All these people have women’s interests and equality at heart. Where we can agree is that women in prostitution and sex work should not be criminalised or stigmatised, and have their human and citizen rights protected, and have access to the support of social, health, public services and justice. This is no less than all women deserve. He said that a “hard” Brexit would eliminate most manufacturing in the UK. Someone asked him about Brexit, saying that one notable economist has said a “hard” Brexit would mostly eliminate manufacturing. (This is a reference to Patrick Minford.) Corbyn replied: The economist who says that Hard Brexit would most eliminate [sic] manufacturing is right. Corbyn said he was someone who trid to “see something good” in everyone. Asked how he kept his focus in the light of relentless media attacks he replied: I am naturally a very patient person. I always try to see something good in all the people I am dealing with. And whilst the mainstream media have been fairly hostile it’s not my experience when travelling around the country and indeed in my office we have a wall of postcards from people of all ages from all parts of the country giving positive supportive opinions and wishing us well. Politics is too often done in a over-adversarial way which involves personal abuse and name-calling. I don’t do any of that and i don’t think anyone else should either. He said that socialism was a “natural instinct” to him. Asked what inspired him to become a socialist, he replied: Socialism is a natural instinct to me, one that shares wealth and resources, gives opportunities to all and recognises the limits of exploitation of our natural environment. I have many political influences, from my mother and father and also as a late teenager living and working in Jamaica and travelling throughout Latin America, I could see the dreadful levels of inequality there. Later as a trade union organiser seeing the way in which we can challenge injustice at the workplace and inequality through trade union membership. Socialism is about including all people and trying to create a world of peace. Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour’s refugee taskforce, has issued this statement in response to reports of what Theresa May will say in her speech to the UN summit on refugees. Cooper said: The prime minister is not doing enough. She is right to say there is a distinction between refugees and economic migrants – that is exactly why Britain should be doing more to help those fleeing persecution and war. Alongside border controls, we also need safe, legal routes to sanctuary including speeding up family reunion which is far too slow and mired in bureaucracy After a 14 year old boy died in Calais trying to reach his brother in the UK, children’s safety should be the top of the agenda. There are 900 children alone in Calais at serious risk of harm and exploitation. It is a complete disgrace that still not a single child has been helped under the Dubs legislation parliament voted for, and that Home Office delays are blocking hundreds of unaccompanied children from reaching their family and safety. The prime minister should immediately expedite the cases of all child refugees with family here in the UK, and work with the French to ensure no child is left in Calais by Christmas. A few hours after being on Today, Jeremy Corbyn is now doing a live Q&amp;A with Mumsnet. As all politicians know, Mumsnet is the much tougher gig. Corbyn has been getting stick for not typing quickly enough. Here’s an example. There are lots of questions posted to you in advance of the web chat, Jeremy. Normal web chat protocol is that you answer at least some of them. Or just you know more than 1 question in 15 minutes would be nice. So far the policy answers seem a bit routine, but Corbyn has declared himself “totally anti-sugar” in his answer to a question about his favourite biscuit (a staple Mumsnet question ever since Gordon Brown mucked up his answer to it). I’m totally anti-sugar on health grounds, so eat very few biscuits, but if forced to accept one, it’s always a pleasure to have a shortbread. Owen Smith, the Labour leadership challenger, has said that Jeremy Corbyn should have been given more time before being challenged for the Labour leadership. (See 1.21pm.) Corbyn has claimed that the huge crowds attending his rallies were evidence that Labour could win a general election and that this would start to show at next year’s local elections. (See 8.36am.) Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader and former deputy prime minister, has accused the Tories of being stuck“up the Brexit creek” without a paddle, canoe, or map. Speaking in a debate that say Lib Dem members vote overwhelmingly in favour of a motion saying any final Brexit deal should be put to the people in a referendum, Clegg said “swivel eyed” Tory backbenchers wanted to force Britain out of the single market and that this would have dire consequences for the economy. He said: You cannot have untrammelled access to a single market, which remember is a single market of rules, without abiding in one shape or form by those rules. That is what will lead to gridlock in the next few years. That is why they find themselves up this Brexit creek, never mind that they don’t have a paddle, they don’t have a canoe, they don’t have a map, they have absolutely no clue whatsoever ... I think, under pressure from their swivel-eyed backbenchers, under pressure from the, sort of, Brexit press, under pressure from their own internal contradictions, they will move remorselessly towards a hard Brexit. Not only taking us out of the European Union, but taking us out of the single market as well. And when they do that they will do untold damage to the British economy. When the Conservatives do that we must remorselessly remind them that they can never dare say again that they are the party of business.And, more importantly, they can never say again, having done so much damage to our great country because of their obsession about Europe, they can never again say that they are a responsible party of government. But the Lib Dems faced embarrassment when Sir Vince Cable, the former Lib Dem business secretary, used a fringe meeting to say he was opposed to the new party policy calling for a second referendum. (See 1.45pm.) Philip Hammond’s decision to transfer shares of his company to his wife shows he is not serious about tackling corporate tax avoidance, the Liberal Democrats’ Treasury spokesperson told the party’s conference, accusing the chancellor of “doing a Philip Green”. As Jessica Elgot reports, Susan Kramer said: “Despite being one of the richest MPs in parliament, Philip Hammond was reported by Channel 4’s Dispatches programme in 2010 to have done a Philip Green and transferred shares to his wife, which can have the happy coincidence of reducing one’s tax bill. This is certainly not illegal, but is it really the actions of a man certain to put the interests of Britain first, let alone to launch a crusade against corporate tax avoidance?” The Lib Dems have voted to opposed the construction of the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. Lynne Featherstone, the party’s energy spokesman, Failing to call a stop to Hinkley will prove a costly mistake. Not just the financial cost to consumers and the public purse, but the opportunity cost for renewables. The opportunity to pull the plug on Hinkley has been missed, and we will all pay for it from our pockets. Theresa May is to tell the UN general assembly of the dangers of “uncontrolled mass migration” as it meets in New York to discuss how to help more than 21 million refugees around the world. Alistair Darling, the former head of the Better Together campaign and former Labour chancellor, has dismissed the prospect of the SNP holding a second referendum on independence anytime soon. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning programme he said: I don’t think it will happen any time soon at all. Nothing has changed since 2014 in that roughly speaking 45% of the population would vote for independence, 55% would vote against it. That’s where we are and Nicola Sturgeon is not going to risk everything, her reputation - she has seen what has happened to David Cameron, who the only thing people will remember about him I suspect when history is written in years to come is that he accidentally got us out of the EU and he didn’t want it. If she loses, she knows she would be finished. That’s why she is in no hurry to rush into it. Ending the free movement of people from the European Union should become a key demand from Labour before the Brexit negotiations with the EU, according to a collection of essays from Labour figures. The exodus of banks from the City in the event of a “hard Brexit” would be modest and manageable, Moody’s, one of the world’s three biggest rating agencies, has predicted. University vice-chancellors fear the UK’s global reputation for higher education and research is already at risk after the vote to leave the EU, with more than 80% of university chiefs surveyed saying they believed the risk to funding would be “considerable”. At the Lib Dem conference former business secretary Sir Vince Cable, appearing at a fringe meeting with TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady, set out a rather different position from Tim Farron and much of the rest of his party on Brexit. Farron has made clear he will fight to keep Britain in the EU, and called for a second referendum to ratify the details of any exit deal - in which the LibDems would back remain. But Cable said: I just don’t agree with that: I don’t think we can say that. We should never have had the referendum in the first place; but the public have voted, and I do think it’s seriously disrespectful and politically utterly counterproductive to say, ‘sorry guys, you got it wrong, let’s try again’. He added that by rejecting even a “soft Brexit”, which preserved the best aspects of the “European ideal,” the LibDems would be lining up with Ukip, who would like to see a hard Brexit. “We should be very careful about the company we keep,” he said. My colleague Anushka Asthana has published a long interview with the Labour leadership challenger Owen Smith. In it, he says Jeremy Corbyn should have been given longer before being challenged for the Labour leadership. (Smith only stood after Angela Eagle had triggered a leadership contest.) Here’s an extract. What is his evidence that Corbyn can’t provide the necessary leadership in opposition? And even if that proves compelling, was nine months really enough time before MPs tried to oust a politician elected by the party’s membership? “I wasn’t in favour of there being a challenge,” says Smith quickly. “But once a challenge had been made then I felt I needed to stand because I felt that I had something to say about the future of the Labour party, and a lot of other people in the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] felt that about me, which is why they asked me to stand.” So Smith would have preferred to see Corbyn allowed to carry on for longer? “Yes, is the honest answer,” he says. Not that this is an admission of regret about his bid to topple the sitting leader. “The truth is, things weren’t going well, things aren’t going well. Nine months may be a short period of time but it’s a period of time in which the Labour party has gone backwards,” he says. “We are at a lower ebb than we’ve been in the polls at any time since 1982, and we’re six years into a Tory government and right now they are unfettered, they feel able to act with total impunity.” And here is the interview in full. Here are the main points from the Number 10 lobby briefing. Downing Street defended Liam Fox’s decision to tell businesses they should invest more abroad. According to ITV’s Robert Peston, the international trade secretary delivered this message recently at a meeting hosted by the CBI. Peston says some of those in the audience thought Fox was “bonkers”. Here is an extract from his blog. “Right now we need as much investment here as we can possibly get, to prevent a rise in unemployment - which is what many of us believe will be the painful reality of leaving the EU”, said the head of a huge UK company. “Few of us could really believe that he was telling us to invest more in other parts of the world. There was a real sense in the room of ‘this is bonkers’”. A senior City figure said: “We assumed he would be telling us to invest here. It was literally amazing that he said we should do precisely the opposite”. Another said the atmosphere in the room was “icy” - and said Mr Fox left without the usual applause. The prime minister’s spokesman said that Fox was making the point that “over time we need a balance of inward and outward investment for the national current account”. The spokesman insisted that the UK would not defy EU law when discussing future trade deals with countries outside the EU. Yesterday the Sunday Times (subscription) revealed that leaked documents show that Fox has been advised that, if the UK opens trade talks while still a member of the EU, it could be fined by the European commission. The spokesman would not comment specifically on the leaked document. He said the government was engaged in a “dialogue” with other countries about what its future trade relations might look like. But it would not defy EU rules, he said. Whilst we remain a member of the EU, we will comply with our responsibilities. Number 10 snubbed the Telegraph campaign calling for the Royal Yacht Britannia to be recommissioned to assist in future trade talks. On Saturday the Telegraph splashed on a story saying dozens of MPs were backing the newspaper’s campaign for the yacht to be brought out of retirement. In an editorial the paper said: Brexit, and the need to negotiate new trade deals, is calling the royal yacht back to service. A debate has begun over whether or not to return Britannia to sea or to commission a replacement. It has demonstrated its potential before: Britannia brought in an estimated £3 billion in commercial deals between 1991 and 1995. Now that the UK is taking back control of its national trade arrangements from Brussels, engagement with countries such as Australia and Canada is primed to begin. Britain is rediscovering its ancient role as a seafaring, mercantile power. In that context, the symbolism of the royal yacht is striking. But, when the spokesman was asked if the prime minister supported this campaign, he said the government was looking at “a number of ways” in which the government could achieve its ambition of turning the UK into a “global leader for free trade”. He went on: As far as I’m aware, the recommissioning of Britannia is not on the agenda for that. Downing Street defended the work of the Iraq Historical Abuse Team, following reports today that David Cameron tried to close it down when he was prime minister. The spokesman said that the work of IHAT had recently been reviewed and that the review found it to be “well led and operating well”. It would soon be moving to a position where it had a much reduced caseload, he said, and it was expected it would finish its work by the end of 2019. The spokesman said the government was raising the case of the “Chennai Six” at the highest level with the Indian government - but he refused to say if the government thought they had been wrongly jailed. Campaigners claim that the six former British servicemen, who were jailed for having weapons which they say they were using legitimately for anti-piracy work, are victims of a miscarriage of justice. The spokesman said that Theresa May was aware of the case and that British consular officials were “providing a full package of support”. The case has also been raised with the Indian government “at the highest level”, the spokesman said. But he refused to say whether the government was trying to secure their release or whether it was just trying to improve the conditions in which they are being held. I’m back from the Number 10 lobby briefing, and I’ll post a summary of it shortly. In the meantime, at the Lib Dem conference delegates have overwhelmingly backed a motion saying the final Brexit deal should be put to a referendum. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, said: The British people were trusted with the question of our departure, they should be trusted with the question of our destination. The terms of Brexit will have a huge impact on jobs, security and the opportunity to travel and live abroad. It cannot be right that such a momentous choice is secretly stitched up by bureaucrats on both sides of the Channel without the British people or Parliament having a say. The Liberal Democrats are now the only party who will give the public a vote on the final deal and who will campaign to remain in the EU. Jeremy Corbyn is doing a live Mumsnet chat at 2pm. You can read some of the questions already submitted here. I’m just off to the Number 10 lobby briefing. I will post again after 11.30am. Theresa May is flying to New York for a UN summit on refugees and migrants. As Rowena Mason reports in her preview story, she will warn of the dangers of “uncontrolled mass migration”. In Parliament Square campaigners from the International Rescue Committee have laid out 2,500 lifejacket to represent some of the refugees who have died trying to cross the Mediterranean. The leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Willie Rennie, will dub the SNP and the Tories the “terrible twins of divisive politics” when he addresses delegates at the UK party conference in Brighton later today. Rennie, whose party secured just five seats in May’s Holyrood elections, will tell the conference that both parties share an interest: “The Tories need Nationalists to scare voters in England. The Nationalists need the Tories to scare voters in Scotland.” “With the blow of Brexit and the threat of another Scottish independence referendum it means that divisive constitutional politics remain at the centre of our national debate.” “It is a dismal scene that has been visited upon us by the Conservatives and the SNP. Our future will be a divided one if we leave it to the Tories and the Nationalists. The terrible twins of divisive politics.” Here is some Twitter comment on the Jeremy Corbyn interview from political journalists and commentators. From CapX’s Iain Martin From the Times’ Hugo Rifkind From Huffington Post’s Ned Simons From the Mail on Sunday’s Dan Hodges From the FT’s Stefan Stern I’ve already covered most of the news lines from Jeremy Corbyn’s interview on the Today programme: his claim that the huge turnout for his rallies showed he could win the election; his offer to reach out to Labour MPs and his belief that Labour members want more democracy in the party. But here are two other lines worth noting. Corbyn dismissed Alan Johnson’s claim that he was “incompetent” and said that Johnson had misunderstood the nature of Corbyn’s opposition to the Blair government. Johnson, the Labour former home secretary, was highly critical of Corbyn in an interview with the Times (paywall) on Saturday. When it was put to him that Johnson had called him “incompetent”, “useless” and “incapable”, Corbyn replied: Very kind of Alan. How generous of him ... Alan hasn’t fully understood what my concerns were in the past. My concerns were when a Labour government led by Tony Blair took us into war in Iraq, I opposed that. When he tried to bring in, and indeed did bring in, tuition fees, I opposed him on that. I think he should understand my opposition to those issues was on the politics of it. I didn’t indulge in that language that many have used against me, and I never will. Here is a flavour of what Johnson said in the interview. [Corbyn] is totally incompetent and incapable of being the leader of a political party and he knows it,” he says. “He hasn’t got a huge ego but it’s got bigger and he’s self-righteous. There’s this adulation out there, it goes to your head. No compromise with the electorate was the left’s theme in the early Eighties and God forbid we go back to that. Corbyn rejected suggestions that he was avoiding giving interviews to mainstream media outlets. Nick Robinson, who was interviewing Corbyn, said this was the first interview with Today Corbyn had agreed to do since the leadership contest started. Citing what Corbyn said in his Guardian interview on Saturday about how “communication is everything” , Robinson put it to him that if he avoided interviews with the mainstream media, he could not win an election. Corbyn did not accept this. He insisted that he had done plenty of media: With the deepest and greatest respect to the Today programme - I know it’s the most important radio programme on the whole planet - it is not the only radio programme on the whole planet. So, yes, of course we will be reaching as best we can to all forms of communication ... It is not the only radio programme. We’ve done lots of radio programmes, lots of TV programmes, lots of social media, lots of regional programmes, and we are going to carry on doing it. The BBC included Jeremy Corbyn’s commenting about wanting to “reach out to” Labour MPs in its news bulletins before it broadcast the interview with him in full at 8.10am. Responding to the news reports, the Labour MP Neil Coyle told the programme just after 7am that Corbyn and his allies were not interested in party unity. Coyle, who was one of the Labour MPs named on a list of supposed abusive rebels released by the Corbyn camp last week,said that if Corbyn was re-elected, he and his supporters would “just continue to cause abuse”. Referring to the list Coyle said: If this is their attempt at reaching out or an attempt at engagement, then they are failing abysmally. He [Mr Corbyn] knew about it and did nothing to stop it being drawn up, did nothing to stop it being published, and has done nothing to demonstrate that he is interested in a unified party, which is why I say to any Labour members still listening who haven’t voted yet, they still have until Wednesday to make sure we end this nonsense. They are not interested in party unity. If they are re-elected, they will just continue to cause abuse. A year ago, the kind of abuse we are seeing in British politics, certainly on the left, was not there. Either by incompetence of design, it has happened under Jeremy’s watch and he should take some responsibility for it. Coyle said that some members of Momentum, the pro-Corbyn group, were “pragmatic and want to win and want to engage with voters”. But he said some Momentum activists were on the hard left and that Corbyn and John McDonnell were encouraging them. There is a section who aren’t interested in Labour winning the election, and are interested in only having a particular ideology and -ism at the top of the party. That’s unfortunate, and sadly Jeremy and John McDonnell in particular, they are encouraging that to continue - they are not trying to tackle it. Here’s our story about Jeremy Corbyn’s comments on Today. And here’s how it starts. There is “a thirst for greater democracy” within Labour, Jeremy Corbyn has said on the eve of a party meeting where he is expected to propose letting members help choose the shadow cabinet, a move that could cement his position as leader. However, less than a week before he is expected to be re-elected as Labour leader, Corbyn also said he was reaching out to dissatisfied party MPs, and stressed that they did not have to agree with everything he did. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Labour MPs needed to appreciate that they had “to try and deliver for the people”. The “good cop/bad cop” routine is a familiar one in any negotiation and it is a strategy the Labour leadership seems to have been adopting as Jeremy Corbyn ponders what to do about the majority of MPs who do not support his leadership. Some of his allies are quite happy to issue threats to the dissidents, as the Guardian reports in its splash today. But Corbyn himself has always been much more conciliatory, and he has used an interview with the Today programme to reiterate his willingness to “reach out to” to Labour MPs who have opposed him, assuming he wins the leadership election on Saturday. Corbyn told Today he hoped the party could unite. I have made it my business to talk to quite a lot of Labour MPs and will continue to do so and I hope they will understand that we’ve been elected as Labour MPs ... It doesn’t mean everybody agrees on everything all the time - that I understand - but the general direction of opposition to austerity, opposing the Tories on grammar schools, those are actually the kind of things that unite the party. In the interview, which was recorded at the weekend but broadcast this morning in the 8.10am, Corbyn also claimed the huge crowds attending his rallies showed that he could win an election. He was asked why he thought being able to get hundreds of people to attend a rally could lead to him gaining power. Corbyn said that tens of thousands of people had attended his rallies over the summer. That showed there was a real “interest in politics”, he said. The crowds were “pretty diverse”, he went on, and quite different from the sort of people who used to turn up to hear him speak before he became Labour leader. That then becomes, surely, a very strong campaigning basis for the Labour movement, becomes a campaigning factor in towns and cities where there’s never been very much activity before. That does begin to change the debate and national mood. I think you’ll begin to see that play out, particularly in local elections next year and after that. I’ve been at political rallies all my life, of various sorts. What I find exciting and nice, but slightly depressing, is when I know half the people at the meeting I go to. I go to these events all over the country, and some of them, I don’t know anybody. I don’t know anybody at all, and they’re people who come up to me who say ‘I’ve never been involved in politics before, I’m interested in what you have to say, because I’m interested particularly in the economic argument that you have to rebalance society away from inequality towards equality’. I will post more from the interview shortly, and all the latest developments in the Labour leadership contest. We’ve also a Number 10 lobby briefing, Theresa May heading for a UN conference in New York and the Lib Dem conference taking place in Brighton, with Nick Clegg holding a Q&amp;A on Brexit at 4.30pm. As usual, I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/nov/09/national-grid-500m-fund-to-put-pylons-underground-in-beauty-spots","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-09T14:23:16Z","webTitle":"National Grid’s £500m plan to move biggest and ugliest pylons underground","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/09/national-grid-500m-fund-to-put-pylons-underground-in-beauty-spots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/nov/09/national-grid-500m-fund-to-put-pylons-underground-in-beauty-spots","fields":{"headline":"National Grid’s £500m plan to move biggest and ugliest pylons underground","bodyText":"The “biggest and ugliest” electricity pylons slicing through some of the UK’s most treasured beauty spots are set to be torn down. National Grid will investigate ways to remove pylons from a shortlist of eight rural areas by putting the high-voltage transmission lines underground. The firm has 571km (355 miles) of pylon lines running through national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty (AONB) in England and Wales. The shortlisted areas are in the Snowdonia, Peak District, New Forest and Brecon Beacons national parks, and the Dorset, Tamar Valley, High Weald and North Wessex Downs AONBs, totalling 25km of lines. “Having decided these are the biggest and ugliest ones, we now have to look at the feasibility,” said Chris Baines, an environmental consultant and chair of National Grid’s stakeholder advisory group. “Undergrounding is best when you can do it, but we also have to make sure the treatment isn’t worse than the disease. It can leave quite a scar that is hard to heal.” Putting lines underground requires a 50-metre-wide trench to be dug to about two metres deep, to accommodate the six lines carried by pylons. Hard rocks or archaeological sites can also present obstacles. Alternatives include moving the pylons to less obtrusive locations. In the High Weald AONB in south-east England, the 50-metre-tall pylons may be moved down the hill, so they have wooded slopes behind them rather than sky. The scheme will add £500m to electricity bills over eight years, or about £7m a pylon, which National Grid says is equivalent to 22p a year on an average customer bill. Feasibility studies will be completed within a year, after which the final list of pylon-removal projects will be ready to go ahead. “There will be three or four of these shortlisted sections that are chosen for the full belt-and-braces disappearing act,” said Baines. Analysis conducted for the stakeholder group deemed 4km of Tamar Valley pylons to have by far the greatest visual impact and that project is being fast-tracked; 12km of pylons along the Woodhead Pass in the Peak District are also a priority. High-voltage lines cross 30 national parks and AONBs and George Mayhew, director of corporate affairs at National Grid, accepts those not shortlisted are likely to be disappointed: “I suspect all 30 sites would say our infrastructure has an impact.” He said there would be a £24m fund available to pay for other measures in those areas, such as planting woods to obscure the view of pylons or filling in gaps in hedgerows. The pylons to be removed were all erected in the 1950s and 60s when less consideration was given to their visual impact. The £500m bill for the scheme, approved by the regulator Ofgem, results from the cost of putting the lines underground: £20m-£22m a kilometre, compared with £2m for pylon lines. But Baines said: “These are particularly special places. No one would argue it would not be hugely beneficial to not have these pylons in these places.” The shortlist was welcomed by Ingrid Samuel, historic environment director at the National Trust: “We know it can be a big challenge for modern infrastructure to work in harmony with the landscape but it can be done when people work together to find the best solution.” Nick Clack, senior energy campaigner at the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said there had been thorough assessment and consultation: “This announcement is a really positive step. Given these welcome efforts to mitigate the impact of existing lines, National Grid needs to make sure it is doing all it can to mitigate the impact of new ones.” National Grid plans to spend more than £10bn on new transmission lines by 2021 as windfarms and nuclear plants are built. But Mayhew said the mistakes of the 50s would not be repeated. He said, for example, the major lines needed to connect the planned nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset would include 8.5km of underground cables through the Mendip Hills, and that underground cables were under consideration for a large and controversial windfarm in mid-Wales."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2013/dec/26/toshiba-stake-uk-nuclear-consortium","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2013-12-26T19:24:55Z","webTitle":"Toshiba to buy majority stake in UK nuclear consortium","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/26/toshiba-stake-uk-nuclear-consortium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2013/dec/26/toshiba-stake-uk-nuclear-consortium","fields":{"headline":"Toshiba to buy majority stake in UK nuclear consortium","bodyText":"Japanese group Toshiba has confirmed that it is in the final stages of securing a majority stake in a British nuclear power consortium, bringing a further boost to the UK's ambitious nuclear programme. Toshiba's chief executive, Hisao Tanaka, said an agreement to take a controlling shareholding in the NuGen consortium could be in place as early as January. NuGen is a joint venture between Spanish power company Iberdrola and French utility firm GDF Suez that is developing a plant at Sellafield in Cumbria, where the owners plan to build 3.6 gigawatts of nuclear capacity on a disused reactor site. Confirming that Toshiba will also buy part of GDF Suez's 50% stake when it acquires Iberdrola's 50% shareholding, Tanaka said: \"We want a majority to move forward. So we would want to take some of GDF's share, but have them remain as an operator.\" He added that securing a long-awaited majority holding in the NuGen consortium would guarantee a $14bn (£8.5bn) deal for Toshiba's Westinghouse unit to supply three reactors for the project. Toshiba is keen to kickstart an ambitious reactor building programme that stalled after countries around the world – led by Germany – froze nuclear expansion plans and tightened regulations in the wake of Japan's 2011 disaster at Fukushima. Its domestic rival, Hitachi, has bought the Horizon project which intends to build two nuclear power stations, in Anglesey and Gloucestershire. Britain is one of the few countries pressing ahead with nuclear plans in spite of the safety fears raised by Fukushima. The government's determination to make nuclear a central part of its energy strategy was confirmed two months ago when ministers approved a deal with France's EDF Energy to build the £16bn Hinkley Point nuclear power plant in Somerset. Analysts at Liberum Capital said state guarantees on electricity prices offered to EDF in order to secure the deal could prove to be \"economically insane\". The European Union has also weighed into the nuclear subsidy debate by launching an investigation into whether the Hinkley deal broke state aid rules. Iberdrola, which is selling assets to reduce debt, said this week that it has agreed to sell its 50% in NuGen to Toshiba for £85m, subject to final approvals, terms and conditions. Tanaka said a majority stake was necessary to make progress on the project, where delays have frustrated the UK government, sources say, as it pushes through its own ambitious nuclear programme to replace new reactors. A controlling stake would allow Westinghouse, 87%-owned by Toshiba, to supply three of its AP1000 reactors for the site. After building the reactors, Toshiba would reduce its stake, Tanaka said. \"We are thinking about an exit, but we haven't decided anything yet,\" he said. \"We will reduce our majority stake over time. We are a plant provider, not a nuclear power provider.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2015/jan/16/haruki-murakami-agony-uncle-fans-online-questions","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-16T10:03:00Z","webTitle":"Secrets and advice: Haruki Murakami responds to readers’ questions online","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/16/haruki-murakami-agony-uncle-fans-online-questions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/jan/16/haruki-murakami-agony-uncle-fans-online-questions","fields":{"headline":"Secrets and advice: Haruki Murakami responds to readers’ questions online","bodyText":"Haruki Murakami concedes he could improve on one of his most famous novels, says he has learned to live with the barbs of his critics, and admits feeling slightly awkward about sharing a birthday with Adolf Hitler’s right-hand man. The novelist’s long-awaited reincarnation as an agony uncle began on Friday when he started responding to fans’ online questions about, among other topics, bringing up children and hate speech, although he predictably steered away from offering any insights into his private life. The 66-year-old’s advice column debut was notable, too, for the absence of any discussion about his well-known passion for jazz, cats, running and the Yakult Swallows baseball team. A day after its launch, Murakami-san no tokoro – or Mr Murakami’s Place – is playing it safe, in keeping with his insistence on indulging in light-hearted conversation with his readers. Launched by the publishing company Shinchosha, the website shows cartoon renderings of Murakami, dressed in a blue sweater and sitting with animals or typing on a laptop. The site will accept questions until 31 January, with Murakami’s responses to a small selection appearing over the following two months. In 10 brief contributions on the site on Friday, Murakami confirmed his reputation for reticence, but displayed moments of sardonic wit that will delight devotees in Japan and dozens of other countries where his books have sold millions in translation. One of the early questions came from a 51-year-old doctor who wondered if he was entitled to a “special invitation” to spend a day by the author’s side. He may have been disappointed with Murakami’s polite, but firm, reply: “There are tiny secrets about my life, so it would be troubling for you to take a peek into it,” he said. “Instead, try taking a look into other people’s lives.” Murakami, who established himself as a leading author with his 1987 novel Norwegian Wood, is coaxed into a rare loquacious response to a question about the “global problem” of hate speech. “As a novelist, I am occasionally the target of hate speech,” he wrote. “There are, after all, some awful people out there … We have to do something about this trend.” It was not fair, he added, to target people because of their race or other things over which they had no control. He assured visitors to the site that he would read and reply to the questions personally. “It’s not like I just sign what I made an assistant or editor write,” he said in a greeting. “Unfortunately I only have one body … I can’t answer everyone.” The site is in Japanese, but Shinchosha said it would accept questions in English and other languages: an English translation of the application form can be found at the Taiwan, Japan, Spain and I blog. The writer rarely appears in public, preferring to restrict any direct contact with his readers to occasional message exchanges. He has, though, spoken out on contentious topics, such as nuclear power, peace and Japan’s resurgent nationalism. Readers are invited to post questions or “little somethings” they want to share with the author. No subject is taboo, although messages should contain a maximum of 1,200 characters. One reader, a 43-year-old woman, managed to elicit a guarded response about Murakami’s writing plans. Asked if he had considered a third work of non-fiction to add to those about running and the 1995 sarin gas attacks on the Tokyo subway, he said: “I’ve thought about it, but there’s been no real movement on this. The preparation is really hard work.” Another person asked him how he would improve one of his best-known novels, Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, if he had the chance to write the 30-year-old work again. “When you think about a girl you dated a long time ago, don’t you find yourself thinking, ‘Ah, if only things had gone better,’” Murakami replied. “I often do. It’s the same thing … if only things had gone better. That said, then was then, and I think I did my best.” Murakami only embraces his agony uncle alter ego once, when a 32-year-old mother explains that she wants to bring up her 11-year-old son to be like him. “He plays computer games every day and never reads books,” she complained. Murakami replied: “Bring him up like me? I wonder what you mean by that. It’s quite tough being me … but I somehow managed it, because I am me. “If you mean you want to bring him up to like books, then I think you have to leave that up to him,” he said, adding that he no longer reads as much as he would like since his eyesight seems to have deteriorated slightly. In response to a 49-year-old woman born on the same date as the novelist – 12 January – he points out that they share a birthday with the author Jack London, but also with the Nazi second-in-command Hermann Göring. “That’s a bit of a problem,” he said. “But it turns out that after the allies arrested the most senior Nazis after the war, Göring performed best at a kind of intelligence test. Maybe that was down to his date of birth.” Murakami went on to say he celebrated his birthday with a visit to a restaurant, where he ate a “seafood tower”: a stack of delicacies comprising shrimp, lobster, oysters, mussels, sashimi and octopus. “It was incredible,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2014/sep/25/edge-of-darkness-box-set-apocalyptic-thriller","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-25T15:00:08Z","webTitle":"Edge of Darkness box set review – a deep and doomy apocalyptic thriller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/25/edge-of-darkness-box-set-apocalyptic-thriller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/25/edge-of-darkness-box-set-apocalyptic-thriller","fields":{"headline":"Edge of Darkness box set review – a deep and doomy apocalyptic thriller","bodyText":"Is Darius Jedburgh the most gung-ho TV character of the 1980s? There he is, our swaggering, golf-obsessed CIA agent, shaking up a nuclear energy conference in the Scottish highlands by whipping two plutonium rods out of a Harrods bag and shouting “Get it while it’s hot!” at the quaking, high-power delegates. It’s a move that certainly gets him the room, as well as the gong for one of the most combustible scenes (literally) in British TV history. But Jedburgh’s scene-stealer is no isolated moment: this six-part drama from 1985 glows from start to finish. Only an actor of immense calibre could compete with Joe Don Baker as Jedburgh. Step forward Bob Peck, utterly mesmerising as our hero, Yorkshire police detective Ronnie Craven, whose eco-activist daughter Emma (Joanne Whalley) is gunned down in front of his eyes in the opening minutes. Attempting to find out why, Craven and Jedburgh become uneasy partners in a twisting, breathless plot involving MI5, the IRA, the nuclear industry and the talking ghost of Emma. A Shakespearean actor who was not often seen on TV, the late Peck manages to be both heartbroken and wry simultaneously. In one wrenching scene he stumbles across his dead daughter’s vibrator and kisses it. It’s this performance he should be remembered for, not being eaten alive in Jurassic Park. Edge of Darkness couldn’t have been more topical – and we’re not just talking about the perms and pussybow blouses. There’s the portrayal of corrupt-but-decent miners’ union leader Godbolt (a fantastically craggy Jack Watson) coming straight after Britain’s bitterly divisive miners’ strike. And there’s ruthless corporate America choppering in, just as Thatcher was busily deregulating the markets. Most of all, with the green movement gearing up, the series’ Northmoor nuclear plant – to which Craven’s investigations lead – serves as a fictional version of serially leaky Sellafield, exemplifying the blurred line between nuclear power and nuclear weapons, not to mention the radiation risks attached to both. British Nuclear Fuels had barely finished cleaning Cumbria’s beaches after the 1983 Sellafield leak when Edge of Darkness came out. In fact, one of the show’s highlights is the claustrophobic, sofa-arm-clutching scene when Craven and Jedburgh break into Northmoor’s 10-mile warren of spooky, disused mining shafts. It does not end well. Edge of Darkness deservedly bagged 8 million viewers and a bevy of Baftas. So avoid its director Martin Campbell’s dodgy 2010 big screen remake with Mel Gibson and luxuriate instead in the depth and doominess of this hypnotically paced original. If the apocalyptic bleakness came out of nowhere for writer Troy Kennedy Martin, his caper background (The Italian Job, Kelly’s Heroes) is perhaps detectable in Edge’s pepper-sprays of unexpected queasy humour. These come largely from Jedburgh, who loves guns, golf and watching Come Dancing, but also from MI5 agents Harcourt (Ian McNeice) and Pendleton (Charles Kay), as marvellously suave as they are mysterious and amoral. “What’s for pudding?” chubby Harcourt whispers animatedly as, in another location, his hit-squad close in on Craven and Jedburgh. Other pleasures include seeing Zoe Wanamaker playing sexy and enigmatic as Clementine, while even Eric Clapton’s bluesy guitar soundtrack proves suitably eerie and menacing. Praise, too, for the neat use of Willie Nelson’s sublime Time of the Preacher: Jedburgh and Craven actually sing it together on two occasions. Rather than being corny, it’s a chilling, riveting moment in a series stuffed with them. “Preacher”, we discover, means gun. • Edge of Darkness box set"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2014/nov/21/nhs-patient-safety-berwick-report","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-21T09:20:05Z","webTitle":"How has the NHS improved patient safety?\r\n","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2014/nov/21/nhs-patient-safety-berwick-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/2014/nov/21/nhs-patient-safety-berwick-report","fields":{"headline":"How has the NHS improved patient safety?","bodyText":"It has been just over a year since Professor Don Berwick produced his review of patient safety in England, offering a distinct shift in emphasis from the focus of the Francis inquiry. Most notably, it stated that “rules, standards, regulations and enforcement have a place in the pursuit of quality, but they pale in potential compared to the power of pervasive and constant learning”. The review team was specifically asked how the NHS can “make zero harm a reality”. They came back and said sorry, this is just not possible (my paraphrasing), but instead filled the report with the broader ambition of a “continual reduction of harm”. So what impact has the Berwick report had on the NHS? In conjunction with Monitor and the Trust Development Authority, the Health Foundation sent a survey to every NHS provider in England. We received anonymised responses from 99 organisations (a 40% response rate) including acute, mental health, community and ambulance services. The headline results are set out in this infographic. Two-thirds of respondents told us that the report had a “high” or “very high” impact on their safety improvement agenda. We heard many examples of action they directly attribute to the report, from the ward (where it improved incident reporting and helped spread learning) to the board (where it informed strategies, policies and governance structures). Respondents told us that action was already under way before the report in areas such as monitoring safety and embracing transparency, but that it gave an added endorsement and the motivation to do more. Crucially, more than nine out of 10 respondents thought they were making progress towards the continual reduction of harm. It seems from this research that the NHS has responded well to being praised for its efforts rather than being criticised for its “failings”. But while there is cause for optimism, it is this concept of “failure” that suggests the NHS hasn’t yet taken up the most critical recommendation from the report: to “abandon blame as a tool”. For instance, we have just seen the Heart of England NHS foundation trust criticised for a “clear failure in leadership”, following concerns about waiting times and mortality rates. This led to the resignation of its chief executive, Dr Mark Newbold. Mike Farrar, former chief executive of the NHS Confederation, came to speak to Health Foundation staff recently and pointed out that we have seen “responsibility [for safe care] increasingly externalised” to regulators and national bodies. If this is the case, have we created a system where oversight bodies will inevitably apportion blame as part of their legal duty to take remedial action? In our survey, we asked what role national bodies should play in improving safety. Respondents told us they want practical and moral support – practical support in the form of sharing learning, evidence and best practice on what works and providing tools and resources, and moral support in terms of greater acknowledgement of where improvements have been made, and recognising that lasting change takes time. Is it time to rethink the role of national bodies in supporting improvement? Rather than focus on the quality of care, should they focus on creating conditions that allow improvement to flourish at the frontline? After all, our survey showed that where providers are making the least progress is in supporting and training staff to improve care processes. The manufacturing sector is a good example of an industry that has pursued quality by moving away from external assurance and towards empowering frontline staff to act when things go wrong. Inspections and audits play their part, but largely to help the operators deliver the best quality possible, not to take responsibility for it. Similarly, our research report on safety cases illustrates how it is the primary responsibility of operators in other safety-critical industries, such as nuclear power and commercial aviation, to make the case for the safety of its services, products and infrastructure. Whatever the future holds, this survey has given us cause for optimism about how organisations at a local level are pursuing safer care, and cause for thought at a national level as to how we can best support further progress. The Health Foundation has created resources to support frontline teams to meet the challenges identified by the Francis inquiry. Are you a member of our online community?

The prime minister, by training a research chemist, acknowledged that the government might be considered negligent for failing to acquire a “retaliatory capability” at the height of the cold war. Secret papers canvassing the military options available have emerged from a Home Office file, released on Tuesday by the National Archives in Kew, which contains warnings that airborne chemical attacks by Soviet aircraft on sensitive UK targets could inflict massive loss of life. One civil defence paper estimated that up to 140,000 people could be injured and more than 20,000 killed if Liverpool’s dockyards were hit by lethal gases. If Gatwick was struck, medical modelling suggested, there would be about 30,000 casualties and 16,000 dead. The UK had ratified the Geneva protocols in 1930, which banned the use of toxic gases and bacteria in war. But the treaty did not outlaw development or production of such weapons of mass destruction and permitted their use in retaliation. The communist bloc’s expanding stockpile of nerve agents alarmed Ministry of Defence planners who warned that there was no military response short of escalating directly to nuclear conflict. “Any significant step … to improve our retaliatory capability will involve serious political and presentational difficulties,” a secret policy document admitted. Saddam Hussein’s use of sarin and other toxic agents in the Iran/Iraq war was seen as helpful in alerting the public to the threat. In February 1984, the prime minister attended a CW briefing in the chief of staff’s room at the MoD along with the defence secretary, then Michael Heseltine, senior army and intelligence officers and the government’s chief scientific adviser. “Nato has no capability to retaliate in kind, although the Americans have a small stockpile not declared to Nato,” civil servants reported. “The threat of nuclear retaliation in response to a chemical attack is our only deterrent and is not credible in all circumstances. “MoD are currently considering proposals for issuing … protective suits to UK-based servicemen and essential supporting staff. There is however little public awareness of the threat outside official circles, no civil defence plans are yet made against chemical weapons and no formal guidance has been issued.” Another note recorded: “Chemical warfare is likely to be an emotional issue and any increase in public awareness is, if possible, best delayed until the general public can be given credible guidance on protection measures.” Problems were anticipated. A policy document rated “Secret UK Eyes A” said: “A sharp turn in HMG’s policy on CW basing or acquisition, after 25 years of no direct involvement with such weapons, will provoke political controversy just when the public debate over the basing of cruise missiles is showing signs of declining. “A unilateral UK move would create even starker problems of domestic and international presentation, particularly if such action were to contrast with continued congressional reluctance to fund modernisation.” It observed that the military chiefs of staff believed the only effective and credible deterrent to Soviet use of chemical weapons was “the ability to retaliate in kind”. Among retaliatory options proposed were offering “practical support to the US administration by permitting the forward basing of US delivery systems and storage of CW in this country in time of tension or even in peacetime. A variation would be to offer to provide delivery systems ourselves … “Finally there is the option of acquiring an independent UK retaliatory capability, based perhaps on American technology. The cost would be of the order of £100m to £200m. Such a decision would be a last resort should all other options fail.” The file does not record the final outcome of deliberations but a letter from Charles Powell, Thatcher’s private secretary in Downing Street, recorded the outcome of a further, senior ministerial summit on chemical weapons in August that year. The following decision had been made, Powell informed the permanent secretary at the MoD: “Modern NBC [nuclear, biological or chemical] equipment should be issued to servicemen and essential civilians in British forces Germany and to some 140,000 servicemen in the UK with a Nato role.” He added: “The Americans should be encouraged to move forward with modernisation of their capability … Public opinion in the UK could be brought gently to a better and wider perception of the imbalance between Soviet and Nato capabilities in chemical warfare while avoiding an upsurge of alarm.” Assessing whether the UK should acquire an independent CW capability, attention was drawn to the drawback that “it might undermine the broader support which had been built up recently in public opinion for the UK’s role as a nuclear power. “Summing up the discussion, the prime minister said that it might be argued that it was negligent of the government not to acquire a CW capability. But this was not a decision which could be addressed at this stage. Further discussions should be held with the Americans to discover more of their intentions and to encourage them to modernise their CW capability. These discussions should be on a bilateral basis rather than involving other Allies who were unlikely to have similar views.” The UK did not sign the chemical weapons convention, by which participating countries agreed to destroy all CW capability, until 1993."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/jul/20/china-uk-nuclear-power-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-20T19:20:00Z","webTitle":"China in talks to build UK nuclear power plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/20/china-uk-nuclear-power-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/jul/20/china-uk-nuclear-power-plants","fields":{"headline":"China in talks to build UK nuclear power plants","bodyText":"China is poised to make a dramatic intervention in Britain's energy future by offering to invest billions of pounds in building a series of new nuclear power stations. Officials from China's nuclear industry have been in high-level talks with ministers and officials at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) this week about a plan that could eventually involve up to five different reactors being built at a total cost of £35bn. Greenpeace described the move as desperate, while others warned of security fears, but the government has been courting China as the UK atomic programme has been hit by rows over subsidies and worries that EDF – the French company with the most advanced plans to build new reactors in the UK – could be hampered by the change of government in Paris. China has operated its own atomic plants since 1994. It is awash with cash from its hugely successful industrial expansion and sees the UK as a potential shop window for exporting its atomic technology and expertise worldwide. Companies from China have already invested in or taken over other infrastructure assets in Britain, such as Thames Water, the port of Felixstowe and the Grangemouth oil refinery. They also own businesses ranging from Weetabix to the Gieves &amp; Hawkes tailoring brand. The China National Nuclear Power Corporation (CNNPC), which is keen to invest in Britain, has just unveiled plans to raise about £17bn through a domestic share offering. A team from the Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research and Design Institute (SNERDI), an arm of the huge China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), met senior DECC officials over the last few days, three different sources confirmed. The first part of the plan involves CNNC and another state-owned firm, China Guangdong Nuclear Power Corporation, bidding in two separate groups against each other for a stake in the Horizon consortium, which wants to construct new atomic plants at Wylfa in Wales and Oldbury in Gloucestershire. But sources close to the Chinese say they are also interested in other locations at Bradwell in Essex, Heysham in Lancashire and Hartlepool in County Durham. EDF has the right of first refusal to operate on these sites but CNNC wants to use an existing technology tie-up with US-based nuclear engineering group Westinghouse to potentially build three more reactors. The Chinese accept they would need to bring in a UK utility firm to operate the plants and overcome any political or public resistance to their plans. \"The Chinese have the money and the experience,\" said the well-placed source. \"They see setting up in the UK as an opportunity to show they can operate in one of the world's toughest regulatory environments so they can then move into other markets in Africa and the Middle East.\" The DECC was unwilling to comment on whether it had met SNERDI officials this week, saying such meetings would be commercially confidential. A DECC spokesman would only say: \"The UK is open for business and actively welcomes inward investment to our energy sector, but any potential nuclear operator is, and would be, subject to rigorous scrutiny through the established regulatory process.\" Keith Parker, chairman of the Nuclear Industry Association in London, said it was \"highly encouraging\" that China wanted to invest in the UK. \"They have 14 of their own reactors in operation and 25 under construction and they use both [French multinational] Areva and Westinghouse designs that could be used here. It was clear from my discussions with them that they have international ambitions.\" In May, the energy minister Charles Hendry told the Energy and Climate Change select committee that he had no objection to Chinese firms being involved in the UK. \"In China, there are different companies who have experience of building dozens of nuclear power stations on time and on budget, and so there is no suggestion that these are companies that do not have expertise in this sector. They have extremely well-proven expertise in this sector, and in looking at how we take this forward in the United Kingdom I think we should be guided by where that expertise has already been proven.\" But Greenpeace said the bid to woo China was a last throw of the dice by the government. \"This is a sign of desperation,\" said Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace. \"Chinese nuclear players have state backing, which could help solve the issue of financing colossally expensive new nuclear power stations in the UK. But this just means that the money from UK taxpayers will flow to the Chinese government, rather than to France.\" The potential for political conflict has been highlighted by the former Downing Street energy policy director Nick Butler. He wrote in a recent Financial Times blogpost that Chinese involvement in the UK energy business could be a concern [subscription required]: \"They will be inside the system, with access to the intricate architecture of the UK's National Grid and the processes through which electricity supply is controlled, as well as to the UK's nuclear technology. \"Perhaps that doesn't matter. Perhaps a Chinese wall exists between the Guangdong Holding company and the government in Beijing.

They have flooded land areas the size of California, displaced a population the size of Germany’s, and turned freshwater into the ecosystem most threatened by species extinction. Below are 12 of the 57,000 large dams that have changed the face of our planet: Hoover: the dam that gave us Las Vegas The Hoover Dam was the world’s highest and most powerful dam when it was completed in 1936. It spurred the agricultural and industrial development of the US southwest, and destroyed the Colorado river’s rich downstream fisheries. Climate change is greatly affecting the dam’s capacity to supply water and generate power. Kariba: the dam that ended poverty in Southern Africa (or did it?) The Kariba Dam on the Zambezi was built in the 1950s to power Zambia’s copper belt, as the first large dam funded by the World Bank. Kariba was considered the symbol of a “brave new world”, in which controlling nature would bring quick economic development. Yet the 57,000 people who were displaced by the dam suffered famine and are still impoverished. Bhakra: the temple of modern India In the 1960s, the Bhakra Dam became the symbol of India’s green revolution, and was hailed by the then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru as a “Temple of Modern India”. Yet in India and beyond, badly managed irrigation schemes have resulted in waterlogged, saline soils and diminishing harvests. Nehru soon came to deplore the “disease of giganticism” in dam building. Chixoy: the grave on the Rio Negro Dam-affected communities have often suffered repression and human rights abuses. In 1982, more than 400 indigenous men, women and children were massacred to make way for the World Bank’s Chixoy Dam in Guatemala. In a historic breakthrough, the country’s government in 2014 signed a $154m reparations agreement with the affected communities. Banqiao: the dam that washed away When dams are not properly built or maintained, they can break. In the world’s biggest dam disaster, the failure of China’s Banqiao Dam killed an estimated 171,000 people in 1975. In more than 100 cases, scientists have also linked dam building to earthquakes. Strong evidence suggests that China’s Sichuan earthquake, which killed 80,000 people in 2008, may have been triggered by the Zipingpu Dam. Yacyretá: the monument to corruption Large dams are often pet projects of dictators. Lacking accountability leads to massive corruption and cost overruns. On average, large dams experience cost overruns of 96% and are not economic. The cost of Argentina’s Yacyretá Dam has mushroomed from $2.5bn to $15bn. A former president called Yacyretá “a monument to corruption”. Nagymaros: the dam that started people power in eastern Europe In 1988, 40,000 Hungarians protested against the proposed Nagymaros Dam on the Danube in the first open defiance of a communist government in decades. The following year, the project was stopped and people power took root throughout eastern Europe. Protests against destructive dams also started democratic processes in Burma and other countries. Sardar Sarovar: the dam that defeated the World Bank The Sardar Sarovar Dam on India’s Narmada river has displaced more than 250,000 mainly indigenous people. The World Bank had to withdraw from the project in 1994 after an independent review found systematic violations of its social and environmental policies. After this humiliating experience, the bank stayed out of mega-dams for more than a decade. Three Gorges: Mao’s dream come true China’s Three Gorges Dam is the world’s largest hydropower project and was completed in 2008. It generates as much power as eight large nuclear power plants, displaced more than 1.2 million people, and ravaged the ecosystem of the Yangtze River. The Chinese government has acknowledged the problems of the project, but continues to export its technology overseas. Merowe: when Chinese dam builders went global In 2003, the Chinese government decided to fund the Merowe Dam in Sudan as its first big overseas hydropower project. The dam displaced more than 50,000 people and caused serious human rights violations. Chinese banks and companies are by now involved in some 330 dams in 74 countries, leading an unprecedented global dam building boom. Inga 3: Africa’s next white elephant? With the Inga 3 Project on the Congo river, the World Bank returned to building mega-dams in 2014. Even though the bank has failed to complete much smaller projects on the Congo, Inga 3 is only the first phase of the world’s biggest hydropower scheme. The project will have limited local impacts, will bypass poor consumers and benefit mining companies instead. Glines Canyon: the dam that came down Dams have serious environmental impacts, and their benefits dwindle as they age. Since the 1930s, the United States has removed more than 1,150 dams to restore river ecosystems and particularly fish habitats. In 2014, the 64 meters high Glines Canyon Dam on the Elwha River in the Pacific northwest was breached in the world’s biggest dam removal so far. Patagonia: the dams that were never built In recent years, solar and wind energy have seen their commercial breakthrough. These renewable energy sources are cleaner than coal or hydropower and can be built were people need electricity, even far away from the electric grid. In 2014, Chile cancelled five dams in the Patagonia region under strong public pressure and approved 700 megawatts of new solar and wind farms. What you can do Renewable energy rather than mega dams and fossil fuels is the right choice for the 21st century. Even so, numerous destructive dams continue to be proposed and built on the Mekong, in the Amazon, throughout Africa, in China, the Himalayas and other parts of the world.

Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) said it had released 560 tonnes of groundwater pumped from 12 wells located upstream from the damaged reactors. The water had been temporarily stored in a tank so it could undergo safety checks before being released, the firm added. The buildup of toxic water is the most urgent problem facing workers at the plant, almost two years after the environment ministry said 300 tonnes of contaminated groundwater from Fukushima Daiichi was seeping into the ocean every day. The groundwater, which flows in from hills behind the plant, mixes with contaminated water used to cool melted fuel before ending up in the sea. Officials concede that decommissioning the reactors will be impossible until the water issue has been resolved. The bypass system intercepts clean groundwater as it flows downhill toward the sea and reroutes it around the plant. It is expected to reduce the amount of water flowing into the reactor basements by up to 100 tonnes a day – a quarter – and relieve pressure on the storage tanks, which will soon reach their capacity. But the system does not include the coolant water that becomes dangerously contaminated after it is pumped into the basements of three reactors that suffered meltdown after the plant was struck by an earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. That water will continue to be stored in more than 1,000 tanks at the site, while officials debate how to safely dispose of it. The problem has been compounded by frequent technical glitches afflicting the plant's water purification system. Tepco and the government are also preparing to build an underground frozen wall around four reactors to block groundwater, although some experts doubt the technology will work on such a large scale. The utility is also building more tanks to increase storage capacity. Dale Klein, a senior adviser to Tepco, recently warned the firm that it may have no choice but to eventually dump contaminated water into the Pacific. The first groundwater release went ahead after Tepco assured local fishermen that levels of radioactive isotopes were far lower than those permitted in drinking water by the World Health Organisation. Tepco described the move as a \"major milestone\", adding: \"The water's quality is monitored regularly by independent third parties using safety and environmental standards more stringent than those set by Japanese law.\" The release comes after a Japanese newspaper revealed that almost all of the workers who were at Fukushima Daiichi when a reactor building exploded in March 2011 panicked and fled, defying orders to remain at the site. The small number of workers, along with firefighters, and soldiers – nicknamed the Fukushima 50 – who did stay behind, working in shifts around the clock to cool nuclear fuel, have been fêted for their heroics. But the Asahi Shimbun, citing leaked transcripts of testimony from the plant's then manager, Masao Yoshida, revealed this week that of the 720 workers present when a reactor building exploded on 15 March, 650 fled to another power plant about six miles (10km) away. Yoshida died of cancer last July. While the Fukushima cleanup continues, government plans to restart some nuclear reactors were in doubt on Wednesday when a court ordered the operator of a plant in western Japan not to put the facility back online, citing safety concerns. In a rare victory for anti-nuclear campaigners, the court in Fukui prefecture said Kansai Electric Power should not restart two reactors at Oi nuclear power plant. All of Japan's dozens of nuclear reactors are idle after being shut down for safety checks in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. \"Plaintiffs have rarely won. This is right in the middle of the restart process … it could have very well have repercussions,\" said Aileen Mioko Smith, executive director of Green Action. Kansai Electric said it would appeal against the decision."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2015/feb/18/jeb-bush-foreign-policy-speech-iraq","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-18T18:13:25Z","webTitle":"Jeb Bush attacks Obama's foreign policy and insists: 'I am my own man'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/18/jeb-bush-foreign-policy-speech-iraq","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2015/feb/18/jeb-bush-foreign-policy-speech-iraq","fields":{"headline":"Jeb Bush attacks Obama's foreign policy and insists: 'I am my own man'","bodyText":"Warning that “everywhere you look, you see the world slipping out of control,” Jeb Bush mounted a harsh attack on the foreign policy of President Obama Wednesday, in a speech that appeared to be a next step in a carefully choreographed rollout of a 2016 presidential bid. Addressing a crowd of about 800 at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Bush described a foreign policy vision that was sharply at odds with Obama’s, and more subtly divergent from that of his brother, President George W Bush. In a speech that was sharply skeptical of Iran, demonstratively supportive of Israel and disdainful of a White House foreign policy that he characterized as lackadaisical and foolish, Bush covered everything from the legacy in Iraq and Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s controversial visit to Washington to surveillance reform and relations with Cuba. Perhaps Bush’s most pointed remarks were in faulting the Obama administration for entering nuclear negotiations that would leave Iran with civilian nuclear power. “Iran’s intent is clear,” Bush said at the Chicago Council of Global Affairs, a non-partisan thinktank. “Its leaders have openly called for an attempt to annihilate the state of Israel. This is an existential threat to Israel” and America’s friends in the region. Bush called on Congress to pass sanctions in advance of the close of nuclear negotiations, to go into effect if the negotiations fail. The Obama administration and others have warned that such new legislation would derail the negotiations. “Iran’s ambitions are clear, and its capabilities are growing … yet the Obama administration has launched negotiations in which the goal has shifted,” Bush said. “The Obama administration no longer seeks to ‘prevent’ nuclear enrichment, but only to ‘manage’ it.” Bush emphasized his close ties with Israel, and jumped into the debate over a planned address to Congress by Netanyahu about Iran’s nuclear program. The White House has said it was not informed in advance of the planned speech, which was scheduled at the invitation of House Speaker John Boehner, and that Vice President Joe Biden would not attend. “I for one am very eager to hear what he has to say,” Bush said of Netanyahu. “I don’t blame him for wanting to share his views… I’m surprised that the US administration is upset about hearing from such a close and valuable ally.” Bush said the Obama “administration has lobbed personal leaks and insults” at Netanyahu “with incredible regularity”. Bush said government surveillance programs, including dragnet metadata collection by the National Security Agency, were important to preserve in the interests of national security. “For the life of me, I don’t understand – the debate has gotten off track,” Bush said of the NSA collections. “We do protect our civil liberties, but this is a hugely important program to keep us safe.” But Bush also grappled on Wednesday with perhaps the thorniest topic he will have to face in the 2016 presidential campaign: his brother George W Bush’s Iraq war. “I love my brother, I love my dad – I actually love my mother, too,” Jeb Bush said in Chicago. “I admire their service to the nation and the difficult decisions they had to make. But I am my own man – and my views are shaped by my own thinking and own experiences.” A list of foreign policy advisers announced in advance of the speech by the Bush team threatened to complicate the message, however. The list, first obtained by the Washington Post, includes several prominent advocates of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Among them are Paul Wolfowitz, deputy defense secretary under George W Bush; Stephen Hadley, national security adviser under Bush; and John Negroponte, ambassador to the UN under Bush. “In 2003, at the beginning of the liberation of Iraq, neither Twitter nor Isis existed,” he said. “New circumstances require new approaches.” Bush laid out principles he said would ensure American leadership, beginning with the importance of growing the US economy. He said Congress should give the president trade authority to complete new deals in the Pacific and in Europe. Bush said the “normalization” of US-Cuba relations announced by the White House last December was “the wrong thing to do” and resulted from poorly conducted negotiations with the Cuban government. He said falling oil prices would have brought Cuba to the negotiating table in a weaker position, comparing the effect to the weakening of Iran through sanctions. “A little more patience would have yielded a better result,” Bush said. “The notion that somehow you’re just going to have freedom outbreak in Cuba, I think it’s false,” he said. “I think it’s incorrect.” While Bush has not officially declared his candidacy for president, he has assembled teams of aides and donors and begun to lay out a policy platform. The foreign policy plank Bush laid out on Wednesday featured sharp criticism of Obama, whom Bush accused of “withdrawing from the world”. Bush’s brother left the White House as an historically unpopular president in part for the failure of his project to shape events in the Middle East. On the 10th anniversary of the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, 53% of Americans said the US “made a mistake sending troops to fight in Iraq” and 42% said it was not a mistake, according to a Gallup poll. For the distance he sought to create from his brother’s foreign policy, Bush fell back on speech that was sometimes reminiscent of the clipped cadence and cowboy imagery of George W Bush. Asked about “diplomacy on Isis,” Jeb Bush said: “No diplomacy. “With them directly? No. We have to develop a strategy that’s global, that takes them out. Restrain them, tightening the noose and then taking them out is the strategy. No talking about this. That just doesn’t work, for terrorism.” Veterans of the second Bush presidency who are now advising Jeb Bush have admitted mistakes in Iraq. “We also did not anticipate that al-Qaida would move into the security vacuum created by [Saddam] Hussein’s fall and seek to defeat the United States in Iraq,” Hadley wrote on the war’s 10-year anniversary. Hadley has also warned, however, about the dangers of inaction abroad. “Syria today shows what happens when a bloody dictator goes unchecked,” Hadley wrote in a 2014 op-ed. Other former George W Bush cabinet members or advisers who are working on the Jeb Bush presidential project, according to the Washington Post list, include former homeland security secretaries Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff, former CIA directors Porter Goss and Michael Hayden, and former attorney general Michael Mukasey. Jeb Bush’s list also includes James Baker and George Schultz, both secretaries of state who served under his father, President George HW Bush. Bush described a need for American interventionism, saying that if the United States did not pursue terrorists “in their own dark corner of the globe,” “they will eventually strike at America, and they often do.” “If we withdraw from the defense of liberty elsewhere, the battle will come to us anyway,” Bush said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/sep/21/what-is-the-best-ethical-watch-to-buy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-21T05:00:05Z","webTitle":"What is the best ethical watch to buy? | Lucy Siegle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/21/what-is-the-best-ethical-watch-to-buy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/sep/21/what-is-the-best-ethical-watch-to-buy","fields":{"headline":"What is the best ethical watch to buy?\r\n","bodyText":"It was once the case that a true hippie never wore a watch, but the times they are a-changing. The watch maisons (the horological equivalent of fashion houses) now fall over themselves to demonstrate commitment, not just to accurate time keeping, but to the health of the planet. Lots of the big heritage brands support good causes through sales of particular watch editions. IWC Schaffhausen sends proceeds from its Galapagos watches to the Charles Darwin Foundation. Tag Heuer has a long history of supporting the arts and charities – benificiaries have included Green Cross International and the Royal Albert Hall. When Leonardo DiCaprio appears in their ads, the brands want you to think of his documentary The 11th Hour rather than The Wolf of Wall Street.

Meanwhile, A Lange Sohne source their Grand Complication watch so meticulously that only one is made each year. Eco watches are so-called because they either use a novel energy-saving way to move the hands or are made from innovative materials. Harold Pinchbeck watches are handmade in England from British components and are an affordable luxury (prices start at around £300). Apart from the glass and movement components and battery, WeWOOD originated in Italy and is a wooden watch made from recycled wood (no two watches are the same).

This brand uses corn resin, organic cotton, cork and bamboo in lieu of toxic materials. But for an all rounder that doesn’t scream “eco”, you’ll be hard pressed to better Citizen.

But a spokesman for owners Sellafield Ltd said the 60-year-old ponds will not be cleaned up for decades, despite concern that they are in a dangerous state and could cause a large release of radioactive material if they are allowed to deteriorate further. “The concrete is in dreadful condition, degraded and fractured, and if the ponds drain, the Magnox fuel will ignite and that would lead to a massive release of radioactive material,” nuclear safety expert John Large told the Ecologist magazine. “I am very disturbed at the run-down condition of the structures and support services. In my opinion there is a significant risk that the system could fail. “It’s like an concrete dock full of water. If you got a breach of the wall by accident or by terrorist attack, the Magnox fuel would burn. I would say there’s many hundreds of tonnes in there. It could give rise to a very big radioactive release. It’s not for me to make comparisons with Chernobyl or Fukushima, but it could certainly cause serious contamination over a wide area and for a very long time.” Gordon Thompson, executive director of the Institute for Resource and Security Studies in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who is an expert at assessing radiological risk, said: “[Sellafield] contains large inventories of radioactive material that could be released to the environment in a variety of ways. The site’s overall radiological risk has never been properly assessed by the responsible authorities. [The] photos, showing disgracefully degraded open-air ponds at Sellafield, indicate that a thorough assessment of risk is overdue.” The images, taken over a period seven years and leaked via a local nuclear watchdog group to the Ecologist, are said to show two ponds that were commissioned in 1952 and used until the mid-1970s as short-term storage for spent fuel until it could be reprocessed, producing plutonium for military use. One is open to the elements. The government is paying private companies £1.7bn a year to decommission ageing buildings at Sellafield. “It is urgent that we clean up these ponds [but] it will be decades before they are cleaned up. Before that, a lot of other work has to be done. We are aiming to get them to the point where they are in a condition where the waste can be taken out of them,” said a Sellafield spokesman. In a statement, Sellafield Ltd said: “These dated pictures do not present an accurate reflection of work across the Sellafield site today, but they are an indication of the scale of the challenge inherited by the NDA, Sellafield Ltd and Nuclear Management Partners to clean up the UK’s nuclear legacy.” According to Large, who gave evidence to the House of Commons environment committee investigation into nuclear safety in 1986, the ponds were abandoned after they were overwhelmed with spent fuel during the 1974 miners’ strike when Britain was put on a three-day working week by prime minister Edward Heath. “In order the ‘keep the lights on’, the UK’s fleet of nuclear power stations were run at full tilt, producing high volumes of spent fuel that the Sellafield reprocessing facilities were unable to keep up with. During the three-day week they powered up the Magnox reactors to maximum, and so much fuel was coming into Sellafield that it overwhelmed the line, and stayed in the pool too long,” Large told the Ecologist. “The magnesium fuel rod coverings corroded due to the acidity in the ponds, and began to degrade and expose the nuclear fuel itself to the water, so they just lost control of the reprocessing line at a time when the ponds were crammed with intensely radioactive nuclear fuel,” he said The Office of Nuclear Regulation (ONR), the statutory nuclear safety regulator, said: “The legacy ponds at Sellafield are old and as a result, do not meet the high engineering standards that would be required for modern nuclear facilities. These legacy ponds bring significant challenges, but we must focus our attention on improving the current situation. This does not mean that operations and activities on those facilities are unsafe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/dec/08/solar-wind-energy-sources-huge-majority-australians-poll-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-08T13:00:01Z","webTitle":"Solar and wind energy backed by huge majority of Australians, poll shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/08/solar-wind-energy-sources-huge-majority-australians-poll-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/dec/08/solar-wind-energy-sources-huge-majority-australians-poll-shows","fields":{"headline":"Solar and wind energy backed by huge majority of Australians, poll shows","bodyText":"Solar and wind energy enjoy strong support from the Australian public, with 80% of people putting them both among their top three energy choices in a poll for the Australia Institute. By contrast, coal and coal seam gas were chosen by 35% and 38% of those polled as being among the best three future energy sources. A separate review of medical literature by the Australia Institute debunked the fear that wind power damaged people’s health, finding “no credible evidence” directly linking exposure to turbines with negative health effects. The poll of more than 1,400 people showed that solar was the popular energy choice of the future, cited by 63% of respondents. Nine out of 10 people said they wanted more solar energy. Six in 10 people said they were concerned about the impact of coal and coal seam gas on the landscape. Despite this apparent desire for renewables – as well as the country’s vast capacity for such energy – the Australia Institute report states that Australia now produces “only the world average level” of solar energy. While the production of solar PV panels is relatively energy intensive, the report concedes, solar’s output of greenhouse gases, and its impact on air quality, is completely overshadowed by the burning of coal. Wind has the potential to supply 40% of Australia’s energy needs, the report says, but the industry has been blighted by the “considerable attention” placed on the perceived health effects of wind turbines. The Australia Institute points out that the National Health and Medical Research Council recently conducted a review of the scientific literature on the connection between windfarms and health and found there was “no consistent association between adverse health effects and estimated noise from wind turbines”. The Australia Institute report states: “Perceived high levels of opposition have been linked to a vocal minority, with many surveys suggesting reasonably high levels of support, especially in community-owned wind operations. “Wind turbines do cause bird and bat deaths, however rates are well below deaths from many other causes including climate change, and technological advances are likely to mediate these further.” A Senate inquiry, established by crossbench and Liberal senators, is set to take yet another look at the health impact of windfarms. The construction of wind turbines has virtually ground to a halt nationally due to uncertainty over the renewable energy target. In Victoria they are banned from being put up within 2km of a dwelling without written consent. “There has been fairly consistent support for renewables, which will only increase as people realise what’s about to happen with climate change,” Dr Jeremy Moss, co-author of the reports, told Guardian Australia. “Australia is at a crossroads. Coal is on the way out and we’re choosing between gas, wind and solar. The health implications are fundamental, both direct and indirect,” he said. “Gas contributes to global warming and so that’s the big reason not to do it, given that the World Health Organisation says climate change is killing around 150,000 people a year. That’s a clear indirect impact.” Moss said he rejected the idea that gas and nuclear power, which are both lower in emissions than coal, should be used as a “bridging fuel” until renewables were online. “You don’t build a gas plant for one or two years, you build them for 10 or 20 years so you get a return on them,” he said. “Also, most of our gas is being exported and it’s only better than coal if it’s replacing coal here.” Moss said Tony Abbott was “very out of touch” with public opinion on energy. The prime minister has said coal is “good for humanity” and that he would like to see coal production go “up and up and up”. Moss said: “Australia, despite Tony Abbott’s claims, can’t hold out much longer in doing something meaningful on climate change. We are completely out of step with the rest of the world. “The government needs to acknowledge there is a climate change problem and commit to very deep emissions cuts. From those deep cuts we need to put a heavy focus on how we produce our energy and also look at the kinds of things we export.” International climate change talks are being held in Lima, with the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, and the trade minister, Andrew Robb, representing Australia. The talks are seen as a crucial precursor to a UN summit held in Paris next year, where countries will look to strike a new deal to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. On Monday the government was accused of trying to set up those talks for failure by insisting any agreement clinched in Paris must include legally binding emissions targets. A separate report released by the Climate Council on Tuesday raised the bushfire season outlook from “above normal” to “major” in Victoria, owing to dry conditions.

The gap between nuclear rhetoric and nuclear reality has been a fundamental impediment to wise energy policy decisions for half a century now. For various reasons, in many nations the nuclear industry cannot tell the truth about its progress, its promise or its perils. Its backers in government and in academia do no better. Rhetorical excess from opponents of nuclear power contributes to the fog, but proponents have by far the heavier artillery. In the US, during the rise and fall of the bubble formerly known as \"the nuclear renaissance\", many of the proponents' tools have been on full display. Academic and governmental studies a decade ago understated the likely cost of new reactors and overstated their potential contribution to fighting climate change. By 2006, a few US state legislatures had been enticed to expose utility customers to all the risks of building new reactors. Industry-sponsored conferences persuaded businesses and newspapers of an imminent jobs bonanza, ignoring job losses resulting from high electric rates and passing up cheaper, more labour-intensive alternatives. These local groups added to the pressure on Congress for more subsidies. France and Japan were held out as examples of countries that had avoided the timidity and overregulation that had stalled nuclear construction in the US. Indeed, it was argued, these nations had even solved the waste problem through their commitment to reprocessing spent fuel. At times inconsistent tales were told simultaneously. Thus the US Congress was told that the new licensing process and the new generic designs were so untried and environmental opposition so formidable that loan guarantees were needed to lay the risks off on taxpayers. At the same time, Wall Street and state legislatures were assured that these new features had chloroformed public opposition and otherwise laid to rest the terrifying industry ghosts embodied by the nine-figure dollar losses at Shoreham, Seabrook, WPPSS (Washington Public Power Supply System), and Midland, sites that resonate in US nuclear folklore like civil war battlefield names. The renaissance story line was hard to resist. By early 2009, applications for 31 new reactors were pending at the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The promises came garnished with tales of remorseful changes of heart from oft-obscure nuclear converts. With few exceptions, the news media – especially television, with its thirst for the short and the simple – fell for the rhetoric. It is all in ruins now. The 31 proposed reactors are down to four actually being built and a few others lingering on in search of a licence, which is good for 20 years. Those four are hopelessly uneconomic but proceed because their state legislatures have committed to finish them as long as a dollar remains to be taken from any electric customer's pocket. Operating reactors are being closed as uneconomic for the first time in 15 years. Still the band plays on. President Obama recently touted new reactors as part of his \"all of the above\" policy on energy. But is \"all of the above\" really a policy? Do we build palaces to avert housing shortages? Don't we instead prioritise, based on the best information available? US secretaries of energy enthuse that the four new reactors will be completed \"on time and on budget\", never mind that they are already behind and over and that \"on budget\" will mean \"well above the cost of creating equivalent low carbon energy more sensibly\". As always in the face of failure, the industry puts forth new designs as a basis for new promises, now touting small modular reactors with the same fervour with which it touted large, partially modular reactors a decade ago. Congress finds a few hundred million to preserve these dreams even as its cutbacks shatter so many others. A new movie, Pandora's Promise (no film-maker familiar with nuclear history would include \"promise\" in a title intended to be pronuclear), recently screened at Sundance.Featuring the same old converts and straw men, it opened in cinemas a few weeks ago to tiny audiences and generally unenthusiastic reviews, especially from reviewers knowledgeable about nuclear power. In the astonishing persistence of the global appetite for false nuclear promises lies the critical importance of the World Nuclear Industry Status Report, published on Thursday. It sets forth in painstaking detail the actual experience and achievements of nuclear energy around the world. It is based for the most part on generally accepted data distinctively graphed for clearer understanding. Where the authors introduce judgment, they explain what they have done and why. The report has a track record stretching back years. It is much better than the embarrassing exuberances of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the World Nuclear Association or the pronouncements of most national governments. Most of the myths on which the purported nuclear renaissance rested founder on the rocks of the information presented here. Is new nuclear power cheaper than alternative ways of meeting energy needs? Of course not. What about low-carbon \"baseload\" alternatives? See page 71 of the report. Can a country grow its economy by building nuclear reactors? What don't you understand about the employment consequences of imposing rate shock on industrial and commercial customers? Are the consequences of the Fukushima meltdowns really being overstated by antinuclear activists? Maybe, but see the chapter on the status of Fukushima. In short, the nuclear renaissance – whatever it may be called throughout the world - has always consisted entirely of the number of reactors whose excess costs governments were prepared to make mandatory for either customers or taxpayers. Investor capital cannot be conscripted. Investors of the sort that nuclear power must attract study risks carefully. They know the information in this report, and so should everyone else with responsibility for energy decisions that allocate nuclear risk.

The study, based on an analysis of global deposit depletion profiles from past and present uranium mining, forecasts a global uranium mining peak of approximately 58 kilotonnes (kton) by 2015, declining gradually to 54 ktons by 2025, after which production would drop more steeply to at most 41 ktons around 2030. The peer-reviewed study, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, concludes: \"This amount will not be sufficient to fuel the existing and planned nuclear power plants during the next 10–20 years. In fact, we find that it will be difficult to avoid supply shortages even under a slow 1%/ year worldwide nuclear energy phase-out scenario up to 2025. We thus suggest that a worldwide nuclear energy phase-out is in order.\" But just last week, in response to dire warnings of power blackouts within two years - the same time uranium production will peak according to this study - the UK government announced £10 billion in financial guarantees to the nuclear power industry. Now Energy Secretary Ed Davey promises, \"Prices aren't going to spike: the lights are going to stay on because we've got a very well thought-through plan.\" The decision reinforces the government's focus on nuclear power as central to its national energy strategy. According to the government's high-nuclear scenario, nuclear power could provide 86% of the UK's electricity at 75GW of capacity by 2050. The new study acknowledges the dawn of a new production period in the last five years, during which a total of 250 ktons or uranium has been produced, but points out that increasingly producers must extract lower grade uranium which generates less energy than higher grades. On average, it finds, only 50-70% of initial uranium resource estimates can be extracted. Developing a model based on precise data about extraction rates and deposits for individual mines in Canada and Australia, the study concludes that planned new mines can only \"partially compensate\" a production decline from all mines currently in operation: \"After 2015 uranium mining will decline by about 0.5 ktons/year up to 2025 and much faster thereafter... Assuming that the demand side will be increased by 1% annually, we predict both shortages of uranium and (inflation-adjusted) price hikes within the next five years.\" The study suggests that one way to delay the uranium supply crunch until 2025 would be a carefully coordinated \"voluntary nuclear energy phase-out.\" Another alternative would be to open up access to \"the still sizable quantities of the military uranium reserves from the USA and Russia especially after 2013.\" If countries do not voluntarily adopt a \"slow phase-out scenario\": \"... we predict that the end of the cheap uranium supply will result in a chaotic phase-out scenario with price explosions, supply shortages and possible electricity shortages in many countries.\" Study author Dr. Michael Dittmar, a nuclear physicist at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, described the nuclear component of the UK's energy strategy to keep the national electric grid going even during the next 10 years as \"effectively non-existent.\" The US, China, and India all plan to dramatically ramp up nuclear power production in coming decades, but like the UK, their energy strategies completely overlook potential uranium supply challenges. Dittmar pointed out that an agreement with Russia supplying the US with 50% of its uranium supply from Russian military reserves ends later this year. The US will either have to \"reduce its aging nuclear power plants or to open American military reserves\" which will only last \"a few years.\" China faces similar challenges: \"The euphoric growth of new nuclear power plant construction in China came to somewhat of a standstill since 2011. Compared to the years 2008 to 2010 when construction began for 6, 9 and 10 reactors, during the last years 2011, 2012 and 2013 so far only four new constructions were started in 2012. Nuclear plant construction in China was already running out of steam well before the Fukushima disaster.\" Dittmar said that such developments are consistent with specific warnings of decline he made years ago. On the UK nuclear energy strategy, he added: \"I would suggest to ask the question how much uranium is required during the next 10 years , and where the uranium for the UK should come from during the next 10-20 years. The absence of an answer will already be telling enough.\" Putting this question to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), a spokesperson said that he could not supply an answer because the information was \"commercially sensitive\", and that the way the question was worded made it \"technically impossible to answer.\" He then said: \"Operation of nuclear power stations is the responsibility of the industry operators who will have their own strategies and processes for sourcing fuel. The majority of the UK fleet is owned and operated by EDF.\" Dr Nafeez Ahmed is executive director of the Institute for Policy Research &amp; Development and author of A User's Guide to the Crisis of Civilisation: And How to Save It among other books.

The cuts set out by the energy secretary, Ed Davey, mean onshore windfarms will for the first time receive lower subsidies than future nuclear power stations. However, wind industry sources said the cuts meant small, community-owned windfarms were likely to be cancelled, harming the government's own intention to overcome opposition to turbines in some places by giving local people a stake in the developments. A small increase in the future subsidy for offshore windfarms was welcomed as significant by developers, though some criticised the government for lacking ambition for the technology in which the UK is a world leader. \"The spin in Westminster today is disappointing but not surprising,\" said Nina Skorupska, chief executive of the Renewable Energy Association. \"But today is actually a good news day for renewable electricity and renewable heat. The real reason that support for solar and onshore wind will go down is that they are leading the race for cost-competitiveness with fossil fuels. Government policy is working and bringing down costs.\" However, a spokesman for another trade body, RenewableUK, said: \"The cuts mean sadly that a lot of the more marginal windfarms, which means the smaller and community-based ones, will fall away. Those are the very ones the government wanted to fly, so local communities could take ownership of their energy and to make onshore wind more politically acceptable.\" He noted that onshore wind had already been cut by 10% in April and said the government had not presented any evidence that there had been further cost reductions since then. A number of sources suggested the cut to onshore wind was the result of political pressure from scores of Conservative MPs and that this exacerbated uncertainty for investors. Davey said: \"This package will deliver record levels of investment in green energy by 2020. Our reforms are succeeding in attracting investors from around the world so Britain can replace our ageing power stations and keep the lights on.\" He said the announcements on Wednesday, which also covered more support for renewable heat and biomass, were also aimed at meeting the government's objectives on renewable energy, cutting carbon emissions and minimising the cost to consumers. The subsidy changes cover the four-year period starting after the 2015 general election. Onshore wind is being cut by 5% a year, and solar by 4% for three years then 9%, while offshore wind remains unchanged apart from a 5% increase in 2018-19. The small increase for offshore wind, and new details of contracts \"do not look like a lot but the big developers who are our members are very pleased: it will mean that projects due to be built at that time can go ahead,\" said the RenewableUK spokesman. Brent Cheshire, chairman of the offshore wind developer Dong Energy UK, said: \"This gives us the confidence to move forward with our future pipeline of projects.\" Davey said 10GW of offshore wind capacity – enough to power about 6m homes – was achievable by 2020. But this represents a sharp drop in ambition according to RenewableUK, who said the aim had been 40GW in 2010. Ministers also announced a preliminary deal towards government loan guarantees for a new nuclear power station that Horizon, a subsidiary of Hitachi, may build on Anglesey in the 2020s. Keith Parker, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: \"This is excellent news. Nuclear power is a clean, reliable and affordable source of electricity. Major infrastructure of this kind requires large upfront capital investment and government guarantees in financing these projects will help keep overall costs down to the benefit of the consumer.\" But Greenpeace's Doug Parr said: \"Government largesse with nuclear has now reached bizarre proportions. It is guaranteeing the Anglesey plant despite the project having no planning permission, no financing and no approved reactor design. Meanwhile the sources of renewable power and energy efficiency that will provide cheaper power are being chopped and changed.\" Simon Bullock of Friends of the Earth said cuts to onshore wind and solar power subsidies reflected their success. \"But ministers must now scrutinise the handouts given to support oil, gas and coal,\" he said. \"George Osborne has given £2bn to support dirty energy in the past year alone.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/aug/24/israeli-stealth-drone-nuclear-facility-iran-natanz","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-24T20:18:59Z","webTitle":"Israeli stealth drone downed at nuclear facility, Iran claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/24/israeli-stealth-drone-nuclear-facility-iran-natanz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/aug/24/israeli-stealth-drone-nuclear-facility-iran-natanz","fields":{"headline":"Israeli stealth drone downed at nuclear facility, Iran claims","bodyText":"Iran's Revolutionary Guards claimed on Sunday that an Israeli stealth drone had been brought down above the Natanz uranium enrichment site in the centre of the country. The semi-official Fars news agency reported that Iran's elite forces had intercepted and brought down an unmanned aircraft belonging to \"the Zionist regime\". The news was announced in a statement published by the guards, but it was not clear when the incident, if true, happened. \"This mischievous act once again reveals the adventurist nature of the Zionist regime [of Israel] and added another black page to this fake and warmongering regime's file which is full of crimes,\" said the Revolutionary Guards' statement. The state news agency ISNA reported that the aircraft was \"of the stealth, radar-evasive type and it intended to penetrate the off-limits nuclear area in Natanz … but was targeted by a ground-to-air missile before it managed to enter the area.\" A spokesman for the Revolutionary Guards later told Iranian television that parts of the aircraft had been retrieved. Iran claimed to have reverse engineered a drone after capturing an American RQ-170 Sentinel in 2011. \"Major parts of the devices of the drone are intact and have been received by our friends that can be used for further information,\" said General Ramazan Sharif. He did not say when the aircraft was shot down, but said it was \"identified upon arrival in Iranian airspace\". He said authorities allowed it to fly for a short time to determine its destination. Israeli political and military officials said they never respond to such claims. They have repeatedly threatened to take military action against Iran's nuclear installations, but have been reluctant to do so without US backing or participation. Natanz is Iran's main uranium enrichment site, housing more than 16,000 centrifuges. About 3,000 more are at the Fordo plant, buried inside a mountain and hard to destroy. Israel says Iran is developing nuclear weapons at the sites which it intends to use in attacks on the Jewish state. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has repeatedly said the Iranian nuclear programme is an existential threat to his country. Iran insists it is enriching uranium is for civilian purposes. Iran and the P5+1 powers – Britain, China, France, Russia, the United States and Germany – reached a six-month interim agreement under which Iran suspended part of its nuclear activities in return for a partial lifting of international sanctions. In July, that deal was extended by four months until November to give the two sides more time to negotiate a final accord aimed at ending 10 years of tensions over Iran's nuclear programme. The sides remain split on how much uranium enrichment Iran should be allowed to carry out. Washington wants Tehran to slash its programme by three-quarters, but Iran wants to expand enrichment tenfold by 2021, chiefly to produce fuel for its Bushehr nuclear power plant. Israel opposes any agreement allowing Tehran to keep part of its uranium enrichment programme."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2014/oct/20/while-didcot-b-burned-renewable-energy-powered-on","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-20T13:35:57Z","webTitle":"While Didcot B burned, renewable energy powered on | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2014/oct/20/while-didcot-b-burned-renewable-energy-powered-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2014/oct/20/while-didcot-b-burned-renewable-energy-powered-on","fields":{"headline":"While Didcot B burned, renewable energy powered on","bodyText":"Renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, is frequently criticised for being “unreliable”. But the major fire at RWE’s Didcot gas-fired power station on Sunday evening shows that traditional energy generation is also intermittent. Moreover, accidents at coal, gas and nuclear plants frequently involve much larger amounts of electricity dropping off the grid and at much shorter notice. The Didcot station was running at full capacity on Sunday evening, RWE told me. So the cooling tower fire, which forced unit 5 to close, led to the instantaneous loss of 700MW of electricity just after 8pm. That is about half-a-million-homes-worth of power that the National Grid had to find with zero seconds’ notice. It pulled off this balancing act using a safety net, called the regulating reserve, that it is one of a number of back-ups always on standby to ensure the UK’s electricity supply remains stable. The regulating reserve is a mix of electricity, such as pumped storage and gas power, kept in reserve to compensate for any sudden drop outs. Big power stations shutting at short notice is more common than you might think. The Didcot fire is at least the third at a UK fossil fuel-fired power station in 2014, according to Reuters. In February, fire permanently closed E.ON’s 370MW unit at Ironbridge, while in July, two units at SSE’s 1,000MW Ferrybridge coal plant in West Yorkshire were shut after a fire. Neither is nuclear immune from shutdowns, with EDF Energy taking four of its nuclear reactors offline in August after a crack was found in a boiler. Combined with Didcot B, these unplanned outages alone have removed 7% percent of total electricity generation capacity. The first lesson to draw from the Didcot fire relates to energy security. Due to their size, problems at centralised power plants pose a greater risk to keeping the lights on than the loss of, say, one turbine in a wind farm, or a few solar panels in an array. Power station drop-outs can occur suddenly and for unexpected reasons, like a plague of jellyfish or seaweed, both of which have knocked out nuclear power stations recently. In contrast, wind can be accurately forecast a day or two ahead and the sun rises and sets like clockwork. The risk posed by big plants falling off the grid will rise further if EDF build their 3.2GW nuclear plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset. Such is its size - a “behemoth” according to Owen Paterson - that National Grid is having to ramp up its back-up measures to cope. In a stunning example of perverse logic, the £160m-a-year cost of this bigger safety net is being spread across all energy suppliers, including renewables, because “increasing costs on larger users could delay the commissioning of large nuclear plants”. The second lesson to draw from the Didcot fire is that the intermittency of some renewables is simply not a problem. On Sunday, the same day the Didcot station crashed offline, wind power provided its greatest ever share of UK electricity: 24%. And the lights stayed on. In April, a Royal Academy of Engineering report concluded wind capacity could more than double from today’s 11GW by 2020 without any changes to how the energy system is balanced. The grid can cope. It is ironic that Sunday was also the day that the Conservative party’s war on renewable energy opened a new front, with environment secretary Liz Truss changing farm subsidy rules to undermine solar farms. This is despite solar energy being a “promising technology” whose price is “falling rapidly” – and that’s Tory climate sceptic Tim Montgomerie talking. Renewable energy come out as most popular in every opinion poll, with solar often getting more than 90% approval. It boosts energy security by being both decentralised and not relying on imported fossil fuels. Onshore wind is the cheapest clean energy available, but communities secretary Eric Pickles continues his crusade against it. As the flames of Didcot burned, Truss and Pickles fiddled in order to foil renewable energy and appease the minority of the public who oppose it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/20/solar-power-in-crisis-panels-generate-power-government-subsidy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-20T17:45:12Z","webTitle":"Solar power in crisis: 'My panels generate enough power for two loads of washing'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/20/solar-power-in-crisis-panels-generate-power-government-subsidy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/20/solar-power-in-crisis-panels-generate-power-government-subsidy","fields":{"headline":"Solar power in crisis: 'My panels generate enough power for two loads of washing'","bodyText":"Sit back, relax, and read this story with an untroubled conscience: it has been created on a laptop and mobile phone powered entirely by the rays of the sun. This feat would surely astound the most idealistic Greek philosopher or Victorian entrepreneur. It would confirm their wildest hopes for humanity’s progress. Perhaps they would be even more amazed that it was possible via a coalition of Chinese companies, British roofers and local councils. Oh, and government support, which is set to be abruptly withdrawn. The power comes from 16 black Ja solar panels that were fitted to the roof of my home in August. Together, these panels, each the size of a coffee tabletop, have a capacity of 4kW, enough to meet the energy needs of an average family home. Today, a gloomy autumnal moment, they have generated 4.403kWh. It hardly sounds impressive – it’s enough power for a couple of loads of washing – but collectively it represents a revolution. Solar hasn’t changed my life, but it has shifted my perceptions. A little monitor on my desk tells me how much electricity I am generating. I’m acutely aware of the scarcity of energy, the rarity of unbroken sunshine and changing path of the sun. In August, rays hit my panels at 8.30am and an image of a green finger materialised on my monitor, urging me to switch on appliances. Now it doesn’t appear until 10.30am and so we delay putting on the washing machine. We have toddlers around the house all day, so solar suits us: we time the dishwasher for daylight hours and the TV tends to be on more during the day than at night. If I’m working from home, I charge laptops and phones around midday, too. Solar’s drawback is that most power is generated in daylight hours, when people tend to be at work, and there’s currently no affordable battery technology to store the energy you generate. But that energy is not wasted: it goes into the national grid, and solar owners are paid for what they produce. A million British homes now have rooftop solar panels. The thicker panels are solar thermal and heat water. Most, some 750,000 solar PV installations, convert the sun into electricity. Solar produces 1.5% of total UK electricity, up from virtually nothing in 2010. It has proved so popular that the government wants to cut the feed-in tariff, the solar subsidy, by 87%. Since 2010, domestic and commercial solar systems have been paid by the government for every kWh they generate. I receive quarterly payments for the electricity I generate at 12.96p per kWh with another smaller payment for what the authorities estimate I return to the grid. These payments are guaranteed for 20 years. Such has been the popularity of solar that the government says it is spending too much money supporting it: from January, it is proposing to dramatically slash this subsidy for new solar installations. The Solar Trade Association has warned this could cost up to 27,000 jobs; 1,000 are already disappearing with the recent closure of four big renewable companies. Will this solar miracle be shattered? Will rooftop panels soon resemble the relics of a bygone energy age, like the enormous cooling towers of coal-fired power stations? Like many people, I was persuaded to put up solar PV not by promises of a fat cheque from the government but by meeting someone who’d had panels fitted and sung their praises. In 2014, I was researching a story about REPOWERBalcombe, a community energy group created by members of the Sussex village best known for its anti-fracking protests. Tom Parker, a gardener, had panels fitted on his roof five years earlier and then volunteered to help 15 renewable projects in the neighbourhood, including his children’s school. He had watched solar systems over 20 years’ worth of running time – and none had lost a single hour of power generation. “It’s fantastically reliable, much more reliable than the National Grid,” he enthused. “It’s just churning out energy, year after year.” Last year, I moved to a south-facing house and this summer found a good deal for solar PV: my standard 16 panels cost £4,630 to supply and install, which was done in a day in August by an electrician and two roofers who were recent converts to solar employment. Business was brisk: they were supposed to fit two roofs each day. Business is even brisker now. Britain’s solar providers are swamped with work as people rush to get panels installed before the government introduces its planned subsidy cut. After that, with solar still a few years off “grid parity” – where a unit of solar power is as cheap as electricity produced via gas, coal or other fossil fuels – the industry will rapidly burn out. According to the Solar Trade Association, the proposed cuts will leave Britain with an annual solar spend of less than what Buckinghamshire county council is devoting to potholes this year. I claim I would have fitted the panels without a subsidy because I want to reduce my dependence on fossil fuels; for others, solar PV is a pragmatic investment: at current prices, government subsidies and reduced electricity bills return your £5,000 in about eight years; then the subsidy – and lower bills – keep coming for the 20-year lifespan of the panels. Most experts say the panels will last longer. I have not yet noticed a rapid drop in my electricity bill, but reductions in southern England are estimated at £135 a year. If I was truly principled, perhaps I wouldn’t pocket the subsidy, but a solar meter was installed next to my electricity meter and I registered for the feed-in tariff through my energy provider. When the feed-in tariff began, in 2010, domestic early adopters were paid a whopping 43p per kWh. But they also forked out almost three times as much for their panels. My magic monitor informs me of the sun’s riches each day. My worst day so far – torrential rain – provided just 7p; the last £2 day was a month ago; will I see its like again before spring? Nevertheless, my solar is on track to generate the fitters’ predicted 3,485kWh each year, which is more than my household’s annual electricity consumption. If so, the feed-in tariff will pay me £534.77 tax-free, each year. The solar subsidy currently costs every energy billpayer £9 each year. This is the nub of the case against solar: why should poor billpayers pay for relatively affluent people like me to indulge our “green crap”? The government’s motives for cutting the subsidy were explained more pragmatically by the contractor who measured up for my panels, an old-school property surveyor who had moved into PV. The government looks like it is struggling to meet its legally binding target of renewables providing 15% of UK energy (including heating) by 2020 but such is the dramatic expansion of solar that it doesn’t want to pay millions in subsidies that cause it to exceed this target. So it is sensible to gradually reduce solar subsidy as panel costs fall: people will continue to fit solar and the industry will prosper and eventually be weaned off government support: the Solar Trade Association is begging the government to adopt an “emergency” plan to do just this. It claims it will add just £1 to annual energy bills. When I call Leo Murray, he’s standing by a fake sun – a 10ft helium balloon filled with LED lights in Ravenscourt Park, London. The campaigns director for 10:10, a charity encouraging positive action on climate change, Murray’s lightbulb-like brightness is dimmed by the government’s desire to slash solar support. Who wouldn’t want to exceed our renewables targets, he wonders, when surveys show that solar is the most popular form of energy, with 80% support: “We explain to the public how we all contribute towards solar – it adds a couple of quid on our bills each year – and we can’t find anyone who is anti-renewable energy.” Murray believes the government is tackling the success of solar the wrong way round. It allocated a finite sum of money and now that is almost spent, after the quicker-than-forecast uptake of solar panels, it is pulling the plug. “It’s ideologically driven. It’s coming from the Treasury. You see the looks on DECC [Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change] officials’ faces – they don’t want to be doing this. It’s the most successful and popular climate-change policy ever implemented by the UK government – a demand-led energy policy engaging consumers in the transition to a low-energy economy.” But why should hard-pressed billpayers subsidise expensive solar? “What really gives the lie to that argument is Hinkley [the proposed new nuclear power station]. Even staunch supporters of nuclear don’t think that is a good deal. At £24.5bn, it could be the most expensive object on earth. If you want to keep bills down, don’t do that – it’s definitely going to push bills up.” For Murray, there’s a simple way to ensure wealthy solar investors aren’t subsidised by less affluent billpayers: a solar levy could be progressively applied to bigger electricity bills. (There is a strong correlation between higher bills and higher household wealth, and there could be specific support for exceptions, such as low-income residents of energy-inefficient private rentals.) Murray and 10:10 will continue to support volunteers in community energy. While media coverage has focused on commercial job losses, the solar cuts will also decimate community energy. Since I met Tom Parker in 2014, REPOWERBalcombe has gone from strength to strength. Funded by local people, Parker and his fellow volunteers have opened an 18kW array on a local farm and two smaller rooftop solar systems for schools. The Conservative-dominated local council this month approved their plans for a 4.8MW array which will meet all the power needs for Balcombe and neighbouring West Hoathly. But Parker is despairing at the government’s punitive approach to solar. “We demonstrated that the community hated the idea of fracking and loved the idea of solar and they are trying to prevent other communities from taking the same approach. It’s almost like we’ve been too successful.” It’s not simply the subsidy cut: Parker lists eight major regulatory changes that have made it more difficult for community energy groups. These include making it harder for investors to obtain tax relief, changing the rules over the creation of energy co-ops and making renewable projects such as theirs pay a “climate change levy” – even though they are part of the solution, not the problem. “If someone had set out a year ago to say, ‘How can we most damage co-ops?’, I don’t think they could’ve done any more,” says Parker. As Murray puts it: “These people are volunteers, doing their best to get things off the ground and the ground keeps moving underneath them.” REPOWERBalcombe won’t be able to grow any more, but it’s lucky to have established as many projects as it has, says Parker. Elsewhere, “it’s looking pretty dire for community energy,” admits Murray. “It won’t kill the sector dead but we won’t see any new projects coming forward.” The volunteers running community energy groups normally aspire to expand to a point where they can employ one person to run their project over its 20-year lifespan. The cuts create the prospect of volunteers being forced to manage their groups (committed to paying a return to local people who have invested in them) for 20 years themselves, unable to expand to hand over to a modestly paid professional. “That’s vindictive,” says Murray. “Presumably, it’s not meant to be.” A botched cut in solar support may damage UK PLC, with investors fleeing such an unstable regulatory environment, as the CBI has argued, but it won’t trouble global trends. Solar currently produces 200 gigawatts around the world. Forecasts suggest this will be 1,000 in 10 years’ time but predictions, admits Ajay Gambhir, senior research fellow at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, have been far too pessimistic. Early 21st-century forecasts of a “US$1 per watt” price for solar panels by 2030 were reached in 2011/12. “That is a rapid cost reduction,” says Gambhir. Solar is a modular technology, so manufacturers quickly learn how to refine it when repeatedly making the same component. Chinese manufacturers will reduce costs to 35/40 cents per watt by the decade’s end, predicts Gambhir, confidently. And solar will probably be adopted in developing nations as quickly as the mobile phone in Africa: its modular character is ideal for remote countries with a limited electricity grid. More exciting than ever-cheaper panels is affordable battery technology, which will solve my problem of generating lots of power at midday when I don’t really need it. Elon Musk of Tesla unveiled its Powerwall domestic battery to great fanfare this spring. In Britain, Powervault is selling dishwasher-sized rechargeable battery units for domestic solar for £2,800. “There’s been a lot of interest from early adopters who’d like to use more of the solar energy they generate,” says Joe Warren, managing director of Powervault. He predicts that prices could fall to £1,000 by 2020 with 50,000 UK households buying batteries. It is not just makers who are talking up batteries. As Gambhir explains, increasing the amount of electricity storage has huge value to the National Grid because it helps balance variable supply and erratic demand (we all switch on the kettles during the World Cup final half-time). It also reduces the requirement to have big gas or coal power plants standing by to backup renewables. (Incredibly, the British government recently approved the creation of backup power stations run by diesel generators.) Batteries will also help the grid adjust to the big new challenge posed by the need to charge electric vehicles. Given these services, shouldn’t solar batteries be subsidised? “I don’t know if it’s being considered politically but from an economics of innovation perspective it makes inherent sense,” says Gambhir. Grid parity – when solar is as cheap as gas or coal – is coming. Parity between solar and the retail price for grid electricity has already been reached in Mexico and even Germany. It will arrive in Britain in about four years, but most analysts believe that British solar won’t reach genuine parity with gas or coal (being as cheap to set up a big power station) for a decade. This will be too late to save Britain’s solar industry, if the cuts come. “Solar will get there and private money will eventually fill the gap, but it may not get there nearly as fast [without government support] and there will be more bankruptcies on the way,” says Gambhir. Murray is close to despair. To abandon solar at this moment “doesn’t make business sense and it’s terrible for the environment. The whole thing is a mess. The rest of the world is looking at us and thinking: ‘What are they doing?’” • This article was amended on 21 October 1015. An earlier version said the solar industry produced 1.5% of UK energy needs. That has been corrected to 1.5% of total UK electricity. It was further amended on 23 October 2015 to correct “3,485kW” to “3,485kWh”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2012/sep/09/climate-change-expert-calls-for-nuclear-power-boost","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-09-09T19:30:11Z","webTitle":"Climate change expert calls for nuclear power 'binge' to avert global warming","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/09/climate-change-expert-calls-for-nuclear-power-boost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/sep/09/climate-change-expert-calls-for-nuclear-power-boost","fields":{"headline":"Climate change expert calls for nuclear power 'binge' to avert global warming","bodyText":"A leading British academic has called for accelerated research into futuristic geo-engineering and a worldwide nuclear power station \"binge\" to avoid runaway global warming. Peter Wadhams, professor of ocean physics at Cambridge University, said both potential solutions had inherent dangers but were now vital as time was running out. \"It is very, very depressing that politicians and the public are attuned to the threat of climate change even less than they were 20 years ago when Margaret Thatcher sounded the alarm. CO2 levels are rising at a faster than exponential rate, and yet politicians only want to take utterly trivial steps such as banning plastic bags and building a few windfarms,\" he said. \"I am very suspicious of using technology to solve problems created by technology, given that we have messed up so much in the past but having done almost nothing for two decades we need to adopt more desperate measures such as considering geo-engineering techniques as well as conducting a major nuclear programme.\" Geo-engineering techniques such as whitening clouds by adding fine sprays of water vapour, or adding aerosols to the upper atmosphere have been ridiculed in some quarters but welcomed elsewhere. Wadhams proposes the use of thorium-fuelled reactors, being tested in India, which are said to be safer because they do not result in a proliferation of weapons-grade plutonium, experts say. Also, under certain circumstances, the waste from thorium reactors is less dangerous and remains radioactive for hundreds rather than thousands of years. Wadhams, who is also head of the polar ocean physics group at Cambridge and has just returned from a field trip to Greenland, was reacting to evidence that Arctic sea ice cover had reached a record low this summer. This latest rate of loss is 50% higher than most scenarios outlined by other polar scientists and coincide with alarming new reports about a \"vast reservoir\" of the potent greenhouse gas, methane, that could be released in Antarctica if the ice melts equally quickly there. Greenpeace said last night that it agreed with the academic's concerns but not with his solutions. \"Professor Wadhams is right that we're in a big hole and the recent record sea ice low in the Arctic is a clear warning that we need to act. But it would be cheaper, safer and easier to stop digging and drilling for more fossil fuels,\" said Ben Ayliffe, the group's senior polar campaigner. \"We already have the technologies, from ultra-efficient vehicles to state-of-the-art clean energy generation, to make the deep cuts in greenhouse gases that are needed to stave off the worst effects of climate change. Unfortunately, we're still lacking the political and business will to implement them,\" he added. Wadhams, who has done pioneering work on polar ice thinning using British naval submarines from 1976 onwards, said these latest satellite findings confirmed his own dire predictions. And they feed into the alarming scenarios that the Arctic Methane Emergency Group have been warning about. \"What we are now seeing is a fast collapse of the sea ice that means we could see a complete loss during the summer by 2015 - rather than the 20 to 30 years talked about by the UK Meteorological Office. This would speed up ocean warming and Greenland ice cap melt and increase global ocean levels considerably as well as warming the seabed and releasing more methane.\" Asked whether the latest evidence made a ban on drilling for carbon-releasing oil and gas necessary as Greenpeace has contended, Wadhams said \"philosophically\" such exploration made little sense. \"We have been conducting a global experiment with the burning of fossil fuels and the results are already disastrous and this would accelerate them,\" he argued saying that there were also practical worries because of the enormous difficulty of dealing with any spillage or a blowout under moving ice where oil would get trapped inside the ice in a kind of inaccessible \"oil sandwich'. But he said at least that companies such as Shell had shown some responsibility by carefully planning its expected exploration in the Chukotka Sea off Alaska and had shown a willingness to use ready-made containment domes that could cap off a well if anything went wrong. He was more fearful about drilling methods in the Russian Arctic where environmental concerns were lower down the agenda."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2015/sep/05/pomised-you-a-miracle-uk-80-82-andy-beckett-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-05T05:30:10Z","webTitle":"Promised You a Miracle: UK 80-82 by Andy Beckett review – how today’s Britain was born in the early 80s","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/05/pomised-you-a-miracle-uk-80-82-andy-beckett-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/sep/05/pomised-you-a-miracle-uk-80-82-andy-beckett-review","fields":{"headline":"Promised You a Miracle: UK 80-82 by Andy Beckett review – how today’s Britain was born in the early 80s","bodyText":"Andy Beckett’s proposition, in the second of his stimulating excursions into recent British history, is that the first three years of the 1980s made Britain the place it is. A profound change “as wide ranging and abrupt as any since the second world war” came over the country in those years, he writes. “And we are still living with the consequences – happily or otherwise.” At first sight, this looks like a humdrum piece of conventional wisdom. We know, surely, that the big before-and-after division of the 70 years since 1945 arrived with Margaret Thatcher and her “-ism”: when the stuttering harmony of the postwar settlement (the last days of which Beckett evoked in his previous book, When the Lights Went Out) was brutally ended by the destruction of organised labour and the unleashing of creative greed, exemplified by the miners’ strike and shouty boys in red braces, with the great leader’s combative visage, as perfected by Spitting Image, suspended over this turbulent landscape like an all-seeing, all-knowing raptor. One of this book’s notable virtues is that it complicates this picture. Beckett tells us that his purpose isn’t to give a simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down to Thatcherism. As well as zealotry and the tumbrils, social revolutions involve “complicity, last-minute conversions, the acceptance … of new realities, and countless other forms of psychological rewiring”. Beckett remembers how he wasn’t immune; as the 11-year-old son of an army officer, he too thrilled to the idea of a “new national story” that Thatcher promised would rescue us from crisis and decline. We find in him and the people he interviews an ambivalence towards the time and the part they played in it that many of us who lived through it may recognise as typical. The Falklands may be the supreme example; to an outsider, sending a British war fleet thousands of miles into the southern hemisphere seemed like a comic anachronism. A writer on the American magazine, the Nation, was astonished to find her British colleague, the leftist eminence Christopher Hitchens, “gathering himself up grandly … and telling me he would happily serve on one of Her Majesty’s ships that were at that moment steaming … to keep the sheep and shepherds under British rule.” But when, in Beckett’s words, the old naval ports of southern England suddenly filled with “telegenic long quaysides of pale grey warships”, which of us at home didn’t feel just a little like Hitchens? That moment had its repercussions. The readying and departure of the taskforce became in Beckett’s words “an epic, brilliantly manipulative piece of public theatre … that would run, to credulous rave reviews in most of the British media, for the rest of the Falklands conflict, and indeed [for more than a year] right up to the next general election”. Those scenes and the victory that followed did wonders for a prime minister who only a few months before had registered lower approval ratings than any of her predecessors; who, according to John Hoskyns, the head of her policy unit, could be found in the summer of 1981 sitting on a seat at the end of her garden thinking: “It’s all gone wrong. I don’t think it will ever come right. I’m the most unpopular prime minister ever. I will go down as a total disaster.” A year later, even as the taskforce was still heaving and wallowing its way homeward, the Tories were suddenly leading Labour by 20% in the polls and Thatcher was chastising “the waverers and the faint hearts … who thought we could no longer do the great things which we once did”, and announcing that Britain had “found herself again in the South Atlantic and will not look back”. In the election the following year, the Tories won their biggest victory since Harold Macmillan’s in 1959. A Commons majority of 144 meant that that they were likely to last at least two more terms in government, the years in which Thatcherism came into its own. People and events outside her control conspired to promote her success. All successful politicians are lucky. In 1982, Thatcher was tremendously lucky. Let us count the ways. In these, her early years of factory closures and steeply rising unemployment, brought about partly by her dedication to monetarism, she was lucky to have a thickening stream of revenue from North Sea oil, which in 1981-82 had grown to equal 5% of public spending; lucky that a fall in world agriculture prices meant cheaper food and lower inflation; lucky that the formation of the SDP split the political opposition. Above all, she was lucky in the Falklands. With what Beckett describes as “crucial, illicitly political advice”, the first sea lord, Admiral Sir Henry Leach, screwed her courage to the sticking place by telling her that if Britain were to “pussyfoot” over recapturing the islands, then “in another few months we shall be living in a different country whose word counts for little”. Other military men might have been less swashbuckling; Leach’s boldness came out of a need to avenge his father’s death in a British naval debacle during the second world war. That was fortunate for Thatcher. Later she and Leach were equally lucky that so many on-target Argentinian bombs failed to explode; six ships were lost, but the number could easily have been doubled. Victory cost 255 British lives and roughly £1m for every Falklander, but it was a quick war and a euphoric peace. When the Franks inquiry into the war’s origins published its report the next year – the contrast with Chilcott is interesting – the Thatcher administration escaped blame, though, as Beckett points out, its prewar approach to the fraught question of the islands’ sovereignty had been risky and barely coherent. As a friend told David Owen, who as a former Labour foreign secretary was irritated by the report’s neglect of his foresight: “David, it’s a simple thing. We won. That’s all they’re saying down the pub. We stuffed the Argies.” But who was this victorious “we”? The war had been won by an older Britain that Thatcherism would soon begin to corrupt and destroy: the Britain that in Beckett’s words “was still a self-consciously maritime nation … its coast thickly strung with the ports and shipyards which had made it a superpower, which had maintained it as such within living memory …” The warships and supply vessels that sailed south had been built in Glasgow, Birkenhead, Newcastle, Belfast and Portsmouth. Two of them, the Canberra and QE2, were the last great passenger liners to be launched by a British shipyard and among the last to have British ownership. The jump jets, the guns, the radar, the obedience and discipline of the private and the able seaman: all these were British too, and still abundant despite the retrenchments since 1945. In a different context, that of a council tenant’s “right to buy”, Beckett writes that Thatcherism “liked to present itself as a rejection of the postwar, state-driven, more profligate way of doing things. But in housing, her administration was actually the postwar state’s beneficiary, selling off assets that it had built up”. That paradox was also present in the Falklands war. It was like an animal dying so that its carcass might feed its young. Several decades passed before the public, the media and unobservant politicians began to notice that the British military had grown significantly weaker and that armed intervention wasn’t without its drawbacks. The Falklands, Beckett writes, gave Britain “a taste for military aggression in pursuit of liberal-sounding causes – the right to self-determination, removing dictators – that did not begin to fade until the coalition’s abortive attempt to ‘intervene’ in Syria 31 years later”. And yet in parallel with this Indian summer of the gunboat ran a great civilian blooming as the population grew more various, more feminist and more tolerant: attitudes that began to be confidently expressed in the early 1980s partly as a reaction and counterforce to Thatcherism. Ken Livingstone’s Greater London Council may have been “a cacophonous experiment in racial, sexual and gender politics” caricatured at the time as “the loony left”, but, as Beckett points out, most of its ideas have since become mainstream, from primary school teaching to the official recruitment policies of big business. London takes up a lot of Beckett’s story. The London Docklands Development Corporation was established 1981, followed by the London International Financial Futures Exchange in 1982. The first laid the foundation of the City’s move to the east, where the towers of finance would rise on a wasteland of old wharves and disused railway sidings. The second, modelled on the macho trading pits of Chicago, assaulted a tradition of financial capitalism that, to quote Beckett, was “weighed down like other parts of establishment Britain by heavy lunches and overpromoted public schoolboys”. But as London began its rise to total national dominance – economic now as well as political and cultural – much of the rest of Britain felt its power ebb away. Northern England in particular was affected by the loss of leverage it had enjoyed since the industrial revolution. “The first Thatcher government had a sometimes Darwinian view of the British regions,” Beckett writes, quoting a private letter to the prime minister from her first chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, in July 1981. “The option of managed decline [of Liverpool] is one which we should not forget altogether,” Howe wrote of a city that then literally smouldered with resentment. “We must not expend all our limited resources in trying to make water flow uphill.” As Beckett’s theme is beginnings rather than endings – of portents rather than farewells – the stress on London is understandable. The fact is, though, that in a book organised in self-contained narrative chapters, not every chapter conforms to this theme. Channel 4, the GLC women’s committee, the Greenham Common protests, the rise in house prices, the renaissance of London’s docklands: all these prefigured or contained within them important aspects of Britain in the next century. But public dread of nuclear war (covered here by an eccentric scheme to build a nuclear-proof town) is surely something that, unreasonably or not, has grown smaller rather than larger. When Beckett meets the founder of the Greenham movement, for example, he discovers that 30 years after chaining herself to the airfield’s fence she’s in favour of both nuclear power and British military action in Libya. On the other hand, there is one part of the UK where anti-nuclear politics has actually intensified – Scotland – where together with neo-Thatcherism and the perception of London as a malign and greedy capital, the Trident question now poses a serious threat to the UK’s future as a state. A book that’s essentially an anthology of an age rather than a comprehensive historical survey will by its nature leave some things out, but Beckett’s omission of a Scottish dimension looks untypically careless. This is a rare blemish in a book that offers so much pleasure and insight, not least in its contemporary encounters with celebrated as well as obscure participants and witnesses from the years in question. A “faint air of unfulfilment” still hangs over the director Hugh Hudson, whose film, Chariots of Fire, helped make patriotism fashionable again. Patrick Minford, Thatcher’s academic cheerleader, is discovered, brittle and unrepentant, in Cardiff. Norman Tebbit comes to the door of his Bury St Edmunds home, Essex having been exchanged for Suffolk, wearing “soft cords, a shirt in country check, and a green jumper with elbow patches – the off-duty uniform of the cosier sort of rural Tory”. There are many memorable phrases. Of Roy Jenkins at the founding of the SDP: “Nothing about his appearance … suggested that it was not 1950.” Of Michael Heseltine, opening the first of London docklands’ new housing schemes: “He strode among the little houses … taller than the trailing crowd … his famous prow of hair swept back, his smile controlled but constant, like a satisfied admiral inspecting a line of frigates.” Two of his statements are, I think, memorably crisp summaries of that time and its legacy. The first concerns council house sales: Thatcherism, “in some ways, was a highly skilful exercise in feigned egalitarianism – as indeed is capitalism itself …” The second helps explain the foreign-owned country we find ourselves in: “The prime minister was a patriot, but she was a capitalist first.” • To order Promised You a Miracle for £16 (RRP £20) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

It depends on how you ask the question. If it is about threats to the world or to the nation, the answer is quite consistently terrorism and religious extremism. Closer to home, it is knife crime and burglary. If you want to dig a bit deeper, the most common personal fears are heights, snakes and public speaking. International terrorism is seen in the UK as the biggest threat facing the world by far. It topped a YouGov poll of the public’s global concerns last September, with 77% of those questioned naming it as the most serious issue, significantly ahead of armed conflicts (60%), pandemics (52%), climate change (39%) and nuclear proliferation (31%). That was more than a year after the last lethal terrorism incident on British soil, the murder of off-duty soldier Lee Rigby in London. But the poll was conducted just a few days after Islamic State extremists had carried out their first filmed beheading of a British hostage. The high awareness of the terrorist threat, and high sensitivity to it, seem to be consistent over time and polls. An in-depth analysis of public threat perceptions soon to be published in the British Journal of Political Science based on surveys in 2012 found that about 80% of respondents ranked terrorism as a global threat. It was also seen as a national threat by close to 70%. However, when the authors – Daniel Stevens of Exeter University and Nick Vaughan-Williams of Warwick University – looked at fears at a community and individual level, the key threats were knife crime, online fraud and burglary. Terrorism did not figure in the top five concerns. People saw it as a problem for the wider world without seeing it as having much impact on daily life. “In surveys and focus groups, people from all over the country invariably had a perception of the security threat that had nothing to do with the national threat,” Stevens said. “On terrorism, people say: if it happens, it happens. And we didn’t find that varied much by region.” Below the immediate rational fears lurk the national phobias, which are entirely different again. Top of the blind terror league here, according to a YouGov poll last March, are heights (23% were “very afraid”), snakes (21%) and public speaking (20%), followed by spiders (18%). None of them are a significant threat, statistically speaking, but then again, neither is terrorism. Julian Borger (The Guardian) Germany The German psyche, some would say, is bust. It is, somehow, collectively disturbed. Germans either lean towards outrageous hubris – see Kaiser Wilhelm, Hitler, the current attempts to save the euro – or else they withdraw into their shells and wallow in depression. Either on top of the world, or in the depths of despair – either way, beyond any sense of moderation. There’s a good reason why the term “German angst” has entered the worldwide vocabulary. It means the Germans’ supposed tendency to be tentative and anxious, or to react chiefly out of fear. As examples, people cite Germany’s foreign policy reserve, or, more concretely, its aversion to military intervention, or else its hasty phasing out of nuclear power in the aftermath of the Fukushima accident. Then there’s their outrage over all those data-guzzling monsters – Google, Facebook, the NSA. Even former chancellor Helmut Schmidt once said it: “The Germans tend to be scared. It’s been stuck in their consciousness since the end of the Nazi times and the war.” So are Germans really a nation of worriers? Perhaps a little. On the other hand, all these examples can be explained rationally: the defensive foreign policy has a lot to do with the legacy of the conquest-mad Nazis – it’s a reaction to a lesson learned from history. The withdrawal from nuclear power, on the other hand, is an attempt to lead the way on what they see as an inevitable development. Are surveys any help? According to the “fear index” of the global IT firm Unisys, which measures among other things feelings of personal security, Germany, with 146 out of a possible 300 points, was roughly in the middle of the 13 countries surveyed. The French are more scared (174), Britons less (103), the Dutch feel the most secure (66). That could be down to the Dutch spending twice as much on insurance every year ($6,012) as the Germans ($2,977). Though the Germans like to insure themselves mainly against direct material threats (life insurance, accidents, liability, theft); old age poverty and illness seem to worry them less. That fits the results of more specialised fear surveys. According to the German insurance firm R+V, Germans are most concerned about money: their biggest worry, at 58%, is the rising cost of living. After that, at 51%, comes the fear of becoming disabled in old age and being a burden to others, as well as the fear of natural disasters. Two-thirds of those polled fear that Germany will have to spend more money on the euro crisis. All in all, Germany’s fear index, the average aggregate of all its personal, economic, and political fears, sank in 2014 to its lowest level in 20 years. Heidelberg political scientist Manfred Schmidt says the Germans are not a nation of scaredy-cats. “They react with justified concern,” he said, “to current events and problems.” Thomas Kirchner (Süddeutsche Zeitung) France The sense of fear has never before been so high in France: 93% of people consider that the threat is “mostly high” or “very high” , according to an Ifop poll carried out for the Atlantico website a few days after last month’s Paris terror attacks. “We’ve never seen that in the past,” said Jérôme Fourquet, director of the business strategies and opinion department at Ifop. Even before the attacks on Charlie Hebdo and the Parisian kosher supermarket in which 20 people – including three gunmen – died, the rise of radical Islamism was at the top of fears for 2015 for the French. In an Ifop poll for Paris Match in December, such fears were greater than concern over climate change, the financial crisis in Europe, conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Ebola, the rise of the far right in Europe, France’s foreign military intervention and aircraft accidents. January’s attacks have only highlighted this trend. “When you think of outside threats, the choice of subjects is necessarily limited,” said Brice Teinturier, director of Ipsos. “And when you are faced with events as violent as the [Paris] attacks, then obviously it’s going to change your perception.” For Fourquet, this fear has been building up since Mohamed Merah’s attacks in Toulouse and Montauban in March 2012, which left seven people dead. However, only just over a half of French people believed that the terrorist threat at that point was raised. “It was seen more in terms of a terrible news event rather than a terrorist attack,” Fourquet said. After that, a new phenomenon emerged: French jihadis leaving for Iraq or Syria. And then the Charlie Hebdo attack happened. From a figure of around 80% at the beginning of January, the perception of the terrorist threat rose 13 percentage points in a few days. This does not necessarily translate into a feeling of dread. Only 24% of French people said they felt afraid after the events, according to an Ipsos poll for Le Monde and Europe 1 published last week. The predominant feelings are anger (72%) and disgust (51%). Nor was there any unusual change in the use of anti-anxiety drugs. Only 1% of people said they had taken more tranquillisers than usual. The event, therefore, does not seem to have sparked a general psychosis. Thibault Petit (Le Monde) Poland The Poles are frightened of Russia: 78% of the population, found a survey last year, regard the situation in Ukraine as a threat to the security of their country. This fear is hardly new: a large part of Polish political thought over the past 200 years has been preoccupied with protection against the Russian threat. A more recent source of unease and frustration, however, is the western attitude towards Russia and the Ukrainian conflict. Many Polish politicians, with President Bronisław Komorowski at their head, are educated historians. They remember well how in the 19th and 20th centuries the west repeatedly sold Poland to the Russians in a similar way – firstly in the name of retaining good relations with the Romanov dynasty and then with the Soviet empire. In private, politicians are asking each other: “Are we not sufficiently integrated into the west to be worth not being sold off to the Russians?” There is a sense of disbelief at the way western politicians appear to treat Vladimir Putin as a rational player with whom communication is possible. And a desire, if the surveys are to be believed, for the defence of Ukraine to be resolved diplomatically by the great world powers: the European Union and the United States. Two-thirds of Poles, according to a CBOS survey last year, do not want to see direct involvement of Polish troops in the conflict. Poland’s fear of Russia is often misconstrued in the west as Russophobia – but it has deep historical roots. From the great northern war (1700-1721), won by Peter the Great, until the fall of the Soviet Union, Russians were stationed on Polish territory with only very short intervals in between. The annually celebrated public holiday of the Polish forces falls on 15 August, the anniversary of the great battle with communist Russia in Warsaw in 1920, which the Poles won and thus regained 20 years of independence for Poland. In more than 300 years of military conflict with Russia, the Poles have only managed to win once – and that was then. Since last year, Poles have been looking eastwards with anxiety once more. A common belief held here since the 19th century maintains that, without Ukraine, Russia is not a threat to Poland. But when Ukraine is dominated by Russia, the Poles are next. They usually were. Adam Leszczyński (Gazeta Wyborcza) Italy What do Italians mean when they say they are afraid? The perceived threat of al-Qaida is strong after the attack on Charlie Hebdo, especially after Islamic State said it wanted to infiltrate Europe by its jihadis posing as refugees and Italy’s foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni, admitted that this threat was real. But, in a country with record high unemployment of 13.4%, scholars argue that it is economic uncertainty – not terrorism – that keeps people up at night (and immigrants actually have a positive effect, contributing an estimated 8.8% of gross domestic product). According to Nicola Piepoli, a pollster, it is the lack of a future that is scaring Italians. “A quarter of the population is worried that future generations will not be as well off as we are,” he said. “Terrorism creates anxiety, but less than half of respondents are really pessimistic. In fact, there’s a general hope that Italy will be spared in this holy war. The most interesting fact, however, is that people are more upbeat now compared with the same period last year. Today, two out of three people feel optimistic about the future compared with one out of two people in 2014.” For the past three years, research has shown that insecurity is the shadow hanging over our society, regardless of whether those dangers are real or only perceived. The national mood hit a low point in 2012 amid a chronic recession. A report on the perception of insecurity published by Demos that year found that 40% of Italians experienced a high level of “absolute” insecurity and that 50% were afraid of unemployment (8 percentage points higher than in 2011). From that point on, this trend has remained constant, and other classic fears, of crime and immigration, for example, remain on the back burner. Certainly, compared with last year, the issue of immigration is bubbling up (3% more think immigrants threaten public order, 7% more believe they threaten Italian culture and identity, while 45% prefer for them to be blocked from entering the country rather than being welcomed, along the lines of the Mare Nostrum operation which ended last October). In data collected by Ipsos Italy, pollster Nando Pagnoncelli sees a clear trend: Italians are chiefly concerned about the economy and jobs. At least 90% who were interviewed talked about economic issues; in second place were the social safety net, welfare and pensions. The Charlie Hebdo attacks were a terrifying reminder of the terror threat but, said Pagnoncelli, “crime and immigration are fears mentioned by one out of 10 people who are interviewed. Terrorism has an emotionally strong impact but remains far from our peoples’ everyday lives”. Francesca Paci (La Stampa) Spain If the masked gunmen who entered the Charlie Hebdo offices hoped that their action would reverberate beyond the frontiers of France, they unfortunately achieved their goal. Fears of a jihadi attack in Spain have risen since the killings last month in France – perhaps unsurprising for a country that has already experienced terrorism first-hand and on a greater scale. A survey carried out six days after the attack on the French satirical magazine found that some 58% of Spaniards believed that a repeat of the attack in Madrid on 11 March 2004, which killed 192 people and wounded 1,858, was likely. Asked the same question two years ago, only 31% were of this opinion. A further 64% questioned last month thought an attack on a specific target, similar to the one in Paris, was likely to be carried out in Spain. Along with an increase in fears of terrorism, the Metroscopia poll also noted a rise in support for the military defeat of jihadi groups in Syria and Iraq. This sentiment crosses the political spectrum and party affiliation, it found. The sense of insecurity and the desire for military action appear to go hand-in-hand. This is a big change: in September 2014, 75% of Spaniards questioned said diplomacy was the best way forward. That poll was carried out at the time when the International Conference on Peace and Security in Iraq was being held in Paris. On that occasion, some 30 countries agreed to “use all means necessary to effectively fight against the Islamic State”, including “appropriate military support”. And on that occasion, perhaps with memories of the failed invasion of Iraq, Spain still preferred diplomatic to military means. Now, it appears, it is arguably another recollection – that of bombed-out train carriages in Madrid – that seems to be uppermost in our minds.

John Carney’s winsome, wistful Begin Again (Entertainment One, 15) sounds warning bells with a premise that reads suspiciously like a lacquered New York do-over of Carney’s organic 2007 hit Once. But what a lovely surprise it is: a loose-limbed, tender-hearted paean to the healing properties of art and friendship, with Keira Knightley hitting peak form as a shy singer-songwriter piecing together a breakup album with the help of Mark Ruffalo’s jaded record executive. The story is admittedly hard to sell in print; it’s the surprisingly unshakable songs (mostly penned by Gregg Alexander, erstwhile frontman of glorious one-hit wonders New Radicals) that give it life and body. Clint Eastwood’s Jersey Boys (Warner, 15), meanwhile, has one of the most effervescent songbooks in American pop music at its disposal, yet barely has a pulse of its own – rarely has a musical pulled from the stage seemed so sheepishly reluctant to perform. Working in the drab, half-lit style that has become his latter-day signature, Eastwood renders the classic rise-and-fall-and-rise narrative of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons barely distinguishable from J Edgar, abbreviating the songs to focus with sub-Scorsese conviction on the rocky domestic rhythms of working-class Garden State society. It flickers to life when star John Lloyd Young approximates Valli’s helium croon on Can’t Take My Eyes Off You – what film couldn’t? – but this is otherwise a notably squandered opportunity. There is as much to be said about the over-milked X-Men franchise at this point as there is to be explored in the films themselves: very little indeed. Still, X-Men: Days of Future Past (Fox, 12) is rarely less than proficient, and occasionally alights upon a poppy visual concept that evokes the comic books whence these gargantuan, machine-tooled blockbusters came. Viewers not already waist-deep in this series, however, need not apply. The same might be said of Melissa McCarthy fans and Tammy (Warner, 15). As a paid-up admirer of the star’s bumptious comic shtick, I found much to enjoy in this sweetly misshapen road movie that sees McCarthy’s loud-mouthed, laid-off fast-food drone setting off for Niagara Falls to find some approximation of herself, with her randy grandmother (a spirited but years-too-young Susan Sarandon) in tow. Yet it’s harder to pinpoint the film’s specific virtues than it is to accept its predictable geniality; McCarthy wrote it herself, with husband Ben Falcone, but one can’t help feeling she’s sold herself a bit short. The week’s best foreign language release is perhaps its least glamorous: The Golden Dream (Saffron Hill, 12) is a maudlin title for director Diego Quemada Diaz’s bracingly tough immigrant song, in which a trio of Guatemalan teens set off on a long, troubled trek to the US. Vividly realised and beautifully performed by its non-professional leads, it’s a modest epic fit to be filed alongside El Norte and In This World. There’s less human substance to Rebecca Zlotowski’s sharply styled romantic drama Grand Central (StudioCanal, 15), though it has ample body heat: it’s worth watching just for the chemical charge between Tahar Rahim and Léa Seydoux as illicitly entangled employees at a nuclear power plant, even if the intriguing semi-thriller narrative never quite reaches a rolling boil. Italian Oscar candidate Human Capital (Arrow Films, 15), meanwhile, rather overcooks the melodrama: its multi-stranded, recession-themed soap opera of class conflict is well acted and chicly clothed, but despite its title, features scarcely one character worth investing in. The Case Against 8 (Dogwoof, E), a thorough, emotionally direct account of the Californian court battle to overturn legislation against gay marriage, heads straight from cinemas to DVD shelves in the space of a weekend, as does Gianfranco Rosi’s infectiously inquisitive roadside community portrait Sacro GRA (Soda, 15). Rosi’s film may have the Venice Golden Lion, but it’s not even the finest documentary out this week: that would be Finding Vivian Maier (Soda, 12), an alluring, melancholic investigation of the eponymous, mysterious American street photographer. Cementing this as a strong week for non-fiction is Netflix pick Marmato, US photojournalist Mark Grieco’s sensitive, unsentimental study of a modern-day gold rush in the Colombian Andes, and its devastating effect on the local economy. It’s a worthy Sundance premiere from earlier this year that skipped cinemas altogether; happily, the streaming service continues to provide a generous alternative for docs that evade UK distributors’ impressively broad net."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2014/dec/31/japan-2014-wartime-conduct-economic-stagnation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T14:53:23Z","webTitle":"Japan in 2014: a year spent looking back and lurching right","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/31/japan-2014-wartime-conduct-economic-stagnation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/31/japan-2014-wartime-conduct-economic-stagnation","fields":{"headline":"Japan in 2014: a year spent looking back and lurching right","bodyText":"Japan spent much of the year confronting familiar demons: its wartime conduct and economic stagnation. The New Year celebrations had barely ended when it became embroiled in a bizarre row with China over the toxic legacy of its wartime conduct in mainland Asia. The 26 December 2013 visit by the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to Yasukuni – a Shinto shrine in Tokyo that honours the country’s war-dead, including 14 class A war criminals – prompted China’s ambassador to the UK to use the pages of the Daily Telegraph to charge its former enemy with revisiting its militaristic past like a “haunting Voldemort”. The Harry Potter symbolism continued days later when his Japanese counterpart accused China of using coercion to push its claims to the Senkaku, a chain of uninhabited islets in the East China Sea (known as the Diaoyu in Chinese) at the centre of a bilateral territorial dispute. China, he said, could either observe the rule of law or “play the role of Voldemort in the region by letting loose the evil of an arms race and escalation of tensions”. With some observers predicting a conflict that could easily draw in Japan’s main ally, the US, Tokyo and Beijing ended the year on marginally better terms when Abe held brief talks for the first time with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the Apec summit in November. Xi’s grimace as the leaders shook hands suggested, however, that tension over the Senkaku will continue to cast a shadow in 2015. At home, Abe celebrated early successes in his quest to revive the world’s third-biggest economy – a weaker yen brought relief to exporters and share prices soared – only for Japan’s notoriously cautious consumers to refuse to stay on-message. A controversial rise in the sales tax in April that Abe’s Liberal Democratic party had agreed to while in opposition battered consumer spending and, by November, sent the economy back into recession for the first time since 2012. Abe promptly postponed a second planned rise in the sales tax until 2017, and called a snap early election, in which he won a comfortable majority. While Abe described the election as a referendum on his decision to focus on growth rather than Japan’s huge public debt and rising welfare costs, others spied an attempt to secure four more years in office before even more bad economic news filters through. Early in 2015 Abe is expected to give the final go-ahead for the restart of two nuclear reactors in the country’s south-west, despite opinion polls showing that most voters, still traumatised by the March 2011 Fukushima accident, are opposed. He is likely to court controversy again later in the year with plans to re-interpret Japan’s pacifist constitution to allow troops to fight alongside allies overseas for the first time since 1945. Having abandoned outright revision of the US-authored constitution, Abe insists that there is room for legislation that would lift the country’s self-imposed ban on collective self-defence, or coming to the aid of an ally under attack. A more robust military posture, coupled with a significant rise in defence spending, fuelled concerns that Japan has embarked on an unstoppable lurch to the right. Geopolitics aside, there was plenty else to exercise the country’s embattled liberals. This month saw the enactment of a state secrets act that its supporters say will enable Japan to safely share intelligence with the US amid rising regional tensions. Under the new law, public officials and private citizens who leak “special state secrets” face prison terms of up to 10 years, while journalists who seek to obtain the classified information could be jailed for up to five years. Critics say the law will be abused to prevent disclosure of potentially embarrassing information, including any hiccups in the decommissioning of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The release, in March, of Iwao Hakamada, who spent 45 years on death row for a crime he did not commit, was a reminder that Japan is one of a shrinking number of countries that enthusiastically impose the death penalty. Japan is set to defy international opinion on another contentious practice: the slaughter of whales in the Antarctic. Months after the international court of justice in the Hague halted its “scientific” whaling programme, Japan has unveiled a revised programme that could see its whaling fleet return to the Southern Ocean in pursuit of minke whales as early as the end of 2015. The coming 12 months are likely to be marred by continued tensions between Japan and its neighbours. Abe has still not held a summit with the South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, amid a row over Japan’s use of tens of thousands of mainly Korean sex slaves before and during the second world war. Abe has stopped short of revising an official apology issued in 1993, but he and his conservative allies in politics, the media and academia deny there is any evidence that the women were coerced by Japanese imperial forces. Relations between Tokyo and Washington will be complicated by the fraught relocation of a US marine air base in the centre of a densely populated city in Okinawa to a more remote location on the island’s unspoiled north-east coast. The relocation was thrown into doubt in November when voters in Okinawa elected a new governor who has vowed to block the move. Abe is expected to issue a “forward-looking” statement next August to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the Pacific war. Depending on how he addresses Japan’s conduct on the Asian mainland in the first half of the 20th century, the statement could either herald an era of regional detente or send relations with Beijing and Seoul back into the diplomatic deep freeze."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2016/mar/07/german-factory-orders-contract-gathering-storm-eurogroup-greece-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-07T18:23:21Z","webTitle":"Greece: Eurogroup says debt talks on the table, troika to return to Athens –as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/mar/07/german-factory-orders-contract-gathering-storm-eurogroup-greece-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2016/mar/07/german-factory-orders-contract-gathering-storm-eurogroup-greece-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Greece: Eurogroup says debt talks on the table, troika to return to Athens –as it happened","bodyText":"The Eurogroup has said debt relief talks for Greece are on the table, but are dependent on the necessary reforms to tax and pensions. More work is needed, and the Eurogroup called on the institutions and the Greek government to put extra effort in to reach agreement. Representatives of the creditors - the troika - will return to Athens tomorrow, but the process needs to be speeded up, so the debt relief talks will be brought forward. On that note it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. Klaus Regling, head of the eurozone rescue fund the ESM, said Greek liquidity was getting tighter but: Will the debt issue be part of the first review? Dijsselbloem: The review is on the implementation of what was agreed so debt relief not part of that. But there is a strong link between the two. We have agreed there should be fiscal targets and pension reform, so fiscal sustainability long term will be part of debt discussions. [To bring them together} we need to speed up review process and bring forward debt discussion, which could allow us to reach political agreement. Was there discussion about debt relief today? Dijsselbloem: We did not, but I flagged to my colleagues that discussions about debt relief would need to come in the short term future. As soon as we know the outcome on reforms and tax etc then we know what the remaining issue of debt relief will be. And after a final question on Portugal the press conference ends. The review was said to be completed by Easter but that is not straightforward: IMF have asked for more to be done, and also made strong debt relief case, are you in that camp now? Dijsselbloem: Have to be more on table than there is now or it will not work. Not in any camp but there is a link between depth of reforms and any remaining debt issue. More you do on reform, smaller fiscal gaps will be and less of a debt issue there will be in the future. We will put pressure on all sides to make sure it adds up, as IMF says. Questions: Could debt talks start before completion of review? Dijsselbloem: Need to know the outcome of the reforms, but there is going to be a point where all this comes together. On other matters, the Eurogroup says Italy’s high debt burden remains a concern. European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said he was very happy with the agreement. It would allow the mission chiefs (the creditors’ representatives) to go to Athens as soon as tomorrow to lead discussions on a review of the agreement. He said there were five issues in particular: establish a privatisation fund; reform income tax; reform pensions; create independent revenue agency; cope with non-performing loans. He said they would work with Greece on steps to achieve a 3.5% primary surplus in 2018. The troika will return to Athens, confirms Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the Eurogroup at a press conference following today’s meeting. But he said more effort needed to be put in to get a good outcome, and there were still fiscal gaps to be filled and some reforms needed to be deepened. He called on the institutions (the creditors) and in particular the Greek government to put in the extra effort. On debt, they had said if the Greek government delivered a primary surplus “we would do what was necessary to make [the] debt manageable.” He said they had now made explicit that those discussions would be on the table. Here’s European Commission vice presdient Valdis Dombrovskis on the situation with Greece: A rebound in oil - above $40 a barrel for the first time since December - and metal prices - iron ore in particular - has lifted commodity companies and helped leading shares in Europe recover some of their early losses. Markets ended mostly lower, hit by gloomy comments from the Bank of International Settlements and some profit taking ahead of the European Central Bank’s interest rate-setting meeting this week. But the strength in commodities and a rally on Wall Street after an early dip helped European markets to recover some ground. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 17.03 points or 0.27% at 6182.40 having earlier fallen as low as 6125 Germany’s Dax dipped 0.46% to 9778.93 France’s Cac closed down 0.32% at 4442.29 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 1.2% to 18,059.27 Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.28% at 8786.8 But in Greece, the Athens market added 1.19% to 559.44 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 57 points or 0.34%. Cyprus has exited its bailout programme ahead of schedule, and here’s a statement from the managing director of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde: More on the prospect of talks over debt relief for Greece. Reuters reports: The head of the Eurogroup Jeroen Dijsselbloem asked euro zone finance ministers meeting on Monday to prepare to start talks on debt relief for Greece in April, a euro zone official said. Talks on the debt relief can only start once Greece’s lenders -- euro zone governments and the International Monetary Fund -- agree that the country has delivered on reforms pledged in August in exchange for cheap loans. This reform assessment, called the first review, stalled in February over details of the politically very difficult pension reform and because of diverging views between the euro zone and the IMF on how to make the economy and debt sustainable in the longer term. European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici told reporters before the ministerial meeting he expected the ministers to decide on Monday to send the reform review team back to Greece. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he would support sending the team already this week. Two euro zone officials, who asked not to be named, said the lenders’ representatives may set out already on Tuesday. “The lenders mission will return to Athens on Tuesday,” a Greek government official said. Confirmation from Germany that Greece’s creditors could return to Athens this week: Brent crude has hit $40 a barrel for the first time since early December. The move comes on hopes of continuing economic recovery in China, which set a target of 6.5% to 7% growth this year, which has boosted commodity prices generally. On top of that US data from information firm Genscape showed a lower than expected increase in stocks at the Cushing delivery hub in Oklahoma, at the same time as hopes are growing that producers could act to tackle the problem of oversupply. Back with Greece and reports are coming in that the country’s international creditors will return to Athens on Tuesday, according to a Greek government official. And Reuters is quoting a eurozone official saying that ministers were told to prepare for the start of talks on debt relief for Greece in April. Meanwhile US markets have continued the downward trend being seen elsewhere. After last week’s rally investors have decided to cash in some of their gains ahead of the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, when further interest rate cuts or other stimulus measures are expected. There is scope for disappointment here, however, as ECB president Mario Draghi tries to live up to his promises of taking all necessary action. The earlier gloomy report from the Bank of International Settlements, warning of a “gathering storm” for the global economy, is not helping sentiment. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has slipped 33 points or 0.19, while at the open the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.45% and Nasdaq 0.56% lower. Greece’s finance minister has urged its creditors to return to Athens and finish signing off its bailout review. Euclid Tsakalotos told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that the two sides can’t simply keep arguing over pension reforms forever. He wants the institutions to accept Greece’s position, opening the door for talks on debt relief. Tsakalotos said: “This question of time is important if we want to move from a vicious to a virtuous circle. We can’t continue debating over pension reforms forever, as if to keep a wound open.....Pensions are part of the social safety net.” More here: Greece urges completion of reform review by May 1 Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs the eurogroup, has warned Greece that it must stick to its bailout deal. Arriving at today’s eurogroup meeting in Brussels, Dijsselbloem said ministers would listen to “the institutions” - Greece’s lenders - and see how all sides can move forward.. But he insists that Greece cannot wriggle out of making the pension reforms demanded by creditors, saying: We need credible and sustainable pension reforms and the budget needs to be on track for the medium-term. This is not just something that concerns the IMF, it is something that concerns all the institutions and the eurogroup. We need to stick to the agreement that we had this summer. Dijsselbloem adds that he hopes to hear more details today about how pension reforms will work out. Those reforms are hugely unpopular in Greece, where farmers have been holding protests against pension cuts for months. Pierre Moscovici, EC commissioner for economic affair, is also speaking to the press. He hopes that the eurogroup will take a ‘unanimous decision’ that the mission chiefs representing Greece’s creditors should return to Athens ASAP to conclude the current bailout review (which has been bogged down for months). Oil is also rising today, with Brent crude gaining over 1% to $39.50. Shares in Brazil mining group Vale have leapt by 8%, following the massive rally in iron ore this morning. Eurozone finance ministers should be arriving at EU headquarters shortly, for a regular eurogroup meeting. They’ll be playing second-fiddle to the big EU Migration Summit, where leaders are wrangling over the refugee crisis. But the meeting could still be significant, given the deadlock between Greece and its lenders over the implementation of its bailout programme. Déjà vu all over again. Again. Eurogroup ministers are planning to look at what needs to be done to allow the first review of the bailout to be successfully completed (after many delays). And that list includes some serious challenges, including: ...reforming the pension system, fiscal strategy, making the privatisation fund operational and addressing the issue of non-performing loans, among other issues. The lack of progress is fuelling concerns over Greece’s position in the eurozone, particularly as the refugee crisis is putting further pressure on its economy, and fuelling EU tensions. Former finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis has told our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, that the situation is boiling up again: “I think the situation right now is more dangerous than it was last summer [when Greece agreed its third bailout]. “Then it was a question of the political will of a few people. Now it’s a question of implementing reforms and working hard and if a government doesn’t believe in them and implements them begrudgingly, progress becomes very difficult.” It’s not been a great few months for Goldman Sachs, and clients who followed its ‘top tips for 2016’. The Wall Street bank just closed all six trades, with five making losses. The failed bets included: Buying the dollar against the yen and the euro Buying yields on Italian bonds versus German ones Wagering that large US banks would outperform the general markek And betting that US inflation expectations would rise They were based on the idea that the US economy would strengthen this year, allowing the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates and pushing up the dollar. Unfortunately (for Goldman), the panic that gripped investors in January and February meant the markets moved against them. This chart of daily price moves confirms that today’s 20% surge in iron ore is way, way, outside the norm: Commodity prices took a fierce battering in 2015, so investors may now be scrambling to get on the ‘right side’ of a rebound. Especially if fears of a global recession are fading. Rating agency Fitch has slashed its growth forecasts but predicted the world will avoid another full-blown recession. It now expects the world economy to expand by just 2.5% this year, not the 2.9% expected three months ago. That would only equal 2015’s growth rate. Fitch expects advanced economies to expand by only 1.7%, down from 2.1% in December. For emerging markets, 2016 growth is now pegged at 4.0%, down from 4.4%. Encouragingly, Fitch believes we will avoid a severe downturn. Here’s why: “With emerging markets at the epicentre of these shocks and now accounting for 40% of world GDP it is legitimate to ask whether the world will see, for more or less the first time in recent history, an emerging market led global recession. However, we believe several factors mitigate this risk. Firstly, labour market conditions in many of the major advanced economies look quite robust. Along with the benefits of lower oil prices on real incomes, this should help support consumer spending in rich countries and cushion the shock. Advanced economies look to be beyond the worst of the private sector deleveraging forces that held back domestic demand growth in the years following the global financial crisis. Furthermore, the impact of fiscal policy on growth in the advanced economies is currently less restrictive than it has been in the last few years. The iron ore price is on an absolute tear this morning, surging by almost 20%. The cause of the mega-rally isn’t quite clear, but it follows speculation that the commodity crunch has bottomed out. China’s latest government targets could also be driving demand. Over the weekend, Beijing committed to a target growth rate of 6.5% to 7% this year, and a budget deficit of 3% of GDP. Some traders think this equals another dose of fiscal stimulus, pushing demand for commodities up. Europe’s major stock markets continue to lose ground this morning. BIS’s warning of troubles ahead, the weak German factory orders data, and the drop in investor confidence reported by Sentix may all be weighing on sentiment on an otherwise quiet day. In London, the FTSE 100 has now shed 55 points. Miners are the big fallers, reversing some of their recent strong rally. Anglo American has shed 4%. Investors are already fretting about Thursday, when the European Central Bank holds its next monetary policy meeting. Everyone expects the ECB to announce something new on the stimulus front. But some fear a repeat of December’s meeting, when market expectations weren’t fully met. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: After a tentative start the bears took hold this Monday, the European indices all sliding into the red with last week’s confidence replaced by pre-ECB nerves. It’s unclear what has inspired this shift in sentiment; general fears over the myriad of macro-maladies currently circling the markets appears to be the driving force this Monday, with this morning’s warning from the BIS and the looming ECB meeting on Thursday only exacerbating matters. There is a chance this kind of jittery trading will continue until Mario Draghi puts the market out of its misery and reveals, for better or for worse, what ‘whatever it takes’ actually means this time around. Eurozone investor confidence has fallen to its lowest level in almost a year. Sentix, the German research group, reports that fears over the global economy hit morale among eurozone analysts and investors this month. Its economic index fell to 5.5, from 6.0 last month, which is the lowest since April 2015. Patrick Hussy, Sentix’s managing director, says the Eurozone is suffering from “the loss of economic momentum of the global economy”. Hussy’s believes it should spur the European Central Bank into agreeing new stimulus measures at Thursday’s meeting. Investors’ perspective on the current situation in the Eurozone should resupply dovish members of the ECB council with enough ammunition to demand significantly more expansive monetary stimulus on Thursday’s ECB meeting. Sentix’s ‘current conditions’ sub-index fell from 10.5 to 8.3, suggesting the eurozone economy has suffered from the market turbulence and gloom in early 2016 But more encouragingly, the ‘future expectations’ measure rose to 2.8, from the 1.5 it slumped to in February. That may mean that confidence will rise again soon. Hussy says: “Investors’ expectations are slowly turning against the negative trend.” The CEO of France’s EDF has pledged to take a ‘final decision’ soon on the Hinkley Point C nuclear reactor, following the shock resignation of his finance chief: Dirk Schlotboeller, economist at Germany’s DIHK Chambers of Commerce. argues that German factories were lucky to only suffer a 0.1% drop in orders in January. Schlotboeller says: “This could have been worse in light of the bad news and turbulence on stock markets at the beginning of the year.” Germany’s finance ministry has warned that storm clouds are gathering over its manufacturing sector. Following the 1.6% drop in domestic factory orders in January, it says: “Over the two months, the impulses are from abroad. “However, expectations in industry have become considerably overcast and signal only a modest economic upswing.” Shares in French energy company EDF slumped by almost 10% at the start of trading, following the shock resignation of its finance director. Thomas Piquemal quit after opposing the firm’s plan to build a new £18bn nuclear power station for the UK at Hinkley Point. Energy editor Terry Macalister explain: A new plant at Hinkley, in Somerset, is desperately needed and has been heavily promoted by the chancellor, George Osborne, and other ministers as a key part of keeping the lights on in Britain. But EDF has been hit by a series of problems that have led many – even in the City of London – to conclude that the new nuclear plant project is on the verge of collapse. Piquemal is said to have been arguing that pursuing what would be the world’s most expensive power project at this moment could jeopardise the French group, which already has rising debts. More here: Germany’s stock market has slipped a little in early trading following the factory orders report. The DAX fell almost 0.5%, with investors also digesting BIS’s warning of global turmoil ahead. Germany has got the new week off to a poor start, by reporting that factory orders dipped last month. Industrial orders at the eurozone powerhouse economy fell by 0.1% month-on-month, adding to a 0.2% slide in December (revised up from -0.7%). Significantly, the fall was partly due to weaker demand from within Germany - suggesting that its economic growth may be stumbling. The Economy Ministry reports that domestic orders fell by 1.6% during the month, quite a hefty drop. And Germany manufacturers were also heavily reliant on other members of the single currency for export sales, as it felt the impact of slowing emerging markets. Sales to other eurozone members leapt by 7.5%, while exports to non-eurozone countries slid by 2.7%. That meant that overall export orders rose by 1%. Reaction to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The new week begins with a serious warning from the Bank for International Settlements that the global markets could be heading into new turbulence. In its latest quarterly report, BIS has warned that that global credit boom could be on the point of unraveling. The “uneasy calm” that has settled on the markets in recent weeks could be about to burst. BIS, known as the central bankers’ central bank, is worried that policymakers are now short of ammunition, at a time when the global economy looks fragile. It reckons that the credit cycle could have reached a turning point, with as the amount of debt being issued by emerging economies stalled in the last quarter. Claudio Borio, BIS’s chief economist, warns: “We may not be seeing isolated bolts from the blue, but the signs of a gathering storm that has been building for a long time.” BIS has been waving a red flag for years, saying the global economy has been piling up too much debt, rather than tackling the underlying problems of weak productivity and unreformed economic systems. BIS also fired a warning shot towards negative interest rates. It fears that the new fashion will backfire - potentially making commercial banks unprofitable,. It cautioned: “The viability of banks’ business model as financial intermediaries may be brought into question.” A timely warning, as the European Central Bank could impose deeper negative interest rates at Thursday’s monetary policy committee meeting. The report is online here. And here’s our full story on BIS’s concerns: Also coming up today: Eurozone finance ministers will be holding a regular eurogroup meeting in Brussels this afternoon. They’ll be considering Greece’s bailout, and the deadlock between Athens and its creditors. There’s not much in the economic calendar, but we do get the latest Sentix investor confidence report at 9.30am GMT."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/feb/28/brexit-labour-criticised-for-voting-with-tories-in-lords-against-single-market-amendment-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-28T17:22:43Z","webTitle":"David Davis tells cabinet to prepare for 'unlikely' possibility of UK not getting Brexit deal – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/feb/28/brexit-labour-criticised-for-voting-with-tories-in-lords-against-single-market-amendment-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/feb/28/brexit-labour-criticised-for-voting-with-tories-in-lords-against-single-market-amendment-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"David Davis tells cabinet to prepare for 'unlikely' possibility of UK not getting Brexit deal – as it happened","bodyText":"Boris Johnson had said he is fed up with people “droning and moaning” about the risks of Brexit, saying that he felt like telling those raising concerns such as Sir John Major to “Come off it, sunshine”. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has told cabinet ministers to prepare for the “unlikely” possibility that the UK will not be able to agree a Brexit agreement with the EU. (See 2.26pm.) Ukip has descended into an open battle over its future direction after the former leader, Nigel Farage, called the party’s sole MP, Douglas Carswell, a “Tory party posh boy” who was afraid of talking about immigration and should be expelled. A senior Nissan executive has said the company may “adjust” its business in the UK, depending on the outcome of Brexit. (See 2.43pm.) The prison officers’ union is “set for unlawful strike action” in already volatile jails across England and Wales, the justice minister, Sam Gyimah, has told MPs. Nuclear power stations would be forced to shut down if a new measures are not in place when Britain quits a European atomic power treaty in 2019, an expert has warned. A Treasury minister has denied reports the government is considering a “death tax” to help fund social care. Speaking during Treasury questions in the Commons, Jane Ellison said “no” to Labour former health secretary Andy Burnham when he asked whether the Tories were pursuing a similar scheme to that mooted by Labour ahead of the 2010 general election. Burnham’s question was prompted by a report in today’s Times. (See 12.15pm.) Government departments have been told to outline potential spending cuts of up to 6% with the aim of saving up to £3.5bn by 2020. A group of influential MPs has demanded “immediate reassurance” from a senior child protection officer after he suggested only paedophiles who pose a physical risk to children should face a criminal sentence. Peers have defeated the government in a bid to stem the tide of pub closures. As the Press Association reports, the House of Lords backed by 278 votes to 188, a majority of 90, a move to require planning permission to be sought for a change of use or demolition of premises. Supporters of the amendment said this would enable local people to give their view on any proposed changes as part of the planning process. The vote to remove so-called permitted development rights from pubs came during the report stage of the neighbourhood planning bill. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has been accused of sexism after advising a female Labour MP against becoming “hysterical” over Brexit-related business concerns. As the Press Association reports, Labour’s Mary Creagh warned 100,000 UK businesses have registered companies in the Republic of Ireland to “hedge their bets” given the “uncertainty” caused by the Brexit vote. Hammond was heckled by opposition MPs after urging Creagh “not to be hysterical”. Raising a point of order, Creagh told Speaker John Bercow: In response to my recent Treasury question, the chancellor of the exchequer accused me of being hysterical. Can we have a ruling from you as to whether this sort of sexist language used to diminish women who make a perfectly reasonable point - that is the sort of language that would not be used had I been man. My question on the registration of companies in Ireland had nothing to do with the condition of my womb travelling to my head, as is the traditional hysterics rhetoric. I expect that sort of language from the sketch writers of the Daily Mail, not from the chancellor of the exchequer. Hammond replied: I did not, of course, accuse [Creagh] of being hysterical - I urged her not to be hysterical. If my comments have caused [Creagh] any offence, I of course withdraw them unreservedly. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Pensioners who have emigrated to Spain, France and elsewhere in Europe are saving the UK about £450m a year in health care costs, a senior official at the department of health has revealed. Paul MacNaught told the health select committee that the 190,000 British pensions living in Europe, mainly in Spain, France, Ireland and Cyprus, cost an average of £2,300 a year to the UK in payments to local health providers. This compares to the £4,500 average annual cost of supporting a pensioner in Britain. “This is one of the advantages of the current arrangements,” said MacNaught. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, told a press gallery lunch today there was “no prospect” of Labour winning unless things improve. The loss in Copeland was really serious. I don’t think some of the reasons put forward are compelling. I’m very straightforward that if things don’t improve there is no prospect of us winning a general election. It is a very bad result for the Labour party and we need to be honest about that. A number of things came up, including the direction of travel of the Labour party, Labour’s ability to communicate and understand what people are saying to them and, of course, the leadership of the Labour Party and we all know that. Six in 10 doctors from Europe working in the UK are considering leaving the country because of Brexit, a new survey by the General Medical Council has found. Charlie Massey the chief executive of the GMC told MPs that while a survey was “not necessarily predictive of future behaviour” the results indicated a potential serious depletion in the workforce. “It does send a worrying signal in terms of the stock of doctors currently working in the UK,” he said. Some 2,000 doctors from the European Economic Area, about 10% of the total working in the UK, responded to the GMC survey, Massey told the Health select committee. Department of Health has revealed that the UK forks out about £650m to EU countries to compensate their respective health services for Britons abroad. The vast bulk of that goes on 190,000 British pensioners in Europe, Paul MacNaught, the DoH’s director of EU, international and prevention programmes has just told the Health select committee. Of those, 70,000 live in Spain, 44,000 in Ireland, 43,000 in France and 12,000 in Cyprus. McNaught told the committee the UK collects just £55m from European countries for Europeans treated in Europe with estimates that it could be theoretically due about £200m. Sir John Major, the former prime minister, did not mention Boris Johnson when he gave his speech, “Britain and Europe - a reality check” yesterday, and Johnson was equally elliptical when he gave what will be remembered as “the pineapple speech” (see 12.50pm), but what both men were saying can only be understood with reference to the other. Major’s argument was that the government has been far too optimistic about Brexit and that it has failed to warn the public about the potential problems. He did not identify any culprits by name, but he and the foreign secretary have previous (see 1.54pm) and he clearly had Johnson in mind in passages like this. I have watched with growing concern as the British people have been led to expect a future that seems to be unreal and over-optimistic. Obstacles are brushed aside as of no consequence, whilst opportunities are inflated beyond any reasonable expectation of delivery. Johnson responded today quite bluntly: “Come off it, sunshine.” (See 1.54pm.) There were no substantial announcements in Johnson’s speech but, as often happens, a story emerged in the Q&amp;A. The government has been criticised for asserting that it will be able to strike a free trade deal with the EU within two years. “Britain’s partners think that is bonkers,” Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, said in an insightful report published recently about the problems the UK will face getting a Brexit deal. Grant went on: The fact that [Theresa] May proclaimed that everything could be done in two years makes Britain’s partners worry that 10 Downing Street is not fully in touch with reality. Today Johnson seemed to concede that people like Grant have a point. He accepted that May’s timetable might slip. (See 1.30pm.) But that was about the only concession in the speech to Majorite reality. In most other respects, Johnson defaulted to heady optimism and did not say anything about the potential difficulties Brexit would pose. Earlier in the day (see 11.55am) George Osborne said that the government would soon have to take decisions about how much immigration to allow after Brexit, or how many foreign students would still be admitted. Did Johnson have anything to say about this? No. Or what obstacles exporters might face outside the customs union? Or how the City will manage without passporting? Or what will happen to the border with Ireland, or to EU nationals living in the UK? In his speech last night Major said: Negotiations are all about “give” and “take”. We know what the Brexiteers wish to take: yet we hear nothing about what our country may have to give in return. If anyone genuinely believes that Europe will concede all we wish for – and exact no price for doing so – then they are extraordinarily naïve. But Johnson refused to acknowledge that there might be any downsides at all. The omission of any discussion of the price the UK might have to pay to leave was particularly glaring. In his speech Major said the demand for €60bn may be unreasonable, but he accepted that Britain might have to pay something. “There are liabilities to be met: pension costs, legacy costs, contingent liabilities, a proportional share of work-in-progress,” he said. Ministers have done nothing to prepare the public for this possibility, and Johnson did not start today. Instead, Johnson just kept going on about the “fantastic” trade deal that Britain would be able to strike, but even here he adopted a tone that would alarm Major. Johnson could not resist returning to his point about how the Italians would keep wanting to sell us prosecco after Brexit - and rolling out the old joke, “we’re pro-secco and by no means anti-pasto” - even though in the past this has offended the Italians and caused a mini diplomatic row. “Smugness and bravura should be avoided,” said Grant in his CER report, giving advice on how British ministers should conduct themselves in the negotiations. Major said something similar in his speech, arguing: “A little more charm, and a lot less cheap rhetoric, would do much to protect the UK’s interests.” Major’s key complaint was that government ministers are being too glib about Brexit. Johnson’s speech seemed to confirm he had a point. Nissan may “adjust” its business in the UK, dependent on the outcome of Brexit, a senior executive has told MPs. As the Press Association reports, the car manufacturer announced in October that it was investing in production of new Qashqai and X-Trail models at Sunderland after receiving government assurances that EU withdrawal would not affect the plant’s competitiveness. But chief executive Carlos Ghosn later said the company would “re-evaluate the situation” once the final deal is concluded. And senior vice-president Colin Lawther told MPs this morning that Nissan would “constantly review” its decision in the light of any material changes to its ability to trade with the remaining EU. Giving evidence to the Commons international trade committee, Lawther said that Nissan’s preferred outcome from Brexit negotiations was for Britain’s relations with the EU to “stay as they are”. In talks with the government, Nissan made “a strong request” for Britain to remain within the European Customs Union, said Lawther, who warned that a move to World Trade Organisation tariffs would “change the business circumstances” for the company. Theresa May all but ruled out full membership of the customs union in the Lancaster House speech setting out her goals for Brexit last month. And speculation that the UK may have to fall back on WTO rules was heightened by her declaration that “no deal is better than a bad deal”. Lawther told the committee that a move to WTO tariffs would change the business environment for Nissan’s UK operations, adding: We would have to look at the degrees of change and adjust our business to take into account whatever this new trading platform would be ... As ... circumstances change, and we wouldn’t wait until the end of the process, we will continually review the decisions that we take, based on anything that materially changes. So at the moment we have got a set of circumstances we are happy with and we will honour that decision going forward. But if anything materially changes, we would review constantly. Asked about the assurances the government gave last year to help persuade the company go ahead with its Nissan investment, Lawther said: The government gave us assurances that it was the government’s intention that they would have a competitive trading environment at the end of the process. I would expect that competitive trading environment be something that doesn’t detriment our business. Ghosn’s suggestion that there could be “compensation” for car firms related to “compensatory measures, tax measures, infrastructure measures or competitiveness measures”, Lawther said. This could involve measures such as lower corporation tax, duty-free movement of parts coming into and out of the customs union or a sector-specific deal for the automotive industry, he suggested. At cabinet this morning ministers were told to prepare for the “unlikely” possibility that the UK will not be able to agree a Brexit agreement with the EU. This is from the Press Association’s report of the Number 10 lobby briefing. A Downing Street spokesman said that Theresa May told senior ministers at the cabinet meeting that Britain was looking for a “smooth and orderly” Brexit. “The message was that we are not going to fail, we are going to make a success of it,” said the spokesman. “It is going to be difficult but our optimistic view is important.” David Davis, the Brexit secretary, told cabinet that the government “is tackling what is its most important peacetime agreement” and it was “important that departments understand the challenges ahead”, said the spokesman. “He set out the need for the government to support a smooth exit from the EU and the need to prepare not just for a negotiated settlement but for the unlikely scenario in which no mutually satisfactory agreement can be reached.” The spokesman said that Davis’s Department for Exiting the EU was “still building its capabilities” nine months after its creation and would continue to build its capabilities during the negotiation process. The government will be trying to negotiate two agreements with the EU over the next two years: one covering the terms of withdrawal (what happens to shared assets and liabilities etc), and another covering the UK’s future relationship with the EU (ie, a free trade deal). May wants to negotiate both at the same time, and conclude both within two years, although most observers think that the free trade deal will take much longer to agree. But Davis’s comments suggest the government is making contingency plans for no deal of any kind being reached. That would result in the UK crashing out without any agreement as to a future relationship, and presumably both sides heading for the international court of justice in the hope of settling any disputes about money. In his speech Boris Johnson did not directly mention the speech from Sir John Major yesterday accusing the government of being overly-optimistic about Brexit. But his opening remarks were clearly aimed at the former prime minister. Johnson said: It is absolutely fantastic to be here in front of an audience of people who [are] dynamic, energetic, can-do and actually get out there and sell things. Because sometimes I get a bit impatient when I hear people droning and moaning about the state of state of the world. And I hear them warn that the sky is about to fall on our heads ... And I feel like saying, ‘Come off it, sunshine.’ Every generation hears its prognostications of gloom. And look at us today. We are living longer than ever before. We are healthier than ever before ... It is worth recalling that Major and Johnson have form. As a Telegraph journalist, in Brussels and later in London, Johnson to a large extent made his name as a commentator attacking Major’s government from a Eurosceptic perspective. In retaliation Major tried (unsuccessfully) to stop Johnson being included on the Conservative party’s candidates list, the first step towards becoming an MP. This is what Boris Johnson said about how getting a trade deal with the EU could take more than two years. All the key figures in Brussels, and almost all trade policy experts, say that this is the case, although Theresa May and her ministers are saying they want to conclude a trade deal within two years and that this timetable is realistic. Responding to someone who said that getting a deal might take longer than two years, Johnson said: Time is [an issue.] You’re right. It depends how our friends and partners choose to handle it. They can play it long, they have electoral considerations, as everybody knows. I think there’s every reason why we [should] go this full tilt and get it done within two years. But let’s see how it goes. Q: George Osborne said Brexit would be the biggest act of protectionism in the UK. Shouldn’t you be honest and tell businesses that some will prosper from Brexit and some won’t? Johnson says he does not think Osborne said that. But if he did, he would be wrong. (The questioner did misrepresent Osborne. See 11.51am for the full quote.) Q: John Major says the tone of trade deals is sour and that we need to show more charm. Do you agree? And do you accept it is not defeatist to raise concerns? Johnson says he wants to be positive about this. He says when he first became foreign secretary, people in other countries were in shock. They had not expected Brexit. But now that mood has vanished. They want a good deal, he says. He says there always will be a role for the UK in Europe. He says Britain is still going to be there, contributing to Europe economically, in security terms and in aid terms. People are starting to get that, he says. He says people are staring to understand that you can have a strong EU and a strong UK. Johnson says Liam Fox and his team cannot “ink in” trade deals with other countries now. But they can agree them in pencil. Johnson is now taking questions - two from business, and two from the press. Q: The EU will want the UK to keep its law in line with EU law if the UK is to have single market access? Can we get a free trade deal in two years? And what happens if that is not achieved? Johnson says we have an unrivalled opportunity. We are already “flush” with the EU in terms of standards. So we should be able to do a fantastic deal. He says the questioner is right to say timing is an issue. He says EU countries could “play it long”. But he thinks there is every reason to believe is can be done in two years. Johnson acknowledges that agreeing a trade deal with the EU could take longer than two years. But he says there is a of goodwill. That goodwill is growing, he says. Johnson says Britain is at its best when it is at its most global. It has been overwhelming as foreign secretary to find that the country has friends around the world, he says. He says of course the UK remains committed to its EU markets. But it wants to be a global force too, he says. Johnson says we are getting “the export ball back over the net”. He says we have a trade surplus with South Korea. He repeats a line he has used many times before about how we export boomerangs to Australia etc ... “and, I’m pleased to say, Nigel Farage to America.”. Johnson says Britain is the most global of the major economies. He says 6m Britons - one in 10 of the population - live and work abroad. He is not sure why, but that is the case. He lists various jobs they do, adding that perhaps “the odd pirate and scoundrel” are among them too. That means Britain has a strong global presence, he says. That global quality of the UK is a fantastic benefit, he says. He says when he visited a school in Pakistan, he asked the pupils who their favourite author was. And they said JK Rowling. That is good for publishing in the UK. And it means more lunches for publishers in Soho, he says. Johnson says a global Britain approach is right for Britain. As other countries become more prosperous, they will buy more of our goods, he says. He says it is right to spend 0.7% of national wealth on aid. He says witnessing aid spending on education for girls in Pakistan has been one of the most moving things he has seen as foreign secretary. Johnson says the UK wants to get a fantastic free trade deal. And you know the arguments why that can be achieved, he says. EU nations are net exporters of goods to the UK, he says. He repeats his assertion about how the Italians will want to keep trading with the UK so they can sell us their prosecco . Johnson says for the last 44 years the UK has contracted out its trade policy to the European commission. It is an excellent body, he says. But only 3% of the staff are British. How can those bodies understand the needs of UK business and commerce with so few Britons employed? Johnson says in 1990 37% of humanity lived in absolute poverty. Today that figure is less than 10%, even though the population has grown by 1.8bn. He says Britain is preparing to be the lead campaigner for free trade. And the UK can be a great free trading nation outside the EU, he says. He says the government will use Brexit to create a regulatory environment of the kind the BCC has been crying out for for decades. Johnson says if we close our markets, and put up barriers, we raise costs for those who can least afford it. We stiffle innovation, he says. He says when goods and services no longer cross borders, troops and tanks do so instead. Johnson says trade is declining as a proportion of global GDP. We are seeing a series of events where populations are supposed to be rebelling. People feel they are not getting a fair “suck of the sauce bottle”, as they say in Australia. Johnsons says, in response, some politicians want to pull up the drawbridge. But that would be the wrong approach. He says the company that brings pineapples to the UK is the biggest employer in Ghana. Johnson says people are living longer than ever before. And life is better before. He asks the audience to remember when pineapples were rare, and came in gloopy syrup in tins. Today there is a force that brings pineapples to London every night. The pineapples come from Ghana. He has been on this flight himself, sitting on top of chilled fruit. What is the benign force that allow this? It is globalisation, he says. Today globalisation is acquiring negative connotations. But he wants to show that it is a force for good. Boris Johnson is speaking now at the BCC conference. He says it is great to be speaking to people who are dynamic. Because sometimes he gets impatient listening to people moaning about the state of the world, or saying the sky is going to fall on our heads. In other Ukip- related news, Arron Banks, the Farage ally and erstwhile Ukip donor, has suggested that he might stand against the Ukip MP Douglas Carswell at the general election, the BBC reports. Could Banks be disciplined for this? Last week Paul Nuttall, the Ukip leader, said he could not take action against Banks because is is no longer a party member. According to the party, Bank thought he was a member but had forgotten to renew his subscription. The party says he is free to rejoin if he wants. Here is my colleague Peter Walker’s story on the latest Ukip shenanigans. My colleague Peter Walker was at the Farage/Paterson press conference on fish. Nigel Farage was apparently keeping a low profile. But Farage did eventually take questions. In her Times column today (paywall) Rachel Sylvester says the Conservatives are considering some form of levy on estates to help fund social care. Andy Burnham floated this idea when he was health secretary before the 2010 general election, but the Tories labelled it a “death tax” and their slogan was so effective that it killed all interest in the idea from policy makers for more than half a decade. According to Sylvester, some Conservatives now think this was a mistake. Here is an extract from her column. Now I am told that the Conservatives are considering returning to this explosive territory by examining how the assets of older people can be claimed by the state after their death to help pay for social care. After months of wrangling, Theresa May and Philip Hammond have agreed that something needs to be done to deal with a crisis in provision for the elderly that is causing chaos in the NHS as well as anxiety for families. The chancellor will announce in the budget next week that there will be extra money to relieve pressure on councils who are struggling to cope with rising demand. What is more interesting, however, is that the government is considering longer term reform that goes far beyond what both the Treasury and Downing Street see as the “sticking plaster” solution of a short-term injection of cash. The debate around the cabinet table has moved away from the need to raise resources and on to the balance between the taxation of wealth and work. One cabinet minister told me: “There is an issue about inheritance. Should someone be able to pass their house on to their children without paying the cost of care or can you get access to some of that money?” The chancellor is among those who are convinced that those who can afford to make a contribution should pay ... Ministers are also discussing the idea of introducing a compulsory social care levy on estates over a certain value. Many senior Tories admit, privately, that it was a mistake to denounce Labour’s scheme as a “death tax”. They are now paying the price for playing politics with such a serious issue. The levy would in effect be a retrospective insurance premium. Although there would be a cost to families, nobody would have to manage catastrophic care costs on their own and everyone could keep most of their inheritance. Andy Burnham has tweeted this about the revelation. And the Lib Dems have accused the Conservatives of hypocrisy. This is from the Lib Dem health spokesman Norman Lamb. This is sheer hypocrisy from Philip Hammond. He used to call Labour’s ‘death tax’ plans shocking but now seems prepared to implement them. The Conservatives chose to cut inheritance tax for the wealthiest and opted for a hard Brexit that will blow a £100bn hole in the budget. Now our health and care services face paying the price and the chancellor is desperate for answers. The Liberal Democrats will make the case for bold, long-term solutions to the crisis facing the NHS and care, and an end to cheap political point-scoring that has failed people for too long. John McDonnell’s speech was well received by the BCC audience but it was a relatively routine restatement of some of Labour’s current economic thinking. In story terms, what George Osborne, the Conservative former chancellor, had to say in the panel discussion was probably more significant. Here are the key points. Osborne said that leaving the EU without a trade deal would amount to the biggest single act of protectionism” in UK history. And he mocked the idea championed by some pro-leave campaigners that new trade deals with other countries could compensate for not having good, tariff-free access to the EU. Let’s make sure that we go on doing trade with our biggest export market. Otherwise withdrawing from the single market will be the biggest single act of protectionism in the history of the United Kingdom. And no amount of trade deals with New Zealand are going to replace that we do at the moment with our big European neighbours. He said the government should continue to allow skilled workers and students from abroad easy access to the UK. Now we need to have the debate about immigration, where I think it’s important we have access to skilled immigration from around the world, and that we’re a magnet for talent. I think it’s important for our universities to continue to attract students from around the world - indeed the government boasts that one in seven world leaders were educated in Britain at some point. Great, let’s make sure that continues to be the case. He said that the government had failed to spell out key aspects of its policy on industry and immigration. He said that this was understandable, given the difficulty of the problems the government faces, but his comments cast doubt on the value of the industrial strategy white paper published by the government recently. You can produce any numbers of white papers on your industrial strategy, but unless you have answered the question ‘are you going to allow, in a way that is not currently allowed, the government to step in and provide support for an industry that has failed, which is not allowed because of state aid rules’ - if you can’t answer that question you haven’t really gone into the meat of an industrial strategy. You can have a business policy, but unless you tell the business audience the kinds of people you are going to be able to recruit and the kinds of people you are not going to be able to recruit, there is a big missing part to it. I’m not surprised all these questions haven’t been answered because they are very big questions and I’m not blaming the government because these are big issues which the British government has not had to think about for a long time. He said he believed that the government could get “positive answers” on issues like trade and immigration in its Brexit settlement. But he urged business groups like the BCC to lobby the government to press for their desired outcome. McDonnell has now finished. He says that he would like to have taken questions, but that he has to get back to the Commons for Treasury questions. McDonnell turns to business rates. Here is the extract from his speech on this released in advance. The revaluation of business rates due on 1 April has quite rightly caused uproar. Whilst few would disagree that a revaluation is long overdue, it has been handled atrociously. It was delayed not for the best economic reasons, but for the best interests of the Tories ahead of a general election. It cannot be allowed to continue this way. And it also cannot be right that whilst the average small shop will be hit by an extra £3,663 in their business rates over the next five years, some large retailers and online retailers will see a substantial fall. The revaluation doesn’t reflect how our economy has changed since the last one. And nor does it take account of the particular cost pressures smaller businesses are now under. Labour have responded to fears about the impact of looming business rate hikes for some businesses by calling on the government to set up an emergency transitional relief fund and take a series of measures to ease the business rate burden for business. Yesterday, we hosted an urgent meeting with leading business organisations, including representatives from the Chamber of Commerce, to discuss a radical shakeup of business rates in the longer term. We believe that government action now is vital to reduce the impact on smaller businesses, and move towards making the local business taxation system fairer and closer to the real economy. We’ve called for a £150m a year for three years transitional relief fund to be established, available to local authorities to distribute to businesses facing a “cliff edge” in their rates bills. We want the shift from RPI to CPI uprating in rates to be brought forward three years. We think, like yourselves, that this would soften the immediate blow to businesses. But looking ahead, we think it is essential that plant and machinery are removed from the business rates system. It cannot be right that companies seeking to do the right thing, and investing for the future, are then penalised for doing so. This is the exact opposite of how the tax system is supposed to function, and clearly out of line with best practice elsewhere. For a country facing the productivity slump that Britain is now experiencing, additional taxation on investment like this cannot be justified. Alongside more regular revaluations, removing periodic and unmanageable hikes, Labour is calling for a fundamental overhaul of the business rates system. I am calling on the chancellor today to provide real and genuine support for those business struggling next week. McDonnell says government should address the regional disparities in investment. Labour would put in place legal rules relating to regional capital spending per head. It would commit the investment needed to build a Crossrail for the north, he says. It would set up a national investment bank, backed up by regional investment banks. McDonnell says it is unacceptable to put EU nationals living in the UK in the position where they do not know their rights will be assured. He says, even as a bargaining position, this is not convincing. The government should resolve this now, he says, and guarantee that EU nationals can stay. On Brexit, McDonnell says Labour accepts the decision to leave. But it is important to get a good deal, he says. He says the government is wrong to say no deal is better than a bad deal. No deal is a bad deal, he says. McDonnell says there needs to be a change in direction. Too often governments have focused on short-term gains. That has led to investment being neglected. He says research spending by the government has fallen by £1bn in real terms. There has been a belief that governments cannot help business. As a result, productivity lags far behind other country. It takes a British worker five days to achieve what a German worker can do in four days, he says. To turn this around will require government to take a lead. McDonnell says we are meeting at a time of upheaval. The vote to leave the EU has created fundamental challenges for us all, he says. He says he agrees with George Osborne. Businesses are a critical part of that national conversation. It is important that business’s voice is heard in the Brexit talks, he says. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is giving his speech now. He starts by thanking the BCC for its advice. He says he has to be back in the Commons for Treasury questions at 11.30. George Osborne is addressing those questions now. He starts by talking about devolution. The whole idea of having a mayor for Greater Manchester or the West Midlands is to give these areas a presence on the world stage. On immigration, he says the country has answered the question. It wants to leave the EU. And we are leaving, he says. But there are a whole set of other questions people were not asked, like what immigration policy you want and what trade policy. People must decide if they want to carry on having high-skilled immgiration. And carrying on with farming subsidies. And will they follow free market trade policies, or let government intervene to protect industries. He says a lot of the debate is “fighting the last war”. Now we must focus on different issues. He says he wants to continue with skilled immigration, and having foreign students coming to the UK. He says no amount of trade deals with New Zealand will replace trade with the EU. There are answers to these questions, he says. He says he has a message for the BCC. You can produce any number of white papers on industrial strategy. But will a new industrial strategy allow state aid to failing industries. And he says government needs to be able to tell business if they will be able to recruit from abroad. Government has not had to think about these questions before. But it does now, he says. He urges business to make its voice heard. These decisions will be fundamental to the country’s future, he says. Andy Burnham also criticised the current government for being less committed to the north than David Cameron’s government. Here are some tweets from earlier in this panel discussion. At the BCC conference George Osborne, the chancellor, is taking part in a panel discussion. We’ve just had a round of questions, including two aimed at Osborne. Does he think the government’s target of getting net migration below 100,000 is realistic? And what did he think of Sir John Major’s speech? Osborne will reply shortly. I’ve come to the QE2 centre at Westminster for the BBC conference to cover the speeches from John McDonnell and Boris Johnson coming later this morning. While I’ve been setting up, my colleague Peter Walker has been at the Nigel Farage press conference. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, is holding a press conference in Westminster at 10.30am. It is supposed to be about fish, and he is appearing with Owen Paterson, the Conservative former environment secretary. But, given that Farage has written an article in today’s Telegraph saying that Douglas Carswell, Ukip’s only MP, should be thrown out of the party, the questions are unlikely to focus on haddock quotas. The Telegraph has also got a good story today about emails exchanged between Carswell and Lord Pearson, a Ukip peer who was lobbying for Farage to get a knighthood last night. Pearson asked Carswell to intervene with Gavin Williamson, the Conservative chief whip, but the emails suggest Carswell did not push Farage’s case particularly hard. Here’s an extract from the story. Lord Pearson asked Mr Carswell in the middle of December to approach Mr Williamson believing this offered “a sporting chance of getting around this committee”. On December 30th Lord Pearson emailed Mr Carswell saying: “Dear Douglas, Could you let me know how your talk with Gavin Williamson went before Christmas? By phone if you prefer? Good wishes. Malcolm.” Mr Carswell replied the next morning on December 31 – the day the New Year’s honours were announced – saying: “As promised, I did speak to the government Chief Whip. “Perhaps we might try angling to get Nigel an OBE next time round? For services to headline writers? An MBE, maybe?” Farage told the Telegraph the email exchange showed Carswell was “consumed with jealousy and a desire to hurt me”. But Carswell told the paper: “You cannot regard that email as anything other than being supportive that Ukip gets its fair share of peerages and honours.” Boris Johnson will hit out at those projecting “doom and gloom on Brexit” in his speech to the BBC conference, sources have told the Guardian. They said the foreign secretary would use the event to strike a positive tone about the future. The intervention will be seen as the government’s response to both John Major and Tony Blair, who each railed against the potential negative impact of a hard Brexit. Johnson will claim that countries are lining up to negotiate trade deals with Britain, telling ministers they are keen to strike. Here is the full list of 33 Labour peers who voted with the Lib Dems on the single market amendment last night. (See 9.03pm.) Lady Bakewell Lord Berkeley Lady Blackstone Lord Bragg Lord Cashman Lady Corston Lady Crawley Lord Davies of Stamford Lord Drayson Lord Faulkner of Worcester Lord Foster of Bishop Auckland Lord Foulkes of Cumnock Lord Giddens Lord Hain Viscount Hanworth Lady Howells of St Davids Lady Hughes of Stretford Lord Judd Lady Kennedy of The Shaws Lord Knight of Weymouth Lord Lea of Crondall Lord Liddle Lady Lister of Burtersett Lord Livermore, Lord Mandelson Lord Monks Lord Morgan Lord Pendry Lord Puttnam Lady Quin Lord Triesman Lord Whitty Lord Winston One Conservative peer, Lady Wheatcroft, also voted for the amendment. The full division list, with a breakdown by party, is here. In a speech today on intergenerational fairness Debbie Abrahams, the shadow work and pensions secretary, will challenge the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to commit to keeping the “triple lock” on pensions beyond 2020, as Labour has done. The “triple lock” guarantees that pensions will rise every year in line with earnings, prices or by 2.5%, whichever is highest. She will say: It was shocking to hear the chancellor suggest that he would expose older people to the flawed austerity agenda - further proof that the Tories are abandoning older people. The last Labour government were responsible for a historic reduction in pensioner poverty levels. A record that we remain hugely proud of. The chancellor must use this Budget to provide clarity on the issue of the triple lock, and follow Labour’s lead by committing to the policy beyond 2020. But it is odd that she is making this point in what is being billed as a speech on intergenerational fairness. Most experts think the “triple lock” militates against intergenerational fairness. The Commons work and pensions committee published a report on intergenerational fairness in November last year and it said the “triple lock” should be abandoned after 2020. It argued: The triple lock should not continue beyond 2020. By then, the value of the new state pension relative to average earnings will be close to the historic high for the headline state pension rate. If maintained, the arbitrary boost the triple lock gives to the state pension relative to both earnings and prices will become ever harder to justify both in fiscal terms and from the perspective of intergenerational fairness. We urge political consensus before the next general election on a new earnings link for the state pension. Theresa May is due to trigger article 50 next month and, when she does, that could mark the moment when Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, decides whether or not to go ahead with her proposal to hold a second independence referendum. In an article in the Times today (paywall), she argues that if there is a second referendum, it will be because of May’s “sheer intransigence”. In good faith, the Scottish government published a compromise position, entitled Scotland’s Place in Europe. We accepted, reluctantly, that we would leave the EU, but argued for the UK to stay in the single market or, if that was not possible, for the UK to seek as part of its negotiation an outcome that would allow Scotland to do so — and to agree to a rebalancing of power across the UK to take account of the post Brexit landscape and enable any different decisions that Scotland might want to take. Instead of meeting us halfway, however, the UK government’s approach has been “its way or no way”. It ruled out UK single market membership with no consultation with the devolved administrations. It has talked about special deals for the car industry and others, but refused to countenance any form of differential approach for Scotland ... If an independence referendum does arise, it will not be down to bad faith on the part of the Scottish government, but to sheer intransigence on the part of the UK government Interestingly, Sturgeon also argues that, if there were to be a second referendum, this time unionists would not be able to run a “Project Fear” campaign. One last point. If there is to be a referendum, those of us advocating independence will face tough questions. We will have a duty to make our case. But so, too, will those who oppose independence. Brexit, with all the uncertainties it entails, will make it impossible to present the UK this time as a “safe haven”. And with so many of the promises made by the No side in 2014 already broken, it will be more difficult to get traction for a Project Fear approach. Indeed, ridiculous threats of a hard border and an end to trade with the rest of the UK will ring even more hollow when those making them are at pains to assure Ireland of the opposite. The government has won its first vote on the article 50 bill in the House of Lords. There was a division quite late last night on an amendment tabled by the Labour peer, Peter Hain, saying the prime minister should commit to keeping Britain in the single market before she triggers article 50. Lib Dem peers backed the Hain amendment, but it was opposed by the Conservatives and Labour and was defeated by 299 votes to 136. In the debate Lady Hayter of Kentish Town, the shadow Brexit minister, explained why Labour was not supporting Hain’s move. She said accepting the amendment would mean acting “as if the referendum hadn’t happened” and effectively “asking the prime minister to eat her own words”. She went on: With regard to free movement, we cannot simply airbrush this from the referendum decision. For if we turn round to those who voted out, and we say ‘yes we are out, but actually we are still having everything exactly as it was, we are still having free movement unchanged’, I think that might emit some surprise. But after the vote the Lib Dems criticised Labour for supporting the government on this. Lord Newby, the Lib Dem leader in the Lords, said: By far the best option for our economy is to stay in the single market. Unfortunately Theresa May’s Ggvernment is hell bent on dragging us towards a hard Brexit. Whatever deal May comes back with is quite simply not going to be as good as remaining in the single market. That is why we voted to ask her to think again on this vital issue. It is extremely disappointing that Labour chose not support this amendment despite the costs of a hard Brexit on working people’s jobs and prosperity. Peers do not debate the bill again until tomorrow, but we are likely to hear plenty more on Brexit today. Here is the agenda for the day. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.45am: The British Chambers of Commerce conference opens. At 10.20am there is a panel discussion featuring George Osborne, the former chancellor, Andy Burnham, the Labour candidate for mayor of the Greater Manchester, and Andy Street, the Conservative candidate for mayor of the West Midlands; at 11am John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor speaks; at 11.55am Greg Clark, the business secretary, speaks; and at 12.40pm Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, speaks. 11.30am: Philip Hammond, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons. 1pm: Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, speaks at a press gallery lunch. 2.15pm: Sir Julian King, the European commissioner for security, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee.

Price hikes have already started and will hit hard over the next few years, adding more than $300 a year to the average household gas bill in Melbourne (where 90% of households use gas for multiple purposes) and $100 a year in Sydney and Adelaide. Industry, especially the already struggling manufacturing sector and smaller businesses with high energy use, will also feel the pain. For example a dry-cleaning business using around 500 gigajoules a year could see its gas bills increase by $2,500 a year. Citing research by BIS Shrapnel, the Australian Workers Union has claimed more than 200,000 manufacturing jobs could be lost as a consequence. But in the report, Gas at the crossroads, the Grattan Institute think tank argues the reason for the price rises – Australia’s booming gas export industry – is of great national benefit. It argues the government should not “do” anything about the domestic price hikes, except to make sure the gas market is working effectively. “By 2018 east coast gas, added to growing Western Australian supplies, could create the world’s biggest gas export industry, worth $60bn a year. The economic benefits that will flow as a result represent an opportunity too good to miss,” the report argues, even though “the downside is that domestic gas prices will increase to compete with the higher prices that other countries are prepared to pay for our gas.” The report’s author, the institute’s energy program director Tony Wood, specifically urges the governments to reject the AWU’s proposed solution, backed by the ACTU and major manufacturers including Alcoa and Australian Paper – to reserve a percentage of gas for domestic use. Western Australia already reserves 15% of its gas for the state’s own needs – a policy that has bipartisan support in the west – but Wood argues WA’s own regulator recently found that policy was not required and would “inhibit” the development of more WA gas reserves. The report also rejects the demand from the Australian Industry Group for a “national interest” test before governments approve future big LNG export projects – with the adequacy of domestic supply being one of the tests. Wood insists inadequate supply is not the problem, just increased prices as big LNG projects begin exporting and the domestic price rises to match the international price. It also urges governments to reject a recent plea from the Consumer Utilities Advocacy Council to subsidise households upgrading the energy efficiency of their appliances, saying this should not be the role of government. He argues governments should consider increasing their concessions for “vulnerable” low income households that will struggle to cook and heat their homes as prices rise. Industry minister Ian Macfarlane has argued NSW faces an imminent gas shortage and has advocated a new pipeline from the Northern Territory as part of the solution, as well as an end to state government’s decision-making impasse whether or how to develop controversial coal seam gas reserves. With the Victorian government also extending its moratorium on CSG approvals until after the November state election, the Grattan Institute argues the impasse between the industry and the anti-CSG campaign does need to be urgently resolved. Household price rises will vary dramatically around Australia, the report found. Melbourne, most reliant on natural gas, can expect annual increases of $300 or $400 for high use households. But high use households in Sydney will pay only around $225 a year cost increases, in Adelaide $200 and in Brisbane around $65. The report predicts some households might switch to cheaper electric appliances, but a “dash from gas” is unlikely because of the high upfront costs of replacing appliances before they wear out. It confirms that rising gas prices will be another factor pushing Australia towards continued reliance on high-emitting coal fired power. International gas price rises have been triggered by the reduced use of nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster in Japan, climate change concerns about coal fired power, and tensions between Europe and Russia - a major gas supplier."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/jun/01/nuclear-energy-emr-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-01T07:30:00Z","webTitle":"Is there a UK nuclear power plan B?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/jun/01/nuclear-energy-emr-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/jun/01/nuclear-energy-emr-uk","fields":{"headline":"Is there a UK nuclear power plan B?","bodyText":"Is the government conducting contingency planning for a scenario in which no new nuclear plants are commissioned in the UK in next few years? You would think it is a vital question, given the nation's binding climate change targets, all the old nuclear and coal plants that will close shortly and rising energy bills. New nuclear reactors are essential to solving all these problems, say ministers, yet utilities such as E.on, RWE and SSE have all abandoned their nuclear plans as uninvestable and the sector's cheerleader EDF has put its plans on hold. But the Department for Energy and Climate Change would not tell me if they were developing contingency plans. A Decc spokeswoman said: \"The Carbon Plan and 2050 calculator show a range of possible scenarios for hitting climate change targets and keeping the lights on. We want to see nuclear as part of the mix – but it has to be taken forward in a way that is consistent with government's position on no public subsidy.\" In other words, we don't need new nuclear energy, except we do. Germany has been somewhat more decisive. On the UK's commitment to \"no public subsidy\" for nuclear, if there is anyone outside Decc and EDF who thinks that is credible, I have yet to meet them. I have just seen the full presentation that SSE made to some MPs in March, first reported by my colleague Fiona Harvey. It makes a simple but devastating point. SSE point out that the price of the electricity generated by new nuclear plants will, according to EDF and the UK's Committee on Climate Change (CCC), be cheaper than the current market rate. That surely means it requires no subsidy at all, SSE say, yet the fiendishly complex knot of measures comprising the new energy bill will deliver handsome subsidies to new (and old) nuclear. The main new nuclear subsidy will come via so-called contracts-for-difference (CFDs), which allow utilities to claim a top-up from energy bill payers if the electricity price falls below an agreed \"strike\" price. Ministers argue CFDs are available to all low-carbon technologies, and are therefore not a nuclear subsidy. Keith MacLean, SSE's policy and research director, sees it differently: \"This complex and messy CFD policy looks like an attempt to try to hide the state aid from the European Commission and the subsidy from political opponents of new nuclear. This is the opposite of what consumers need, which is an open and transparent approach where they can clearly see what they are paying and what for.\" Currently, state subsidy for nuclear would contravene EC competition rules. MacLean adds: \"The government should not be trying to find a one-size-fits-all policy to hide the nuclear subsidy, especially one which could be so damaging for renewables.\" And it's not just new nuclear power that is threatening investment in renewable energy, which is the only sustainable option in the long term. \"Renewable energy may be the victim of cheap gas prices if governments do not stick to their renewable support schemes,\" said Fatih Birol, IEA chief economist, on Tuesday. The CCC said the same in March, in response the UK's new dash for gas: \"The approach set out could be compatible with power sector decarbonisation required to meet carbon budgets, but also carries the risk that there will be too much gas-fired generation instead of low-carbon investment.\" EDF chose not to comment on SSE's assertion that either EDF's price predictions are wrong, or they are in line for subsidies they don't deserve. But the Nuclear Industry Association did comment. \"The current power price is volatile and depends on the price of input fossil fuels such as gas and coal,\" said a spokeswoman. True, but we are talking about nuclear energy. \"Low carbon generation - such as nuclear, CCS or offshore wind - has lower operating costs but higher upfront capital costs,\" she continued. \"CFDs will allow developers to model anticipated revenues, enabling them to commit the upfront costs to construct the plant.\" Also true, but Citi analyst Peter Atherton suggests the nuclear strike price may well need to be double or even three times higher than the prices predicted by EDF and the CCC. Again, something does not add up. \"We know [the strike price] has to be value for money and affordable,\" Decc says. \"On price discovery, we want to see competition between technologies over the longer term. This will drive the best deal for consumers. For now, we have to work on a technology specific basis and administratively set prices – based on gathering evidence about costs.\" It's worth reading that last sentence again. What it amounts to is an admission that nuclear plants, after 60 years of development, cannot compete on price in an open market. That is why no nuclear plant has ever been bulit without state support. \"I can only feel sorry for the people at Decc who have to put out this garbage, it can't be fun,\" one expert told me. \"I think we're near the end game now and I will be interested to see whether the government has the nerve to abandon nuclear completely or whether it will force through a couple of reactors to save face.\" What is really extraordinary in all of this is that the rock-solid political orthodoxy of the last 30 years has been that the government industrial policy must not try to pick winners. Yet the political bind that Decc's obsession with nuclear has now created means the government is having to bend over backwards to pick a loser. It is energy consumers, you and me, who will pick up the tab."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2014/nov/21/steven-poole-language-power-disarm-concerned-citizen","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-21T16:30:02Z","webTitle":"Language has the power to disarm the concerned citizen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/21/steven-poole-language-power-disarm-concerned-citizen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/nov/21/steven-poole-language-power-disarm-concerned-citizen","fields":{"headline":"Language has the power to disarm the concerned citizen","bodyText":"Let’s say you want to push through a massive programme of anti-democratic corporate protection over two continents. It might be a good idea to festoon your official explanations with tedious-sounding initialisms, acronyms and euphemistic bromides, and with any luck concerned citizens will fall asleep before realising what is going on under their noses. Consider the case of the US-EU trade deal called TTIP, with its controversial provisions for ISDS (Investor-State Dispute Settlement), and its reassuring talk of removing “barriers” and consulting “stakeholders”. As heroically wakeful perusal of its soporific rhetoric by George Monbiot and others has made clear, this threatens to constitute an enormous transfer of power from public to private hands. TTIP – which authorities cutely invite us to pronounce tea-tip – is short for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. It sounds anodyne enough. (Everyone loves a partnership, right?) Its point is, they say, to remove “barriers” or “obstacles” to trade between the continental blocs. Well, who loves a barrier? Who adores the obstacle? As it happens, the normal kinds of trade “barriers”, ie import and export duties (collectively, “tariffs”), are already very low between the US and EU. So TTIP is focusing on the reduction of “non-tariff barriers”. Well, any kind of barrier is surely still a pesky thing. Things begin to appear more worrisome when a persistent reader realises that most of the “non-tariff barriers” being targeted by TTIP are regulations: those annoying profit-blocking rules erected by governments to stop their citizens being poisoned or killed, or to prevent rampant pollution. TTIP’s boosters say they just want to make regulations more compatible on both sides of the Atlantic, so that a car manufacturer, say, will not have to pass two different expensive procedures, one for the US and one for the EU, that are aimed at ensuring similar safety levels. The term of art here is regulatory “harmonisation” or “coherence” or “cooperation”. Well, excellent. Who is an enemy of harmony? Who shudders at cooperation? Perhaps it depends on who is cooperating with whom. Here is where ISDS comes in. It means that private companies will be allowed to sue national governments for doing things that harm their bottom line. Similar provisions in other treaties have already resulted in Philip Morris suing both Uruguay and Australia for enacting anti-smoking legislation, and a Swedish energy company suing Germany for phasing out nuclear power. ISDS could also help the present government’s fanatical drive to privatise the NHS. The EU, in the minutes of its “Civil Society Dialogue” in June, emphasised that it “does not have a practice of excluding specific economic sectors from ISDS”. Investor-State Dispute Settlement is a triumphantly boring-sounding name for all this. Let us admire the use of “investor”, rather than “speculator” or, I don’t know, “rapacious corporation that artifically headquarters itself in Luxembourg for the purposes of tax avoidance”. And surely no one is against “dispute settlement”, even though such “disputes” would be arbitrated by unaccountable panels of corporate lawyers. We are, though, assured by TTIP negotiators that they are consulting “stakeholders” throughout this process. Originally a “stakeholder” was a person who held the stakes (bets) of gamblers: so the stakeholder was the one purely disinterested party. But now “stakeholders” are all those with a stake in the outcome. Curious, then, to discover that the overwhelming majority of “stakeholders” consulted by both the EU and US TTIP bodies have turned out to be, er, corporations and their lobbyists. TTIP is an excellent idea, say its champions, because it will be a magical GDP bonanza for both economic blocs, at least according to some controversial hand-waving models. In case anyone is worried that jobs might be at risk, the language of the economic models cited is careful to speak not of job losses, still less of job destruction; instead they refer mildly to possible “job displacements”, an ingeniously mealy-mouthed way of saying the same thing. (A cynic might object that it is not the jobs that will be moved, but the people – out of their jobs.) While paying lip service to the idea of public (or at least “relevant stakeholder”) consultation, the architects of TTIP nonetheless intend to keep secret all the documentation of how the eventual agreement is reached – for 30 years. One might be forgiven for concluding from this, and in general from the obfuscatory and often downright misleading bureaucratese in which TTIP’s aims are framed, that they are trying to hide something. However, the official TTIP literature itself relentlessly invokes the modish political virtue of “transparency”. They must mean some kind of perfectly opaque transparency that would surely be of interest to scientists researching new smart materials. Or perhaps, after all, they are just trying to pull some very thick wool over our eyes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2014/dec/09/vladimir-putin-narendra-modi-summit-delhi-russia-india","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-09T16:22:30Z","webTitle":"Putin and Modi have much in common, say aides ahead of summit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/09/vladimir-putin-narendra-modi-summit-delhi-russia-india","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/dec/09/vladimir-putin-narendra-modi-summit-delhi-russia-india","fields":{"headline":"Putin and Modi have much in common, say aides ahead of summit","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, who will arrive in Delhi on Wednesday night, has much in common with Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, according to aides and diplomats from the leaders’ two countries. The two men, both in their early sixties, have met twice – at the July Brics summit in Brazil and at the G20 in Australia last month, where Putin received a chilly reception from western nations angered by Moscow’s intervention in Ukraine. His welcome in a smoggy but unseasonably temperate Delhi for his first summit with Modi will be much warmer. Russia and India have long had a close relationship, even if the two Asian powers have grown distant in recent decades. Officials hope the leaders of each power, one a former spy, the other a former organiser for a hardline rightwing organisation, will be able to develop a close personal bond that will bring the two states back together. “They’ve had two short meetings but they went very well. They understand each other,” said one Delhi-based Indian diplomat present on both occasions. Delhi tilted towards Moscow during the cold war as hostile neighbour Pakistan grew close to the US. The era has left deep traces. In the Hindustan Times, a local newspaper, analyst Sushil Aaron described both states as “instinctively uncomfortable with the west’s dominance of global institutions and its alleged propensity to use narratives of a rules-based international system to suit its interests”. If the Communist party of India is a shadow of its former self, the influence of decades of leftwing activism and centrally planned socialist economic policies remains deep. One result is that although successive US administrations have sought to improve relations with India – President Obama has accepted an invitation to be chief guest at the nation’s Republic Day parade in January – Moscow can still rely on goodwill in Delhi that Washington can only envy. “Ask any child in India who is India’s best friend internationally and they will tell you that it is Russia,” said one Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) official, echoing a comment made by Modi this year. India has strongly opposed EU and US sanctions on Russia over events in Ukraine while Russia has historically backed India’s position on the disputed Himalayan former kingdom of Kashmir. But it’s on the personal level that many believe the coming summit, an annual occasion, will work best. “Modi and Putin get on very well together. Both ... are self-assured and charismatic leaders with a strong nationalist bent, who have a clear vision for their country and keep its best interests at heart,” said Ajai Malhotra, who was Indian ambassador to Russia until last year. Less diplomatic commentators point out that support for both men is rooted in a populist promise to restore the former power and wealth of their respective nations. Both have explicitly said they hope to force their immediate neighbours to respect their local dominance, while domestically both are suspicious of “liberals” and distrust the mainstream media. Modi’s attitude to the west is ambivalent, with reservations on the cultural front but enthusiasm for technology and governance; Putin’s is increasingly hostile all round. The geopolitical context also throws India and Russia together. Senior Russian officials have said they expect sanctions against the country to be in place for years or decades to come, and have reiterated that Moscow will look elsewhere for new allies. “Our goal is to find as many equal partners as possible,” Putin said during his annual state of the nation address last week. He said focus would be put on countries that did not mix economics and politics, with China and India the two most obvious targets. Tatiana Shaumian of the India Studies Centre in Moscow noted defence cooperation, the diamond industry and energy as particular areas of focus for the summit. India, despite recent flagging growth, has a huge need for oil, gas and coal. Russia has done cut-price deals with China and Turkey on crucial energy resources in recent months. Moscow is also involved with India’s civilian nuclear power programme, building reactors in the south. Some analysts are less convinced about the extent of the warmth between the two leaders. C Raja Mohan, a leading Delhi-based foreign policy analyst, said that, though there was a “lot of sentiment”, there were some “big structural issues”. “Both men are nationalists and realists, strong leaders who want to do as much as they can. They need to salvage what they can from this relationship,” he said. Sameer Patil, associate national security fellow at Gateway House thinktank in Mumbai, said trade between the two nations was particularly disappointing – about $10bn annually – and the defence relationship had been troubled by unreliability, defective spare parts and disagreements over the pricing of equipment. Neither have signs that Russia is working to build a closer relationship with Pakistan pleased observers in Delhi, though analysts say there is a recognition that to expect Moscow to ignore Islamabad would be unrealistic. At least on the cultural front, there are signs that the two countries have things in common. While huge quantities of ideological literature were once printed in the USSR and distributed almost free in India, different cultural exchanges have taken their place, the MEA official said. “Now the [Russians] are into Bollywood and yoga, and we welcome them here in Goa.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2016/may/27/markets-us-growth-figures-janet-yellen-putin-greece-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-27T17:54:47Z","webTitle":"Fed chair Yellen hints at summer US rate rise but urges caution – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/may/27/markets-us-growth-figures-janet-yellen-putin-greece-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2016/may/27/markets-us-growth-figures-janet-yellen-putin-greece-live","fields":{"headline":"Fed chair Yellen hints at summer US rate rise but urges caution – as it happened","bodyText":"So there you have it and the traders from New York can now go off to the Hamptons. While not specifically mentioning a June rise, she did say it would probably be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to gradually raise rates in the coming months. But she urged caution and warned of hiking rates too steeply. As a consequence the dollar has moved higher. On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for your comments, and we’ll be back next week. And now the key question. She is told that a New York money brokers are delaying their weekend trip to the Hamptons to see if she says anything market moving. So here is her chance to move markets (laughter) so can she say anything about the path of monetary policy? Yellen: The economy is continuing to improve, we saw weak growth in first quarter of year. It looks to be picking up from data we monitor... We will monitor incoming data and risks. It’s appropriate for the Fed to gradually and cautiously increase our overnight interest rate over time. In coming months such a move would be appropriate. On negative interest rates, we considered it briefly. There could be a number of negative repercussions so we didn’t pursue it and it’s not something we are thinking about now. But other countries are using it. So we have to be cautious. If we were to raise interest rates too quickly and we trigger a downturn we have limited scope to respond. We should be cautious about raising rates too steeply. On the economy, she says it has been a slow recovery but we have made a great deal of progress. We have created 14m new jobs since lowest point for employment. We’ve made a lot of progress. That said, further gains are possible, we’ve not seen much improvement in wage growth. But the growth of output has been remarkably slow. We have a lot of jobs being created in the face of not much output, so that means productivity growth is quite slow. With respect to inflation, it has been running below the Fed’s 2% objective for a number of years. There are a number of reasons, the plunge in oil price, a marked depreciation of the dollar pushing down import prices. These seem to have stablised, and if we continue to see stability, inflationwill move over next couple of years to near target. Yellen says they are trying to be better at spotting financial instabilities, and they have a better process for doing that. Yellen is praising her predecessor Ben Bernanke for being brave during the financial crisis, but she admits they did not see the crisis coming. Bloomberg has a better feed here. Janet Yellen is now on stage at the Radcliffe Institute where the chair of the Federal Reserve is being given the Radcliffe Medal, “presented annually to an individual who has had a transformative impact on society.” Of course the big interest is what - if anything -she might say about a June rate hike, given the suggestions from a number of Fed members in recent days that such a move may be on the cards. At the moment she is being asked about her background and general comments about economics. A link to the discussion (albeit a bit sporadic) is here. The Russian president Vladimir Putin was quick to stamp the tone on his two-day visit as he begun talks with the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras, reports Helena Smith: “In Moscow and St Petersburg we have discussed our prospects of economic collaboration in detail. Of course there are many problems and times are difficult but for sure there are good prospects,” said Putin. “We have to transform the good relations of [our] two peoples into tangible economic results.” Greece and Russia, fellow Orthodox states, with a common heritage that goes back to Byzantium have hailed 2016 to be a “year of Greek-Russian friendship.” Putin, who is travelling with nine ministers, is expected to sign an array of agreements with Athens’ leftist-led government. Energy and tourism are expected to be high on the agenda. Tourist-dependent Greece is hungry for Russian holiday makers and industry figures have complained bitterly about the slow pace with which visas have been made available to them by the Greek state machinery - not least diplomatic services in Russia itself. Athens’ governing left wing Syriza party has spoken stridently about the need to create a “multi-faceted” foreign policy - one which will see the country furthering relations with China, Russia, Iran and Latin America. “We are trying to open up what used to be a very narrow western looking diplomatic attidude,” the country’s culture minister Aristides Baltas, a leading Syriza ideologue, told me. “We want to remain in Europe but not in the sense of being the obedient servants of the west,” he said, adding that Greece, as an EU member state, had been obliged to follow the embargo against Russia even if didn’t agree with it. Back in Greece and words of welcome for president Putin from the country’s prime minister: As for Putin himself: There’s no disguising the fact it was a pretty quiet day all round on European stock markets as the week drifted to a close. With investors unwilling to commit themselves ahead of comments from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen later - albeit there is little expectation of any real hints on interest rates - there was little to disturb the horses. Even the upward revision to US first quarter GDP passed without much impact. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up just 5.14 points or 0.08% at 6270.79 Germany’s Dax was virtually unchanged, edging up 0.13% to 10,286.31 France’s Cac closed 0.05% ahead at 4514.74 Italy’s FTSE MIB dipped 0.17% to 18,186.14 Spain’s Ibex ended up 0.31% at 9107.3 In Greece, the Athens market fell 1.33% to 636.83 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 34 points or 0.19%. In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority said it was investigating the £1.4bn takeover of Argos owner Home Retail by supermarket group Sainsbury. It said it would be looking at whether the deal would hurt competition in the UK, and it would announce its decision by 25 July. Back with the US GDP figures, and we could be looking at a weak figure for the second quarter according to Markit: And here’s Russian president Putin arriving in Greece: American consumers are more confident in May than they were in April, but the latest survey has still come in lower than analysts had been forecasting. The University of Michigan’s final index of consumer sentiment for May was up from 89 in April to 94.7. But this was lower that the preliminary estimate of 95.8 and below the consensus of 95.4. Meanwhile in Greece: (See our preview earlier) Investors are keeping their powder dry ahead of the remarks later from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, with the latest GDP revisions doing little to lift the mood. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 28 points or 0.16% while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.12% and Nasdaq just 0.09%. And here’s how the US slowdown looks: A US interest rate rise in the next two months is unnecessary, given the uncertainty over the country’s economy evidenced by the revised first quarter GDP figures, suggest the CEBR. It said: We still expect the remaining three quarters of 2016 to make up for the first quarter slowdown. Despite the seasonal adjustment process, first quarter GDP data are often unreliable and overly gloomy due to seasonal factors such as winter weather. Our view is also supported by consistently strong job creation figures and a rebound in consumer confidence. Consumer sentiment saw an uptick in May due to a strong labour market showing and expectations that both inflation and interest rates would remain low. However, the chances that interest rates will remain lower for longer are slimmer now than they were earlier this month...The minutes from the [latest Federal Open Markets Committee] meeting, and statements made by Federal Reserve officials since, indicate that some FOMC members believe that the US labour market is at full employment and that this may start putting upward pressure on inflation. Another, less official, consideration may be the US presidential election taking place in November. In the past the Fed has been reluctant to indirectly weigh into political debates and raising interest rates too close to the election would be interpreted as a signal regarding the institution’s opinion of economic prospects. Therefore, while the FOMC’s interest rate decision in June will be data-dependant, it may also be impacted by the realisation that if interest rates do not rise in June or July, they are very likely to remain at 0.5% until at least December. Cebr believes that raising rates in June or July is premature and unnecessary. The inflationary environment remains benign and the US economy still faces numerous risks on the global front. Lacklustre growth in export markets is already creating problems for the country’s exporters. Further strengthening the US dollar via monetary policy tightening would make US-made products relatively more expensive and therefore less desirable for foreign buyers. David Morrison, senior market strategist at Spreadco said: The question is how this affects the odds on a Fed rate hike this summer? As far as the markets are concerned, not very much so far although it certainly keeps the prospect alive. However, it’s unlikely investors will want to take on additional exposure ahead of Janet Yellen’s public appearance this evening and the long holiday weekend. Whether the Fed Chair says anything related to monetary policy is another matter altogether. What should prove far more significant is next week’s raft of manufacturing PMIs along with the latest US Non-Farm Payroll release. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: Yesterday’s durable goods orders and home sales data would have put a smile on the face of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, but today’s underwhelming first quarter GDP report is unlikely to be as well-received. It’s not the most positive start to the financial year for the US and observers will now be keen to see if momentum can pick up in the next quarter. There’s plenty of talk about an interest rate rise, but Yellen and Co. are likely to wait for the data to support it before pushing the button. Despite the revision, the figures show a slowdown in GDP compared to the fourth quarter which saw a 1.4% increase. The overall figure was lifted by spending on home building and an increase in inventory investment by businesses. The US economy grew more than originally thought in the first quarter, but less than some economists had been expecting. As various members of the Federal Reserve suggested that a rate hike in June was not off the table, official figures showed an annualised 0.8% rise in GDP in the three months to March. This was higher than the first estimate of 0.5% but below estimates of a rise of 0.9%. This really has been dullest morning in the City for a while. Our old friend, the FTSE 100, is refusing to show any enthusiasm and is currently down a meagre 4 points. Investors are hoping that the US growth figures, in around 40 minutes, might cause a stir. Remember, economists expect the annualised growth rate in the last quarter to be revised up to 0.9%, from 0.4% before. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx (who gets a bonus mark for keeping awake, frankly), says: Friday continued at an alarmingly dull pace this morning, though there is the chance for a bit of excitement from the US open later this afternoon. The FTSE plodded along flat on the day, with the DAX and CAC effectively following the UK index’s lead. Both regions had nothing in the way of data to offer this Friday, and with Brent Crude threatening to fall below $49 per barrel were lacking the recent commodity-buzz that has helped push the indices to 3 week highs. Greece is prepares to welcome Russian president Vladimir Putin, amid tight security and fears that the visit will cause ructions within the EU. Putin’s visit is billed as a way of deepening economic and diplomatic ties between the two countries. He’ll be discussing trade, energy and transport issues, and meeting with President Prokopis Pavlopoulos and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Putin has already signalled that Moscow wants closer links with Athens, as the Greek newspaper Kathimerini explains: Moscow is primarily interested in buying state-run railway operator Trainose and a stake in Thessaloniki port, the country’s second largest, as Putin reiterated in a commentary for Kathimerini published on Thursday ahead of the visit. He also said that Russia – Greece’s main gas supplier – is still very much interested in reviving the South Stream gas pipeline project. “The issue of our energy resources being carried through southern corridors to the countries of the European Union is still on the agenda,” Putin said But the sight of Russia’s president landing in Athens at a time when the EU is imposing sanctions is causing some concern. Daragh McDowell, a principal analyst for Europe and Central Asia at Verisk Maplecroft, told CNBC that Putin hopes to take advantage of anger within Greece about its years of austerity. “The extreme political and economic disruption Greece has experienced, in combination with existing cultural ties, make it a particularly attractive target for these kind of initiatives. “Fundamentally these overtures are about sowing division and discord among the EU states in order to undermine the sanctions regime and, over the longer term, the EU as a whole.” Resolution’s Duncan Weldon has now blogged about the IMF paper on the problems with neoliberal economics. He explains that it’s part of a wider change of thinking at the Fund, away from the “Washington consensus” that dominated thinking before the wheels came off the global economy in 2008. But the IMF is also pointing out the flaws in the policies implemented over the last eight years. Duncan argues that the criticism against austerity is understandable : Excessive fiscal tightening in countries that still have fiscal space simply hasn’t worked as promised. There are plenty of countries with ample fiscal space that haven’t used it and the world economy has suffered as a result. And the Fund’s comments on capital controls reflect its concerns that ultra-loose monetary policy in the US and Europe has a severe impact on emerging markets. If The Fed won’t care about spillover effects, developing countries must take more precautions. In this respect the Fund; move towards backing capital controls is a consequences of the failure of Western fiscal policy makers to do enough to support growth and the unwillingness of Western monetary policy makers to take into account the global consequences of their actions. Jonathan Ostry, the IMF economist who co-wrote its critique of neoliberalism, is hoping to trigger a new debate about economic orthodoxy. The Financial Times has the details: In an interview, Jonathan Ostry, deputy director of the IMF’s research department and the article’s lead author, said the new piece was not meant as an attack on “the entire neoliberal agenda or the Washington consensus”. But he hoped it would set the stage for a broader examination of “neoliberalism” that would come out this year. It also fitted, he argued, with work on everything from austerity and inequality to debt and the desirability of open capital accounts that he and others have been publishing since the 2008 financial crisis — and with a growing sentiment in the broader economics community. “There are a lot of people thinking the same thing at this point, that basically some aspects of the neoliberal agenda probably need a rethink,” he said. “The crisis said: ‘The way we’ve been thinking can’t be right’.” Financial Times: IMF economists put ‘neoliberalism’ under the spotlight Neoliberal economics has attracted plenty of critics over the years, as the impact of privatisations, shrinking the state and austerity measures has become clear. And now, a team at the International Monetary Fund have delivered a remarkable attack on the consequences of neoliberalism. In a new paper they argue that the benefits of neoliberal policies has been over-blown, and its damage has been underplayed by policymakers. They put their finger on two key issues – the impact of capital flows into emerging markets, and the austerity measures and fiscal tightening forced on governments. They conclude that neoliberalism simply hasn’t worked as well as supporters claim, and has created inequality that actually hurt growth. Here’s their key conclusions: The benefits in terms of increased growth seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries. The costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda. Increased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects. This won’t surprise those who have lived through the eurozone debt crisis, or previous economic perils. But it does highlight that some global policymakers are trying to learn from the mistakes of the past. The paper suggests that capital controls, once seen as a thoroughly bad thing, might actually have helped avoid causing economic problems. The IMF team even takes aim at the notion that running a budget surplus is a bright idea, asking: Is there really a defensible case for countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, or the United States to pay down the public debt? And they argue it’s probably not, because: Austerity policies not only generate substantial welfare costs due to supply-side channels, they also hurt demand—and thus worsen employment and unemployment. The piece does state that neoliberalism has had its benefits; global trade has lifted millions out of abject poverty, for example, while some privatisations have delivered better services. But even so, “there are aspects of the neoliberal agenda that have not delivered as expected’. Here’s the full piece: Neoliberalism: Oversold? Activist Naomi Klein points out that the damage has already been done: While economist Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Foundation argues that the IMF really is changing: Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets wonder if Yellen might play it cool at Harvard: In focus today will likely be Fed Chair Yellen’s speech after the European close, especially after her colleagues (mostly non-voters) were out in force this week swaying expectations about a Summer rate hike. Note, however, Yellen is only receiving an award from Harvard so may well swerve explicit mention of US monetary policy to avoid adding fuel to the fire. Janet Yellen’s comments may not come until around 5.30pm BST, or later. She’s due to speak at a lunch at Harvard, along with her predecessor Ben Bernanke. More details here. Janet Yellen could move the markets today, when she visits Harvard to collect the Radcliffe Medal in recognition of her work. FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says investors will be watching the Fed chair closely, for any hints that a rate hike could be close. Sentiment towards the US economy has improved this month with an impressive array of domestic data bolstering speculation that US rates could be increased in June or July. With retail sales, inflation and new homes sales exceeding forecasts, the prerequisites for another US rate hike in Q2 could be fulfilled if US GDP and next week’s NFP exceed expectations. Yellen’s comments could act as a catalyst today for Dollar bulls to rampage if she chants the same hawkish tune as the other board governors. Although the CME group Fedwatch tool displays a 26% probability that a June hike could occur, concerns over slowing global growth and persistent China woes may also disrupt the Fed’s efforts to take action. Europe’s stock markets are open, but frankly there’s little happening out there. The main indices are all broadly unchanged, as investors wait for the US growth figures at 1.30pm BST. Some traders may also be pondering the long weekend (there’s a bank holiday on Monday), or wondering how England will fare against Sri Lanka in the Test Match (probably rather well). Mining shares are leading the risers in London, where the FTSE has managed to rise by 3 whole points. Tony Cross of TrustNet Direct explains: Commodity stocks are still finding favour, helped in no small part by US dollar weakness amidst the idea that the Fed may not be in a position to hike rates next month as had been earlier thought. A glimmer of good news from across the Channel. French consumer confidence has hit its highest level since October 2007, when the world economy was reeling from the credit crunch. The country’s main consumer confidence gauge has jumped to 98 in May, which beats economists’ expectations of 95. That’s tantalising close to the long-term consumer confidence average of 100. I do wonder, though, whether the clashes on the streets this week will hurt confidence. Tens of thousands of people have been protesting against legislation to make it easier to both hire and fire workers, prompting clashes with riot police yesterday. My colleague Angelique Chrisafis explains: Striking French workers continued to disrupt oil refineries and nuclear power stations, halted some air traffic and trains and prevented almost all national newspapers from printing in the growing industrial action. Union activists blocked roads and bridges in northern France while some train drivers and air traffic controllers joined the action. World leaders at the G7 meeting in Tokyo have declared that global growth is their “urgent priority”, but not actually announced any new measures to deal with it. The official declaration following the meeting declares: Global growth remains moderate and below potential, while risks of weak growth persist..... They then warn that growth is “moderate and uneven”, while global trade is disappointing. David Cameron, the UK PM, has also managed to get a reference to next month’s EU referendum into the communique. Leaders have agreed that Brexit would harm international trade, and is a “further serious risk” to growth. Japan’s stock market has gained ground today, following reports that prime minister Shinzo Abe is considering postponing one of his flagship policies. Abe dropped a broad hint earlier today that the planned hike in sales tax could be delayed. This tax was a crucial part of Abe’s attempts to improve Japan’s financial situation, but with the economy weak and inflation low, a rethink could be on the cards. Abe told a press conference at the G7 meeting that: “We must reignite powerfully the engine of Abenomics. That undoubtedly would include a decision on what to do with the sales tax hike.” A postponement probably would help consumer confidence and economic growth. However, it would undermine Abe’s commitment to improving Japan’s troubling fiscal position (a national debt of more than 200% of GDP). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It’s Friday, and it’s a bit quiet. But there are still a few events coming up that might get the blood pumping. Investors are mainly waiting for the second estimate of America’s growth in the first three months of the year, at 1.30pm BST. The first estimate was pretty dire, showing that growth slowed to an annual rate of just 0.4%. But with more data now available, economists believe we could get an upgrade to perhaps 0.9%. That’s still only a quarterly rate of around 0.2%, but it would calm fears that the US economy was faltering. All US data is currently seen through the lens of monetary policy, and whether it’s strong enough to prompt an interest rate rise soon. America’s top central banker, Janet Yellen, might have something to say about that when she visits Harvard (where she taught in the early 1970s). RBS Capital Markets explains: Yellen speaks at Harvard’s Radcliffe Day, where she will engage in “a conversation about her groundbreaking achievements.” The widespread expectation is, of course, that she will reiterate the more hawkish line taken by almost all recent Fed speakers. That event begins at 3.30pm BST, or 10.30am local time. Otherwise, the economics calendar is as bare as Old Mother Hubbard’s cupboard before payday. But we’ll also keep one eye on Japan, where the G7 leaders meeting is wrapping up. Our G7 liveblog is here: The other eye will be on Greece, where Russian president Vladimir Putin is paying a visit to Athens (having been blackballed from the G7) . This trip will is likely to reignite concerns in Brussels that Moscow could be using austerity-gripped Greece as a lever to divide Europe. Officially, the visit will deliver a “number of bilateral agreements” and will focus on trade, investment and joint energy and transport projects. We’ll be tracking all the main events through the day (and hoping the newsflow picks up a bit)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2013/sep/16/nuclear-bonfire-liberal-democrat-principles","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-16T20:00:02Z","webTitle":"Letters: Nuclear fuel on the bonfire of Liberal Democrat principles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/16/nuclear-bonfire-liberal-democrat-principles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2013/sep/16/nuclear-bonfire-liberal-democrat-principles","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear fuel on the bonfire of Liberal Democrat principles","bodyText":"As Liberal Democrat opposition to nuclear power joins opposition to secret courts and tuition fees on the bonfire of Lib Dem commitments, voters could be forgiven for wondering whether the party has any \"red lines\" of policy or principle left (Climate fears bring U-turn on nuclear power generation, 16 September). The weasel-worded capitulation on nuclear power suggests it has a role to play \"providing concerns about safety, disposal of radioactive waste and cost are adequately addressed and … without allowing any public subsidy for new build\". As the Lib Dem leadership well knows, the new energy bill has been crafted precisely to give generous subsidies to nuclear through so-called contracts for difference. It is thought likely that, for Hinkley C alone, a transfer of £30bn-£50bn from British householders and businesses to the French company EDF will be required. Moreover, it is proposed that nuclear operators' liability be capped at just £1bn per plant, when the total costs of the Fukushima disaster, for example, may well exceed £300bn. There are far cheaper, safer, quicker, more efficient ways of addressing the climate challenge than pursuing nuclear power. Accelerating the deployment of energy-efficiency measures, demand-response, demand-reduction and distributed-generation policies, and renewable technologies, would help drive wholesale electricity costs down and deliver more value for money as a pathway to decarbonising electricity generation. The Green New Deal Group, of which I am part, outlined just such an approach in a report last week. Investment in renewables, alongside a nationwide project to make every building in the country energy-efficient, would create hundreds of thousands of high-quality jobs across the country, as well as reducing both fuel bills and emissions. Caroline Lucas MP Green, Brighton Pavilion • I was surprised to read that Vince Cable is to ask the Low Pay Commission to restore the value of the minimum wage (Report, 14 September). Can these be the same Lib Dems whose minister for farming, David Heath, pushed through the abolition of the minimum wage structure for agricultural workers because it would lead to a more flexible market? The same Lib Dems who, in the face of the overwhelming rejection of the proposals in the consultation period, ploughed on and whipped their members in the House of Lords to push through abolition? The same Lib Dems who had received analysis from Defra showing that low-paid agricultural workers would lose £279.7m over 10 years if they pushed abolition through? I wait with bated breath to hear that Cable has instructed Heath to halt the abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board, which is due to be implemented on 1 October. Clearly they are now concerned about low pay and minimum wages in rural areas in a way that they were not earlier this year.

His 1966 debut film, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, got 13 nominations and won five. His second, The Graduate, got a mere seven nominations and one win. The 20 other films he went on to make managed 22 nominations and one Oscar between them, for best song. Nichols died this week, at 83, and the obituaries have been full of praise. But an Observer piece 10 years ago summed up, I think, the general feeling about his career as a film director: “Nichols is now regarded as a safe pair of hands in Hollywood, a mainstream, middle-brow director who is wonderful with stars.” “Wonderful with stars.” Talk about being damned with faint praise. Nichols, actually, was wonderful at making films that offered realistic portrayals of women. Perhaps this went unnoticed because it has not, historically, been a Hollywood priority. But it was the outstanding feature of those two early films, and of many of his films since. Quite a few of his movies have been about women or written by women. Silkwood starred Meryl Steep as a nuclear power whistleblower, and was written by Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen. Postcards from the Edge starred Streep again, as a drug-addicted actress, and was based on Carrie Fisher’s screenplay. Gilda Live was a film of Gilda Radner’s one-woman Broadway show. Two of his films, Primary Colors and 1996’s The Birdcage, were written by his former comedy partner of several decades earlier, Elaine May. Even the fact that the guy had a female comedy partner in the 1950s suggests that his view of women was notably progressive for its time. Nevertheless – and despite the fact that he dated Gloria Steinem – you’d be hard-pressed to argue that Nichols’s films were feminist. Even Working Girl, which celebrates the idea of a secretary, Tess, fighting her way into investment banking, is criticised on that score because her horrible boss, Katherine, is also female. This rather misses the point. The great thing about Working Girl was that the leading women – Melanie Griffith, Sigourney Weaver, Joan Cusack – had enough critical mass to ensure that the men – Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin – became the romantic interest, in an inversion of the usual movie dynamic. Working Girl is a liberating film because it’s about women, not because it portrays women as good and men as bad. (If you count success in Oscar nominations, all three women were nominated for their performances in that film.) It’s about women – and they’re not just pretty faces. In Nichols’s films, they never are. If you look at the way women have been portrayed in Nichols’s films as his career went on, you can trace the rise of female equality within them. The early films, Virginia Woolf and The Graduate, are quite obviously tragic portrayals of frustrated women, angry at where the limitations on their own lives have taken them. Later, in Silkwood and Working Girl, women are seen questioning the passivity of the roles assigned to them, and struggling to change things. By the end, in Closer and Charlie Wilson’s War, gender is simply a less reliable predictor of behaviour. It’s harder to see a line between typically male traits and typically female traits. It’s not that Nichols did women huge favours. It’s just that his work always displayed an acceptance of women as interesting that is conspicuous by its absence in a lot of mainstream Hollywood output. The women in Nichols’s films shouldn’t be remarkable, and to his credit, Nichols never claimed that they were. Yet it’s hard to think of another body of work that charts the changing role of women in this way – as part of life rather than as something to be consciously examined or proselytised about. Maybe it’s just the consequence of a long career, this subtle, seemingly unintentional examination of women and their place in society. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t valuable. One striking feature about Nichols’s work is that despite the wide range of genres he tackled during his career, he has pretty much steered clear of storylines that involve women being physically maimed or killed (with the exception of Silkwood, a true story). Sometimes – even now, perhaps especially now – it can seem like women are only allowed to appear on screen if there’s some gaffer tape mixed up in the plot somewhere, owned by a psychopath. In Nichols’s films, women are often seen struggling. But they struggle against the narrow exigencies of their own lives, not against scary monsters. Nichols’s women may at times be powerless. But they are never passive. The sad thing is that this is both so remarkable and so little remarked upon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/live/2017/may/18/general-election-2017-theresa-may-conservative-manifesto-social-care-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-05-18T22:10:57Z","webTitle":"General election 2017:  ITV hosts first leaders' debate – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2017/may/18/general-election-2017-theresa-may-conservative-manifesto-social-care-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2017/may/18/general-election-2017-theresa-may-conservative-manifesto-social-care-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"General election 2017:  ITV hosts first leaders' debate – as it happened","bodyText":"There’s a reason why PMQs attracts so much interest at Westminster, even though the quality of “debate” is often poor. It’s because, when the prime minister and the leader of the opposition are speaking, there’s a hinge that connects the arguments to decisions that get taken, things that happen, stuff that matters etc. The PM and opposition leader have to defend what they do, and so whether they can defend it or not convincingly actually counts. But if the people who are engaged in a political debate don’t have that sort of authority, even if they speak with the wit and intellect of characters from an Aaron Sorkin drama, it is not going to have the same edge. And no one would confuse what happened tonight with a Sorkin script. Which is a round-about way of saying it was all a bit dull, and it does not really matter. In fact, I’m not quite sure why I’m still here. But, since I am, three concluding thoughts. First, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn deserve no credit for not turning up and, in so far as people take a view (which is probably not much), it will be negative. When Leanne Wood said May was scared to show up, that sounded melodramatic, although the ITV viewers’ panel apparently liked it. (See 8.22pm.) When Tim Farron said at the end she was taking people for granted, he sounded as if he had a point. Second, the women were generally better than the men. Nicola Sturgeon, Caroline Lucas and Wood all put in strong performances. Farron’s theatrics and argument-by-anecdote (presumably he was coached) got the thumbs down from the press (see 9.32pm), but he may have gone down well with less jaded observers. And, third, Paul Nuttall floundered. Probably the only thing anyone will remember from tonight is that twice he called Leanne Wood “Natalie”. Ukip already poll worse with women than with men, and this may help to explain why. But it wasn’t just that; his attempts to reduce everything to immigration became borderline comic, and provoked some effective mockery from the others. (See 8.46pm and 9.08pm.) Ukip are having a terrible election and earlier today an Ipsos MORI poll showed them being overtaken by the Greens for the first time in some years. Tonight Nuttall did not do anything much to help. That’s all from me. Thanks for the comments. The ITV leaders debate has exposed the patchwork, oddly shaped nature of the UK’s political system. The only two party leaders with a realistic chance of becoming prime minister, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, have declined to appear – further highlighting the weakness of this format, in which the speakers spent much of the debate virtue-signalling, untested. We had leaders of two nationalist parties whose candidates only stand in small parts of the UK, in Nicola Sturgeon of the Scottish National party, and Leanne Wood from the Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru. Yet neither are candidates in the election. Tim Farron of the Liberal Democrats, Caroline Lucas of the English Greens and Paul Nuttall of Ukip are standing, yet none has a realistic chance of being in the next government. The Greens will likely end with one MP, in Lucas. Ukip are likely to end with none at all. Only Nuttall, the one outsider among the five, was directly challenged over his policies. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, is the only one of the five who has served in government. Yet her 10 years in power in Edinburgh was not under direct scrutiny in this debate, facing an audience in Salford that can never vote for her. Likewise Wood. Sturgeon made assertions on Scotland’s economy for which there is no evidence, implying that the SNP’s policy of lifting 100,000 small businesses out of paying business rates has helped the economy. The Scottish government has never tested the benefits of that policy for the Scottish economy, which is on the cusp of official recession. Clearly aware of this, Sturgeon had the insight to qualify her own answers – confirming how odd this debate really was. Keenly aware that her government’s patchy record on education is a fierce topic of debate in Scotland, she said: “Nothing is more important to me than education, where there are some challenges we are working really hard to address.” Unprovoked, she said the same about housing: “We’ve got challenges; we’ve not done everything right.” It is quite unclear what meaningful impact this programme will have on the final outcome of the election on 8 June. This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the debate on Twitter. Those who are expressing an opinion - many seem to have taken the John Rentoul line, and concluded it was a waste of time. In so far as you can draw any conclusions these responses, Caroline Lucas probably “won”. From the Guardian’s Gaby Hinsliff From Sunday Post’s Andrew Picken From the Sun’s Steve Hawkes From Open Democracy’s Anthony Barnett From ITV’s Joke Pike From the Telegraph’s Liam Halligan From the former Sunday Post journalist James Millar From Sky’s Darren McCaffrey From the Mirror’s Ben Glaze The Sun’s Steve Hawkes also thinks it was wrong for the Tory and Labour press offices to start commenting on the debate on Twitter when they were not willing to take part. And ITV’s political editor Robert Peston agrees. Here is more from ITV’s Chris Ship, who was watching the debate with what was in effect a mini focus group. They are now on final statements. Nuttall says the other party leaders do not believe in Brexit. They do not believe we are big enough or good enough to be a free country on the international stage. If you believe that immigration should be cut, and aid reduced, then please go out and vote Ukip. We can put the great back into Britain. Lucas says she is asking people to vote Green because this is about you, and it is about standing up for our values of “openness, cooperation and compassion”. We face challenges to our climate, which we have not discussed enough tonight. We can build a more confident future. Vote Green on 8 June8, she says. Farron says there is a vision of a better Britain worth fighting for. The fact that Theresa May is not here tonight tells you she is taking you for granted. You need someone who will step up for you. This is a country worth fighting for, she says. Wood says Plaid’s values and principles are of value wherever you are. Neither Theresa May nor Labour will have Wales as a priority. That is why we need a strong team of Plaid MPs, to defend Wales and make Wales matter. Sturgeon says a strong SNP voice at Westminster matters. The Tory government is increasingly in hoke to Ukip. To people outside Scotland she would say the SNP will always work for strong, progressive values. And to those in Scotland, she says the SNP will stand up for the country and make it the best it can be. And that’s it. A summary and verdict coming up soon. Farron says he promised that he would not vote to put up tuition fees. He kept his promise he says. (He voted against the tuition fees increase, even though his party backed it.) Nuttall says there are far too many students going to university. Last year 46% of students ended up in a non-graduate job. He says if they did that, they would be able to afford to get rid of tuition fees. Nuttall says the English are paying for housing in Scotland. Sturgeon points out that the Scots pay taxes too This is from the former Times journalist Andrew Clark. Q: What would you do to benefit young people? Sturgeon says they do a lot in Scotland, where they don’t have tuition fees. Having a strong economy is key, she says. Wood says she wants to see welfare cuts that disadvantage young people should be reversed. Farron says one in three young people leave Cumbria, where he lives, despite it being the most beautiful place on earth, because house prices are too high. We should build more, he says. He says young people voted to stay in the EU. He will stand up for them, and would give them a final say on Brexit in a second referendum. Farron’s habit of answering questions with a personal reference is attracting a lot of wry comment from the journalists watching. (We’ve heard several times already.) Farron is also doing a lot of staring at the camera. Wood says selection does not work. You have winners and losers. She says in Wales she will oppose grammar schools for as long as she draws breath. On class sizes, she says she is not aware of evidence showing that they make a different to outcomes. The quality of the teaching is more important, she says. Sturgeon says she thinks both are important. She says she is not an expert on the English education. But she was aghast to hear Theresa May say she would find more money for schools by, literally, taking food out of the mouths of children. She will protect free school meals in Scotland, she says. Nuttall says he believes in academic selection, and he always has done. We need more grammar schools, he says. There are only 164. The problem is they are in middle-class areas. Lucas says the Greens want to scrap SATs and let teachers focus on teachers. “Let kids be kids and let teachers teach,” she says. Farron’s aides have posted this clip on Twitter. Q: I am a primary school teacher. What would you do to support teachers in school so every child gets the best education? Farron says he is a father of four. Nothing is more important to him. And we are just a few weeks away from a time when head teachers will have to dismiss staff because of lack of funding. He says we need a government that allows teachers to get on with the job. Nuttall says it is a scandal that about 500,000 pupils go to schools with more than 30 pupils to a class. Teachers are overwhelmed with paperwork, he says. Lucas says she is still recovering from the shock of finding there is one thing she agrees with Nuttall on; they both think HS2 will be a disaster. Nuttall says after Brexit we will be able to sign free trade deal with America. And accept hormone-filled beef, says Wood. Why not, asks Nuttall. Natalie Bennett, the former Green leader, is glad to learn that she has made an impression on Paul Nuttall. Nuttall says rents are high because we are not building enough houses. You will need migrant labour, Farron tells him. Not if we train enough people, says Nuttall. Sturgeon asks him if he knows what the unemployment rate is. Nuttall says living standards are low because immigration is driving down wages. Wood says it is outrageous that public sector workers are having to go to food banks. Farron says he remembers seeing poverty when he was brought up in Preston. He says it was a mark of good parenting that he only realised they were brought up poor afterwards. He says this taught him that government must not take people for granted. The Labour and Lib Dem press teams are rowing about the debate on Twitter. This is from Labour. And this is the Lib Dem response. Q: Prices are going up, rent and bills are increasing, but wages and benefits are not going up. What would you do about it? Nuttall says Ukip wants to put more money in people’s pockets. It would cut VAT on fuel, and scrap the green levy, which increases energy bills, he says. Farron says he has a long-term economic plan. It is called staying in the single market. Lucas says we can learn a lot from Scotland, where they have free personal care. Nuttall says he agrees with “Natalie”. But he was referring to Wood, and she corrects him. She suggests he is not very good with women’s names. Sturgeon says we should not be taking resources from some of the poorest people in the world. And we don’t do this just to help them. We spend money on aid to make the world safer. But the question for Nuttall is, if you cut immigration, where are the NHS staff going to come from, she asks. Nuttall says Ukip would not block all immigration. They would have a one in, one out policy, she says. You are talking about people, Sturgeon tells him. Farron joins in, and says he is also opposed to taking money from the poorest people on earth. Here is the BBC’s Philip Sim on the CCHQ Twitter output. See 8.16am. He has a point ... Lucas says the Greens would get rid of the nuclear weapons programme. That would release £110bn over the next 30 years. Some of that money would go into the NHS, she says. She criticises Farron and the Lib Dems for backing the Health and Social Care Act, which allows more private involvement in the NHS. Farron says most of the extension of private care into the NHS happened under Labour. Lucas and Farron both make a point of thanking the questioner for her service to the NHS. Farron says the Lib Dems would raise income tax to fund extra money for the NHS. Sturgeon also thanks the questioner. She says the SNP has put more money into health and they abolished hospital car parking charges in 2008. Q: [From an 82-year-old former nurse] I am extremely concerned about the funding of health and social care. What will you do about this? Etchingham points out that health is a devolved issued, so the governments in Scotland and Wales are in charge of what happens there. Wood says we should pay for health and social care from taxation. The wealthiest should stump up a bit more, she says. Nuttall says we are a growing population. Immigration plays a large part of that. If we continue on the track we are on, it will reach 80bn by the half of this century. Ukip would put more money into hospitals, and £1.4bn into social care. It would take that by cutting the aid budget to 0.2% of GDP – what it was in the US under Barack Obama. This is from my colleague Gaby Hinsliff. This is from the Daily Mail’s John Stevens. And this is from the SNP’s Hannah Bardell. Lucas says Nuttall’s suggestion that all problems are caused by immigrants is “outrageous”. Nuttall says calling for a second referendum, as Lucas suggest, is “all very European Union”. This is what they do in the EU. But that is not acceptable, he says. We are leaving. “Tim can cry about it all he wants.” Wood asks Nuttall if he really thinks people voted to leave their jobs. There is an Airbus factory in Deeside employing 6,500 people. They will not stay if they have to pay tariffs. As Nuttall starts to reply, Wood says: “I’m not Natalie [Bennett], I’m Leanne.” Farron calls Nuttall “the ambassador for Theresa May”. Nuttall says it was made clear during the EU referendum that leaving the EU meant leaving the single market. It is “downright duplicitous” to say otherwise, he says. Farron says people like Nuttall went round saying the UK could have a Norway-type relationship with the EU. Nuttall does not accept that. Lucas says Brexit will be catastrophic. Sturgeon says people were influenced by the “lie” on the Vote Leave bus. She says an effort should have been made to find compromise afterwards. ITV’s Chris Ship is watching the debate with 10 viewers - effectively, a focus group. Sturgeon says she was at St Andrews university last week. It is one of the best universities in the world. But they are worried about Brexit, about losing students and funding and academics. Theresa May is not here, but her spokesman, Paul Nuttall, is, she says. She says she wants the future of EU nationals decided quickly. Nuttall says he agrees that the future of EU nationals should be sorted soon. He is not May’s spokesman, he says. He thinks she will backslide. He thinks she will do that over fishing, and over free movement. Lucas says free movement is a wonderful thing. She wants her kids to be able to travel. Nuttall says we should not be paying a Brexit bill. Farron says that he has four children. He wants to be able to look them in the eye in the future and say he did everything to fight Brexit. The Tories did not want to attend this debate, but they are actively getting involved on Twitter. Lucas says we were not told what Brexit would be like. The Greens think people should have a say on the final result. And she says she feels very let down by Labour over Brexit. Q: If elected, how would your part negotiated a safe, beneficial worthwhile deal for Britain. And will it be better than what we have? Wood says she wanted to stay in the EU, but she accepts the result. Only by electing Plaid MPs will you ensure Wales’ voice is heard. Sturgeon says she campaigned passionately to stay in the EU. And she thinks Scotland should have a choice. But the priority now is the Brexit negotiation. Theresa May is pursuing a hard Brexit. Even today she it threatening to walk away with no deal. That would cause a catastrophe, she says. It would cost 80,000 Scottish jobs. The leaders are making opening statements. Caroline Lucas says she will be straight. Never in her lifetime has the future been so uncertain: Brexit, climate change and the NHS crisis. But when we come together, we can change things. We can stop 4m people living in poverty. Leanne Wood says Plaid Cymru is all about Wales, but its vision can benefit people in all parts of the UK. The country faces real challenges. Plaid has a positive, post-Brexit plan. She has a message for the prime minister, who she is sure is watching. You are scared of facing a debate. That is weak leadership, Wood says. Those of us here will show you that real leadership is standing up for what you believe. Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland needs MPs able to stand up for it at Westminster. It will stand up for jobs, and against an extreme Brexit. The next few years will determine the kind of country we become. We need strong opposition, standing up for tolerance and justice and community. Paul Nuttall says there is only one party truly committed to the Brexit people voted for, where we are back in control of borders and our money. We should take back control of our fishing borders. Ukip is the only party committed to a policy of balanced migration. And it is committed to cutting the foreign aid budget which is costing £30m a day. And it wants the health service to be a national one, not an international one. Tim Farron said he got into politics to fight, to stand up for people who take you for granted. He grew up in Preston, where people were taken for granted by heartless Tory government. The Britain he loves is not lost yet. If you care for our schools, do not give up. Do not turn your back on the world. The fight is not over. Julie Etchingham opens the programme. There were seven leaders here for the debate in 2015, she says. She says 7m people watched. Five of those parties have changed leaders, she says. She introduces the line-up. (See 7.44pm.) Labour are not taking part in the debate, but they are in the spin room, according to Mohammed Shafiq. This is from YouGov’s Joe Twyman. The first proper leaders’ debate of the election will start soon, at 8pm. It is on ITV, and it will run for two hours. We will, of course, be covering it live. There is a small hitch. Although it is being billed as the leaders’ debate, the two most important ones – the only two with any chance of being prime minister after 8 June – aren’t turning up. It is not just Hamlet without the prince, but without Claudius too. Theresa May declared that she would not take part in debates because she wanted to focus on campaigning, and because she thought people did not learn much from seeing politicians arguing with each other, and Jeremy Corbyn said he would take part in debates that did not involve May. But there are five other leaders who were invited who are turning up: Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and Scottish first minister; Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader; Leanne Wood, the Plaid Cymru leader; Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the Greens; and Paul Nuttall, the Ukip leader. ITV told the Conservatives and Labour that it would not allow them to send substitutes. The channel has also decided it will not “empty chair” the two no-shows. Or empty podium them, since the participants will be standing. Theresa May urged Britain’s voters to “join me on this journey” as she unveiled a Conservative manifesto that ditches free market Thatcherism in favour of “country and community”. As Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart report, speaking at a launch event in Halifax, a Labour-held marginal seat, May brandished a copy of the slim navy blue document, entitled Forward, Together. Long on philosophy and short on eyecatching giveaways, it rejects “untrammelled free markets and selfish individualism” in favour of “a belief not just in society but in the good that government can do”. Unlike the Labour manifesto, which was published alongside a separate costings document, the Conservative prospectus included few financial details, and ditched George Osborne’s “tax lock” that promised in 2015 not to increase income tax or national insurance. Here is a summary and analysis of the manifesto by Alan Travis. The chair of the long-term care commission has attacked the Conservatives’ plan to make more elderly people pay for social care, saying it would leave people “completely on their own” to deal with future costs. That’s all from me for the moment. If anything dramatic happens in the next 90 minutes or so, a colleague will step in. Later, at 8pm, we have the ITV election leaders debate. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are not taking part, but Nicola Sturgeon, Tim Farron, Paul Nuttall, Leanne Wood and Caroline Lucas are all due and I will be covering it live. This, from the Economist’s data team, is very good. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the Tory plans for extra schools spending amount to a real-terms cut. This is from Luke Sibieta, the IFS’s associate director of education and skills. The Labour party went to great lengths to show that its spending commitments were funded. The Tories claimed to have identified some holes in the Labour accounts - some of their criticisms were spurious, some weren’t - but generally, when Labour announced a new policy, there was also a funding stream attached. The same cannot be said of the Conservative document. It does not contain a costings section, and it says almost nothing about how plans will be funded. To highlight this, Labour has released a press statement saying there are 60 spending commitments in the Conservative manifesto and that only one of them is costed (new offices for the British Business Bank, paid for by repatriated funds from the European Investment Fund. Here is an extract from the Labour list. And this is from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. The Tories’ numbers don’t add up. They have published an 84 page blank cheque that provides a tax giveaway guarantee for big business, while offering a roll of the dice for working families with no commitments to rule out rises in income tax and national insurance. Now we can see why Theresa May is running scared of debating Jeremy Corbyn, when she publishes a document like this that contains more questions than answers. It also further shows how her party has managed to add £700bn to the national debt since 2010, as they won’t be straight with the British people on how much their plans for a wealthy few truly cost. One of the few revenue raisers they identified was withdrawing free school meals from children and withdrawing support for pensioners struggling to heat their homes – this just sums up the Tory approach. This is the equivalent of the prime minister going to the shops with the nation’s cheque book and not checking the price of the goods as she puts them in the trolley. The Labour document isn’t perfect. It includes items which don’t necessarily involve extra spending (eg, simplifying the tax system) and items which could cut spending, not increase it (eg, moving civil servants out of London). And some items are just peculiar; the list includes “£1bn to modernise prisons” and then asks (in the column on the right) “how much does this cost?” Around £1bn might be a good guess. And this last point illustrates why an exercise like this may have little traction. All government have - and have to have - spending plans looking forward to the next five years and beyond. Many of the items on the Labour list refers to plans that are already in the pipeline. In so far as they look like spending commitments, people may assume that these are already priced in. That is not to say that Labour gets a fair press. As Anoosh Chakelian writes in the New Statesman, a quick glance at how the papers have covered Theresa May’s plans to make pensioners pay more for social care, compared to how they covered Labour’s semi-equivalent proposals seven years ago, show that appalling double standards are operating. But it is not just a matter of the Tories being Tories. The fact that they are in government, and that they therefore determine baseline government spending, helps make it easier for them too. The Women’s Equality party says the Tory manifesto plans will extend economic hardship for women. And it is particularly critical of the proposals on childcare. This is from Sophie Walker, the Women Equality party’s leader. May is recycling the Tory promise of 30 hours’ free childcare for three- and four-year-olds, but focusing only on working parents ‘who find it difficult to manage the costs of childcare’. This policy has been aggressively underfunded and has led to nurseries closing their doors. Good quality childcare demands investment. We have demonstrated how this can be done. Our offer is 40 hours of free childcare, 48 weeks of the year, for all children from the end of shared parental leave until they start school. This is a policy that works. Buried in Theresa May’s manifesto is a commitment to merge the Serious Fraud Office with the National Crime Agency. It says: We will strengthen Britain’s response to white collar crime by incorporating the Serious Fraud Office into the National Crime Agency, improving intelligence sharing and bolstering the investigation of serious fraud, money laundering and financial crime. The idea has reportedly been on her to-do list for some time. Reaction from anti-corruption groups and specialist lawyers has thus far been uniformly negative. Stephen Parkinson, the head of criminal litigation at Kingsley Napley, said: This is a dreadful decision. The NCA does not have the capability or the expertise to investigate complex, serious fraud, nor, I suspect, the desire. This is a real step back from the UK’s commitment to tackle serious economic crime. Robert Barrington, the executive director of the anti-corruption group Transparency International, warned the move would jeopardise the freedom from political interference that the SFO’s investigations enjoy: The underlying concern is that this could be a crude attempt at either cost-saving or to neuter the Bribery Act so that the UK can increase its exports at the expense of the stability, security and economic development of our overseas trading partners. An SFO spokesperson said: “This is a political pledge and we cannot comment. The organisation of law enforcement is a matter for ministers.” The Conservative manifesto includes a proposal to overhaul voter registration laws by including a requirement for voters to show ID at polling stations, in order to crack down on election fraud. The manifesto claims that the Tories will tackle every aspect of electoral fraud. “The British public deserves to have confidence in our democracy,” it states. We will legislate to ensure that a form of identification must be presented before voting, to reform postal voting and to improve other aspects of the elections process to ensure that our elections are the most secure in the world. But the policy is a controversial one, with evidence that strict voter ID rules in some US states have disproportionately disadvantaged poor and minority voters. Furthermore, there is little evidence that electoral fraud is widespread in the UK, which has a system that is respected around the world, including by international monitoring organisations. Labour has previously said that millions of people may be disenfranchised by the plans. In December, Cat Smith, Labour’s shadow minister for voter engagement, raised concerns that 7.5% of the electorate may not have the right kind of identification in order to exercise their right to vote. Voter ID requirements were also criticised as a “sledgehammer to crack a nut” by the Electoral Reform Society, a pressure group campaigning for reform of the democratic system. “The government should think very carefully before introducing barriers to voting,” said its chief executive, Katie Ghose. “There is simply no evidence to suggest that electoral fraud is widespread across the UK. Where it has occurred it has been isolated and should be tackled locally.” The Social Market Foundation thinktank has spotted another Tory 2015 manifesto pledge that has been dropped. Two years ago the manifesto included a commitment to halve the disability employment gap. That has gone, and instead the party is committed to getting 1 million more disabled people into employment. Matthew Oakley, an SMF researcher, said: It’s disappointing that the Conservatives have dropped their commitment to halving the disability employment gap. But given the cuts to employment support seen in the last parliament, it should come as no surprise. The new pledge, to increase employment of disabled people by 1 million, is a weaker commitment than the one it replaces. Employment of non-disabled people could well increase by more than this over the same period, meaning that the employment gap between disabled and non-disabled people could actually increase. Whoever the new government is needs to be serious about disability employment. The first step should be to reverse cuts to the specialist support available to help disabled people into work and do more to ensure that the benefits system supports people to get help when they experience the onset of physical or mental health conditions. For more on 2015 Tory manifesto promises that have been dropped, see 3.07pm and 3.09pm. UPDATE: The Tories have been in touch to say the manifesto does include plans to get more disabled people into the labour market. In particular, a spokesman cited this one in the manifesto: We will also work to help those groups who have in the past found it difficult to get employment, by incentivising employers to take them on. So for businesses employing former wards of the care system, someone with a disability, those with chronic mental health problems, those who have committed a crime but who have repaid their debt to society, and those who have been unemployed for over a year, we will offer a holiday on their employers’ national insurance contributions for a full year Here is comment from a Guardian panel on the manifesto, with contributions from Hugh Muir, Matthew d’Ancona, Faiza Shaheen,Anne Perkins and Kate Maltby. And here is an extract from Matthew’s article. Look too at the plans for social care. At the heart of this blueprint – already hugely controversial – is the belief that wealth in this country is radically undertaxed and that a citizens’ assets should be the key determinant in assessing how much they contribute towards their care, posthumously or otherwise. It is hard to overstate what a break this represents with past Tory thinking. John Major spoke of “wealth cascading down the generations”. When George Osborne warmed to the idea of a mansion tax during the coalition years, Cameron stopped him in his tracks at once. Indeed, one his final flagship policies was to protect all properties worth up to £1m owned by couples from all inheritance tax. Whatever else it may be, this manifesto is not a blank cheque for revolutionary neoliberalism or continuity Thatcherism. If you think you hate these proposals, imagine what rightwing MPs are thinking. While the Conservative manifesto includes the easing of fracking rules and the capping of household energy bills there is a very significant omission – no mention at all of the fleet of new nuclear power stations the party has always previously backed. The 2015 Tory manifesto promised “a significant expansion in new nuclear”. The new one promises nothing at all. The deal for a French-Chinese partnership to build the first new reactors in a generation at Hinkley Point in Somerset is signed. But vast costs of nuclear power are looking ever more expensive as renewables costs plummet and grids gets smarter at managing demand. It may be that the serious financial woes at Toshiba, which has placed another proposed plant in jeopardy, was the final straw. The Tories may have realised that hiking energy bills to fund large subsidies to foreign state-owned companies is not the best way to power the UK. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published a briefing on the Tory plan to get rid of the “triple lock” (ensuring the state pension rises every year by 2.5% or inflation or earnings, whichever is higher) and replace it with a “double lock” (ensuring they rise every year in line with inflation or earnings, whichever is higher). It says that the new policy does not make much difference to pensioners or the Treasury and that it “does little to resolve the pressures an ageing population will put on the public finances over the years to come.” Ukip are also attacking the Tories over their pensioner proposals. This is from Patrick O’Flynn, Ukip’s economics spokesman. The Conservatives are planning to unleash the biggest tax raid in history on pensioner households. It is unbelievable that the elderly should be subjected to a new death tax by a party that pretends to defend their interests. Ukip will fight this just as hard as we are fighting Philip Hammond’s plan for a national insurance attack on the self-employed. Jeremy Corbyn has accused the Tories of unleasing a “nasty party triple whammy” on pensioners with their manifesto plans. In a statement he said: Millions of pensioners are betrayed by Theresa May’s manifesto. She is hitting older people with a classic nasty party triple whammy: Scrapping the triple lock on pensions, removing the winter fuel allowance and forcing those who need social care to pay for it with their homes. The Conservatives’ record is one of broken promises and failure. They promised to raise living standards, but working families are set to be on average over £1,400 a year worse off. They promised to improve all standards of NHS care, but A&amp;Es are in crisis. They promised to protect school spending, but schools are facing crippling cuts and class sizes are soaring. You can’t trust a word Theresa May says. Despite Theresa May’s warm words, she leads a party that has created a rigged economy that only works for the super-rich. The Conservatives have not changed. While the Labour party has promised to protect low and middle earners from any tax rises, all Theresa May has promised is a cut to corporation tax for their big business friends. Unlike the Conservatives, Labour is standing up for the many, not the few. The Tories appear to be fishing for votes in the Scottish Borders with the same zeal as an angler fishing for salmon on the Tweed. The party has a new manifesto pledge to create a major “Borderland” investment plan, for a region where the Tories are fighting to protect their only MP and hopefully secure at least one more. Theresa May’s manifesto said: Building on the city and growth deals we have signed across Scotland, we will bring forward a Borderlands Growth Deal, including all councils on both sides of the border, to help secure prosperity in southern Scotland. By coincidence, the Scottish secretary, David Mundell is defending a slender 798 majority in Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale, while John Lamont, a prominent ally of the Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson, is fighting to unseat the Scottish National party’s Calum Kerr in Berwickshire, Roxbugh and Selkirk. Kerr is protecting the smallest majority among Scotland’s 59 Commons seats, of 328 votes, and is widely expected to lose to Lamont, who is Tory MSP for the contiguous Holyrood seat. No further details have yet emerged about the shape and value of the Borderlands offer, but in a party statement Mundell said: From the Borders to the North Sea, this manifesto delivers for Scotland. It shows that a re-elected Conservative government will continue to ensure that Scotland benefits from its membership of the United Kingdom. The SNP, which has itself faced Tory accusations of buying votes with Scottish government announcements before the council elections on 4 May, said it had reopened the Borders railway and was planning a new South of Scotland enterprise agency linked to the new city deal for Edinburgh. Calum Kerr added: The usual routine by the Tories is they announce these growth deals, put up a bit of the money and then rely on the Scottish government to stump up the rest. The Conservative manifesto pledge to increase school funding in England gets a tepid response from Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. He says: We welcome any improvement to school funding, but unfortunately the Conservative pledge of a £4bn boost includes a large element of sleight of hand. The schools budget would have to increase by about £2.8bn in any case because the pupil population will rise by 490,000 by 2022. So, the “extra” money is in fact just over £1bn, which is not enough to counteract the rising costs which are hitting schools and will amount to £3bn a year by 2020. Barton is also unimpressed by the promise to revive grammar schools and selection. The evidence we have seen does not support the premise that the further expansion of selection will improve education for the majority of young people. The evidence indicates that it will have a damaging impact on the life chances of the majority who do not attend a selective school. Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, has done his own analysis of how the Tory manifesto differs from the 2015 one. He says he has identified 12 promises that have been dropped. The headlines will focus on the Conservatives abandoning triple lock protection for pensions and an end to David Cameron’s “tax lock” promise of no increase in income tax, national insurance or VAT. But what else has changed in the small print between today’s Tory manifesto and David Cameron’s two years ago? On child poverty Tory manifesto 2015: We will work to eliminate child poverty Tory manifesto 2017: We want to reduce child poverty What it means: Four million of our children are living below the official poverty line and the IFS projects the number will pass 5 million by 2020. That demands a muscular response. But the Conservatives have abolished the child poverty unit which has been subsumed into the DWP. This looks like no muscular response on the rising numbers will be forthcoming. On balancing the budget Tory manifesto 2015: Deliver a balanced structural current budget in 2017-18 Tory manifesto 2017: “A balanced budget by the middle of the next decade” What it means: A far less specific commitment, and ten years later than George Osborne promised. On the Human Rights Act Tory manifesto 2015: Scrap the Human Rights Act and curtail the role of the European Court of Human Rights, so that foreign criminals can be more easily deported from Britain Tory manifesto 2017: We will not repeal or replace the Human Rights Act while the process of Brexit is underway but we will consider our human rights legal framework when the process of leaving the EU concludes. We will remain signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights for the duration of the next parliament. What it means: Another ditching of a flagship Cameron pledge, and a promise May made during her leadership campaign to remain signatories to the ECHR. A U-turn maybe, but one that will be welcomed by many progressives. On defence Tory manifesto 2015: We will maintain the size of the regular armed services and not reduce the army to below 82,000. Tory manifesto 2017: We will maintain the overall size of the armed forces, including an army that is capable of fielding a war-fighting division. What it means: No numbers here, because the Conservatives have failed to meet this pledge, the numbers are currently 78,500. Defence secretary Michael Fallon has been regularly castigated in TV interviews about the figure. On prosperity Tory manifesto 2015: We will pursue our ambition to become the most prosperous major economy in the world by the 2030s Tory manifesto 2017: It doesn’t appear What it means: This was a key pledge by George Osborne as a case for deficit reduction. The UK is the fifth largest economy in the world though it slipped to sixth below France in the direct aftermath of Brexit. With such economic uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations, it seems unsurprising this has been quietly dropped. On rail travel Tory manifesto 2015: We will keep commuter rail fares frozen in real terms for the whole of the next Parliament Tory manifesto 2017: It doesn’t appear What it means: It means rail fares could rise above inflation under the Tories. Labour has pledged to renationalise the rail network, prompted in part by rising fares. On Heathrow Tory manifesto 2015: We will deliver on our National Infrastructure Plan and respond to the Airports Commission’s final report. Tory manifesto 2017: We will continue our programme of strategic national investments, including High Speed 2, Northern Powerhouse Rail and the expansion of Heathrow Airport What it means: Heathrow’s third runway is going ahead and Conservative candidates in seats where they at risk against anti-Heathrow Lib Dems will have to explain that on the south west London doorsteps. Among them will be Zac Goldsmith, standing again for the Tories in Richmond Park after quitting and sparking a by-election to protest the decision, which he subsequently lost to Lib Dem Sarah Olney. One small element of the Conservative manifesto promises to examine the method for selecting people for honours. It says: We will review the honours system to make sure it commands public confidence, rewards genuine public service and that recipients uphold the integrity of the honours bestowed. While there is no further explanation of what this will involve, it follows briefings from those around May that she wanted to move the system away from giving knighthoods and other gongs to civil servants and former special advisers, instead rewarding more people outside Westminster, particularly those who assist social mobility. It follows controversy about the last two lists of honours. David Cameron’s resignation list brought recognition to a series of No 10 and Tory party staffers, and the New Year’s collection – in part drawn up under Cameron – had awards for a series of senior officials. What the promised review of the system will actually bring remains to be seen. But it shows May remains keen on the idea. All that speculation about how the Conservative manifesto was going to be unusually short turned out to be wrong, the Press Association’s Ian Jones points out. The manifesto made no mention of air pollution, which MPs have described as a public health emergency. The Tories commit to investing £600m by 2020 to pursue a desire for “almost every car and van” to be zero-emissions by 2050, but they make no mention of pollution from diesel vehicles and the 40,000 premature deaths each year from air pollution. There is no mention either of tax changes to support the public to ditch their diesel cars in favour of less polluting alternatives, or a diesel scrappage scheme. David Timms, from Friends of the Earth, said: The lack of policies to deal with the dirty air crisis is astounding. Polluting car manufacturers will sleep easy knowing that they have been let off the hook, while children with asthma will continue to choke. This is a national disgrace which can’t be hidden behind planting a few trees. The one mention of air quality is a commitment to planting one million trees in towns and cities. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s World at One, Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, welcomed the Tories’ decision to drop their pledge not to put up income tax, national insurance or VAT. He told the programme: You saw the trouble the chancellor got into during the budget when he wanted to make a relatively modest change to one bit of the national insurance system. I don’t think this means they are looking for big increases in income tax and national insurance, though perhaps they might, but I do think it means they will want some flexibility to change for example the rates of national insurance for self-employed people. And some flexibility to respond if the public finances need it. Time after time when governments have had promises not to raise rates of income tax and so they have just continually broken those promises. It is rather better not to make the promise rather than make the promise and then break it, or what’s even worse make the promise, and then get the country into trouble because you don’t feel you can break. Johnson described the document as a “largely a steady as she goes kind of manifesto”. The Conservative manifesto includes the tantalising promise of creating a “sustainable business model for high-quality media online”. The industry as a whole had thus far failed to definitively answer the digital question and the Tories pledge to create a level playing field online for media and creative companies. “We will ensure content creators are appropriately rewarded for the content they make available online,” the manifesto says. The Tories have also pledged to introduce a levy on social media companies to fund awareness and “preventative activity” relating to issues such as inappropriate online content. May has also promised to clamp down on data gathering by social media companies with a ban on keeping information about young people. Further pleasing many newspaper editors, the Tories will not seek to proceed with a second judge-led inquiry into press misbehaviour, or Leveson 2, which was to investigate the relationship between the press and the police. The manifesto also states that the Tories will repeal a controversial law, called article 40, that could have forced publishers to pay the costs of the people who sue them, even if they win. The manifesto also confirms that Channel 4 will be forced to move out of London. The state-owned broadcaster, which has a £100m headquarters in Victoria, London, has been the subject of a relocation review with Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds considered frontrunners for a new base. The Tory manifesto will mean sleepless nights for university vice-chancellors. Their hopes have been dashed, with students still to be counted in immigration statistics and a further crackdown on student visas promised. On top of that, universities in England wanting to raise the top rate of tuition fees – which is all of them – will have to sponsor a free school or academy to qualify. And the manifesto promises a major review of funding across tertiary education to improve access, which could see higher education have to compete against its more cost-effective further education peers. In the schools sector in England, the manifesto, as expected, pledges a revival of grammar schools – although it avoids the phrase in favour of “selective schools” – and redirects £1bn to schools to smooth over losses caused by the new national funding formula. That will be largely be funded by scrapping universal free school meals for infants, an unloved policy. The eye-catching promise to help solve the shortage of teachers is an offer for student loans “forgiveness” for new teachers, in order to retain them within the profession. But there are no details of how any forgiveness would work in practice. There are also pledges to continue toughening up the school curriculum, and the vague threat of further school “accountability” at key stage three – the period between the national tests at the end of primary school and the start of GCSEs. Previously 14-year-olds were tested, but that was ended by Labour in 2009. Labour says the Conservative manifesto is just offering most working people and pensioners more insecurity. This is from Andrew Gwynne, the party’s co elections coordinator. Behind the rhetoric, this is a manifesto that offers the majority of working people and pensioners insecurity with a huge question mark over their living standards. The tax guarantee they previously made is gone. While they’ll guarantee corporation tax falls to 17p they’re dropping their promise not to raise income tax and National Insurance contributions, raising the spectre of tax rises on lower and middle incomes. No wonder they’ve dropped their previous promise to raising living standards and the phrase “living standards” doesn’t appear at all. This manifesto is proof the Tories are ditching any claim to stand up for older people. Pensioners stand to lose the pension guarantee in the next parliament, the winter fuel allowance is being hacked away at and their social care plans could see those who need care forced to pay for it with their homes. For our public services – slashed back by the Tories – there’s nothing but insecurity in these plans. They’ve failed to match Labour’s commitment on education and there’s no detail other than a vague promise on giving the NHS funding – a promise they made in the past and broke. The Tories stand up only for the few. For the many they offer the prospect of five years of insecurity. Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC that the spending plans in the Conservative manifesto would probably not require much extra tax. While there is not an absolute promise not to increase income tax or national insurance, what you have got is a pretty modest set of proposals which probably isn’t going to require terribly much in the way of tax increases. If you look at the Labour party proposals, they have costed out their spending proposals at a pretty big £75bn. To be clear, £75bn is a very, very big number indeed, and they have promised £50n of tax rises. The big difference is that from the Labour party we have a much bigger state, much more spending, much more tax. In the Conservative manifesto we have much more small-c conservatism. There isn’t a lot more spending or a lot more tax. He also said the Tories have left themselves “wriggle room” by keeping the target date of 2025 for eliminating the deficit. If you have been watching Sky News this morning, you may have heard Adam Boulton say that the Tories are limiting its access to cabinet ministers. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, would not speak to them, although he has done other broadcast interviews today, and so Sky had to show a clip from a BBC interview with Hunt instead. What’s going on? It is understood that advisers to Theresa May were particularly annoyed when Boulton speculated about the prime minister’s health as it became apparent that she was to make a statement outside Downing Street – the one she used to make the surprise announcement about the general election. Boulton infuriated May’s co-chief of staff, Fiona Hill, by claiming there were rumours that the prime minister, who has type-1 diabetes, could be suffering from ill health and about to respond. He then further angered Hill, who herself used to work at Sky News, by reading out a message she had sent. “You might want to tell Bunter that he should watch what he is saying about my boss’s health, utterly unfounded and untrue.” Advisers were said to be angry about a story from Sky’s senior political correspondent, Beth Rigby, which claimed cabinet ministers had said that the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, would be sidelined during the campaign. Jeremy Corbyn has been on the Jeremy Vine show on BBC Radio 2 this lunchtime. He told Vine that Labour would not immediately impose the 45p in the pound tax rate for those earning more than £80,000 if it won the election. The increase would be introduced gradually, he said Speaking about the new tax rate for people in this group, he said: I’m not saying how much they are going to actually have to pay straight away, we will put it up during the parliament. The government’s schedule of year-on-year funding increases for the NHS in England, drawn up while David Cameron was still prime minister, was due to run until 2020-21. That involves the question that has caused Theresa May persistent political difficulty – that is, whether the real amount of extra cash involved was the £8bn George Osborne pledged in the 2015 election campaign or the £10bn figure May has used repeatedly, despite health thinktanks, the Commons health select committee and NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens all saying that it isn’t true. So the Conservatives had to come up with a lightly extended version of that plan – some new numbers – given the new parliament will sit until 2022 and that Labour and the Lib Dems have pledged significant extra NHS funding. May’s response is a pledge that “we will increase NHS spending by a minimum of £8bn in real terms over the next five years, delivering an increase in real funding per head of the population for every year of the parliament”. But the manifesto provides no other detail. It doesn’t say, for example, how much of the £8bn by 2022 is already included in the previous funding plan - ie, how much over and above what was already planned the NHS will get. However, it does mean that May is ripping up the health budgetary plans she inherited from Cameron/Osborne by pledging, in effect, more money than planned in both next year and 2019-20 too. Those are the two years that - as Stevens had publicly pointed out in parliament in January, to May’s likely discomfort – were due to see per capita NHS spending fall, albeit by just 0.2% in each year. That was going to make transforming the way the NHS delivers care and making overdue improvements – notably in cancer, mental health and maternity services - harder to achieve, Stevens had warned. So the £8bn is a victory, albeit modest, for his public pleas for more cash than the £8bn promised in 2015. But while £8bn is and sounds like a lot of money, in NHS terms it is small beer. Bear in mind that the NHS budget in England this year will be £123.7bn. Therefore £8bn more over five years isn’t a lot of money. It is well below the extra sums that Labour (£37bn over the parliament) and Lib Dems (£6bn a year, but for both the NHS and social care). It is also far less than the minimum 4% a year budget increases that the Office for Budget Responsibility said last autumn the NHS would have to start receiving again after 2020 given the huge extra cost pressures that are due to come its way from the growing and even more rapidly-ageing population, increasing impact of lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes and also patient and doctor demand to access new drugs and technology. While 4% is a hefty increase, that is the average annual budget increase that the NHS enjoyed between its creation in 1948 and 2010, when the coalition took power. The CBI is worried about the Conservatives’ plans to cut immigration. This is from its director general, Carolyn Fairbairn. Firms will be therefore heartened by proposed increased R&amp;D spending, planned corporation tax reductions and a commitment to act on business rates. But the Conservative manifesto has an Achilles heel – in a global race for talent and innovation UK firms risk being left in the starting blocks because of a blunt approach to immigration. The next government can both control migration and support prosperity – it does not need to be an either-or choice. Decisions made in the next parliament will determine the UK’s economic destiny for a generation. And Brexit is the biggest and most complex task facing the next government – getting it right is vital for our country’s future prosperity. Torsten Bell, the Resolution Foundation director, has written an excellent blog about the Conservative manifesto, and the social care proposals in particular. Here is its verdict in a nutshell. After all, the big picture today is that Theresa May is proposing to significantly change our social care system to increase the volume of care people receive and is asking people with housing wealth to pay more for it. That marks the end of an era both for the Conservative party and possibly for the wider politics of intergenerational fairness. He points out that, on winter fuel payments, May is going well beyond what Labour was proposing in 2015. Ed Miliband just wanted to take them away from wealthy pensioners, saving the taxpayer £100m. May will take them away from all but the poorest 2 million pensioners (those on pensions credit), saving £1.7bn. As for whether the Tory proposals are a good idea or not, Bells says it depends on the alternative. Against the world as it stands today these plans are a clear improvement – addressing one of the two big problems of the current system: massive unmet need where people who need care do not receive it. Simply putting more money into the system matters a lot from this perspective. The new system will also be more progressive with those with assets under £100,000 doing much better, and those with the highest care needs requiring residential care also winning. The biggest losers are those with significant housing but little wider wealth who require expensive care in their own home for a long period of time. They have gone from having their housing wealth entirely protected to all of it over £100,000 being at risk. Technically, it might be unfair to call this a death tax, but it’s certainly a death charge paid by homeowners unlucky enough to need care. Against the benchmark of the previously promised system the assessment of the Conservative proposal becomes more complex. Dumping the Dilnot cap amounts to a decision to give up on a wider social insurance, with no limit on the costs you may have to bear for your social care if you have the means to pay for them – something that Sir Andrew convincingly argued against for economic and moral reasons. Just as now, the new proposals will mean individuals (and their families) bearing the financial risk of being unlucky enough to require very expensive care. Dementia will not only cost you the full enjoyment of later life but your ability to pass on to your children more than £100,000 of inheritance. That said, simply implementing the Dilnot cap without addressing the lack of funding and need for a higher means test that what today’s package amounts to was also deeply unsatisfactory as it focused resources on better off households with high care needs. The ideal care system would incorporate both the social insurance of Dilnot with the additional resources and progressive protection that today’s proposals amount to. Ukip has responded to the manifesto, with its leader, Paul Nuttall, arguing that under Theresa May the Conservatives have “become almost identical to the Labour party”, an argument that might come as a surprise to her and Jeremy Corbyn. Nuttall said: They offer no end to mass immigration, no firm Brexit, no end to spending billions of our hard-earned money on so-called foreign aid, and they offer no curb on our National Health Service being used as an international drop-in centre. Ukip will publish its “fully costed manifesto” next week, the Ukip statement adds, including big reductions in foreign aid and a promise of zero net migration. The Greens’ co-leader, Caroline Lucas, has released a statement calling the Conservatives’ plans on social care a “dementia tax”and the manifesto “deeply misguided”. She said: The social care changes will hit those in need worst, shifting the cost burden on to individuals and further undermining the welfare state. The lockdown on migration isn’t just economically illiterate and bad for business, it’s cruel too. In contrast, Lucas said, next week’s Green manifesto “will be setting out our vision for the confident and caring nation that we believe Britain can be”. Investors in two of the UK’s biggest energy companies seem relaxed over the detail of the long-promised price cap on bills. The share price of British Gas owner Centrica is up more than 2% and SSE is up 1.5%. While the Tories have promised in the campaign to cap the amount 17m households on standard variable tariffs pay, the final manifesto pledge is woolly, only promising to protect “more customers on the poorest value tariffs”. Perhaps the most striking energy policy is on fracking, where the Conservatives would remove the need for planning permission for companies undertaking exploratory shale drilling. That planning process has caused huge delays and headaches for the fracking industry, even after ministers attempted to fast-track planning applications, so this would be a significant change. The manifesto also promises a new shale regulator to speed things up. Onshore windfarms, which the Tories campaigned hard against in the 2015 general election, are still considered unacceptable in England, but will get government support in remote Scottish islands. Theresa May may disavow the term, but her Conservatism is different from Margaret Thatcher’s, or John Major’s, or David Cameron’s, and the final three paragraphs on page 9 of the manifesto (which Nick Watt mentioned in his question – see 12.26pm) provide as good a definition as any of what some of us will continue to call “Mayism”. Because Conservatism is not and never has been the philosophy described by caricaturists. We do not believe in untrammelled free markets. We reject the cult of selfish individualism. We abhor social division, injustice, unfairness and inequality. We see rigid dogma and ideology not just as needless but dangerous. True Conservatism means a commitment to country and community; a belief not just in society but in the good that government can do; a respect for the local and national institutions that bind us together; an insight that change is inevitable and change can be good, but that change should be shaped, through strong leadership and clear principles, for the common good. We know that our responsibility to one another is greater than the rights we hold as individuals. We know that we all have obligations to one another, because that is what community and nation demands. We understand that nobody, however powerful, has succeeded alone and that we all therefore have a debt to others. We respect the fact that society is a contract between the generations: a partnership between those who are living, those who have lived before us, and those who are yet to be born. In a recent Times column Michael Gove described May as “post-liberal”. That line about responsibilities to others outweighing our rights as individuals helps to define what Gove meant. (It also marks an interesting difference from Blairism; he pushed through a new clause IV for Labour saying “the rights we enjoy reflect the duties we owe”, implying responsibilities and rights having equal status, not that one outranks the other.) (Gove’s column was headlined: Now we will find out what Mayism stands for. He clearly thinks it exists, even if she doesn’t.) And the final sentence of the manifesto extract above is pure Edmund Burke. It is an adaptation of this quote from Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution in France. (My bold). Society is indeed a contract. Subordinate contracts for objects of mere occasional interest may be dissolved at pleasure – but the state ought not to be considered as nothing better than a partnership agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee, calico or tobacco, or some other such low concern, to be taken up for a little temporary interest, and to be dissolved by the fancy of the parties … it becomes a partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born. One element of the Conservative manifesto is how relatively briefly it deals with global environmental protection and climate change, which some argue is the pressing issue of the age. The section of the document about protecting the global environment runs to 133 words. In contrast, the paragraphs about allowing shale gas extraction and fracking takes up 306 words. Q: [From Newsnight’s Nick Watt] Page 9 of the manifesto says you reject the cult of selfish individualism (see 11.33am), and you reject rigid ideology. So is Mayism the rejection of Thatcherism? May replies: There is no Mayism. I know you journalists like to write about it. There is good, solid conservatism which puts the interests of the country and the interests of ordinary working people at the heart of everything we do in government. May says “there is no Mayism”, only “good, solid conservatism”. And that’s it. The Q&amp;A is over. Q: The manifesto does not say if high earners will pay more in tax. Will they? May says high earners face a choice, between a party that always has and always will believe in low taxes, and a Labour party whose instinct is to put up taxes. First reaction from Jeremy Corbyn, and it’s focused on the policies connected to older voters: Q: If you win seats like this one, Halifax, those new MPs will hold your feet to the fire to get a firm Brexit. So isn’t David Cameron deluded in thinking you will resist a hard Brexit. May says she does not think in terms of hard or soft Brexit. She wants the right Brexit. Q: What does this manifesto say about you and your philosophy? May says she thinks it shows that she is a good Conservative. Q: Why should people believe you can get net migration below 100,000? May said when she was home secretary the figures went down, then they went up again, and now they are going down. When we are outside the EU we will have more control. She explained in her speech why controlling immigration is so important. Q: [From the Daily Mail’s Jason Groves] Do you expect peers to drop opposition to leaving the single market if you win? And do you see yourself as a Thatcherite? May says she wants tariff-free and frictionless access to the single market. But you cannot be in it without effectively being in the EU, she says. On Thatcher she says: Margaret Thatcher was a Conservative, I’m a Conservative, this is a Conservative manifesto. Q: Are you moving to the centre ground? And are you proud of being a red Tory? May says the Tory party has always been in the centre ground. She wants to give people opportunity, and to encourage aspiration. You can now read – and download – the full manifesto from the Conservative party website. Q: Are you being upfront with older people? Are you saying they have done well, and now have to pay more? May says the triple lock was introduced when pensioners were not doing well. Now there is a risk that the younger generation won’t be better off. Pensions will continue to go up. Instead of the triple lock, there will be a double lock. Pensions will go up in line with earnings or inflation, whichever is higher. Q: Are you trying to redefine what it means to be a Conservative? And what do you say to people who claim your social care plan amounts to a death tax? May says the social care problem has been ducked for too long. This is the first proper plan to address this, she says. She says she wants to provide a system that gives people dignity in old age, but allows fairness across the generations. The editorial in George Osborne’s Evening Standard has an instant reaction to the manifesto - it’s almost as if he had someone send over a copy in advance. The verdict? Not exciting, but “sensible”: Anyone still expecting Theresa May to be the next Mrs Thatcher will be disappointed. There are no bold plans to roll back the frontiers of the state, or extend the private market into the public sphere. The small group of Brexiteers who think leaving the EU will turn Britain into a new low-tax, low-regulation Singapore will find their delusion exposed. Mrs May understands that this is not what most Leave voters want. Far from using Brexit as a chance to get rid of red tape, the Tories are using it as an excuse for extra regulation. However, the editorial adds, the major questions for the UK are connected to Brexit: “They are not answered in this manifesto, not least because Britain is not in sole control of the negotiations.” Q: [From Channel 4 News’ Gary Gibbon] Have you estimated the impact of cutting migration? And isn’t there an unfair gap between what happens to people whose parents get dementia and those who don’t? And the manifesto seems quite anti-business. Do you think business has got too greedy? May says the government wants to reduce immigration because of the impact it has on people at the low end of the income scale. It depresses wages, and puts pressure on services. On business, she says the manifesto sets out who the Tories want the UK to be the best place for businesses to grow. “But we do believe in responsible business.” She says since 2010 2.9m jobs have been created. Employment is higher than since records began, she says. Q: [From 5 News’ Andy Bell] Won’t people getting care in their own home pay more? And aren’t you turning your backs on middle England? May says this is the first time we have seen a proper plan for care. Those elderly people worried about paying for care in their home won’t have to worry. They won’t have to sell their home while they are living in it. The figure for the assets people can keep is being quadrupled. Q: [From Sky’s Faisal Islam] On page 36 the manifesto says you think no deal is better than a bad deal. Is this a mandate for leaving the EU with no deal? And wouldn’t that cause chaos? May says she wants the best deal for Britain. She wants a deal that works for the whole of the UK. Q: [From the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg] You are ditching many ideas you stood on two years ago. Some families will lose things, like free meals. You are pushing back deficit reduction. Isn’t this a bleak picture? May does not accept this. There are hard choices, she says. But that is what strong and stable leadership is about. She says for the first time ever the government is going to put forward a plan for social care. It is a plan that ensures fairness across the generations. School pupils are being offered a breakfast at the start of the day. An interesting potential change on policing: May invites people to join her on this journey, and to come with her as she fights for Britain. She raises her voice for her peroration (in a way that doesn’t quite come off.) And that’s it. The speech is over. May says her government will fight injustice wherever it is found. For example, it will introduce the first mental health bill for 30 years. But, above all, it will provide strong and stable leadership. We need that more than ever because the next five years will be among the most challenging the country has faced. Britain needs a clear plan, and the determination and the will to see it through. It is time to put the old tribal politics behind us and to unite behind getting the best deal for Britain. May says every vote for her and her team will strengthen her negotiating mandate. She says she is optimistic she can get a deal for all. May says with the right Brexit deal secured, “my mainstream government will deliver for mainstream Britain”. It will deliver for those who are just about managing. It wants every area of the country to prosper. It will keep taxes low and cap energy tariffs. It will build more homes. It will build a Britain in which the economy is strong. May says she has negotiated in Europe. She knows the best thing to do is to be clear about what you want. You cannot be half in and half out, she says. She says the British people made their choice. She respects that. Britain will form a new “deep and special partnership with Europe”. But it will reach out to other countries too. May says we need a new contract between the government and the people. She says it is the responsibility of leadership to be straight with people about the challenges ahead. That is what this manifesto does. It sets out how the government can face up to the five challenges facing the country. 1 Creating a strong economy 2 Brexit and a changing world 3 Tackling enduring social divisions. 4 Dealing with an ageing society 5 Dealing with fast-changing technology On education: May says building this Britain will not be easy. There will be obstacles in the way. Some will wish us to fail, she says. May says she wants Britain to be a place where people can go as far as their talent will take them, a place where it matters not where you are from but where you are going. All that should matter is the talent you have and how hard you are prepared to work, she says. She says we need to unleash the talent of every person. Theresa May is speaking now. She says the manifesto is a plan for a “stronger, fairer, more prosperous Britain”. It is a detailed programme for government, rooted in the experiences of ordinary people. She says, as we advance on the momentous journey of Brexit, we have a chance to ask what kind of country we want. She says she thinks we can emerge “stronger, fairer and more prosperous than ever before”. You can read the full manifesto here, it seems: David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is introducing Theresa May. He says the Brexit negotiations will be tough. May’s record as home secretary shows she is tough, he says. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart. Tories promise to eliminate deficit by 2025 This is from the Mirror’s Jack Blanchard. This is from the Observer’s Michael Savage. The Tory document is not online yet, but, in the meantime, here is Labour’s alternative version. This is from the FT’s Sebastian Payne. This is from my colleague Anushka Asthana. This is from ITV’s Robert Peston. This is from Sky’s Beth Rigby. At the manifesto launch copies of the document are now being handed out to journalists. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, says the Tory immigrations proposals would cause “huge damage to London’s economy”. Echoing what the SNP are saying about these policies (see 10.49am), he says: These Tory immigration policies are totally unworkable and will cause huge damage to London’s economy. This is yet another anti-London policy from the most anti-London government since Margaret Thatcher. Reducing net migration to the tens of thousands would make all Londoners poorer, cause huge damages to our public services like the NHS and schools, and make it impossible for us to build the affordable homes we need. We must do more to give Londoners the skills they need for the jobs of tomorrow, but Tory plans to introduce extra charges for businesses who have no choice but to hire highly skilled workers from overseas will stifle jobs and growth. London businesses need access to the most skilled workers from around the world. Theresa May has arrived at the venue for the Conservative manifesto launch in Halifax. The Evening Standard has published the findings of an Ipsos MORI poll showing Labour up eight points - but the Conservatives still well ahead. Here is an excerpt from Joe Murphy’s story. Labour has put on eight points, trimming the hefty Conservative lead to 15 points, while Mr Corbyn’s personal leadership ratings have slightly improved, found the Ipsos MORI survey, revealed exclusively in the Evening Standard. But Tim Farron’s Liberal Democrats see their support halved to just seven per cent, a level no better than the 2015 general election. Theresa May remains on course for a major victory on June 8, with the Conservatives unchanged on 49 per cent and Labour climbing from a rock-bottom 26 to 34 per cent. The Lib Dems are third on seven per cent, down from 14. But the biggest loser is Paul Nuttall’s crisis-stricken Ukip, down from four per cent to two per cent. Ukip is overtaken by the Greens, who edge up to three. This is from Fraser Nelson, editor of the pro-Conservative Spectator. In this week’s magazine Nelson has an article describing Theresa May as the most leftwing Tory leader for 40 years and explaining why her party tolerates that. Here is an extract. Mrs May is the most left-wing leader the Tories have had in perhaps 40 years. In normal times, this would set her at odds with the MPs on the right — the ones Sir John Major once referred to as the ‘bastards’, for whom regicide is a form of relaxation. But not now. The Thatcherite MPs are those who are most committed to Brexit; having regarded the whole idea of leaving the EU as a dirty fantasy, they still cannot quite believe that it is coming true. For them, the national question — leaving the European Union and crushing the Scottish Nationalists — matters more than gas bills. As one senior Tory puts it: ‘As a Conservative I have three priorities: the nation, security, and a low-tax economy. David Cameron gave me none of those three — Theresa May gives me two. So I’ll bank those two and back her, and worry about the rest later.’ There is also a belief that Conservatism’s strength lies in being opportunistic, and ideologically flexible. So if the public want some pick-and-mix, a bit of banker-bashing with their Brexit, then Tories will cheer Mrs May as she delivers it ... For those Conservatives who think that the party’s role is to keep the bad guys out of power, things could not be going better. ‘If an energy price cap is the price we pay for destroying Labour in its heartlands, then I’ll pay it ten times over,’ says one MP. It’s an example of the strategic shamelessness which many Tories see as the party’s election-winning secret. When Lord Salisbury was prime minister, he said that Gladstone’s existence was the Conservative party’s greatest source of strength. Now it’s Jeremy Corbyn who is the great Tory unifier. So the Conservatives are mutating from being the party of low taxation to the party of Brexit. They may regain their love of free enterprise when Britain has left the EU. Either way, it seems likely that in ten years’ time there will still be a clear Tory majority. And for now that seems to be all that matters. Ukip held a press conference earlier to outline their energy policy and it’s fair to say it was a slate of policies not shared by many other parties in this election. Roger Helmer, the Ukip MEP and longtime energy spokesman for the party, is an avowed sceptic about human-created climate change, and the policies he outlined reflected this. Ukip are calling for the repeal of the Climate Change Act and withdrawal from the Paris climate accord – Helmer said he had recently read a letter from some MEPs to Donald Trump, asking that the US president fulfil his promise to leave the Paris deal. Helmer argued that green energy policies were causing “an industrial massacre”, and making it “increasingly difficult for energy intensive industries to survive in Europe”, as well as causing fuel poverty among many households. Ukip would remove VAT from domestic fuel, end subsidies for renewable technologies and focus on what he called “grown up” energy, not “playground technologies like wind farms”. Helmer accepted he was a climate change sceptic, but insisted this did not mean the energy policies pushed Ukip to the political fringes on the issue: We know that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, nobody is arguing with that. But it is just one factor among many … Nothing is happening to the planet today that hasn’t happened before or that requires a special explanation. The press conference heard from another Ukip MEP, Tim Aker, who said the party would particularly target pro-remain Tories. He used a fairly unusual image to explain the party’s electoral mission: We have got to make sure that we have Ukip MPs on the backbenches, the Vietcong in the trees, making sure that if they don’t deliver, if they don’t do what the people want, we will be there to strike. Sky’s Adam Boulton has tweeted a picture of the set in the hall where Theresa May will launch the manifesto. There’s an uneasy stand-off going on outside the Tories’ manifesto launch venue here in sunny Halifax. A small group of protesters have unveiled a Unite-branded banner in front of the Theresa May battle bus, saying “End Zero Hours”. They’re shouting slogans including “Tory scum not welcome in Halifax”; and “come out and meet the people Theresa!” The police are standing awkwardly by - and the Conservative press minders are looking on with horror. Not quite the optics they were looking for. Like the Unison general secretary Dave Prentis (see 10.29am), Labour’s Jess Phillips is worried that the Tory plan could just end up as a profits bonanza for care providers. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, says the Tory proposals mean Labour is now the party for older people. The SNP’s George Kerevan, an academic economist, has the same analysis of the Tory care plans as the Conservative Bow Group. (See 10.03am.) Here Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, on the Tory social care plan. Bell has also produced a good “fix” to the Daily Mail splash headline. Responding to this tweet. He commented: Michael Russell, the Brexit minister in the SNP government in Scotland, has condemned the Conservative plan to keep the target for getting annual net migration under 100,000. The SNP’s Andrew Wilson says some Scottish Tories interpret this as meaning Scotland should have annual net migration of under 10,000. Responding to this, Russell said this would be “complete madness”. Unite campaigners are at the Tory manifesto launch where they have unveiled a banner calling for the end of zero-hours contracts. The Lib Dems claim the Tory manifesto proposals show “the nasty party is back”. This is from their campaign spokesperson, Ed Davey. It is clear the more you need, the more you pay with May. Theresa May is betraying working families by snatching school lunches from their children and their homes when they die. The nasty party is back – hitting families from cradle to grave. The choices she’s made in her manifesto will hurt over half a million frail elderly people and almost 2 million children. The National Pensioners Convention says the Tory social care plans offer pensioners “the worst of all possible worlds”. This is from its general secretary, Jan Shortt. The Conservatives’ manifesto pledge on social care offers the worst of all possible worlds for millions of older people and their families. It’s a Frankenstein’s monster of a plan which bolts lots of bad policies together and still fails to tackle the real unfairness in the care system. Every single pensioner needing care at home will now be forced to pay, regardless of their income, because for the first time ever the value of their home will be taken into account, whilst the number of those in care homes that will benefit will be relatively small by comparison. What makes it worse is that to pay for this proposal, around 9 million pensioners are going to lose their winter fuel allowance and all pensioners will see the value of their state pension fall once the triple lock is removed. This plan has completely failed to spread the risk and cost of social care across society as a whole, and in effect has left the burden on the shoulders of millions of older people and their families. It’s actually quite unbelievable that the Conservatives, who rely on the support of older voters, would make such a controversial and punitive proposal. They clearly have no intention of solving the social care crisis. Dave Prentis, the Unison general secretary, whose union represents people working in health and social care, has also criticised the Tory plans. Caroline Lucas, the Green party co-leader, has criticised the Tories’ care plans. Theresa May has chosen Halifax to launch the Tory manifesto – the latest in a string of visits to the north-east that underlines the Tories’ determination to seize seats in traditionally Labour areas. Labour’s Holly Lynch had a majority of just 428 over the Conservatives in 2015. Here is Sky’s political editor, Faisal Islam, on the Conservative plan for social care. On Sky News Adam Boulton says he has seen the set from the hall in Halifax, where the Tory manifesto is being launched at 11.15. He says there is no mention of Theresa May or “strong and stable leadership” on the branding, which he says represents a new approach. The Bow Group, a Conservative party thinktank which used to be establishment and centrist but which in recent years has focused on goading the party leadership, has put out a press statement denouncing the care plans as “the biggest stealth tax in history”. This is from its chairman, Ben Harris-Quinney. These proposals will mean that the majority of property owning citizens could be transferring the bulk of their assets to the government upon death for care they have already paid a lifetime of taxes to receive. It is a tax on death and on inheritance. It will mean that in the end, the government will have taken the lion’s share of a lifetime earnings in taxes. If enacted, it is likely to represent the biggest stealth tax in history and when people understand that they will be leaving most of their estate to the government, rather than their families, the Conservative party will experience a dramatic loss of support. Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester and health secretary in 2010 when Labour floated a plan to fund social care with a 10% levy on estates (the “death tax”), has rejected the Demos claim (see 9.47am) that the Tory plans are similar to his. Andrew Dilnot may not be very happy about the Conservative party’s social care plans, but the Demos thinktank is supportive. This is from its chief executive, Claudia Wood, a social care specialist. (Bold type from the Demos release.) Social care currently has a means and a needs test – in other words, you have to be both really poor, and really ill, to get funding support from your council. The Conservative manifesto pledges to change the means-testing element of this – shifting the benchmark upwards so that those with assets worth more than £100,000 have to pay for all of their care. This calculation includes the value of a person’s home, so the vast majority of home-owning older people will find they have to pay. This may seem unfair, but the current asset threshold is already very low (£23,250) – meaning not only all homeowners, but many social renters with modest retirement savings also have to pay for all of their residential care. The large jump in the threshold will means hundreds of thousands of the poorest older people will have access to partially or fully funded residential care for the first time. However, the substantive difference in the manifesto is that the asset test will now also apply to care in one’s own home. This will expand the number of self-payers substantially in this market, but it does bring parity between residential and home care, improving the clarity of the assessment system. It may also make it easier to move between care in one’s own home and in residential care; up until now, this was never seen as viable, as people often had to sell their home to pay for residential care. This is where the manifesto is a game-changer – it pledges that people will not have to sell their home in order to pay for their care while they or their partner are alive – flexibility that has never been possible before. The answer lies in equity release – financial products which essentially allow you to mortgage a portion of your home in return for cash to pay for care, which is then paid back with interest when you sell up or, in many cases, when you die, and your beneficiaries will have to pay up. All in all, it’s basically a rerun of the Andy Burnham policy the Conservatives labelled ‘the death tax’ – an idea that remains a reasonable policy solution to this most pressing of issues. Here are the key points from Jeremy Hunt’s Today programme interview. Hunt, the health secretary, said the Conservative manifesto would include plans for extra spending on the NHS. Asked about this, he said: You will have to wait and see, but you will see a commitment to increase spending on the NHS, yes, above the promises that we’ve made to date. He claimed the cabinet was “completely united” behind Theresa May’s decision to keep the Tory target for getting annual net migration below 100,000. An editorial in the Evening Standard, which is now edited by the former Tory chancellor George Osborne, claimed yesterday that May was the only senior cabinet member who actually believed in the policy. Hunt denied this, and said the policy was important because it showed the government was listening to the concerns of voters. I think you’ll find the cabinet, and including me, are completely united behind Theresa May on this because we believe that the worst possible thing we could do is to take that Brexit vote and to pretend that we were listening to it, and then not actually listen to the real message which is that many people have concerns about immigration, that they think the political establishment has ignored for a very long time. What Theresa May is saying is: ‘Well I’m not going to ignore those concerns, I’m going to listen to those concerns’, because that is the kind of prime minister she wants to be. The reason we are making this promise again is because we are listening to the message that people gave the political establishment on 23 June last year, which said that they wanted control of the border, of our borders, and they wanted immigration reduced. He defended the Tory manifesto plan to double the charge for firms hiring workers from outside the EU on skilled visas from £1,000 to £2,000. He said: Everyone recognises the incredibly important role that immigration has in our society, of course I recognise it particularly in the NHS, where we have brilliant work done by workers from the EU and other overseas countries. But what is not fair is if you bring in these workers from overseas, but then you don’t train up your own people and give them the skills such that they can do some of these higher paid jobs. What we’re saying to businesses is that we all have a social responsibility and if you are benefiting by bringing in workers from overseas, then you need to help pay to train people in this country so that they can access those higher paid jobs. That’s very, very important if we’re going to have a social contract where people support a capitalist market system, then people have to feel it’s fair to everyone. I’ve beefed up our earlier post on Andrew Dilnot’s Today interview about the Conservatives plans for social care. Dilnot, an economist who now runs an Oxford college, was appointed by the coalition government to chair a commission looking at social care and in 2011 it produced a report that was seen offering a potential long-term funding solution. But the coalition government first watered down the plans and then, having gone into the 2015 election pledging to introduce them, David Cameron’s Conservative government then shelved implementation until 2020. Today’s manifesto means the Dilnot blueprint is now dead and buried. Dilnot is clearly furious, as you can see from what he said earlier (although he concealed his anger with classic English reserve). (See 7.31am.) Here is some reaction to the Dilnot interview. From the Times’ Matt Chorley From the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg From the Health Service Journal editor Alastair McLellan Q: You will promise to get the deficit down. Why on earth should anyone believe that? You can do better than that, Nick, Hunt says. The deficit has been reduced. It is at the same level it was when the financial crisis started. We said, because of Brexit, we needed a little more flexibility. Q: Will there be more money for the NHS? Hunt says there will be a commitment to increase spending on the NHS, above the promises already made. Hunt says the Conservative manifesto will propose extra spending on the NHS. Q: Are you going to stay in your job? Hunt says Robinson should not make assumptions about who will win the election. And that’s it. Q: Will you listen to businesses that say they are opposed to having to pay twice as much to hire a foreign worker? Hunt says what is not fair is to allow firms to hire from overseas without paying to train people in the UK. Q: Why are you promising to get immigration below 100,000 when you have not done that for seven years? Isn’t that insulting to people’s intelligence? Hunt says the government could not do that because it was in the EU. The government is listening to people. Q: George Osborne, in the Evening Standard, says no cabinet minister backs this in private. I have never met a minister who in private thinks this is a good idea. Hunt says he thinks this is a good idea. He says the government has to show it is listening to what people want. Q: If you are cared for at home, you will have to spend much of the value of your home for your care. So it is meaningless to say they will be able to pass on their home to their children. Hunt says people who go into a care home have to use up their money until they are left with just £23,000. The Tories will quadruple that figure. He says the Tories have looked at the Andrew Dilnot proposal ... Q: It was your proposal. It was in your last manifesto. But we have dropped it, he says. He says the Tories do not think the Dilnot plan was fair. This is about fairness between the generations, he says. Q: You say your plan will protect people’s homes. But the average home is worth £225,000. You will only let people keep assets of £100,000. So anyone inheriting the average house will have a mortgage on it. People will not be able to inherit the home. Effectively this is a death tax. Hunt says he does not accept that. The party does think that assets saved up over a lifetime should be used to pay for care costs. The government will protect £100,000. People will be able to pass that on. Nick Robinson is interviewing Jeremy Hunt. Robinson starts by saying the last Tory manifesto promised to put a cap on how much people would have to pay for their care costs. That policy has been abandoned. Now there will be a floor instead (you won’t have to pay once your assets are reduced to a certain level). And the value of your home will be taken into account. Q: Why have you changed the rules? Hunt says he wants to correct Robinson. He says at the moment the value of a person’s home is taken into account when it is assessed if they have to pay for care in a care home. But it is not taken into account when people receiving care in their own home are billed. He says the Tory plan will mean the same rule applies to both groups. He says the Tory manifesto shows the party is prepared to make difficult choices. You would expect the Tory manifesto to talk about defence and the police. But it is focusing on care because this is an issue that people worry about, he says. People want to know that they can pass on their savings. At the moment people can be “completely cleaned out”. Good morning. I’m taking over from Claire. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, is about to be interviewed on Today about the Conservative manifesto launch and the party’s plans to make the elderly pay more for social care. I’m now handing over the live blog to Andrew Sparrow, who’ll take you through the rest of the day. To have our daily election briefing freshly delivered to your inbox tomorrow – and every weekday – morning, do sign up here. My colleague Alan Travis has compiled a list of five things to look out for when the Conservative manifesto is officially unveiled later this morning. You can read the full article here – but this is an intriguing question: What’s on offer for a working class kid from Brixton, Birmingham, Bolton or Bradford? This was a question asked in a 2016 article by May’s joint chief of staff, Nick Timothy, who was raised in a Brummie working-class family, which identified the Tories’ most serious weakness as “the perception that we simply do not give a toss about ordinary people”. He said an approach was needed that continued to help the very poor and fought injustices based on gender, race and sexuality but the party also needed to “adopt a relentless focus on governing in the interests of ordinary, working people”. He argued that previous Tory governments had got this right on welfare reform, increasing the minimum wage and the “northern powerhouse”. But he said they had lost sight of their interests on energy policy, housebuilding, immigration, tax credit cuts, protecting pensioner benefits, and the profile of spending cuts. Look out for evidence of this bigger vision of what might be called Mayism in the manifesto. Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives have also announced – as Welsh Labour did earlier – that they will suspend campaigning today following the death of former first minister Rhodri Morgan. Leanne Wood, the leader of Plaid Cymru, is due to appear this evening in ITV’s leaders’ debates, following last night’s ITV Wales version. She’ll be joined by Nicola Sturgeon, Tim Farron, Caroline Lucas and Paul Nuttall – but not by Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn, who have said they won’t take part. As deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg introduced free school lunches for infants. That scheme could now be scrapped, with the Conservative manifesto promising to cancel it in exchange for free breakfasts for all primary school pupils (an estimated saving, the Tories say, of £650 a year per pupil). Clegg has this morning called it a “cynical” move: Barbara Keeley, Labour’s shadow minister for social care, has criticised the Tory proposals: In their last manifesto they promised a cap on care costs. But they broke their promise, letting older and vulnerable people down. It’s the Tories who have pushed social care into crisis; their cuts to councils have meant £4.6bn axed from social care budgets between 2010 and 2015, leaving 1.2 million people struggling to get by without care. The Labour manifesto published earlier included a pledge for an increase in social care budgets of £8bn over the five-year parliament, with £1bn in the first year. It said this would mean: ending 15-minute care visits and providing care workers with paid travel time, access to training and an option to choose regular hours. It also set out plans to: place a maximum limit on lifetime personal contributions to care costs, raise the asset threshold below which people are entitled to state support, and provide free end-of-life care. But it did not set out precisely how that would be funded, saying it would “seek consensus” on the answer: There are different ways the necessary monies can be raised. We will seek consensus on a cross-party basis about how it should be funded, with options including wealth taxes, an employer care contribution or a new social care levy. Andrew Dilnot – who led the review into funding for social care in England in 2011 but whose proposals were shelved after the Tories won the 2015 election – has been speaking to the Today programme and labels the plans set out by the Conservatives this morning as new thinking that shows a less than full understanding of the problems. He says the plans so far trailed in the Tory manifesto “fail to tackle what I’d argue is the biggest problem of all”, which is that with social care there is “nothing you can do to protect yourself”. People cannot insure themselves against the costs of care in later life, something Dilnot describes as a “classic example of a market failure”. They’re tackling completely different questions and the disappointment about these proposals that we’re expecting to hear in the Conservative manifesto later is that they fail to tackle what I’d argue is probably the biggest problem of all in social care, which is that at the moment people are faced with a position of no control. There’s nothing you can do to protect yourself against care costs, you can’t insure it because the privater sector won’t insure it, and by refusing to implement the cap [Dilnot’s own proposal] that Conservatives are now saying they’re not going to provide social insurance for it. So people will be left helpless knowing that what will happen is if they’re unlucky enough to suffer the need for care costs, they’ll be entirely on their own until they’re down to the last £100,000, all of their wealth including their house. Dilnot says he is “very disappointed” with the proposals, adding that Theresa May had previously pledged to tackle broken markets. This was an absolute open goal for that type of approach and it seems to have been missed. Dilnot says that some people will be helped by the Tory plans, but he says the majority of people receiving care in their own homes, rather than in residential care, “will find themselves worse off”. What’s being done on the means test will help some people, although many people, the majority of people who are getting care not in a residential care home but in their own home, will find themselves worse off. So the changes are not bad in themselves. It is just that they fail to tackle the central problem that scares most people ... The analogy is a bit like saying to somebody: you can’t insure your house against burning down, if it does burn down then you’re completely on your own, you have to pay for all of it until you’re down to the last £100,000 of all your assets and income. There’s been some work going on in the Cabinet Office recently to think about what might come next, there’s the proposal for a green paper after the election. So I’m very surprised there is such specific information that appears to be new thinking, new thinking that I’d argue shows a less than full understanding of the problems, when there’s a green paper that’s due to come out later this year. Welsh Labour has suspended campaigning today after the death of Rhodri Morgan, its former leader and Welsh first minister. Tributes from across party lines have been paid to Morgan, who was 77. The Welsh Labour leader, Carwyn Jones: Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn: Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood: Leader of the Welsh Conservatives Andrew RT Davies: While the traditional Tory-supporting press has shouldered the shift that saw Theresa May champion an energy bill cap that was roundly lambasted when proposed by Ed Miliband as Labour leader, the social care changes are prompting a more guarded response. “Middle-class pensioners to lose benefits under Tory plan to fund social care,” is the Telegraph’s lead this morning. The Daily Mail is pleased that elderly people won’t be compelled to sell their home to fund care, but adds: “Tens of thousands more will be forced to pay and winter fuel benefit will be axed for millions.” Andrew Dilnot carried out a government review into funding for social care in England in 2011. One of its key recommendations was that an individual’s contributions to their care should be capped – that cap had already been deferred by the Conservative government until 2020. Now it looks set to be dropped in today’s manifesto. Dilnot told the Times – which reports “tens of thousands more people will be made to pay for their care in old age” – today: It’s extremely disappointing that no attempt is being made to provide risk-pooling or social insurance. People will still be left to manage the risk to which they are exposed. Welcome back as we hit the “really – there’s still three weeks until polling day?” mark. I’m Claire Phipps with the morning roundup and the early news; Andrew Sparrow will be along later. Join us in the comments below or on Twitter @Claire_Phipps. What’s happening? It’s here: the day when Team Theresa May, the party formerly known as the Conservatives, tells us some actual policies. Hack through the knotweed of strong and stables, and coalitions of chaos, into a clearing where hitherto elusive details of tax and social care and migration might be spotted, along with a beleaguered fox. What do we know? Having studiously pretended that they just weren’t into the commitment thing, the Tories have at the last moment plighted their troth. We have numbers, some of them with £ signs attached. Elderly people can have £100,000 in assets (up from £23,250) before they’ll be asked to pay for social care, but they will be asked to pay whether in their own home or elsewhere. There’ll be no cap on costs, but a promise that nobody will have to sell their home for care while they’re alive – which translates to a bill once they’re not. Of course, as Labour’s Andy Burnham was not the first or last to point out, this used to be snarled at by some as a “death tax”. But that was back in the days when caps on energy bills were “Marxist” and not official Conservative policy. You can read May’s pitch in her own words in the Telegraph and in the Sun today, if you don’t mind that a lot of those words are “strong”. But here’s the nitty-gritty. Winter fuel payments for pensioners will be means-tested. The pensions triple lock will be undone. Charges for firms employing foreign workers, and for overseas visitors using the NHS, will be upped. There’ll be no such thing as a free school lunch but there will be free breakfasts for all primary pupils, a saving the Tories claim will boost schools funding by £4bn by 2022. The Sun, lauding the PM as a “consumer champion”, says a “trains ombudsman will be created to stand up for furious passengers”, presumably because there are no seats. In the still don’t know column sits anything firm on tax, and what Brexit means. But watch out for the third rolling-out of the policy – perhaps more of a vague wish this time – to cut net migration to the tens of thousands. An editorial in George Osborne’s Evening Standard yesterday claimed none of the cabinet were behind the quixotic pledge: All would be glad to see the back of something that has caused the Conservative party such public grief. Could there be a better segue into Boris Johnson’s latest adventure? The foreign secretary has apologised after using a rare day release to the campaign trail, to a Sikh gurdwara in Bristol, to plug one of his favourite topics: don’t worry about Brexit – we can sell a load of whisky to India! Drinking alcohol is forbidden in some Sikh teachings, and the Sikh Federation pointed out that those who have taken intoxicants are not supposed to enter a temple. Johnson’s aides said “there was no gaffe”, but Johnson’s aides’ gaffe tolerance levels might by now be calibrated differently to most. No real missteps in the ITV Wales leaders’ debate, which centred on Brexit: Ukip’s Neil Hamilton wants a “clean Brexit”, while Labour’s Carwyn Jones wants a “sensible” one. Lib Dem Mark Williams warned it could be “disastrous” for Wales, and the Plaid Cymru leader, Leanne Wood, said Wales has been ignored (although the country did vote for Brexit and that’s certainly been clocked). The Welsh Conservative leader, Andrew RT Davies, said “strong and stable” and “coalition of chaos” and occasionally some other words. Tonight it’s the full-blown ITV leaders’ debate, minus May and Jeremy Corbyn, who’ll send spin doctors instead to pick holes in the arguments they won’t be making. It does mean we’ll hear more of what the other parties are proposing: you can get up to speed on the Lib Dem manifesto – and its commitment to raise £1bn by legalising cannabis – here; the sums are here. At a glance: Labour’s Rhodri Morgan, ‘father of Welsh devolution’, dies at 77. Labour suspends Aberdeen councillors over coalition with Tories. Inquiry launched into targeting of UK voters through social media. Guardian view on the Lib Dem manifesto: unlikely to get the vote out. Poll position A fresh YouGov poll for the Times dunks the Tories down a point to 45%, with Labour up two to 32%. And a curious GFK poll for Business Insider pronounces Corbyn a “bigger vote-winner than Tony Blair”, with 31% saying they “would consider voting Labour” under its current leadership, against 23% who might give it a whirl should Toxic Tony magically spirit himself back into contention, a proposal that not even the most devout Blairite (yes, they still walk among us) is offering. Springtime 1997 Blair was, if memory serves, scoring a tad higher. Against other, actual party leaders, Corbyn fares worse, with a net approval rating of -30 versus May’s +16. Paul Nuttall (-28), Nicola Sturgeon (-23) and Tim Farron (-11) also get the thumbs down. Diary At 9.30am Ukip shows off its energy policy; that’s in London. The main event is at 11.15am, with the Conservative manifesto launch in West Yorkshire. Then this evening it’s the ITV leaders’ debate minus the two prime ministerial candidates, at 8pm in Salford. Expect to see Nicola Sturgeon, Tim Farron, Caroline Lucas, Paul Nuttall and Leanne Wood. Read these BuzzFeed analysis by Tom Phillips and Jim Waterson reveals rather different travel tactics by the two party leaders: Jeremy Corbyn has visited only two seats so far where Labour is defending a small majority in the election campaign … The leader has visited none of the party’s 40 most vulnerable seats, and just two – Southampton Test and York Central – of the 100 most at risk. Instead, Corbyn has spent the vast majority of his campaign in either safe Labour constituencies or Conservative-held marginals, the analysis shows … Theresa May, meanwhile, has largely focused her visits to Conservative-held seats with relatively low majorities, which have the potential to be losses. She’s been to seven seats that fall within the Conservatives’ 100 most vulnerable, versus just three that lie outside it. Of those three, one was her own safe seat of Maidenhead. Anne Perkins, in the Guardian, says the Lib Dem pitch as the party of the 48% is flailing: The trouble is that the remain vote has turned out to be much flakier than it felt last June, or even at the time of the Richmond byelection … The wound is healing. Unsurprisingly, this is not turning out well for the party. Instead of the usual election pattern of the Lib Dems picking up support as their name recognition and familiarity grows, this time it seems to be leaking away. Outside London and the south-east of England, campaigners are barely fighting on the national platform at all. They are fighting old-fashioned local campaigns about schools and hospitals. Revelation of the day Nigel Farage just can’t seem to stop those darned gun metaphors toppling out of his mouth. After sparking upset last year – barely a week after the murder of Jo Cox – with his claim that the vote to leave the EU had been won “without a single bullet being fired”, he took the opportunity this week to warn that if Brexit didn’t mean proper, full-on, Ukippy Brexit: I will be forced to don khaki, pick up a rifle and head for the front lines.

There has to be action when an alarm detects \"elevated levels of radioactivity\" on the perimeter fence at the north of a site which is home to the world's largest civil plutonium stockpile. It now seems that naturally-occurring radon was responsible for triggering the alarms, but the private sector managers were right to keep thousands of non-essential staff at home while they investigated. The British nuclear industry has a fairly decent safety record, but prudence and openness is vital because the global atomic industry has long been associated with secrecy and has in the past initially underplayed incidents, the worst being the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine. Proceeding with utmost caution at Sellafield is also vital given there has been repeated criticism of the consortium that now runs this site, Nuclear Management Partners, by a succession of parliamentary committees. The National Audit Office argued in a report published a little over a year ago that the deteriorating conditions of radioactive waste storage at Sellafield posed a \"significant risk to people and the environment\". More recently, accountants KPMG, working for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, accused NMP of overspending, failure to reach operational targets and weak leadership at the atomic complex in Cumbria. The bulk of the Sellafield work now being performed by upwards of 10,000 staff is to reprocess fuel and decommission plants such as the world's first provider of commercial nuclear power, Calder Hall, as well as look after atomic waste storage ponds and plutonium, the latter a legacy of bomb-making during the cold war. The Sellafield site has been at the centre of concern in the past, one of the most recent and serious incidents being in 2005 when a leak was discovered in the Thorp reprocessing plant. There were fears the leak had gone undetected for months and although no one was injured, Sellafield Ltd, which then managed the site, was fined £500,000 for breaches of health and safety law. There was also a scandal in 1999 over the falsification of quality assurance data but the worst incident at Sellafield, then-called Windscale, came in 1957 when a fire broke out which resulted in significant quantities of radioactive material being released into the environment. The wider context of this current safety scare is that Britain is moving towards a new generation of nuclear power plants, starting with Hinkley Point C in Somerset – proposed by EDF of France. This comes after decades when the industry looked as if it might be wound up in the UK. These new facilities should be far safer than any predecessors but the human factor will always remain. While Germany has started to shut its nuclear plants following the Fukushima disaster in Japan, the government here has gone in the opposite direction, seeing atomic power as a major generator of low-carbon electricity needed to address the issues of climate change and energy security. And as David Cameron and François Hollande discussed, among other things, the nuclear industry on Friday, the European commission came out with a detailed report explaining why it believed the financial support mechanism proposed for Hinkley represented a subsidy and could be against competition rules. All eyes are on the managers at Sellafield to prove that the nuclear industry has entered a new era – not one of 100% safety, which no one can guarantee, but one of transparency, openness and efficient safety management."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/aug/06/is-it-too-late-to-stop-turkeys-coal-rush","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-06T11:01:54Z","webTitle":"Is it too late to stop Turkey's coal rush?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/06/is-it-too-late-to-stop-turkeys-coal-rush","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/aug/06/is-it-too-late-to-stop-turkeys-coal-rush","fields":{"headline":"Is it too late to stop Turkey's coal rush?","bodyText":"The smell is sharp and smoky, with a metallic tinge, and very, very strong. “That,” says Yıldırım Biçici, “is the smell of coal”. The tea-shop owner’s home is just a couple of hundred metres from a huge, ageing coal-fired power plant in central Turkey, whose red-and-white chimneys spew dirty fumes. Biçici has lived amid the smoke for decades but now finds himself on the frontline of the nation’s new coal rush: the Afşin-Elbistan station is planning to expand into the biggest coal-fired power plant in the world. Sitting on a little wooden stool in the shabby square of Goğulhan village, Biçici says: “There are warnings on cigarette packets saying don’t smoke, but here we have no choice.” Waving his hand through the pungent air, he says: “We have to smoke.” Biçici’s mother died of lung cancer – “we figured it was the air pollution” – and his four-year-old daughter Gülbeyaz has chronic bronchitis. “It is so sad, we don’t let her go out even if the weather is nice,” he says. Turkey has very big plans for coal, with more than 80 new plants in the pipeline, equivalent in capacity to the UK’s entire power sector. The scale of the coal rush is greater than any country on Earth, after China and India. It is pushing forward in a year when the world’s nations must seal a deal to combat climate change at a crunch UN summit in Paris in December and when scientists have warned that 80% of known coal reserves must stay in the ground. Turkey is desperate to keep stoking its fast-growing economy and to wean itself off its enormous dependence on Russian gas. But opponents warn that coal brings a heavy human health toll, estimated to already cost Turkey several billion Euros a year, and they point to the virtual absence of solar power in the sunny country. A short drive from Goğulhan, Hussein Alp Aslan, is looking down on vast 20km-long opencast coal mine that feeds the Afşin-Elbistan plant with low-quality, highly polluting lignite coal. The patchwork of ochres and greys, smouldering fires and gigantic insect-like machines tearing at the seams, is laid out beneath a fringe of sharp mountains and a blue sky. “I feel like I am in hell,” says Aslan, the vice-director of the public hospital in the nearby town of Elbistan. “What are the problems? First health, second health and third health,” he says, citing a string of respiratory diseases and cancers. “Twenty-nine years ago [when the first plant opened], people were so happy,” Aslan says. “They thought they were going to be rich. But they didn’t know they were going to have to spend that money on medical treatment. They started poor, were rich for a short time, and then died poor.” Aslan is clear how Turkey’s future energy needs should be met: “Turkey is a sunny country and in this region we could build hundreds of wind turbines. What is most beautiful about wind turbines is they are built in isolated areas where nobody goes. Coal should be the last option.” But Afşin-Elbistan sits on the largest coal deposit in Turkey and the existing plants and mine employ about 2,800 people. About 700km to the north, on the Black Sea coast, lies Zonguldak. Here, the smokestacks of three coal-fired power plants form a snaking line along the floor of a steep, forested valley, including the nation’s first plant which opened 70 years ago. It is indisputably a coal town. The football team was named Coal Sports, the school Black Diamond and a new $1bn coal power station is planned here, backed by Chinese investors. Zonguldak hosts one of Turkey’s few hard coal reserves and standing inside a pitch-black tunnel, just off one of the hairpin bends that leads to the road out of the valley, miner Murat Sahin says: “I like the job – it’s kind of a privilege. We like the fact that coal is heating people’s homes, and producing electricity. We feel productive.” For Sahin, coal itself is not the problem, but the way it it used. “I agree with the air pollution concerns, but they have to take the correct measures to put filters on the power stations, and they are not doing it,” he says. “We have to use local resources. Would you prefer nuclear power here? It is much more dirty – look at Chernobyl.” He smiles away concerns for his own health, with the coal dust picking out the laughter lines around his eyes: “That’s an advantage of the job: miners never grow old.” The small mine, producing 600 tonnes a day from its 4km of tunnels, is owned by Musa Demir. He is far less enthusiastic about the future of coal than his government, saying he has had to lay off half his 630 workers. His costs have been pushed up by new regulations following the 2014 mining disaster at Soma which killed 311 men and shocked the nation, which had the deadliest coal mining safety record in the world. Demir says he may be the last generation of his family working in coal: “I don’t want my three sons to work in coal mining. It is not very profitable now and I lost my brother in a coal mining accident. I don’t want that to happen to them.” The Turkish government has emphasised the use of indigenous resources in pushing its coal rush, but 95% of the fuel used by plants built in the last five years has come from abroad. Opposition to these coal imports is an issue that unites both the coal miners and local groups campaigning against the new plant in Zonguldak, where a green mountain spur on the coast is being cut away to expand the port. Unlike at Afşin-Elbistan, a small but determined opposition is growing, and has been recently joined by Kadir Orhan, who used to work at the plant. Overlooking one of the giant pits at Zonguldak, where the pastel-coloured ash from the power stations is dumped at a rate of 400 tonnes a day, Orhan reflects on the 26 years he spent working at one of the town’s power plants and the pollution it caused. “I have faced some challenges with that. I saw what was going on at first hand,” he says. He was laid off eight months ago when the plant was privatised and has now become the first person in the town to put solar photovoltaic panels on his house. “I am trying to show you can do something,” Orhan says, as a large yellow truck grinds past, drifts of pale ash spilling from the back. A recent Bloomberg New Energy Finance report, commissioned by WWF-Turkey, found that expanding Turkey’s wind, solar and hydropower could meet its energy needs for the same cost as the coal rush, while keeping carbon emissions level. If Turkey’s coal rush is to be headed off, it will happen in places like Amasra. The ancient fishing town, 100km east of Zonguldak, is popular with tourists and here even the coal miners oppose the plans for four large power plants, the first in the region. “We are living here and we will be affected by the air pollution,” says Engin Pazar, who works in the underground mine which is a 20-minute walk from the pretty seafront. “Coal mining is our work, but we are opposed. There are wind and solar opportunities – the government should support these first.” Here, close to the oldest monuments in the Black Sea region at Tios, whose history stretches back 2,400 years, Professor Erdoğan Atmiş is one of the leaders of a powerful groundswell of protest. Demonstrations have included a 7km human chain and 42,000 - one in four - of the district’s population writing letters of protest. “No matter how tall the chimneys, people will suffer, just like London in the 1950s,” he says. Atmiş is a forestry expert at a local university and points to a 36km swathe cut through the region’s famous forests for power lines in December. The move, he says, is intended to make the approval process for the power plants a fait accompli, as is a new coal mine in Amasra. The campaigners thought they had won in 2012 when a court ruled in their favour. But the then environment minister Erdoğan Bayraktar did not endorse the legal ruling, as required. Bayraktar was forced to resign in 2013, amid a major corruption scandal which led police to investigate allegations of bribery for construction projects. The threat of the coal plants remains and in the nearby village of Tarlaağzi the locals fear the impact of air pollution and the digging of deep ash pits. Hatice Erfidan says: “It makes me so anxious I can’t even sleep. They should build some solar power plants. I lived in Saarbrücken in Germany for 40 years and there were solar panels everywhere, and wind power too.” Fiery words from the village head, Sakir Karabacak, reflect the passion of the campaigners: “We are afraid the new plants will mean the end of the villages. They could try to expel us, because we would not go by ourselves. But they would have to kill us – or we will kill them.” The Amasra campaigners are drawing inspiration from the victory of the people of Gerze, 300km further along the Black Sea coast. Here, in 2013, after 24-hour vigils to block construction sites and other protests, opponents won a legal battle and killed off plans for a large coal power plant. But many other coal plants across Turkey appear likely to go ahead. The Guardian requested interviews with Turkey’s energy ministry, the environment ministry and the companies involved in the various projects, but none were granted. Government support for coal is strong, including substantial subsidies, but projects in the newly privatised industry require financing. On 16th floor of Garanti Bank’s headquarters in Istanbul, the glass walls show a glittering panorama of the booming city as executive vice president Ebru Dildar Edin explains the bank’s approach. Garanti Bank is the biggest funder of Turkey’s new coal plants and Edin says the projects represent attractive loans because the low price of coal makes them look profitable. But she acknowledges pollution and climate change concerns: “It is not good that gas plants will be replaced by coal.” Edin says Garanti Bank imposes tougher environmental and social conditions on its loans and has turned down a coal project that would not agree to them. It was funded, nevertheless, by another bank. Edin also points to the half of the bank’s energy loans that are not for coal, but split between wind and hydro power. Turkey’s has just 3.5GW of wind power - the UK already has 13GW - but a third of that was financed by Garanti Bank and she agrees with green campaigners that solar power must grow fast. The international spotlight will focus on Turkey when it hosts a G20 summit in November, just weeks ahead of the crunch UN climate summit in Paris. One issue could be the big coal projects that are reliant on imported fuel, which Edin says are likely to need foreign finance: “I don’t think there will be a big appetite for these from Turkish banks.” But this is not a barrier to the $12bn proposals at the Afşin-Elbistan complex, which sits on its own vast lignite reserves. A stone’s throw from the plant, in the acrid atmosphere of Goğulhan village, Biçici seems resigned about the prospect of living in the shadow of the world’s biggest coal plant. “We have already lost our land. We have little left to lose,” he says. He explains he was forced by the authorities to sell the 7.5 hectares, on which he grew wheat and sunflowers, to the mine in 2011, at a knock-down price. Biçici, who has lived in the village for all of his 47 years, says: “I think of leaving, but I can’t afford to go.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2014/dec/08/terry-jones-fairytales-dont-have-to-be-grimm-nicobobinus-musical","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-08T08:00:08Z","webTitle":"Terry Jones: why fairytales don’t have to be Grimm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/dec/08/terry-jones-fairytales-dont-have-to-be-grimm-nicobobinus-musical","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2014/dec/08/terry-jones-fairytales-dont-have-to-be-grimm-nicobobinus-musical","fields":{"headline":"Terry Jones: why fairytales don’t have to be Grimm","bodyText":"When my daughter Sally was five, I said: “Whoopee! Now I can read some fairytales to her!” So I went out and bought Children’s and Household Tales by the Brothers Grimm. And that night, I read Snow White to Sally. Now, I don’t know if you remember, but at the end of the original Grimm version, Snow White’s wicked stepmother is made to put on red-hot iron slippers and dance until she falls down dead. This came as something of a shock. I always thought fairytales had happy-ever-after endings. And I didn’t want my five-year-old daughter going to sleep thinking: “Thank goodness they tortured that old woman to death.” That’s when I decided to write Fairy Tales, my own book of stories. And they came easily, I suppose, because my mental age is about 10. In the first week, I wrote two stories a day and read them to Sally at bedtime. I judged the stories by how well she received them. ForIn the second week, I couldn’t keep up the pace and wrote only one a day. Then I faltered and wrote a story every other day. Nevertheless, by the end of the month, I had accumulated 30 stories. The Corn Dolly was based on a child who was always complaining, while The Silly King was just a silly story Sally loved. The Fly-By-Night is exactly what it says, but The Glass Cupboard and The Wind Ghosts are (surprisingly) about nuclear power, but you can’t read any morals into them. The Witch and the Rainbow Cat I wrote for Sally because of her enormous appetite for stories about witches. Dr Bonocolus’s Devil is a new version of the Faust legend: here, the cleverest man in the world sells his soul to a fool. Nicobobinus, however, was different. I wrote this book four years later. Sally was older and embroiled in all of that formative stuff girls have to do – who’s friends with who, who isn’t friends with who, who stuck a sticker on the back of whose jumper calling them a twit, or whatever the insult of the time was. Nicobobinus, the boy who could do anything, came out of my yearning for a more innocent world. It begins: “This is the story of the most extraordinary child who ever stuck his tongue out at the prime minister. His name was Nicobobinus. He lived a long time ago, in a city called Venice, and he could do anything. Of course, not everybody knew he could do anything. In fact, only his best friend, Rosie, knew he could, and nobody took any notice of anything Rosie said, because she was always having wild ideas anyway.” Nico and Rosie’s friendship is a proper friendship between a boy and a girl – she really does believe he can do anything; and because she believes it, he believes it too. Never mind that the world around them is as corrupt as it always has been (the book is full of crooked doctors, kings and religious figures – all after Nicobobinus’s golden arm, which they’re willing to cut off with the usual gung-ho attitude of plunderers). Pretty much all the grownups – the ivory poachers, the bankers, the frackers – come off badly. Only the dragons are vaguely honourable. Since there’s no meanness, no mistrust, between Nico and Rosie, they succeed against the odds, finding the cure to his “deathgold” and turning him back into flesh and blood – hoorah! The critics were embarrassing in their praise of Fairy Tales. The Times said “Lucky Sally Jones”, while the Financial Times called me “an author setting out to rival the classic fairytales and making an exciting job of it”. Nicobobinus, however, received not a jot of that sort of praise. And yet, over the years, it is the book that has surprised me most – it might not have made it into the mainstream consciousness, like Erik the Viking or Life of Brian, but people who have loved it, have loved it hard and have kept it dear to them. So when a young theatre director called John Ward approached me about the stage rights in 2010, I was surprised. John was so full of enthusiasm for the story (“my favourite book EVER”) and for its potential as a musical that I found myself swept along. Last year, I went to see an early version of the show, produced by John’s company DumbWise and Red Ladder, and found it something very different to that little book I’d written so long ago. It was funny (of course) and silly (thank god), but also, well, contemporary – not at all the museum piece it might have been. A new and shiny thing made with all the energy, thoughtfulness and resilience of a generation who’ve had it harder than mine. I recently asked Sally what she thought of Nicobobinus. She said it wasn’t her favourite. I might make her come and see the show with me. • Nicobobinus, a co-production between Red Ladder and DumbWise, is at the Lost theatre in Wandsworth, London SW8, from 11 December to 4 January.

David Cameron's reported desire to cap their numbers would mean building more offshore wind turbines or nuclear power stations, both of which are more expensive. In 2013, the 4,338 wind turbines dotted across the country generated almost 5% of Britain's electricity, an increase of a third on the previous year. Together, those turbines have a capacity of over 7GW, enough to power 3.8m homes. Windfarms have often encountered huge local opposition. Some analysts attribute this to the fact that about 90% are owned by large energy companies, rather than being owned by local communities – as in Germany. The government was rattled by a letter opposing onshore windfarms sent to the prime minister in 2012 by 100 Conservative MPs and has been careful not to set a specific target for future turbine numbers. Ministers have also cut the subsidies for onshore windfarms and changed planning rules to make it harder to get permission for new turbines. However, the most recent government \"scenario\" envisages significant growth in onshore windfarms to 11-13 GW. There are currently just over 3,000 new turbines in construction or with planning approval. If all were built, that reach a total of 13GW of generation capacity. An additional 3,350 turbines (8GW) are in the planning system, although many are likely to be refused permission. The head of the Committee on Climate Change - the government's official climate adviser, has said that objections against windfarms for blighting landscapes were legitimate but that suggestions wind power was too intermittent to be useful were \"rubbish\". Adair Turner said: \"If someone argues they passionately believe that windmills are bad for the aesthetic environment and are willing to do more nuclear instead, or willing to bear the cost of offshore wind, that is a real argument.\" Suggestions that turbines can cause ill health have been debunked and there is little evidence that erecting turbines damages property prices. In opinion polls, onshore wind power is consistently supported by a large majority of the UK public, even when asked about having turbines built near their homes and even among Conservative and Ukip voters. But the minority who are strongly opposed tripled to 21% between 2010 and 2012 in Guardian polling. After solar energy, wind power is routinely more popular than all other energy technologies, including shale gas and nuclear. A key objection raised by opponents is that the subsidies given to onshore windfarms make them too expensive. Billpayers each paid £9 in 2013, or 0.7% of the average dual-fuel bill, to support onshore wind. But polling also shows majority support for the subsidies. The price of electricity from onshore wind per kilowatt is higher than that from gas-fired power stations. But wind power is virtually zero-carbon and the UK is committed to cut its carbon emissions by 50% by 2025. Low-carbon nuclear power from the planned new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset will be more expensive than onshore wind, under current subsidy plans, as are offshore wind farms, making it more expensive to meet the UK's climate change targets. They also note that green energy currently receives far lower subsidies than the nuclear or oil and gas industries did in their early stages of development."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/jan/09/nuclear-decommissioning-authority-axes-commercial-director-role","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-01-09T17:56:37Z","webTitle":"Nuclear Decommissioning Authority axes commercial director role","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/09/nuclear-decommissioning-authority-axes-commercial-director-role","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/jan/09/nuclear-decommissioning-authority-axes-commercial-director-role","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear Decommissioning Authority axes commercial director role","bodyText":"The role of commercial director of the much criticised public body overseeing the cleanup of Britain's old nuclear power stations has been axed amid a wider management shakeup. The exit of Sean Balmer, who has been at the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority for eight years, follows recent heavy criticism of the organisation's performance, particularly at Sellafield in Cumbria. John Clarke, the chief executive of the NDA, has scrapped the commercial director post and created three new positions on his executive team including one full-time job looking after Sellafield, the UK's largest atomic complex. The moves also follow the departure of the chief operating officer, Mark Lesinski, before Christmas and the planned exit at the end of March of the head of human resources, Jim McLaughlin. Clarke was subjected to ferocious criticism from politicians at a meeting of the Commons public accounts committee that expressed grave concerns over the estimated £70bn cost to the taxpayer of work at Sellafield. The NDA boss appeared at before the committee alongside Tom Zarges, the boss of the NDA's private sector contractor Nuclear Management Partners (NMP) which has just been controversially reappointed to clean up Sellafield. Clarke insisted that the reappointment was the best way forward even though he admitted NMP had repeatedly failed to meet many of its targets, while Zarges said he was \"humbled and truly sorry\" for cost overruns and an expenses scandal. Clarke said the latest management changes would improve the performance of his organisation. \"It was always the case that the role of the NDA would change as the private sector takes a greater role in delivering our mission and it's important that the make-up of our executive team reflects that,\" he said. \"I'm confident that these changes will place us in good shape to face the challenges that lie ahead as we strive to accelerate the cleanup of the UK's nuclear legacy while delivering value for money for the taxpayer,\" he added. Clarke said that Peter Lutwyche, from Jacobs Engineering, would take on the Sellafield director role while David Vineall, from Tata Steel, would take over from McLaughlin in the spring. The NDA employs only 300 staff directly but is responsible for overseeing annual spending of over £2bn on cleaning up the sites where nuclear power stations have ceased operation having come to the end of their working lives. The Sellafield facility, first used by the ministry of defence for making atom bombs, also includes Calder Hall which was Britain's first nuclear power plant, the THORP atomic fuel reprocessing plant and the Magnox nuclear fuel reprocessing plant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/nov/14/un-climate-change-summit-paris-planet-future-balance-science","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-14T22:03:18Z","webTitle":"The planet’s future is in the balance.

But a transformation is already under way","bodyText":"We Homo sapiens got lucky. Very lucky. Back in the 1920s, when looking for a “safe” gas to use in refrigerators, chlorine was the element of choice in a new family of manmade chemical compounds – chlorofluorocarbons. In the 1970s, Paul Crutzen, Mario Molina and Sherwood Rowland discovered that while it was safe in our fridges, it was destroying the ozone layer, which is essential to protect all life on land. Luck struck twice. Nasa scientists measuring ozone above Antarctica in the 1980s never saw the ozone hole in their data. Their computers were programmed to ignore any figures deemed “impossible”. Luckily, the British Antarctic Survey had no such technology and sounded the alarm. In 1987, nations signed the Montreal Protocol outlawing CFCs. But here luck comes in threes. Bromine is as good as chlorine for fridges and air conditioners, but about 40 times more corrosive to ozone. And by mere chance, the industry chose chlorine as the global standard. If this had not happened, the ozone layer could have been ripped apart before we even knew it. In 1995, Crutzen, Molina and Rowland were awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry, obviously. This story barely gets mentioned in the history books covering the 20th century, but it is a significant subplot in an emerging meta-narrative of our species. In this narrative, the most significant event in the last century was not the world wars, the Cold War, the Great Depression, civil rights, or the moon landings. It was when our species overtook the great forces of nature to become the most significant driver of change of Earth’s biosphere, the space where life exists. It is this event that historians and geologists will be poring over for centuries to come. They will either wonder why, if this knowledge was known, did our species fail to act to prevent catastrophe after catastrophe – the tragedy of the global commons – or they will wonder how we found the political will and technology to navigate towards a safe and just future. The trajectory of our planet is in the balance. At the same time, ending poverty and ensuring there is food, clean water and energy for all are within our grasp. Remarkably, 2015 is the make-or-break year and all the signs are there that we are changing course – a great transformation is not only within sight, it is under way. Here’s why. First, world leaders met in New York recently to agree the sustainable development goals – applying equally to all nations. This is a paradigm shift in thinking; it acknowledges for the first time that our wellbeing, the global economy and human development all rely on a stable biosphere and that this very stability is at risk. Second, we have reached “peak child”; the number of children in the world is no longer increasing. Population will eventually stabilise at 10-12 billion. And third, world leaders meet again next month to seek a workable solution to the climate challenge. The best evidence from science indicates that there is still time to avoid dangerous climate change, but the window of opportunity is closing rapidly. The world’s biggest emitters – China and the US – are showing real global leadership for the first time. US leadership during the ozone crisis was critical to providing the necessary confidence to spark bold action by many nations. But first, more drama: we can articulate precisely how high the stakes have become. Last week, we learned that the Earth had passed two new landmarks. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere crossed the 400 parts per million threshold. The last time carbon dioxide levels were this high was at least three million years ago, before modern humans existed and in a very different climate to today’s. Scientists estimate that if we really wanted to safeguard a stable climate, then our limit should be around 350ppm. The second landmark is linked directly to greenhouse gases. It was announced that the Earth’s temperature is 1C above pre-industrial levels. We are halfway to the 2C limit agreed by world leaders in 2009. Emissions of greenhouse gases are changing the global carbon cycle. Damming, water extraction, irrigation and climate change are affecting the global water cycle. We use an area the size of South America to grow our crops and an area the size of Africa for our livestock. We move more sediment and rock than natural processes. Biodiversity is reaching mass extinction rates. There have only been five mass extinctions in Earth’s 4.6bn-year history; the last, 65m years ago, ended the reign of the dinosaurs. The oceans are becoming more acidic at a rate not seen for at least 55m years. Don’t get me wrong. These changes have been remarkable for human wellbeing. Artificial fertilisers mean we can feed more people. Diseases are being eradicated on a global scale. We, in wealthy nations at least, live longer, healthier lives. But we have done this with a frontiers worldview – we have believed we can always expand and grow into new spaces to accommodate our needs. This is no longer tenable. We need to update our worldview: we are no longer a small world on a big planet. We are now a big world on a small planet. The base upon which we have built all of this is a stable biosphere. As long as the Earth was relatively large, with good resilience and ample abundance of resource, we could benefit from subsidies from ample natural resources, a forgiving ecosystem and a stable climate. Ecosystems provide fresh water, pollination, fertile soil and food. Indeed, the stability of the global climate over the past 11,000 years, which geologists call the Holocene, has been the foundation for our global civilisation. In 2000, Paul Crutzen proposed that Earth has left the Holocene and had entered a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene, where humans dominate. This is not the result of some gradual transition over the 200,000 years since we emerged from the plains of Africa. We have hit the Earth like a comet. We became a phenomenal global force in a single lifetime – since around 1950, with most change happening in the last few decades. The Anthropocene is up there with Copernicus’s heliocentricity or Darwin’s theory of evolution as one of the most profound shifts in worldview that has emerged from scientific endeavour. Since Crutzen’s remarkable intervention at a meeting of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, the race has been on to answer one of the two biggest questions in science: if we are beyond Holocene boundaries, how stable is the Earth’s biosphere? A tipping point is a scientific concept best captured by the idiom “the straw that broke the camel’s back”, or by the scene in Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life where a waiter places a “wafer-thin mint” in the mouth of a grossly obese man – Mr Creosote – who explodes. We know Earth has lurched across tipping points before, causing temperatures to change drastically in a matter of decades as the planet slips into a new regime. Given that the Holocene is the only state we know can support a population of 7.3 billion, a degree of caution would be advisable to avoid Mr Creosote’s fate. While we are beginning to put together a picture of the Earth’s tipping points, the precise thresholds beyond which we risk irreversible change, deleterious for human societies, are as yet unknown. Earlier this year, my colleagues and I published our latest assessment on the state of the biosphere and the parameters that must be safeguarded to remain within Holocene-like conditions. We confirmed our previous work, showing that there are nine planetary boundaries relating to, for example, ozone, fresh-water use, ocean acidification, new chemicals (such as CFCs) and aerosols – small particles in the atmosphere. We estimated that the Earth has crossed four boundaries as a result of human activity, relating to climate change, biodiversity loss, deforestation and fertiliser use. We are in a danger zone. If we cross one tipping point then we risk crossing them all. So, we have reached the critical moment. What happens next is up to us. But we are already seeing warning signs. With just a 1C rise in temperature, there are strong indications that some parts of Antarctica are destabilising. This probably commits us over the next centuries to another one metre sea level rise (in addition to the up to one metre sea level rise committed to over the coming century, according to most science), and which could be a prelude to a long-term sea level rise of six to seven metres if the trend of tipping points continue. If we burn all known reserves of fossil fuels, the Antarctic ice sheet will melt completely, causing a rise in sea level of around 58 metres. Given the implications, speculative drilling for oil in the Arctic may one day be seen as a crime against humanity. Closer to home, climate change is implicated in Syria’s civil war. The unprecedented drought in 2007-10, which climate models indicate can be expected to be repeated in the region as greenhouse gases rise, led to a mass migration to cities, contributing to civil unrest and political instability. If we carry on emitting greenhouse gases, then by the end of the century the world will be 4C warmer than just before the Industrial Revolution. This will be devastating in itself, but by that stage climate change may be difficult to stop and may trigger accelerated change. Hence the political consensus that going beyond 2C is “dangerous” and must be avoided. Setting such a planetary guard rail is critical, even though our scientific planetary boundary for climate change is set at 1.5C, showing that even 2C – a political “boundary” – is a risky threshold for humanity. But after 21 years of trying, nations have yet to agree a global pact to avoid this fate. This is why, earlier this year, my colleagues and I published the Earth Statement, outlining the eight essential ingredients of a successful agreement in Paris. This has now been signed by business, political and religious leaders including Richard Branson, Arianna Huffington, Mary Robinson, Desmond Tutu, Al Gore and Paul Polman. In the weeks before the Paris summit, we have launched a social media campaign, This Is My #EarthStatement, to build public support. Instead of signing an online petition, people can sign their own bodies and post photographs online to show not just a strong message to politicians, but also personal commitment to act. We’ve seen enormous support from sports stars such as Olympic skier Julia Mancuso, musicians, business leaders and politicians – next week, 15 mayors from major capital cities will sign to show their support. Will the change be fast enough? Will emissions cuts be deep enough? So to the other most important question in science: how can societies transform? Science is good at solving constrained problems, such as “what is the structure of DNA?” or “how do you land on the moon?” Or even “what are the Holocene boundaries?”. It is less good at “wicked” problems, such as poverty and overpopulation. In the Anthropocene, we have “super wicked” problems (first identified by Kelly Levin, Benjamin Cashore, Graeme Auld and Steven Bernstein), where time is running out, there is no central control and the people attempting to solve the problem caused it in the first place . In this environment, transformation emerges when worldviews change (science can be a good driver here), when new goals are set, when rules are introduced (and enforced), when the flow of information changes and when confidence reaches a threshold and spreads throughout the network like wildfire. I believe the building blocks are in place. The shift in worldview is represented by the Anthropocene. After the largest consultation in the history of the UN, the sustainable development goals provide the new compass point. The planetary boundaries framework is a mind-shift in the relationship between people and planet and a first attempt to set some rules to minimise risk. Information flows have altered radically since the internet revolution. Three billion people have access to the internet and there are 7bn mobile phone subscriptions. In the next decade, this will explode further. The priorities of the UN goals are clear and aligned with science – end poverty, decarbonise the global economy, halt biodiversity loss and protect the remaining forests on Earth. We need nothing less than a new industrial revolution for rapid transformation. Incremental change is not enough. Moore’s Law describes how computer processor speeds double every two years. The entire industry is now built on this foundation – and this changes how companies operate. We need a Moore’s Law for global sustainability. We need to get on a curve where entire sectors of the economy will change radically in the next few decades. If global sustainability becomes the compass point for a million hi-tech entrepreneurs and developers from Bangalore to Tokyo to Silicon Valley and Stockholm, then this industry alone will put a significant dent in the universe, to paraphrase Steve Jobs. But technology is not enough. Policy support is essential. We need to decarbonise the global economy by 2050 and run on 100% clean energy. We need a price on carbon. We need to keep within a carbon budget of one trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide – or 27 years at current emissions rates. We need a $100bn-a-year investment in sustainable energy systems for rapidly developing countries. We need to invest in adaptation to the change that is now inevitable. And we need 193 nations to unite. These are the foundational principles of the Earth Statement. And here is the good news. The transformation is under way. Copenhagen has announced it will be free of fossil fuels by 2025. Now Sweden is seriously talking about being the first fossil-fuel-free country. I believe it could do this as early as 2030. Imagine the signal this will send. Germany aims to decarbonise the world’s fourth largest economy without relying on nuclear power. The UK has a climate law legally binding the country to 80% emission reductions by 2050. Now let’s return to Paul Crutzen. The Dutch chemist was one of the founders of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, set up in 1987 to coordinate research internationally on global change. The findings that emerged from this research are changing how we think about our relationship with the planet, not least during the Anthropocene. It has had a seminal influence on the creation of a new academic discipline: Earth systems science. After almost 30 years of operation, it closes this year. In its place, we need a new research programme – a global endeavour with the vision of the Apollo missions – to ensure the stability of Earth’s biosphere. Or, to quote Mark Watney (Matt Damon) in The Martian, we need to “science the shit out of this”. This will require a new type of science to support the transformation of societies, one that brings together climate researchers and Earth systems scientists with economists, behavioural scientists, ecologists, health specialists, engineers and many more. It must also engage business, policymakers and the public in a new way. Unlike Watley, no single country can do this alone. The international research programme developed to support this is called Future Earth, which meets in Japan this week. It is bringing together the world’s leading intellectual might to tackle the greatest scientific challenge of our time and it needs the support of all nations.

It wants to see 10 new reactors built over the next few years. It sees this as a critical part of its carbon management strategy, and absolutely necessary to help \"keep the lights on\". It believes it will strengthen the UK's energy security at a time when North Sea oil and gas continues to decline. It is working closely with a wide range of energy companies to help deliver the 10 new reactors. That's the plan. Some think it's great; some don't much like it, but see it as a necessary part of addressing accelerating climate change; some think it is seriously misguided. It doesn't really matter what you think: it cannot possibly deliver – primarily for economic reasons. Nuclear reactors are massively expensive. They take a long time to build. And even when they're up and running, they're nothing like as reliable as the industry would have us believe. Few if any companies have balance sheets that are strong enough to cover the capital costs of a new reactor – with a starting price today of about £6bn, and growing by an average of 15% per annum. For that reason, the funding has to come either from private investors or from governments: no reactor has ever been built anywhere in the world without substantial government subsidy, and no reactor ever will be built without substantial government funding in future. However, private investors are not enamoured by nuclear power. The construction risks are too high (with cost overruns and substantial delays all but guaranteed), and the political risks (with governments constantly changing their mind about levels of support) even higher. The higher the risk, the higher the costs of capital. Which means governments always have to step in – including the UK government. For the time being, ministers in DECC are sticking to the wording of the Coalition Agreement that a new nuclear programme can only proceed \"provided that they receive no public subsidy\". This is now so transparently dishonest that it will not be possible to maintain that fiction for much longer, especially when the details of the electricity market reform (EMR) proposals are published. Here's their dilemma. Ministers wanted to have lots of companies competing to build the ten reactors. Three of the most significant players, (RWEnpower, EON UK and Scottish and Southern Electricity), have already dropped out. Both GDFSuez and Centrica have been giving out very strong signals to investors that they are about to drop out. Most of the rest of the companies left in are too small or incapable to bother about. That leaves EDF, a nuclear giant, 85% owned by the French government. Just three years ago, EDF's chief executive could be heard crowing about the fact that EDF would need no public subsidy to build its EPRs (European pressurised reactors) here in the UK. Today, his senior directors are pretty much permanently camped out in the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) demanding eye-watering levels of financial support for the four reactors they hope to build at Hinkley Point and Sizewell. The going wholesale price for electricity at the moment is around £45/MWh. Under the EMR, the government is offering \"contracts for difference\" to cover the extra cost of nuclear – the so-called \"strike price\". Calculating the scale of those extra costs is tricky, not least because it is impossible to believe anything the industry says about future costs. Estimates vary between £60/MWh and £90/MWh, with most independent commentators veering towards the high end rather than the low end. The amount of subsidy required for just four reactors, £90/MWh, would be £2bn a year for 30 years. £60bn. For 10 reactors, it would be £5bn a year for 30 years. £150bn And you need to understand that this figure doesn't take into account any of the other forms of subsidy on offer (be it in the form of a carbon price floor or massively subsidised insurance arrangements to cover the possibility of nuclear accidents), let alone the massive liabilities for cleaning up our existing nuclear power programme, which come in at about £7bn a year. From a taxpayers' point of view, that's a minimum of £12bn a year to support an industry that is meant to be receiving \"no public subsidy\". The implications of all this for an already shambolic government are enormous. George Osborne is deeply concerned about the costs of \"the green agenda\". How could he possibly wave this through in the name of a low-carbon economy, when he could get infinitely better value for our money by investing in energy efficiency and renewables? And as for the Lib Dems, either they renege on the Coalition Agreement, and come out firmly against these proposals, or they go into the next election as liars to a man and woman. • Jonathon Porritt, Tom Burke, Charles Secrett and Tony Juniper have produced a series of six briefings to help inform the public debate about nuclear power. On 12 March, they wrote to the prime minister to warn him that his current proposals will end in failure. As yet, they have not received a reply."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/may/20/clean-energy-beacons-of-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-20T09:10:09Z","webTitle":"From Kansas to Copenhagen: clean energy beacons around the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/20/clean-energy-beacons-of-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/may/20/clean-energy-beacons-of-the-world","fields":{"headline":"From Kansas to Copenhagen: clean energy beacons around the world","bodyText":"With global demand for energy continuing to rise and fossil fuel production buoyed by $5.3tn (£3.4tn) in tax-payer subsidies annually, it is easy to lose hope that cleaner forms of energy will ever catch up. But there are beacons around the world showing the way to an energy future that does not run on coal, oil and gas. Here are nine places that are blazing a trail to a less polluting future. Greensburg, Kansas It was only through total disaster that the aptly-named Greensberg, a sleepy, Republican whistle–stop on the Kansas prairie, was able to transform itself into America’s greenest town. After a massive tornado destroyed 95% of the buildings in the town in 2007, the 1,400 residents had to choose if they would rebuild or relocate. A tough choice in a town that had been in decline for decades. About half the townspeople left, but a group of residents established a master plan to rebuild the town as an energy-saving, renewable energy haven. Just outside the town, they built a 12.5MW wind farm. This supplies 300% of the town’s electricity, with the excess pumped into the Kansas grid. But key to this green resurrection has been energy efficiency. Because of the ability to rebuild from scratch, residents were able to apply the most modern building techniques to Greensberg 2.0. The town now has the highest concentration of gold and platinum eco-design rated buildings in the US and all of its street lights are LED. All large government buildings are now rated platinum. This saves the town over $200,000 a year and, more importantly, reduces the town’s dependence on generating electricity. Samsø Since winning a Danish government competition for designing a carbon neutral community in 1997, the island of Samsø, off the east coast of the Danish mainland, and its 3,800 residents have pioneered energy independence. The island has been carbon neutral for aabout five years. All of Samsø’s electricity is produced by 21 wind turbines and 70% of its heating is produced from biomass boilers. The wind electricity the island generates more than offsets the fossil fuels burned by the community’s vehicles and ferries, and plans are afoot to shift over to electric vehicles. By making initial investments in the project, “Samsingers” own about 70% of their electricity infrastructure through a cooperative model. Scientific American has called it “an alternative view of the future”. Iceland Few places are as thoroughly predisposed to life without fossil fuels as Iceland. This spectacular volcanic land sits at the head of the mid-Atlantic ridge, where the tectonic plates of North America and Eurasia are splitting apart and the Earth’s mantle bubbles towards the surface. The Icelandic people, so long impoverished by their reliance on burning peat and imported coal from Europe to survive, have harnessed this heat to enable an almost total transition from the fossil-powered past. All of Iceland’s electricity comes from renewable sources, three quarters from hydroelectric dams on the glaciers and mountain sides and the rest from geothermal. Bores are drilled 1-2 miles into the thin crust of earth. Water pumped down into the hot rocks returns as high pressure steam, spinning turbines to produce electricity. The country also uses this heat directly. Two-thirds of the country’s primary energy comes from geothermal. Hot water is everywhere and is tapped to heat homes and offices. The streets of Reykjavik are kept snow and ice free in winter through a system of heated water pipes. None of this, however, has stopped the Icelandic government seeking to exploit the oil and gas reserves of its surrounding seas. El Hierro, Canary Islands In another example of making use of what you’ve got, the 12,000 residents of the Spanish island of El Hierro use their extra wind energy to pump water into the sealed crater of an extinct volcano, 700m above sea level. Then, when the wind drops, the water runs through a hydroelectricity plant ensuring an uninterrupted supply. It’s a huge, unusual and very effective battery. The island is the most remote of the Canary Island chain and once generated power from an expensive diesel generator. They claim to be the first island to have evolved to electricity self-sufficiency without connecting to a grid first – unlike Samsø. “When they turn on the light, they think of the windmills moving and maybe they think, ‘We are different than the rest of the world, because we are catching electricity from these windmills and not from conventional engines,’” the island’s governer Alpidio Armas told NPR last year. Copenhagen If the western world, with its cities built on billions of tonnes of carbon emissions, is to do its fair share to defeat climate change then it must look to the Danish capital as a model for the future. Copenhagen ranks as the greenest city on Earth in the Siemens/Economist Green City Index and was Europe’s Green Capital in 2014. But beyond the rankings, Copenhagen is truly breaking new ground. It is set to be carbon neutral by 2025. This will involve halving its emissions and offsetting its remaining carbon use by producing more renewable energy than it consumes. By focussing on building standards and energy efficiency, the city believes it can make large inroads into its energy consumption. Dolf Gielen, a director at the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena), said cold cities with large heat energy requirements are counterintuitively well placed to shift their heat to renewable sources because they often have large scale centralised heat plants – rather than boilers in every home. By 2025, the city says 75% of all journeys will be by foot, cycle or public transport. Copenhagen is now considering how it can transition away from fossil fuel use altogether by 2050. This will go a long way to helping the Danish government achieve its national goal of independence from fossil fuels in the same time frame. Professor Brian Vad Mathiesen, who authored a report on Copenhagen’s 2050 strategy, said the goal was possible and, most importantly, replicable. “The vision we created for Copenhagen as a city based on 100% renewable energy in 2050 can be seen as a paradigm that many other ambitious cities can copy around the world,” he said. Samoa Like many small, isolated islands, Samoa’s need to ship in diesel for electricity generation has led to high power prices and been a boot on the throat of the developing economy. For these islands, says Irena’s Gielen “it makes perfect sense to switch to renewables”. The government has set itself the target of achieving 100% renewable electricity generation by 2017 and is well on course. Last year the UN climate chief Christiana Figures congratulated Samoa on being a leader among small island states as they attempt to bypass the fossil fuel economy. The government and developers have used the island’s rivers, sunlight and wind to generate electricity. Last year, the country’s first wind farm was completed. The two turbines will cut annual fossil fuel expenditure by $475,000. Because of the regular occurrence of tropical storms, the turbines are designed to fold away their blades when necessary, protecting them from destructive winds. Fukushima Devastated by tsunami in 2011 and still suffering from the radiation spilled by the Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, the prefecture of Fukushima has declared its intention to rebuild itself as a renewable energy haven. As a country, Japan was left deeply scarred by its experience with nuclear disaster. The fallout from Fukushima has been a dramatic rise in carbon emissions as nuclear reactors across the country were switched off and fossil fuels were poured into the breach. By March last year, after years of strong cuts before the disaster, emissions had risen to their second highest level on record. But Fukushima’s government has committed to building enough renewable electricity capacity to supply its 2 million residents by 2040. Driving the transition is a focus on community scale solar and wind plants. By 2020, the prefecture aims to have 143 floating wind turbines with a capacity of 1GW installed. Orkney The Orkney islands are home to Europe’s most productive wind turbine. During April, NM92 became the first wind turbine in Europe to click over 100,000,000 kWh – enough electricity to power a typical UK home for over 30,000 years. With it’s total exposure to winds sweeping out of the Northern Atlantic, Orkney – which translates from Icelandic to ‘energy islands’ – has become a beacon for renewable energy consistently producing more renewable electricity than they consume. Advanced testing of wave and tidal generation is also underway. The cheap, clean energy has led to a growing demand for electric vehicles. Currently 50 cars cruise the islands, about 5% of the entire Scottish electric vehicle market. Orkney has just 0.4% of the country’s population. Tianjin Eco-city, China While it’s not a done deal, Tianjin Eco-city provides a clue to how China might answer the question: what are you going to do with all these millions of newly middle-class, high carbon-emitting citizens? The Eco-city is a $24bn model of sustainability. It is being built from scratch and, when complete, will be able to accomodate 350,000 residents. It is just one of hundreds sprouting across China as the urban population, swelled by the rural poor, grows by 13m each year. The city puts a premium on energy efficient buildings – a must for a country where coal smog has cut life expectancy in some areas by 5.5 years. Public transportation and modern urban planning will also help to cut pollution and carbon emissions. But a Guardian visit last year found the Eco-city remained largely empty, an environmentally-friendly Potemkin city of empty highways and just 6,000 people, meaning the project remains an incomplete vision of a healthier, less-polluted China."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/nov/17/narendra-modi-express-rolls-into-sydney-bringing-excited-supporters","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-17T00:36:07Z","webTitle":"Narendra Modi express rolls into Sydney, bringing excited supporters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/17/narendra-modi-express-rolls-into-sydney-bringing-excited-supporters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/nov/17/narendra-modi-express-rolls-into-sydney-bringing-excited-supporters","fields":{"headline":"Narendra Modi express rolls into Sydney, bringing excited supporters","bodyText":"“Prime Minister Modi is the change we’ve been looking for,” says Hari Iyer. “He’s the only one who can turn India’s fortunes around.” Iyer, an aerospace engineer has lived in Australia for eight years. But his connection to his homeland of India is still strong, and he has been following Narendra Modi’s progress since before he was elected prime minister in May. Iyer, his wife and young son were among the 220 Indian Australians who made the overnight trip from Melbourne to Sydney aboard a specially chartered train known as the Modi Express. The atmosphere was jubilant and festive, as passengers anticipated Modi’s speech to a community audience on Monday afternoon. Many Indian Australians have welcomed Modi’s charismatic and engaging public persona as a turning point for the country. “Having him here is an awesome thing. Indian Australians have two mothers – a birth mother and an adoptive mother,” Iyer says. Bilateral relations between the two countries have never been stronger, he says. The president of the Australian South Asian Federation, Aashish Gholkar, says Modi’s appeal is partly due to this outward-looking approach to politics. “India’s political establishment has historically been insular,” Gholkar says. Reaching out to the Indian diaspora has been a deliberate strategy to build Modi’s “aura”, Gholkar says. “He is trying to get people to focus on things that unite.” About 1.6% of Australia’s population were born in India, making it one of the fastest growing migrant groups. Many came to the country in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when the Howard government introduced its revamped 457 visa program. Others came as students and stayed on skilled migrant visas. India is one of Australia’s most significant tertiary education markets. India does not offer dual citizenship with other countries, forcing migrants to relinquish voting and other rights if they take on Australian citizenship. That has been a sticking point for many new migrants. “I’d love to be able to vote in Indian elections,” Iyer says. Indian Australians from around the country will fill the sold-out Allphones Arena in Sydney on Monday afternoon to hear Modi speak. More than 30,000 people applied for tickets. The organiser of the event, Balesh Singh, said more than 100 people were coming from overseas to hear the leader, including from New Zealand, Fiji and South Africa. Modi’s contentious treatment of minorities and links to Hindu nationalist parties have angered some ethnic and religious groups, who plan to hand over a petition calling for change before the address on Monday. Members of Australia’s Sikh community want Modi to pursue the perpetrators of a series of pogroms against the religious minority in 1984. “Almost every Sikh’s concern is that nothing has been done to arrest those responsible [for the massacres],” the secretary of the National Sikh Council of Australia, Bawa Jagdev says. “After numerous commissions nothing has been done.” He says the fanfare around Modi’s Australian appearance has been driven by Indian political groups, a claim flatly denied by Singh. “This is completely community-funded,” Singh says. More than 200 community organisations and 21,000 individuals contributed to pay for Modi’s address, he says. Indian community groups in Australia say opportunities have been missed for investment and engagement, but Tony Abbott’s visit to India in September helped put the bilateral relationship back on the Australian agenda. The relationship between Canberra and New Delhi has been on an upward trajectory in the past few years, partly due to the Modi’s focus on diaspora communities, and partly because of the shift in focus to Asia from successive Australian governments. “There has been inattention to India in recent years [but] there has been unprecedented levels of high-level contact between the countries,” Danielle Rajendram from the Lowy Institute says. “The relationship has bounced back from a low point in 2009-2010,” she adds, referring to a series of attacks on Indian students living in Australia. The economic relationship between the two countries is strong, and both have a strategic interest in the Indian Ocean. Details of bilateral naval exercises in the Indian Ocean next year “are in the works”, Rajendram says. The resolution of the ban on selling uranium to India – due to its refusal to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty – has also strengthened relations. Rajendram says about 70% of Indians saw the ban as a sticking point in the bilateral relationship. “It’s more symbolic than practical in that sense. It signals India is a mature and responsible nuclear power,” Rajendram says. That policy paved the way for a future free trade agreement with India. “India is the next frontier to conquer,” says Amitabh Mattoo, head of the Australia-India Institute. “In the past, the India-Australia relationship has been marked by missed opportunities and a lack of conversation. This relationship could be the one for the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/dec/06/george-osborne-fossil-fuel-energy-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-06T17:54:45Z","webTitle":"George Osborne oversees biggest fossil fuel boom since North Sea oil discovery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/06/george-osborne-fossil-fuel-energy-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/dec/06/george-osborne-fossil-fuel-energy-environment","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne oversees biggest fossil fuel boom since North Sea oil discovery","bodyText":"George Osborne has sparked the biggest boom in UK fossil fuel investment since the North Sea oil and gas industry was founded in the 1970s. Analysis of new Treasury data also shows investment in clean energy has plummeted this year and is now exceeded by fossil fuels, while road and airport building is soaring. After years of coalition infighting over green energy, the stark shift marks a major victory for the chancellor. But it conflicts with David Cameron’s recent statement that climate change is “a threat to our national security and to economic prosperity” and his 2010 pledge to the lead the “greenest government ever”. UK ministers are currently at UN climate talks in Peru arguing for strong action against global warming. In Wednesday’s autumn statement, Osborne added £430m to the billions in tax breaks he has granted the fossil fuel sector since 2012. Taxpayers will also now fund seismic exploration to help companies find more oil and gas and will pay £31m for shale gas research drilling plus another £5m to “ensure the public is better engaged” with fracking. Osborne said the North Sea tax breaks “demonstrate our commitment to the tens of thousands of jobs that depend on this great British industry”. Joan Walley MP, who heads parliament’s environmental audit committee, said: “Taxpayers should not be propping up the fossil fuel industry in the 21st century. Tax breaks should be used to support firms that come up with innovative clean energy solutions, not to keep us drilling for the fossil energy fuelling climate change.” Matthew Spencer, the director of the thinktank Green Alliance, whose experts performed the new analysis, accused Osborne of political manoeuvring before the general election. “A series of short-term tactical decisions have reversed what was a very encouraging picture for UK infrastructure. These stark figures show that you can’t focus on oil extraction and road building and expect to deliver a cleaner, leaner economy.” Green Alliance, praised in November as an “immensely important” thinktank by Osborne’s cabinet colleague Oliver Letwin, scrutinised the data in the Treasury’s infrastructure pipeline, which collates all public and private investments over £50m. The analysis revealed that, compared with the 2012 pipeline data, expected investment in fossil fuels rocketed from 8% to 61% of all energy investment in 2014-15, reaching £15.2bn. The Treasury claims that half of this is the result of Osborne’s tax breaks. Investment in low-carbon energy tumbled from an expected £25bn in 2014-15 to £10bn, the analysis found. This is despite the National Infrastructure Plan having the stated goal of reducing “carbon emissions in order to mitigate climate change and meet the UK’s legally binding targets”. For the period 2015-20, the expected share devoted to fossil fuels has more than tripled to 33%, although low-carbon energy including nuclear power will receive more. The share of expected transport infrastructure spending also moved away from cleaner public transport to roads and airports, which together rose from 8% to 36% of the total in 2015-20. Road spending ballooned more than 20 times to £32.7bn for 2015-20. “We are working hard on the transition to a low-carbon economy and turning around a legacy of underinvestment in our energy sector,” said a spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change. “The move away from fossil fuels will not happen overnight, and oil and gas are forecast to remain a key element of the UK’s energy mix for some years to come. This is consistent with a least-cost approach to the UK’s binding 2050 emissions reduction target.” Spencer said the oil and gas investment boom would lock in greater fossil fuel dependency and cut the UK’s options for reducing future emissions. A Treasury spokesman highlighted the increased electrification of railways and support for electric cars. “What does Osborne know that China, Germany and the USA don’t?” said Louise Hutchins, the head of Greenpeace UK’s energy campaign. “At the moment when the big industrial powers are starting to realise the future is low-carbon, Osborne seems intent on dragging Britain back to depression-era technologies to match his depression-era economics with new subsidies for old coal plants and declining North Sea oil and gas.” Caroline Flint, Labour’s shadow energy and climate change secretary, said Conservative antipathy to renewable energy would cost the UK “the high-skilled, high-wage jobs we need for the future”, echoing recent comments by Ed Davey, the Lib Dem energy secretary. Flint said: “The smart money is on the low-carbon economy. The UK can be a world leader in green technology and services, but under the Tories our competitive edge is being eroded.” In 2009, six months before becoming chancellor, Osborne also praised the green economy. “The global market for green goods and technologies is worth trillions of dollars a year, but with less than a 5% share of that market Britain is failing to take advantage. This has got to change,” he said. “I want a Conservative Treasury to lead the development of the low carbon economy.” However, most Conservative MPs remain sceptical about global warming and Ukip, which has attracted two Tory defectors, also decries climate action as expensive and unnecessary."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
