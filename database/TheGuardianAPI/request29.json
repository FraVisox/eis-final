Emissions of the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, fell 9.8% in 2009, while overall output of a group of six greenhouse gases fell 8.6%. According to the Department for Energy and Climate Change (Decc), the estimated decrease in CO2, from 533m tonnes in 2008 to 481m tonnes in 2009, was mainly caused by a significant fall in energy consumption as the economy contracted. A switch from coal to nuclear for electricity generation also helped, the department said. Joan Ruddock, energy and climate change minister, said: \"The significant reduction in emissions would no doubt have been impacted by the recent economic circumstances. However, we should still recognise the good progress we are making towards meeting our [climate change] targets, and should not underestimate the effort made so far by government, industry, business and homeowners alike. We are determined to continue to strengthen and sustain the momentum behind the low-carbon transition in the UK.\" David Symons, director at environment consultants WSP Environment &amp; Energy, said: \"The recession was forecast to reduce emissions by 3 to 7% last year. That the UK actually achieved a reduction of 8.6% in greenhouse has emissions in 2009 is very encouraging.\" But Andy Atkins, head of Friends of the Earth, said: \"These figures suggest that UK emissions have fallen more in one year than in all the other years of the Labour government put together, but it's taken a major recession to make this happen.\" Decc said the biggest falls in emissions in 2009 came from businesses and industrial processes, while a drop in domestic consumption of fossil fuels for space heating – because last year was slightly warmer than 2008 – led to a drop in domestic emissions of 5%. Public sector emissions fell by just 0.1%, while transport emissions, not including international flights and shipping, fell 7% because of lower fuel consumption in the face of the recession and greater use of biofuels, Decc said. The UK is on track to exceed its Kyoto protocol target for the period 2008-2012, which is a 12.5% cut in greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels. But environmental campaigners point out this has been achieved in part by the increasing use of gas to generate electricity and the export of manufacturing to other countries, rather than specific emissions reduction policies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"government-computing-network/2009/dec/17/ipc-applications-begin-march2010-17dec09","type":"article","sectionId":"government-computing-network","sectionName":"Guardian Government Computing","webPublicationDate":"2009-12-17T11:29:00Z","webTitle":"IPC powers up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/government-computing-network/2009/dec/17/ipc-applications-begin-march2010-17dec09","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/government-computing-network/2009/dec/17/ipc-applications-begin-march2010-17dec09","fields":{"headline":"IPC powers up","bodyText":"The Infrastructure Planning Commission has made the announcement as its list of anticipated projects has begun to grow to the extent it has prompted concerns about a backlog quickly developing.

In a long-awaited and much-trailed announcement, Hutton said nuclear power stations had provided \"safe and secure supplies of electricity for half a century\" and that the government was publishing plans to encourage the private sector to build more. The Conservatives said that they broadly supported the announcement, which is supposed to help the government achieve the twin objectives of guaranteeing energy supplies and tackling climate change. Hutton said the first of the new wave of nuclear plants would be built \"well before 2020\" and that they would not be subsidised by the government. But critics said they did not believe his assurance that the taxpayer would not end up having to cover the costs of decommissioning the power stations and disposing of their waste. \"The government believes that the new nuclear power stations should have a role to play in this country's future energy mix alongside other low-carbon sources,\" Hutton said. \"The view of the government is that it is in the public interest to allow energy companies the option of investing in new nuclear power stations and that we should therefore take the active steps to facilitate this.\" Hutton's announcement coincided with the publication of the energy bill and a nuclear white paper. The bill includes provisions designed to ensure that developers building new nuclear power stations have enough funds to cover the waste and decommissioning costs. On the issue of costs, Hutton told MPs: \"It will be for energy companies, not government, to fund, develop and build new nuclear power stations, including meeting the full costs of decommissioning and each operator's full share of waste management costs. The bill includes provisions to ensure this.\" The government will set up a new advisory body, the Nuclear Liabilities Financing Assurance Board (NLFAB), to monitor the arrangements operators are making to ensure that funds are available to cover waste and decommissioning costs. But some MPs were sceptical about the proposal that nuclear power stations could operate without state subsidy. The shadow business secretary, Alan Duncan, said he supported more nuclear power, but that there should be no subsidy for it of any kind. \"Although nuclear companies claim that they don't want subsidies, there remain suspicions that the industry will end up asking for them.\" On the question of waste, Duncan pointed out that the government was saying operators would have to pay their \"full share of waste management costs\" rather than saying that they would pay the full costs of waste disposal. And on decommissioning, Duncan said: \"We accept that companies will set money aside, but how can the government be confident their economic modelling is right, and what would happen if a nuclear company goes bankrupt?\" In an interview on The World at One, Hutton admitted that he could not identify a nuclear power station built anywhere in the world without public subsidy. But he claimed that the economics of nuclear power were changing because the cost of fossil fuels was going up so rapidly. In his statement, Hutton said the government had concluded that \"geological disposal\" was technically possible and the right long-term solution to the disposal of waste. But the government did not believe it had to wait until long-term waste disposal facilities were available before going ahead with the construction of new nuclear power stations. On safety, he said he was \"confident\" Britain had the \"robust regulatory framework\" for ensuring that nuclear power stations were operated properly. And he claimed that backing nuclear power would not undermine the government's commitment to promoting renewable energy. Hutton did not specify where new nuclear power stations would be built. A review would be carried out for completion next year, but the government assumed that applications would \"focus on areas in the vicinity of existing nuclear facilities\". In its white paper, the government said it would use provisions in the planning bill to ensure that nuclear power stations were treated as \"critical infrastructure projects\", which would enable planning applications to be fasttracked. In its energy bill the government also unveiled proposals to encourage private investment in carbon capture and storage, the technology that could enable conventional power stations to produce fuel without producing carbon emissions. Commenting on the plans, the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, said: \"The government must be honest about how much it will cost to build and run new nuclear power stations and who is going to pick up the bill. The government should abandon these expensive white elephants and focus on increasing energy efficiency and the use of genuinely renewable technologies.\" The executive director of Greenpeace, John Sauven, said: \"This is bad news for Britain's energy security and bad news for our efforts to beat climate change. Nuclear power can only deliver a 4% cut in emissions some time after 2025, and that's too little too late at too high a price. \" The CBI director general, Richard Lambert, said: \"After much consultation, the government has reached the right conclusion about nuclear's role in meeting the twin challenges of climate change and energy security.\" During its prolonged deliberations over the future of Britain's energy needs, Labour initially described going nuclear as \"an unattractive option\". Since that statement in 2003, however, surging oil prices have made the nuclear option much more competitive. Today's move will add to the gathering momentum behind atomic energy as part of the solution to the world's energy problems. Countries such as France and Finland are already building new nuclear plants, and, in the US, companies have begun applying for licences. Around 18% of the UK's electricity is generated by nuclear power, but the last of the UK's existing nuclear plants is scheduled to close by 2035."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/apr/15/nils-pratley-greece-imf","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-15T19:42:51Z","webTitle":"Greece has no option but to take the money","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/apr/15/nils-pratley-greece-imf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/apr/15/nils-pratley-greece-imf","fields":{"headline":"Greece has no option but to take the money","bodyText":"Last Sunday, Greece secured a €45bn borrowing facility that was meant to be so impressive that the debt-laden country would never be obliged to use it – €30bn from the 16 eurozone countries and the rest from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The sum represented about 15% of Greece's outstanding debt – definitely big. Jean-Claude Juncker, the Luxembourg prime minister and eurogroup president, declared: \"This is the step of clarification the markets are waiting for.\" Wrong. It has taken less than a week for the markets to demand more clarification. Greek bond yields are back above 7% and the Greek government today has turned to the European Union, the European Central Bank and the IMF to hammer out the details of an aid package. Greece is not actually activating the bailout, officials stressed. That's true. But at the current pace of events, activation looks inevitable. It is barely credible at this stage for Greece to turn around and say \"no thanks\". Are investors being irrational – or worse, bloodthirsty – in forcing up those bond yields and heightening the sense of panic? No. The reality is that the €45bn package wasn't watertight. There were legitimate questions to be asked. Would German politicians, in the face of resistance from voters, be prepared, in practice, to dispatch the cash? Is 5%, the interest rate attached to the EU portion of the package, sufficiently generous to be useful given the scale of Greece's debt-reduction programme? George Soros, for one, doubts it. And what happens if Portuguese bond yields, say, also spike? Isn't that the moment when EU officials should seek a more comprehensive solution? The pace and development of the Greek crisis brings back memories of Russia in 1998, notes Roland Nash of Renaissance Capital, the Russian investment bank. Then, as now, the international community offered a financial safety net that was meant to inspire awe. \"Four weeks later, the rouble, banking system and debt markets blew up,\" says Nash. The rouble fell from six to the dollar to 20 and Russia became the first nuclear power to default on its debt. Greece doesn't have the option of devaluation, of course. It can default, but if that happens to a member of the eurozone we have entered very deep waters indeed. The most likely resolution, in the short term at least, remains this: Greece will request the bailout cash and Germany and the other eurozone members will have to find a way to meet their promises. The Greek government still has to persuade its citizens to be austere – hardly a trifling matter. And the EU has to accept the presence of the IMF in its backyard as fiscal policeman. But we're at the endgame now. The market is telling Greece to take the bailout package or leave it. There is really only one option – take it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/16/japan-quake-tsunami-freezing-temperatures-relief","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-16T18:32:07Z","webTitle":"After Japan's quake and tsunami, freezing weather threatens relief efforts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/16/japan-quake-tsunami-freezing-temperatures-relief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/16/japan-quake-tsunami-freezing-temperatures-relief","fields":{"headline":"After Japan's quake and tsunami, freezing weather threatens relief efforts","bodyText":"Freezing winds, hail storms and thick snow are the latest threats to 430,000 beleaguered survivors of northern Japan's week-long cascade of disasters. After a massive earthquake, devastating tsunami and nuclear crisis, many people made homeless are now facing icy weather, with temperatures forecast to plunge to –5C (23F). The risk of a deadly humanitarian crisis is rising among refugees lacking food, fuel and blankets, even as the world's attention is transfixed by the unfolding nuclear emergency at the Fukushima plant. The official death toll has risen to 4,255, with 8,194 people registered as missing. Many more are likely to be added as bodies are found in the mud and rubble of the tsunami aftermath. Morgues have run out of space so schools have been used instead. Officials are struggling to identify the dead and deal with their remains. A big concern is for those who escaped the tsunami but lost their homes. Up to 2,400 shelters are accommodating them; usually these are schools, shrines and city offices, but they are not equipped for the care and feeding of large numbers of people. The prefectural governments of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima, have asked the Japan Prefabricated Construction Suppliers &amp; Manufacturers Association to build 32,800 temporary homes, but these are not expected to arrive for weeks. Such is the uniqueness of the situation, the 77-year-old emperor, Akihito, made a rare public address to urge a full-hearted rescue effort. \"We don't know the number of victims, but I pray that every single person can be saved,\" he said. Help has come, but it is not enough. The defence minister, Toshimi Kitazawa, has ordered the first dispatch of reserve personnel since the self-defence forces were established during 1954. They join 80,000 troops, firefighters and emergency workers in the disaster area. More than 100 countries have offered assistance. The Japanese Red Cross has deployed about 90 medical teams and distributed emergency bags containing radios, cutlery, plates, towels and gloves. The US navy has offered aid. Foreign aid workers, including the UK Search and Rescue team, have joined the hunt for survivors and the task of feeding 430,000 homeless people. Getting food and other supplies to where they are needed has been hampered by aftershocks, radiation fears and damaged roads. But access is possible. The main problem is a lack of fuel. Panic buying Nine refineries were damaged by the quake and tsunami, along with almost a dozen ports. According to the national broadcaster, NHK, this has reduced the amount of oil available in Japan from 450,000 barrels to 310,000. The scarcity is most evident in the northern area, close to the disaster region, where petrol tankers, as well as food trucks and rubbish collection vans remain parked at their depots because they do not have enough fuel. The impact is increasingly apparent. For the first few days after the crisis there was a surreal disconnect between the scenes of chaos and devastation along the coastline, and the orderly, affluent, seemingly undisturbed communities just a few miles inland. It was possible for journalists at that time to visit the disaster zone during the day and drive back to a restaurant and hotel in the evening. But the impact is now rippling outwards as supplies become scarce. Supermarkets and convenience stores across the north-east first sold out of jerry cans as queues lengthened at petrol stations, then they ran out of batteries when the government announced plans for rolling power cuts. In the panic buying that followed the first explosion at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, shops imposed a \"two bakery items per person\" limit. Many shops have also run out of blankets, sanitary pads, nappies, toilet paper, instant noodles, torches, and anything else that people preparing for disaster might need. On Wednesday at least one hotel in Shinjo, far from the disaster zone, told guests there was not enough food for breakfast. Almost all petrol stations are closed and traffic is increasingly scarce. As far away as Akita city, in the Tohoku region but roughly 155 miles from the disaster zone, police said there was not a single garage selling petrol to the public. Seiichi Nakayama, manager at an Eneos garage in Takakami city, Iwate prefecture, said: \"I'd like to help people by selling petrol, but I have are no supplies left.\" There are, however, stores of emergency petrol supplies that have been reserved for the relief operation. Alarm about the Fukushima reactors has pushed many people away from the disaster zone. NHK reports that doctors and other medical staff are reluctant to volunteer for relief work, and truck drivers do not want to deliver supplies because of concerns about radioactivity. Unease about the government's handling of the crisis has prompted an exodus of foreign workers, causing greater suffering for those in the evacuation centres. Having already endured the country's biggest earthquake since records began and a devastating tsunami, they are finding it harder to secure basic necessities. Panic buying and hoarding are occurring in large parts of Japan and beyond. As far away as Hong Kong, shoppers have reportedly been buying up Japanese milk powder in case future supplies are contaminated by radiation. Entreaties As far as the refugees are concerned, the balance of priorities is wrong. Masaki Ohata, a pharmacist whose home in Kesennuma was destroyed by the tsunami, said the radiation threat was a lesser concern. \"The nuclear meltdown is frightening. It's something you can't see that can hurt you. But frankly it is not as terrifying as the disaster I saw with my own eyes.\" Ohata has been sleeping in a room outside the city hall on a concrete floor with no blankets. The Guardian has spoken to dozens of refugees, all of whom were waiting for help that was yet to come on anything like an adequate scale. Some needed medicine. Others were desperate for sanitary wear. Many were cold because they lacked blankets and stoves. All were uncomfortable and unhappy about the lack of running water which meant they were having to relieve themselves in plastic bags. The deputy mayor of Ishinomaki, another devastated coastal community, lying within Miyagi prefecture, said that he was coping with the same food shortages as the hundreds of refugees now sheltering in the city hall. \"I eat one rice ball a day. Of course, I am hungry, but when I think what the other citizens have been through, it's nothing. I believe food is coming. I will be grateful for that,\" he said. Elsewhere, polite and quiet endurance was gradually giving way to vocal entreaties for help. \"What we urgently need now is fuel, heavy and light oil, water and food. More than anything else, we need fuel because we can't do anything without it. We can't stay warm or work the water pumps,\" said Masao Hara, the mayor of Koriyama city, in Fukushima prefecture. Survivors face freezing conditions Aid workers on the frontline of the relief effort have told of the mounting threat to elderly refugees from sub-zero temperatures while residents of one affected area voiced growing anger that panic buying in Tokyo is depriving them of vital food and fuel. The national broadcaster NHK even advised people to wrap themselves in clingfilm and newspaper to keep warm. \"It has been snowing heavily, which has disrupted the whole search and rescue effort,\" said Pat Fuller, a worker with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, after another day trying to help an exhausted and psychologically traumatised population in Otsuchi, where more than half the 19,000 population is thought to have died. \"The fire department pulled out early because they were worried about getting stuck. It has been doubly difficult for survivors. They are lying on sheets of cardboard on the floor and they are huddling up trying to keep warm all day. Temperatures have been as low as -5C and were -1C today. You can imagine what it is like for people living in the wrecks of their homes.\" After the biting, unrelenting cold, survivors are struggling with stretched supplies of food and water, and a desperate lack of shelter. But Fuller said the humanitarian effort was now battling a more abstract threat: Japan's demographic. Almost a quarter of the Japanese population are aged 65 or over, and the medicines that many rely on for chronic problems have been washed away or are buried in rubble. \"There are considerable numbers who need regular medical attention for hyper tension and diabetes that they can no longer access,\" said Fuller. \"It is very distressing as there are people who need to be hospitalised, but the hospitals are overflowing. Hypothermia and pneumonia are becoming real issues. Just last night two elderly people were stretchered into our tent suffering from hypothermia. It is worse for people who were actually in the tsunami. They get water on the lungs and that's a recipe for pneumonia.\" The government says that almost 2m households are still without power, and 1.4m lack water. Seasoned aid workers said they were shocked by the scale of the damage the tsunami left in its wake. \"Everything is destroyed and flattened,\" said Tadateru Konoe, president of Japan's Red Cross. \"This is a complete disaster. In my long career, this is the worst I've ever seen.\" Makiko Oonuki, a resident of Natori, just north of Sendai, complained of people from outside the stricken areas panic buying goods and fuel and reported burglaries and overcharging. \"They're feeling that the media are focusing too much on the areas north of Sendai and they now have enough support in terms of petrol, food and water supply whereas Natori is not getting anything,\" London-based Naoya Tatsuzawa told the Guardian after speaking to his friend by phone. \"At local shelters people only get a golf ball size of rice a day. They also feel they have been treated badly by people from outside the affected areas: they hear people in Tokyo are panic buying whereas people in the affected areas have nothing to buy. \"Also people in Natori have seen other people driving in from Tokyo and the Kanto area to fill their cars up as they can't find petrol any more at their local petrol stations in Tokyo … she has also seen odd incidents of cars/house broken into, things stolen from local shelters. Some shops are charging twice or three times for goods in low supply. So it's not really as good as the media has tried to portray it so far.\" Fuller said a big issue was getting food back into the markets. \"The shortage of fuel is hampering everything. We had to go to five petrol stations today to get 20 litres of fuel. There is sufficient food and nobody is going hungry. They have drinking water, but they can't wash their hands because it is so strictly rationed. \"The government is responsible for providing food and water and they are being provided with cooked food from limited food supplies which are coming in from a central distribution system. But I saw people yesterday scavenging through the rubble of what used to be shops so that was a sign people are getting pretty desperate.\" Search and rescue workers, are struggling to find anyone alive. Britain's 63 strong team which flew in with 11 tonnes of equipment, including heavy lifting gear, has found no survivors and three bodies after searching in the debris at Ofunato and Kamaishi.

They pulled them away and crawled into a space barely wide enough for the human body. Descending a steep shaft, they found themselves in a vast underground cavern of astonishing beauty. But nothing prepared them for what they saw next. As they advanced into the 400m-long chamber, one of the three, Eliade Brunel, suddenly let out a cry. She said later: \"Our light flashed on to a mammoth, then a bear, then a lion with a semi-circle of dots which seemed to emerge from its muzzle like drops of blood, a rhinoceros … We saw human hands, both positive and negative impressions. And a frieze of other animals 30ft long.\" Haunted since the day its discovery was projected all over the world in 1994, I, like many others, have always wanted to see inside the Chauvet cave, site of the world's earliest known cave art. Quite rightly, we will never go. It is closed to the public. Cut to 1976, standing on a cliff at the end of the day on the windswept southern coast of Jersey where the water stretched all the way to St Malo. My father flings out his arm. He tells me that, during the last ice age, this sea was a plain – a savannah-type landscape, albeit a cold one – that stretched from England to France. We were there because he was a prehistorian, and every year of my childhood and adolescence through the 1960s and 70s, we spent weeks on an excavation of a Neanderthal site dating from 120,000 years ago. Across this landscape, he said, roamed bison, mammoth, rhinoceros, lions, horses, deer, bears and countless other species, including the aurochs – giant oxen 2m tall. (The last recorded aurochs only died in 1627 in the Jaktorów Forest in Poland.) You would, my father told me, be looking over a landscape teeming with animals. It was man who was in the minority. It was an animal world. Maybe it was on these excavations, surrounded by hair-growing, non-washing, chain-smoking 1970s students that I also first heard of Werner Herzog, the radical German film-maker. His evocation of Lope de Aguirre – the 16th-century conquistador terrifyingly incarnated by Klaus Kinski in Aguirre, Wrath of God – drew me, aged 16, into his world. I have followed his films ever since. Here, the borders of fiction and documentary are constantly blurred in an excavation of human excess, endurance and ingenuity. They also have an eccentric, wry humour. Like Herzog himself. I have watched him on YouTube eat his shoe and be shot at while being interviewed. His stubborn, unflinching vision leads him into places most of us will never go. \"The poet must not avert his eyes,\" he once said. \"You must look directly at what is around you, even the ugly and … the decadent.\" And now, somehow, he has talked his way into filming inside the Chauvet cave. In 3D. With the result that we are able to penetrate where we can never go. With rough humour and touching observations, he guides us; not as an expert, but as we ourselves might look. The result is astonishingly moving. Herzog leads us into the cave, and we go with him. As the cinema usher said to me on the way out: \"This is the first time 3D has made sense to me. It always seemed a gimmick before.\" She is right. We feel the texture of the rock. Stalagmites and stalactites loom out of the darkness and pass us as we crawl along, their wet shape and colour reminding us of the human body. When we stand, we are in that immense chamber. We are really there. This is not an effect. It is an event. We are in a sacred place. And we feel it. Jean Clottes, one of the first to authenticate the paintings in 1994, instructs us. \"The original entrance was there, and here it was light. As you will see, there are no paintings. They were not painted in the light. They were painted in the dark.\" We go further into the dark. Traces are engraved in soft clay. You can almost touch them. A bear has scratched with his claws. Then the next marks are human. Drawn with a stick. And over all this, a finger, tracing the outline of a horse. Every movement of the finger – the speed, the hesitation, the deliberation – is there to see in the single ridged line in the clay. It is astonishing. The horse is really alive. As John Berger wrote in the Guardian in 2002: \"Art, it would seem, is born like a foal that can walk straight away … The talent to make art accompanies the need for that art; they arrive together.\" Deeper still. And closer. Hands appear dipped in red ochre and planted on the rock. One of the artists had a deformed finger. From the angle that he applied his painted hand to the wall, we even know he was at least 6ft tall. My father's hands were also deformed, and he too was 6ft tall. He died in 1979. I look in his stead. The camera swings round. Herzog is sweating. A bead runs down his face. On the floor is a bear skull, next to it a boy's footprint. But this cave belonged to the bears before the humans came, and was returned to them after humans' temporary visit. And the drawings of the animals tell us that: this is the animals' place. But even when evoking their ferociousness, these drawings are not about danger, but familiarity. There is an intimacy with the animals. And an intimacy with the rock. The shoulder of a bison is made rounded by a bulge of limestone. A lion's pelvis follows a convex curve in the rock. Everything is preserved by the thinnest layer of calcite from the water oozing out of limestone over the millennia. Even charcoal pieces that dropped from the artists' hands on to the cave floor are here; still in the place where they fell, 32,000 years ago. Jean Clottes turns to the film-makers. \"Silence please. Please listen to the cave. You may even be able to hear your heartbeat.\" The visitors stand in silence and awe. (Herzog, perhaps not forgetting the audience in his adopted country, the US, adds music and a heartbeat, but even this does not entirely remove the wonder.) In the cinema, we too hold our breath. We cut to Julian Monay – a young French archaeologist who startles us with the words: \"I am a scientist but also a human being.\" He confesses he was a circus performer before he became a prehistorian. Working with lions, asks Herzog. No, no, a juggler and unicyclist, Monay replies, before describing, in most unscientific terms, not his line of research but his dreams after his first visit to the cave. I am struck by a tinge of regret in his voice. As if in recognition of something missing for him when he woke. The animals, perhaps? The endless investigations of the scientists unfold in a delightfully haphazard fashion. An experimental archaeologist, dressed in caribou skins, demonstrates a bone flute, similar to one found in southern Germany of the same antiquity as Chauvet. Ludicrously he plays The Stars and Stripes. Another inexpertly demonstrates a spear throw. A retired \"perfumier\" suddenly appears. He sniffs the ground, telling us that he is searching for more possible caves with his nose. Back in the cave, we stand before the great panel of horses. Their muzzles are soft. You can feel the velvet lips. They're not being chased. Unlike the drawings in Lascaux and Altimira 15,000 years later, there are no depictions of hunting anywhere. The legs are doubled and trebled, making them move. \"Like proto-cinema,\" Herzog mutters. And he reinforces what we already know. This is no gallery. This is a place where the animals are alive. Why have these artists not drawn themselves? There is only a single human figure in the cave: a woman's pudenda and legs. With a bison head overlooking and entwined with her. Are the legs hers or the bison's? There is no separation. The people are in the animals. And the animals are so alive. We can even, it is suggested, hear the sound of a horse's neigh from its open mouth. This horse is neither a symbol, nor a stylisation. It is depicted as we would see a horse now. Here. Today. The observation and imagination of these artists were the same as ours. We feel closer to the drawings on the walls of Chauvet than the painting of, say, an Egyptian mural. These artists are not remote ancestors; they are brothers. They saw like us, they drew like us; we wear essentially the same clothes against the cold. But despite their proximity, there is something fundamental that cuts us off from them. The time they lived in connected everything. They lived in an enormous present, which also contained past and future. A present in which nature was not only contiguous with them, but continuous. They flowed in and out of a continuum of everything around them; just as the animals flow into and out of the rock. And if the rock was alive, so were the animals. Everything was alive. And perhaps this is what truly separates us: not the space of time, but the sense of time. In our minute splicing of our lives into milliseconds, we live separated from everything that surrounds us. Do you know who made your clothes, or even what they are made of? \"We are locked in history; they were not,\" says Herzog. And then he wilfully changes direction, suddenly filming crocodiles living in a glasshouse heated by the nuclear power station a few miles downriver from the Chauvet cave. The radioactivity of the water has caused a mutation in the offspring of the crocodiles. They are albino. We leave with this startling image of our deforming modernity, and blink our way into the light. As we leave the cinema, I remember that on my father's study wall was a section marking the stratigraphy of earth in a trench he dug in a cave in Wales. \"Look, time is vertical,\" he would say, pointing to the strata of clay and loess. We live in horizontal time. In the 1650s, just after the death of the last aurochs in the forest in Poland, Blaise Pascale observed in his Pensées: \"We never keep to the present. We anticipate the future as if we found it too slow in coming and were trying to hurry it up, or we recall the past as if to stay its too rapid flight. We are so unwise that we wander about in times that are not ours and blindly flee the only one that is. The fact is that the present usually hurts.\" Cave of Forgotten Dreams is released next Friday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2011/apr/08/simon-hughes-interview-andrew-sparrow","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-08T15:49:23Z","webTitle":"Simon Hughes: Local elections will be the most difficult ever for Lib Dems","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/apr/08/simon-hughes-interview-andrew-sparrow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2011/apr/08/simon-hughes-interview-andrew-sparrow","fields":{"headline":"Simon Hughes: Local elections will be the most difficult ever for Lib Dems","bodyText":"Nick Clegg complained in an interview this week about being treated like a punchbag. Simon Hughes would have been forgiven for feeling the same way if he had read all 255 questions submitted on the blog I posted earlier this week inviting suggestions for questions ahead of our interview. But he seemed surprisingly upbeat for the deputy leader of a party that has seen its polling figures shrink by more than 50% since the general election. Here are the highlights: • Hughes said the local elections would be \"the most difficult\" the party had ever faced in England. But he claimed that, if people voted on local issues, Lib Dems could benefit from the way their councils have protected services. \"It absolutely isn't looking like a dire and dreadful prospect, and because we've done a good job in many places, we may do much better than some people forecast,\" he said. • He said that he wanted university scholarships to be offered on a school-by-school basis. As the government's adviser on access to higher education, Hughes is making recommendations to ministers about how the £150m national scholarship programme should operate. He said he would like university scholarship programmes to \"reach every school\", so that scholarships gave pupils an incentive to apply. \"At the moment, almost nobody applies to any university because of the bursaries they offer,\" he said. \"What happens is that they apply to university and then they discover there's a bursary.\" He also said he wanted pupils to have a \"careers account\", so that they were constantly reminded about the university opportunities available. • He said that if the alternative vote was defeated, it would kill the prospect of electoral reform \"for a decade, or longer\". He urged people not to use the vote as an opportunity to punish the Lib Dems. That would not be \"grown-up politics\", he said. \"I make a plea: don't vote on the referendum because of your views about the behaviour of my party or any other party. This is beyond party. It is cross party. And the opportunity may not come [again], certainly for a decade, or longer.\" • He said the Liberal Democrats had changed their internal party rules to stop Lib Dem ministers agreeing to measures contrary to party policy. The new system would have stopped Andrew Lansley publishing the health bill in the form that he did, Hughes said. Lansley would now have to make \"substantive\" changes to the bill, he went on. \"There has to be the unscrambling and the remaking [of the bill] because the health bill clearly doesn't conform to either the coalition agreement, or party policy,\" Hughes said. • He dismissed speculation that Nick Clegg might stand down as leader before the 2015 election. • He said it was \"absolutely possible\" to imagine the Lib Dems going into a general election campaign again promising to get rid of tuition fees. Technically, the Lib Dems were still committed to getting rid of tuition fees, he said. \"It has been reaffirmed since the election. That's our party's policy.\" He acknowledged that it might not be realistic to have this as policy in 2015. But that was a debate that the party still had to have, he said. Hughes was running late - no surprise there, colleagues will think - and we ended up conducting the interview in the back of a taxi between his constituency office in Bermondsey and Camden, where he was taking part in an alternative vote rally. We covered the health, education, local elections, AV, Nick Clegg, Labour and internal party reform. But, having read all 255 questions, I had to start with the utter contempt that some people appear to feel for the Lib Dems in the light for their decision to go into coalition with the Tories and, in particular, their blatant pledge-breaking over tuition fees. Here's how it went. Voters who feel betrayed Q: When I asked people on a blog to suggest questions they would like to ask you, the replies showed just how angry some voters are with the Liberal Democrats. There was this [from BitterBunny at 12.18pm]: \"Do you understand the level of betrayal felt by Liberal Democrat voters?\" And this [from Nazo at 12.11pm]: \"If politicians are allowed to promise (in writing) to do something if elected, then do the polar opposite when they are, what is the point of democracy in the first place?\" And this [from gmtyre at 11.01am]: \"How does he feel now that he is perceived by many who once admired him as a Tory stooge?\" How are you going to get these people back? A: First, obviously, it's the first time in the lifetime, probably, of all the people who are putting pressure on us that we've gone from opposition to government. By definition, that's always going to be more difficult. Government is always a place where you can't do as much as you hoped, and you can't be as critical and as populist as you have been in the past. Second, if you go into coalition, and it's an unexpected coalition and it's a coalition with the Tories, then you are bound to get anger from people who would have voted Labour if they had not voted for us, or who are naturally Labour anyway. But I'm clear that it was the only viable coalition option and - more importantly - the alternative would not have been a coalition with Labour. The alternative was a minority Tory government which would have very soon become a majority Tory government. Q: Because there would have been an early election? A: Because they probably would have done what minority governments in the past have done, and called an early election. And that could have ushered in, as it always has in the recent past, probably further periods of Tory government. Tuition fees Q: But your critics can understand the difference between going into coalition and not being able to do everything that you want, and specifically breaking a promise. What do you say to the person who wants to know what point there is of voting for politicians who sign a pledge saying they will do one thing, then do the opposite? Do you accept there's a fundamental problem there? A: There is, I accept that. But, again, the whole of the last year has forced people to readjust their mindsets in UK politics, in a way that people have already done in Scotland and Wales because of being in coalition. At other places in the UK people have got used to the idea that you don't have a single party delivering its manifesto and not having any constraint. We had never confronted that since the war. Q: People understand that. But what they have a fundamental objection to is a party going back on a promise. A: The only clearly expressed key policy where we, in the end, went in a different direction from what we promised was the tuition fees issue. That's the only one. That clouded for most people the whole perception. I think we might have been wiser in anticipating that, which we didn't. We could have been wiser, and I regret that we didn't negotiate in the coalition agreement that we could have had a free vote in the House of Commons, which would have got everybody off that hook. Q: But in the coalition agreement you had the option to abstain as a party, and you didn't even use that. A: Well, I used it, and eight parliamentary colleagues used it. Q: Do you think the party as a whole should have used that option? A: I was one of those who argued that all of us should abstain, because the coalition deal very clearly said if Liberal Democrats can't agree with the recommendations of Lord Browne, we could abstain. It would have been a position that many of us would have agreed to go along with. In the end several colleagues had made their position public, and said they would vote against, so it wasn't possible. I tried that. It was my idea. But we didn't deliver. So, I accept that we made the pledge and we couldn't deliver. Q: Do you accept that the party will now never again be able to go into an election promising to be able to get rid of tuition fees? Or could the party at some point in the future commit itself again to getting rid of tuition fees? A: It's absolutely possible that we could. Party policy is still to get rid of tuition fees. It has been reaffirmed since the election. That's our party's policy. Q: But if you have a party policy that is diametrically opposed to what the government is doing, that makes you look absurd. A: No, it doesn't, because the party policy, for example, is to have no nuclear power stations, but we had to negotiate a coalition deal saying that nuclear power could go ahead without subsidy. The party is clear. It has not changed its policy. We would wish that three years of education at university was paid for by the taxpayer in general, rather than the graduates. Q: But would it be realistic at the next election to put that to the voters knowing what will have happened by then? A: That's a debate we have to have. We are four years out from the next election. Clearly, it will be more difficult, of course, to get to that position from where we will be in 2015 than from where we are now. I accept that. But it's a debate we haven't had, we will have, and the debate about the whole of the future funding of higher education will start with the white paper later this year. Access to higher education Q: You're now working on improving access to higher education. After I said that I was interviewing you, I received an email from an Oxford professor who has been dealing with admissions for 20 years who said this: \"Admissions officers in Russell Group universities know that the problem with access is not bias in the admissions process - exam results broken down by education sector confirm that - but too few applications from able candidates at schools in the state sector.\" He wanted to know if you agree. A: Having looked at this afresh over the last few months, three things clearly determine what happens in terms of who gets to universities. Firstly, the opportunities given from primary school and before. It's about making sure you don't have disadvantage in the years up to five. Secondly, there has been a cultural problem whereby Russell Group universities in particular have tended to draw from regular sources - schools that have a tradition of sending pupils - and certain schools never have the aspiration or the ambition to send people. [Thirdly] although there has been generally widened participation, the Russell Group has done far less well than others. The Russell Group is a part of the problem, and they must be part of the solution. I have spent some considerable time working with Martin Harris, director of the Office for Fair Access, to make sure there are much tougher access agreements and that if people don't have verifiable improvement year on year, they could be fined or [made to charge fees of £6,000 again]. One of the ideas I'm working on is a national scholarship scheme that would offer scholarships to every school, every sixth-form college and every FE college if people get adequate grades at university, so that from 15 onwards youngsters understand that there is the potential for them to go to university, either in their region or somewhere else, and they would get financial help to do it. [The government has already announced the broad outline of its £150m national scholarship scheme. Hughes is working on the details.] Q: What would be the difference between that and the financial help that is already available? A: It would be far more transparent and public because it would be a national scheme. At the moment, almost nobody applies to any university because of the bursaries they offer. What happens is that they apply to university and then they discover there's a bursary. It's not a motivating force. All the evidence is that if you are trying to get kids from the Old Kent Road to go to Oxbridge or anywhere else, then unless you have a significant financial incentive, that doesn't carry much weight. That's why the government is right to start thinking in terms of £3,000 a year as being the sort of figure that makes people think that's worth having. Actually, in my view, it should be money that is offered not for fees, because if we are trying to say you won't have to pay your fees unless you earn enough, then getting your fees paid for is illogical. It should be to help pay for accommodation and living costs. I've talked to ministers about having something that reaches every school. There are models in the States that work, where the state universities offer scholarships to every high school in the state. You have to get the grades. But there isn't a single high school where you don't know that if you do well enough you can get a place at the state university. Q: Because there's a leaflet when you're 16 ... A: There's more than a leaflet. And I will be coming up with some quite radical ideas about how you don't just give people the information once when they are 15. Effectively, they are then locked into a careers account that keeps on giving them the information and helping them and prompting them and so on. Local elections Q: How are the Lib Dems going to do in the local elections? A: They are going to be difficult, self-evidently. Q: How many seats are you likely to lose? A: I can't tell you. Not because I don't want to tell you, but because I've been to many places where we are defending councils and I'm expecting us to still be in control of the council after 5 May. Q: Do you expect to still be in control of Sheffield [as grahamew asked on the blog at 12.30pm]? A: We can hang on to Sheffield, yes. I've been up there campaigning and I shall be going there again next week. I think we can hang on to Newcastle. I was in Chesterfield the other day. I think we can hang on to Chesterfield. The records of our councils, where we are still in government, are often extremely good. People, I hope, will vote on local issues. If they do, you may well find that because people understand that we have protected frontline services, we do much better than people think. Obviously, it is going to be the most difficult set of elections we have ever faced in England. But it absolutely isn't looking like a dire and dreadful prospect, and because we've done a good job in many places, we may do much better than some people forecast. Alternative vote Q: Ed Miliband thinks that Nick Clegg is a liability to the AV campaign. Do you think he's right? A: From the beginning the fairer votes campaign was always meant to be about putting up non-politicians, and using their arguments to win the case. That remains the case. Clearly we want to continue to do that. In certain parts of the country Nick has campaign for AV perfectly unproblematically. Q: Do you accept, then, that there are other parts of the country where having him campaign for it is a problem? A: He will judge that, and the campaign will judge that. But votes are going to be won if the public think that ordinary people like them will do better out of it. My plea to the politicians is this. Our party is trying very hard, because I know hardly anyone in our party who is not a believer in moving to fairer votes. My plea is that the other progressives in politics, like the progressives in the Labour party, get up off their backsides and do the campaigning because they have wanted a modern constitution. Q: But they might cite people like some of the readers who posted questions on the blog saying they would not vote for AV because they wanted to punish the Lib Dems. Like this person [chilloutpeeps at 12.34pm]: \"I have supported electoral reform for the 35 years of my adult life. Does it bother you that after all that time I will happily vote against it just in order to fuck you and your leader off?\" [Or garyallen at 2.13pm.] Do you accept there's a problem there? A: No. My response to that is that that is not grown-up politics. This is the first opportunity ever in British political history for the public to vote to have a fairer voting system. This is not a matter of single party interest. It won't produce more balanced parliaments necessarily, with Liberal Democrats holding the balance. Indeed, the evidence is to the contrary. Q: But there's no evidence showing it will harm the Liberal Democrats. The evidence suggests it will help them in a modest way. A: It may have a marginal effect, but you know the evidence. Australia, which has had the system for 90 years, has had fewer balanced parliaments than we have had in Britain with a first past the post system. The change is about whether people have a real influence in their seat. All progressives, I hope, will realise the benefit of the new system. And I make a plea: don't vote on the referendum because of your views about the behaviour of my party or any other party. This is beyond party. It is cross party. And the opportunity may not come [again], certainly for a decade, or longer. And it will reinvigorate politics. Lib Dem influence on the coalition Q: On the blog someone [liberacy at 5.06pm] posted this question about Lib Dem influence on coalition policy: \"What procedures should be put in place to prevent a repeat of the NHS fiasco? If Conservative ministers want to propose other bills that do not reflect either party policy or the coalition agreement, how will you make sure they are acceptable to the party?\" I know the party passed a motion at the spring conference addressing this, but can you explain what's going to happen. A: The answer is we've taken the action already. I saw this as an issue from the time I got elected as deputy leader last summer. I have worked with colleagues in the parliamentary party. We have amended our rules. If anything comes forward now that is contrary to our party's policy or contrary to coalition policy, it will not be something that our government ministers can back unless there is the agreement of the parliamentary party in the House of Commons. Q: Did that procedure work over Libya? A: With Libya, yes, it came to the parliamentary party, and it was agreed by the parliamentary party. Q: Before or after David Cameron committed himself to a no-fly zone? A: We had a debate before that. Q: Has this been written into party rules? Or is this an informal mechanism? A: No. There have been long deliberations over what has been agreed. They will, at the next appropriate occasion, be formally written into the standing orders of the parliamentary party. But we've made the agreement. The parliamentary party has had sub-committees looking at it. It has come up with recommendations. They have been agreed to. Q: Did that happen before the health bill was published or after? A: It happened after the announcement on health policy. The process started in the autumn and finished after Christmas, after the New Year. We now have a system that would not allow the Liberal Democrats to be bounced into a position that came out of the pale blue yonder. Q: Would it have prevented the health bill getting into committee in the shape it did? A: Yes. It would have prevented the health policy being turned into the health bill in its present shape. It's unique because it's the only major piece of legislation that has not come from the coalition agreement. That's why now there has to be the unscrambling and the remaking [of the bill] because the health bill clearly doesn't conform to either the coalition agreement, or party policy. Health bill Q: At the spring conference the Lib Dems passed a quite technical motion on the health bill proposing lots of specific changes, including one saying that about half of all the seats on boards of GP commissioning consortia should go to local councillors. As a Lib Dem MP, are you now bound by that, or are you bound to support government policy, which at the moment is not saying half those seats should go to councillors? A: [Having 50% of seats go to councillors] is party policy. That is our starting point. That does not mean to say that you can't undot an i, and uncross a t. That is the position that we now take into the negotiations that should have proceeded the policy being announced in the first place. Again, it's a coalition. I can't imagine that we will agree every single part of that. But the party has a very clear view. Party members and supporters would expect us to deliver that. Work has already started, from Nick [Clegg] downwards, to try to deliver as much of that as possible. Q: And are you confident that there will be substantive changes to the bill? There are suggestions that the changes will just be cosmetic. A: No, it has got to be substantive. It would not pass the test if it was not substantively changed. I think everybody's got the message. Nick Clegg Q: I had a question on the blog from someone [Peter61 at 11.42am] who wanted to know if you were \"ashamed\" when Nick Clegg was recorded on a platform with David Cameron saying they could not find anything to disagree on. A: It was a joke. You sometimes have to realise that people do say things lightheartedly that can be misinterpreted. I know, having worked closely with Nick all the time since last year, he is as determined as the rest of us are to make sure that as we get towards the next election, we have clearly identifiable Liberal Democrat policy positions. Work has started on that already. Obviously, we are bound to deliver jointly the coalition agreement. That may not take the whole of this parliament. We will start working out our separate positions. So, there won't be a failure to notice the difference between us and the Tories. And for people like me, who come from the left of politics, and who believe that there is no inevitability about a coalition with the Tories rather than a coalition with Labour, then we need to make sure that we have robust, independent, radical policies that are as appealing to people who come from the progressive left. Q: As someone who does work closely with Clegg, are you 100% sure that he will be leader of the party at the time of the next election? A: I see absolutely no reason why he won't be. Q: What happens if he is perceived as a liability? A: The first year of the government, the first two years, were always going to be difficult. Nick has led us into government for the first time since the war. About two thirds of our manifesto is being implemented. We just have to make sure that our successes are not lost by the one particular difficulty of last year, and some smaller matters, when there have been just the most amazing set of political reforms. People must judge Nick and his colleagues on what we've delivered. That's why the five-year term is so vital. Q: So there's no chance of him disappearing off to be a European commissioner, as some have speculated? A: I see no chance. He will want to defend our record in government, and I think, as the second half of the parliament moves towards a general election, people will be able to see exactly the influence of the Liberal Democrats in government. It wouldn't have happened without Nick's determination to be there, and absolute energy and tenacity in making sure not a single thing in government escapes his attention and doesn't have our input into it. Relations with Labour Q: How are your relations with Labour at the moment? On the blog someone [Torresdelbabel at 1.01pm ] said: \"You must be talking to the Labour at some level about what an alternative coalition might look like, or at the very least forcing an election prior to 2015.\" A: My relationship with different Labour people, it's very good with some, good with others, less good with others. The answer is, there are no conversations within the first year about what might happen after the next election which is four years away. Q: At the spring conference, the party passed a strategy motion saying that the party should fight the next election with \"no preference for potential future coalition partners\". But, realistically, how is that going to work if you've got a Labour leader who's rude about Nick Clegg in public, while you've got Tories like Michael Gove saying [in an interview in the Times (paywall)] \"I love Nick Clegg.\" A: At the next election, once we're into an election campaign, it will be like every other country where you have coalitions in term time and then you have an election. You take your independent position, you argue your own corner and you argue that your corner is better than the others."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/jun/18/sheffield-forgemasters-political-folly","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-18T11:35:10Z","webTitle":"Forgemasters decision is political folly | Gregor Gall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/18/sheffield-forgemasters-political-folly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/18/sheffield-forgemasters-political-folly","fields":{"headline":"Forgemasters decision is political folly","bodyText":"The decision to scrap an £80m loan to Sheffield Forgemasters could turn into an act of considerable political folly for the still-young coalition government. The loan was given to allow the company to install a new forging press for producing nuclear plant components. Its rationale was part of a policy to support successful businesses – especially in areas of high unemployment and low wage, unskilled jobs – to expand and prosper. The withdrawal of the loan not only threatens hundreds of jobs at the company and its suppliers, as well as the company's business strategy. It may also impede the ability of the new tranche of nuclear power plants to come on stream, for the company is almost alone in Britain in producing such steel products. This decision appears particularly short-sighted, for it was a loan (rather than a non-returnable grant or gift) and to a company that is far from being a basket case or a lame duck. Not only does Sheffield Forgemasters have a long and illustrious history, but it is one of the few businesses from that age of the industrial revolution to have survived, grown and developed when others around it withered and failed. It now manufactures general and specialised high-quality steels, in either rolled or cast formats. Some observers may say a successful company should not need state aid – they would say this almost axiomatic. Yet, the £80m loan was matched by the same amount raised in private money markets by the company, so this was not exactly a case of the government bailing out a company or encouraging it not to stand on its own two feet. Rather, relative to the worth and assets of the company, it would not have been able to raise such sums of money without government help. On top of this, steel and Sheffield have a kind of resonance in the political fabric of Britain unlike many others industries and places because of the parts they played in the industrialisation of the economy. Indeed, in what many consider the last great Clash song, Joe Strummer sang \"This is England … This knife of Sheffield steel.\" By the same token, bringing into doubt the future of a successful smokestack company speaks to a long-running sore in British political life, namely, that of deindustrialisation. The contrast with Corus, the owner of former British Steel operations, could not be greater. It has recently shut down and mothballed many of its production facilities. But what will really give foundation to the loan withdrawal being an act of political folly for the price of a returnable £80m is that the MP for the constituency in which the company is based is the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg. This makes his statement of lament in response look rather hollow and insincere. However, the icing on the cake will be the extent to which the Labour opposition can land a blow on the coalition government for bringing about the danger of a \"double dip\" recession by cutting too much too soon. This was the political fault line in this year's general election between the main political parties. With Clegg as the local MP, Labour's leadership contenders should be able to have a field day. Added to this mix will be the accusation that the Liberal Democrats are no different from the \"slash and burn\" Tories. Or, put another way, rather than moderating the Tories, the Liberal Democrats have given in to them in return for a few ministerial Mondeos. And at the back of all this, the longstanding Tory dogmas that people should get on their bikes to look elsewhere for work and that there is nothing wrong with becoming a nation of hairdressers are likely to fall on increasingly deaf and unreceptive ears. To many, it will look like the new face of the Tories under Cameron is pretty much the same as the old one under Thatcher. • This article was requested by PrincessChipChops in a You tell us thread"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/may/27/oil-spill-bernie-sanders-energy-offshore-drilling","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-27T20:04:00Z","webTitle":"Bernie Sanders | Oil spill shows drilling is not the answer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/may/27/oil-spill-bernie-sanders-energy-offshore-drilling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/may/27/oil-spill-bernie-sanders-energy-offshore-drilling","fields":{"headline":"Oil spill shows drilling is not the answer","bodyText":"The BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is an unmitigated disaster. Its full consequences will not be known for decades. What we do know, however, is that BP president, Tony Hayward, was incredibly wrong when he stated that the spill will have \"a very, very modest environmental impact\". Quite the contrary! In fact, one of the most beautiful and productive coastal regions of the world is being turned into a giant cesspool and, in the midst of a major recession, thousands of workers are going to lose their livelihoods. It goes without saying that BP must pick up the full costs of the cleanup and the economic damages. BP earned $5.6bn in the first quarter of this year. BP, not the American taxpayer, must pay for the devastation it caused. Further, we must learn that with any risky technology, whether it is offshore oil drilling or nuclear power, it is not good enough to be 99% safe. One event can have a calamitous and irreversible impact. We need a major investigation to understand how this accident occurred. We must make certain that precautions are put in place so nothing like it ever happens again. This crisis occurred at a time when the United States was considering opening new areas to offshore oil drilling. If there is a lesson to be learned from this disaster, it is that Congress must end that policy. There must be no new offshore drilling. Not now, not ever. Offshore drilling simply does not achieve the goals that its advocates claim, and it is not worth the risk. If we are serious about wanting to break our dependence on foreign oil and move to energy independence; if we want to lower the cost of energy; if we want to combat climate change and cut greenhouse gas emissions; if we want to create millions of new jobs – then more offshore drilling is not the way to go. The simple truth is that we cannot drill our way to energy independence or lower gas prices. The US uses roughly 25% of the world's oil, 7.5bn barrels per year, but we have only 2-3% of the world's proven petroleum reserves. Offshore drilling today provides roughly 1% of the oil we use in the United States. That is why I have introduced legislation to reinstate a ban on new offshore drilling in the Atlantic and Pacific continental shelves and along Florida's gulf coast and dramatically increase fuel efficiency for vehicles sold in America. Instead of saving three cents a gallon by 2030 by allowing wide open offshore drilling, we can save far more with stronger fuel economy standards. Just by raising our fuel efficiency standards to 35.5 miles per gallon for cars and trucks, as President Obama is doing, we will save consumers the equivalent of $1 per gallon of gas in 2030. If we enacted my legislation, we would reach 55 miles per gallon by 2030. That would save motorists the equivalent of $1.43 a gallon of gas. It also would eliminate the need for 3.9m barrels of oil per day, more than double the amount we now import from Persian Gulf nations such as Saudi Arabia. We know we can get better fuel economy, because other nations are already doing it. The European Union currently gets 42 miles per gallon and is moving to 65 miles per gallon by 2020. China, Canada, Japan, and South Korea all have stronger fuel economy standards than the United States. If we take bold action in energy efficiency, public transportation, advanced vehicle technologies, solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal, we can transform our energy system, clean up our environment, and create millions of new jobs in the process. This direction, and not more offshore drilling, is where we have got to go."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/08/new-europe-what-we-learned","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-08T15:20:04Z","webTitle":"New Europe: what we've learned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/08/new-europe-what-we-learned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/08/new-europe-what-we-learned","fields":{"headline":"New Europe: what we've learned","bodyText":"The Guardian's New Europe series launched at perhaps the busiest time for international news since 9/11. Revolution in north Africa and the Middle East, a triple disaster in Japan, Ivory Coast on the brink. What could a month-long journey through Europe's most important countries tell us about the crises of the day? Plenty. Within hours of launching Germany week, the nuclear disaster in Japan was contaminating German politics, forcing a rethink on nuclear power and propelling the Greens to a remarkable electoral triumph. France week kicked off at the same time as the French-led air assault (pictured below) on Muammar Gaddafi's regime, which rebooted not only French foreign policy but perhaps the Sarkozy presidency. The immigration debate in southern Europe faced a new dynamic with the sudden spike in the number of Africans heading north across the Mediterranean. All this at a time when the leaders in all four countries we examined faced questions about their mandate: Nicolas Sarkozy and Poland's Donald Tusk are both girding for imminent re-election battles; Spain will get a new prime minister next year after José Luis Zapatero announced he would not be seeking a third term; and Germany's Angela Merkel suffered an electoral setback in Baden-Württemberg. But New Europe month told us most about the post-crash Europe that we live in. It gave us a chance to understand how our neighbours are dealing with the biggest economic upheaval in a generation, an opportunity to find out who had the best answers to universal European problems of ageing populations, listless youth, insolvent governments, bankrupt welfare systems, restive regions and often unfair health and education systems. Economics and welfare Our correspondents found that when it comes to economics, Europe's post-crisis nations are a little like Tolstoy's families: happy economies are alike, but every unhappy economy is unhappy in its own way. In France, les misérables are striking workers, jobless youth and a president who has had to water down his grand designs for Thatcherite reform. In Spain, the unhappy are residents of construction-boom towns that now sit almost empty, the bankers who are all but bust and the one in five unemployed. In Poland, the unfortunates are those on the wrong end of deepening inequality. Ailing economies weaken the power of the state, nowhere more critically than in France, where the sense of entitlement now dwarfs the ability of the state to subserve it. Polly Toynbee found that in a country which diverts a full third of its national income to pensions, income support, health and social services, \"cross-party commitment to welfare runs deep\". Readers online and of the paper were as divided as the French themselves on the issue of whether the generous French welfare state was still affordable. For some, the country's system is a model for the UK; others expressed concern about its top-down economy and an emergent two-tier system for workers, in which those on low pay and temporary contracts are excluded from the security, tax breaks and welfare payments enjoyed by their permanent counterparts. One reader, Gwan, said: \"No one in my office has a permanent contract, and we're all educated to master's level and employed by the state. Job insecurity aside, there's zero hope for advancement.\" Health and education France's health system impressed our correspondents, beating the NHS on most yardsticks. The picture was more nuanced elsewhere, but readers took issue with the suggestion that Spanish healthcare and medical staff have been protected from cutbacks during the financial downturn. Healthcare standards vary greatly between regions as the organisation of the communidades autónomas play their parts, they said, with one reader citing a 10% cut in Catalonia's health budget this year. There was much praise, however, for the work of the donor co-ordinators mentioned in the article and for hospitals' treatment of family members and visitors. On schools, our correspondents were surprised to find that elitism, selection and ghettoisation were not just a British disease. The German system of streaming at 10, which heavily favours the middle classes, felt like a formalisation of the UK's own patchwork system in which the well-to-do try to buy better futures for their children. The Spanish mix of concertadas (academies) and faith schools alongside down-at-heel state schools also felt deeply familiar. France, with its long school days, rigorous grading system and uniform curriculum, is falling down international league tables. Immigration Also familiar are the various debates across the continent on immigration, minorities and integration. In France, Angelique Chrisafis spoke to Marine Le Pen, pictured, dauphine of the far right, who still argues that immigration is a threat to the economy and security of France, and speaks of immigrants as \"neverending queues of foreigners\". Her Front National scored well in local elections and an opinion poll found she was more popular than Sarkozy. In Germany, steeped in a sulphurous debate about whether Turks are doing enough to integrate, Gary Younge found housing projects where there was \"not a lot of tension here, but there's also not necessarily a lot of contact\". Readers weighed in on both sides: many took issue with \"multiculturalism\". JoeDeM wrote: \"It seems that Germany has similar problems to the UK when it comes to the integration of Muslim immigrant communities. Hardly surprising.\" Ostberlin offered a first-person perspective that provided a nice counterpoint: \"Although everybody speaks about education all the time, I think the poison of racism is the key issue; if, like Günther Wallraff, you treat people with affection and dignity, they respond in kind. This is my experience.\" In Spain and Poland, our writers found countries preoccupied with a different kind of migration: exodus. With jobs hard to find, a new cohort of Spanish youth is preparing to move overseas to find work. Poles did the same, of course, throughout the past decade. Amelia Gentleman found that many are now returning, and not always with good stories. One migrant, JanPomorski, said: \"I was one of those migrants myself, came back after two years … I was just another Pole living in the ghetto (Stratford, London) for 900 pounds/month, in overcrowded place, struggling to save some money. As for the promised land, I can say just one thing: agencies. Some work agencies are advertising, hiring, and even training in Poland (like I was trained) and as soon as you start working they don't give a sheet about you any more.\" Gender and family life Zoe Williams found Germany preoccupied with its low birth rate, France suffused with pervasive, tacit misogyny, and Spain with a lot of women in its government, but many more discriminated against in the job market. Readers challenged the view of France, pointing to a proliferation of political and business high flyers, with lavieenrose offering this personal perspective: \"As a woman who has lived in France for 40 years, I worked my way up the corporate ladder to senior management positions back in the supposedly dark days of the 70s and 80s. Not easy, particularly with two children, but not exceptional by any means and probably easier than in the UK due to the higher percentage of working women, superior maternity benefits and well-organised childcare facilities. And why no mention of leading French businesswomen such as Anne Lauvergeon, president of one of the biggest companies in the world, Areva?\" However, support for the piece came from mireillep: \"It is anecdotal but I find women here so subservient in subtle ways. Men rule, no doubt about that. In this Latin society the male has space, he is entitled. It is indefinite, it is subtle, but even my British husband feels it. They strut their stuff and it's OK. Women work, have babies (the highest birthrate in Europe), do the washing, the shopping, the cooking, the kids' stuff (82% of childrearing is carried out by women, 80% of domestic tasks too) and they get depressed (recent studies done) and anxious. France is the highest consumer of antidepressants.\" Our G2 writers, meanwhile, found young European families grappling with the same issues that their British counterparts face: trying to be good parents as well as good professionals; short of time, space and money. Art and culture Correspondents found arts at the sharp end of the cuts agenda – even in France, which has traditionally earmarked lavish funds to ensure the persistence of the exception culturelle. Some readers argued that Spain's art scene might not be as bleak as our piece portrayed, pointing to \"an overwhelming amount of art that doesn't involve gallery spaces, public or private\". Street theatre, outdoor performances and exhibitions are found all year round, some readers said, and there has been an improvement in Spanish arts since the 1980s and 90s, with increased involvement of public institutions at national, regional and local level, leading to new collections, grants, exhibitions and museums. Others suggested Spain was \"a cultural desert\" that neglected to nurture artistic talent at youth and university levels and also lacked cultural programming on TV – factors that are driving Spanish talent abroad. Marie Winckler's appeal for new, subversive French theatre directors, actors and playwrights produced a wide range of recommendations on who to follow, from the Théâtre de la Colline in Paris to the writers Bernard-Marie Koltès, Jean-Luc Lagarce and Olivier Py, and actor/writers such as Joël Pommerat. Commenters broadly agreed there was a shortage in this area of French theatre, with some suggesting the stagnation was being felt in other cultural areas such as the visual arts, too, and was fed by being \"a closed space which only services a small group [of friends and influencers]\". Dorota Maslowsa's summary of the development and future of Polish art since the fall of communism was welcomed by commenters as \"interesting\" and \"well-observed\", although one worried: \"I just hope that 'modern' and 'universal' are not euphemisms for 'western' and 'homogenous'.\" Europeans Readers were invited to send us short videos in support of their favourite European country. Spain emerged as the most popular and Spaniards the most likely to nominate their own land, possibly helped by a Twitter campaign urging Spaniards to fly the national flag. \"Where else can you ski in the morning and go to the beach in the afternoon?\" pondered Cristina and Lola. Miles from Wiesbaden took us on a tour of his city to show us \"why Germany is a nice place\", explaining that Germans are old-fashioned people who love traditional food, nature and romance. Italians made wry references to Silvio Berlusconi's extracurricular activities while extolling their food, lifestyle and landscape. Ambra told us: \"I don't eat pasta every day, drive a Ferrari or participate in bunga-bunga parties with my prime minister.\" As for the European project itself, battered by the debt crisis, correspondents found Germany determined to defend its national interest, Spain's prime minister told Giles Tremlett the country would not need a bailout – words that take on greater significance in the wake of the Portuguese cry for help this week – and Timothy Garton-Ash's overview of Poland's journey to being a \"normal\" European country elicited plenty of responses. Alex, a 28-year-old living in Warsaw, said: \"I am surprised how well authors of articles from the series New Europe describe Poland.\" Talking of his own, post-communist generation, he went on: \"When I observe young people, born in the 80s and 90s, it is obvious they have no complexes, they feel Europeans, and speak at least one foreign language. It is the generation of our parents and grandparents who still live in the past, slowing down reforms and any other necessary changes in the country. I'm not sure if we should complain that much about the situation when people who govern still don't understand our reality – we are Europeans with European problems just living on Polish territory.\"Guardian readers also shared their views of Poland – its cities, countryside, food and people – in our Flickr group, inspired by David Levene's shots of Warsaw."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2007/dec/04/greenpolitics.conservatives","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2007-12-04T09:39:29Z","webTitle":"Tories rethink nuclear power 'last resort'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/dec/04/greenpolitics.conservatives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2007/dec/04/greenpolitics.conservatives","fields":{"headline":"Tories rethink nuclear power 'last resort'","bodyText":"Nuclear power is no longer to be viewed as \"a last resort\" by the Conservatives, according to an energy policy statement to be published later this week designed to give David Cameron greater credibility on how he would achieve the 80% carbon emissions reductions the party supports. An interim energy review by the party published last year suggested that the Conservatives would only view a fresh generation of nuclear power stations as \"a last resort\", and predicted other forms of green energy would come first. The proposal led to ridicule from Tony Blair who said the Conservatives were giving no clear signal on nuclear power even though the private sector required certainty and a long lead time if it was to take the commercial risk of building new nuclear power stations capable of replacing the current ageing stock. The announcement will come as a relief to the nuclear industry wary of making significant investments because of concern that an anti-nuclear Tory party might one day take office. The government is due to publish the outcome of its consultation on nuclear power early next year. The first consultation was cancelled after the high court ruled it had not been conducted fairly. It is not clear whether the dropping of the phrase \"last resort\" will lead to a concrete change in Tory policy towards nuclear energy. The Tory interim review opposed subsidies, or special favours to nuclear, and called for transparency about lifetime costs, including clarity about disposal of waste. Subsequently the quality of life review led by Zac Goldsmith and John Gummer took a less negative approach to nuclear power. It pointed out that nuclear would be exempt from a carbon levy and questioned whether it was realistic to replace current electricity provision without an element of nuclear. The new policy may instead reflect a Tory admission that it is unlikely to meet its ambitious carbon emission reduction targets of an 80% cut by 2050 without a continuing contribution from nuclear energy. The government itself has opposed an explicit nuclear subsidy, but would treat nuclear power as exempt from the European emissions trading system, and not subject to a carbon levy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/nov/22/security-cover-up-nuclear-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-22T00:06:37Z","webTitle":"Security 'cover-up' at nuclear plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/22/security-cover-up-nuclear-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/nov/22/security-cover-up-nuclear-plants","fields":{"headline":"Security 'cover-up' at nuclear plants","bodyText":"The government is refusing to provide details on five separate security breaches at Britain's nuclear power stations last year. The breaches have prompted accusations that ministers are suppressing damaging information at a time when they are attempting to sell the idea of more nuclear power stations. Earlier this month, 10 new sites in England and Wales were approved. The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, told MPs that nuclear was a \"proven and reliable\" energy source. But the latest annual report from the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS) has prompted questions about the measures being taken to protect the country's ageing plants. The report states that nuclear operators must disclose \"events and occurrences which may be of interest from a security point of view\". It notes: \"Five reports were made which warranted further investigation and subsequent follow-up action.\" According to government guidelines, such incidents include \"any unauthorised incursion on to the premises\", \"any incident occurring on the premises involving an explosive or incendiary device\", \"any damage to any building or equipment on the premises which might affect the security of the premises\", \"any theft or attempted theft of any nuclear material\" and \"any theft or attempted theft, or any loss or unauthorised disclosure, of sensitive nuclear information\". The incidents are a cause for concern due to the heightened security threat, with al-Qaida terrorists thought to be targeting nuclear plants around the world. There are also claims that al-Qaida has attempted to procure radioactive materials abroad. Last year, western intelligence services, including MI5 and MI6, successfully blocked 16 attempts to smuggle plutonium or uranium, according to reports. In all cases the materials were believed to be destined for terrorist groups. Earlier this month an independent MP, Dai Davies, tabled parliamentary questions demanding that the government detail the nature of the five security breaches. But the energy minister, David Kidney, cited \"national security reasons\" in declining the request. Kidney said providing any more details would be in breach of government guidelines that \"prevent the disclosure of sensitive nuclear information that could assist a person or group planning theft, blackmail, sabotage and other malevolent or illegal acts\". Dr David Lowry, a nuclear policy consultant who specialises in security issues, attacked the refusal to provide further details. \"Three years ago, the OCNS's annual report recorded eight breaches in information security, and at that time the nuclear security regulator was prepared to reveal that these included 'the theft of laptops from parked vehicles' and 'inappropriate transmission of restricted information over the internet',\" Lowry said. \"Now we have the minister responsible for nuclear security refusing to disclose any of the five reportable security incidents. Does this indicate they are much more important than hitherto, or does it reflect an acute atomic insecurity by ministers because they are trying to sell the claimed benefits of new nuclear plants to a sceptical public?\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/apr/23/afghanistan-party-leaders-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-23T12:57:02Z","webTitle":"The leaders failed to deliver on Afghanistan | Wazhma Frogh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/23/afghanistan-party-leaders-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/23/afghanistan-party-leaders-debate","fields":{"headline":"The leaders failed to deliver on Afghanistan","bodyText":"Ironically, when the UK stood by the United States in the \"war on terror\" in 2001, they didn't try to influence or solicit public opinion on why they went to Afghanistan, but when leaders are competing in a general election, Afghanistan becomes a top foreign affairs priority. Sound political leadership is about shaping public opinion. When a crowd of anti-war protests was asking for UK troops to get out of Afghanistan, the leaders weren't convincing enough about their strategies in Afghanistan. While all the three leaders accepted failures in strategies in Afghanistan, none of them illustrated any changes or anything new to recuperate the sinking mission in Afghanistan. As an Afghan, I believe the leaders, too, are already convinced by the popular views that come from the United States, rather than coming up with their own perspectives in relation to the war in Afghanistan. I also think the three leaders are too obsessed with the southern region of Afghanistan and base their whole analysis on Helmand rather than understanding the overall challenges of Afghanistan. David Cameron tried to impress the audience with his mythical general knowledge that most of the Taliban insurgency is based in the south, which is a Pashtun-dominated region, and that the national army is dominantly Tajiks. However, we Afghans believe that the problem of continued militancy is a result of the lack of a cohesive strategy by the UK and other international allies that have built a parallel government in Afghanistan. The success of this war does not depend on helicopters, as claimed by Cameron, but depends on the coordination and partnership of UK with the Afghan government. None of the leaders talked about the importance of governance and working with the Afghan government. I also found contradictory remarks in the debate by the political leaders. While Nick Clegg advocated a values-based politics and complained about human rights violations and torture by UK troops, at the same time he said that the UK is in Afghanistan just to keep itself safe from terrorists, rather than \"parachute democracy\" into Afghanistan. How can we Afghans then believe that troops and international assistance comply with their political values rather than a mere national interest realism? While the UK is the second-largest donor of international aid in Afghanistan, the leaders seemed unaware of the importance of aid effectiveness. As none of them raised the issue, we Afghans believe that international aid has not been effective enough to help the Afghan government and Afghanistan to stand on its own, and neither have we seen strong accountability mechanisms in the aid given. Gordon Brown tried to link the resurgence of the Taliban with border infiltration, but none of the leaders seem to understand that al-Qaida threats are flourishing in Pakistan beyond its frontier provinces, given the arrests of Taliban leaders in Karachi. They need to realise that the Taliban insurgency is being supported by the Pakistani intelligence. Considering Pakistan is a nuclear power, the more insurgency strengthens in the region, chances are that nuclear bombs will fall into the hands of al-Qaida. • More Guardian election comment from Cif at the polls"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/201549","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-03T14:58:00Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: Saudis fear 'Shia triangle' of Iran, Iraq and Pakistan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/201549","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/201549","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: Saudis fear 'Shia triangle' of Iran, Iraq and Pakistan","bodyText":"Thursday, 09 April 2009, 04:22 S E C R E T STATE 034688 EO 12958 DECL: 04/07/2019 TAGS OVIP (CLINTON, HILLARY), UAE SUBJECT: (U) Secretary Clinton's April 7, 2009 meeting with UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed 1.(U) Classified by Bureau Assistant Secretary Jeffrey Feltman. Reasons: 1.4 (b) and (d) 2. (U) April 7, 2009; 1:30 p.m.; Washington, DC. 3. (U) Participants: U.S. ---- The Secretary Acting Assistant Secretary Jeffrey Feltman Jake Sullivan, S staff Barbara Masilko, NEA Notetaker UAE --- UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed (AbZ) Ambassador Yousef al Otaiba Abdullah al Saboosi, UAE Notetaker 4. (S) SUMMARY. The Secretary reviewed the status of the US-UAE 123 agreement and additional action the UAE can take to encourage a positive Congressional review. The UAE request for participation in the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF) is under serious consideration. The Secretary expressed her interest in participating in a GCC plus three meeting in Baghdad in the near future. The UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed (AbZ) also suggested a GCC plus 3 and P5 plus 1 joint meeting to discuss Iran. AbZ confirmed his intention to participate in the Pakistan Donors conference in Tokyo and expressed concerns about Saudi back peddling. The Secretary thanked the UAE for the positive support for both the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Palestinian Authority. AbZ noted that Qatar wants the Arab League to request a meeting with the Quartet focused on settlements and East Jerusalem. END SUMMARY. -------------------------------------- Nuclear Cooperation and Export Control -------------------------------------- 5. (S) The Secretary expressed the Administration's commitment to the U.S.-UAE Agreement for Cooperation on the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (aka 123 Agreement). She emphasized that our goal is to get the agreement completed as smoothly as possible. AbZ said that he is delighted with the progress on the agreement. He added that the UAE's goal is to create a gold standard for a nuclear power program. Then, because of the strong commitments the UAE has made, it will be impossible to have improper use of its nuclear facilities. 6. (S) Turning to the need to be prepared to respond to Congress, the Secretary committed to form a State Department committee including H, NEA and ISN to work on the notification. The Secretary noted the importance of implementing the UAE export control law and continued UAE efforts against illicit Iranian trade and Iranian front companies. The Secretary encouraged action on nonproliferation treaty commitments as especially helpful actions the UAE could take to support our efforts. AbZ noted that the UAE would formally join the additional protocol on April 8. 7. (S) AbZ agreed that the August 2007 export control law had some \"loopholes\" and said that the UAE Cabinet \"revisited\" the issue last week. Otaiba said that AbZ had personally intervened to ensure timely action. Otaiba elaborated that the committee charged with implementing the export control law will have its first meeting later this month to begin operations. 8. (S) Otaiba noted that, even in the absence of a formal implementation committee, the UAE is taking action - citing a recent case involving German-made Siemens computers and a Chinese ship bound for Iran interdicted in port in the UAE. --------------------- Major Economies Forum --------------------- 9. (S) The Secretary noted UAE interest in the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF). While noting that the UAE does not technically meet the criteria for the meeting, based on size of the economy alone, the Secretary said there are many criteria that make it important for the UAE to attend, adding she will make a recommendation for UAE participation as an observer. AbZ said the UAE bid to host the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) headquarters would be very difficult to achieve if the UAE is locked out of the MEF preparatory meeting in Washington and promised \"we will remember your help.\" ---- Iran ---- 10. (S) The Secretary said the U.S. is looking to see if Iran can be engaged in any productive manner and noted that Special Advisor Ross would travel to the region soon for consultations. AbZ told the Secretary that UAE feels threatened by Iran today, even though Iran does not yet have a nuclear capability. AbZ asserted that the UAE is even more worried about Iranian intentions than is Israel. AbZ encouraged the U.S. to consider a GCC plus 3 and P5 plus 1 joint meeting. ---------------- Iraqi GCC plus 3 ---------------- 11. (S) The Secretary expressed interest in the Iraqi invitations for a GCC plus 3 meeting in Baghdad, at a date to be determined. She noted the value of the GCC plus 3 mechanism not only for furthering Arab engagement with the Iraqi government during a time of transition, but as a way to send a message to Iran that Iraq has broad support in the Arab world. -------------------- Afghanistan/Pakistan -------------------- 12. (S) The Secretary told AbZ that the U.S. needs help to stem the flow of funds from the Gulf to the Taliban. She noted that one area of potential action is reviving training related to bulk cash smuggling. 13. (S) Thanking the UAE for hosting the Friends of Pakistan preparatory meeting, the Secretary said she hopes AbZ would attend the April donors conference in Tokyo. AbZ confirmed that he plans to attend and said that the UAE will make a \"strong\" pledge, but no decision has been made on an exact dollar figure. 14. (S) AbZ express concern over Saudi Arabia's decision not to make a pledge at the Tokyo conference. AbZ said that the Saudis have never liked the Pakistan Peoples Party, and support Nawaz Sharif. In addition, AbZ posited that Saudi Arabia suspects that Zardari is Shia, thus creating Saudi concern of a Shia triangle in the region between Iran, the Maliki government in Iraq, and Pakistan under Zardari. Feltman noted a pattern of Saudi behavior of withholding financial assistance - not supporting March 14 in Lebanon, not sending funds to the PA, and not planning a pledge for Pakistan. Otaiba added that Saudi Arabia also failed make a commitment at the G20 meeting. ------- Lebanon ------- 15. (S) The Secretary noted the need to support Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) in the run up to the elections with concrete displays of support. Feltman added that the UAE had been particularly helpful already by funding the delivery of the first ten refurbished tanks for the LAF. AbZ noted that he would meet with visiting Lebanese Minister of Defense Murr later on April 7. AbZ said the UAE will purchase additional munitions for LAF helicopters, donated by the UAE to LAF last year, but is waiting for France to provide a price estimate. ------------------------- Middle East Peace Process ------------------------- 16. (S) The Secretary thanked the UAE for its strong financial support for the Palestinian Authority (PA). The Secretary asked if AbZ had an update on the status of Palestinian unity talks. Acknowledging that Hamas and Fatah are not coming to an agreement, AbZ replied with a smile that things are \"going well.\" 17. (S) AbZ said that in addition to financial support for the PA it is important that the new Israeli government reach out to President Abbas. AbZ said that the Secretary should expect the Qatari Prime Minister to request an Arab League meeting with the Quartet focused on settlements and East Jerusalem. AbZ said the Quartet will need to use the same standards for the new Israel government as already applied to the Palestinians regarding respecting previous agreements. The Secretary agreed. AbZ said that it is important to create a road map of Israeli and Palestinian actions towards an end game. The Secretary agreed on the importance of simultaneous reinforcing actions in support of negotiations. AbZ said that the UAE candidacy to host IRENA could yield political benefits, if successful. Israel is already a signatory to the agreement, so it would have a representative IRENA mission in Abu Dhabi should the UAE be chosen to host headquarters.

This report responds directly to instruction ref A. End Summary. DG of All States, But in Agreement with Us ------------------------------------------ 2. (C) In a meeting with Ambassador on the eve of the two-week Board of Governors (BoG) and General Conference (GC) marathon of mid-September, IAEA Director General-designate Yukiya Amano thanked the U.S. for having supported his candidacy and took pains to emphasize his support for U.S. strategic objectives for the Agency. Amano reminded Ambassador on several occasions that he would need to make concessions to the G-77, which correctly required him to be fair-minded and independent, but that he was solidly in the U.S. court on every key strategic decision, from high-level personnel appointments to the handling of Iran's alleged nuclear weapons program. 3. (SBU) Amano shared with Ambassador Davies his public stance on the role of the IAEA and the Agency's contribution to the global issues of proliferation, security, power, human health and water management. More candidly, Amano noted the importance of maintaining a certain \"constructive ambiguity\" about his plans, at least until he took over for DG ElBaradei in December. With a bow to the G-77, Amano felt obliged to emphasize the importance of \"balance\" regarding the Agency's work in peaceful uses of nuclear technology. For staff morale reasons, Amano planned to work on improving the quality of management while publicly praising the current standards and commending staff members for their dedication. 4. (SBU) In the course of conversation, Amano was careful to highlight the April 12-13 Nuclear Security Summit in Washington as \"the biggest event for me in the coming months.\" The Summit coming in spring would drive his winter agenda, including events in Davos and the IAEA's March meeting of the Board of Governors. Again for political considerations, Amano said he would balance visits to the U.S. with trips to South Africa, Egypt and Malaysia. Were he not to secure the cooperation of these countries, Amano felt he would make little progress on top priorities upon taking office. While acknowledging the increasing polarization between IAEA Member States, Amano was quick to point out areas of agreement, such as the need to upgrade the Seibersdorf laboratory complex, promote cancer therapy and safely introduce nuclear power. Amano promised to \"treat Iran with dignity,\" but followed up firmly with the claim that he had been granted the post of Director General \"to implement safeguards.\" He emphasized that Iran had specific obligations which the IAEA would enforce; he did not see himself as an intermediary between Iran and the rest of the world. Shaping IAEA Leadership ----------------------- 5. (C) On staffing issues at the Deputy Director General (DDG) level, Amano stressed his pleasure that DDG for Management David Waller had agreed to stay on in his current position. Amano described Waller as \"an old friend, an effective manager and a good speaker.\" Referring to his long-standing acquaintance with DDG for Safeguards Olli Heinonen, a manager he described as \"reliable and professional,\" Amano had also planned to retain Heinonen in his current position. He also intended to appoint another Russian to replace DDG for Nuclear Energy Sokolov. Amano noted that DDG for Security and Safety Taniguchi would be leaving during the summer of 2010 (when his contract expired) and said he hoped to identify a \"reliable person from a reliable country\" to succeed Taniguchi. Amano acknowledged that finding replacements for DDG Cetto (Technical Cooperation) and DDG Burkart (Nuclear Applications) would be trickier, as the jobs were rife with G-77 political considerations and he needed at least one DDG from a developing country. Amano described the complex issue of staffing at the IAEA - from technical expertise to geographical representation and gender balance - as a \"jigsaw puzzle.\" He planned to appoint only one advisor from Japan, someone who was \"not too visible.\" (Note: From subsequent USG-GOJ consultations in Tokyo we know the individual in question to be Satoshi Suzuki, whom we expect to serve as Special Assistant to the Director General for Management. End Note.) Holding Agency to Verification Responsibilities, Not Politics ------------------------------ 6. (C) Subsequently, White House WMD Coordinator Gary Samore and NSC Senior Director Laura Holgate met with Amano on September 15 on the margins of the General Conference. Amano noted that he knows everyone will be focused on the March 2010 Board of Governors meeting, his first as the new DG, to see what he does and says about Iran and Syria. He affirmed it was most important for the IAEA to stick strictly to its verification responsibilities and not offer political \"proposals\" or \"negotiations.\" Amano said that he would insist Iran to implement fully all Safeguards obligations and extend full cooperation with the IAEA, although he does not believe Iran will completely change its current position of stalemate. 7. (C) Amano indicated he had begun reaching out to key individuals in the IAEA, seeking their advice on managing tough issues. He said that, in particular, he had spoken to DDG Safeguards Olli Heinonen about whether or not the IAEA needed to change how the Iran and Syria reports were written. Amano also reaffirmed to Dr. Samore that he plans to keep DDG Management David Waller and Heinonen in their current positions, especially as it is important to maintain some level of consistency and continuity with the turnover of a new DG. 8. (C) Amano echoed these themes in a September 16 meeting with U.S. NPT Special Representative Susan Burk. Citing his own election, Amano noted warmly that \"if you are determined, the U.S. can do anything!\", and he hoped the U.S. also be a driving force in the NPT Revcon. Asked about the need for increased IAEA authorities, Amano affirmed his commitment to keep pushing on the Additional Protocol. He also argued for greater work on the back end of the fuel cycle, suggesting that it would be useful to develop something analogous to the IAEA multilateral fuel assurances arrangement that deals with waste issues while reassuring developing countries that \"it's not just about new restrictions to be imposed.\" Winning 'em over, gradually --------------------------- 9. (SBU) Comment: By the time he departed Vienna with the GC's confirmation of his appointment, Amano appeared comfortable in his \"Director General\" shoes. He speaks with increasing confidence and clarity, having mastered his talking points and grown accustomed to his new title. Apprehensions linger among IAEA staff and diplomatic missions regarding his communications and leadership abilities, but with his performance during the GC he made progress in winning over skeptics. His wisdom in downplaying Japanese visibility among his senior advisors will also assuage staff fears that Amano would subvert the Agency with a Japanese corporate management style. On a grander stage, Amano's global political savvy was clearly in evidence, and his willingness to speak candidly with U.S. interlocutors on his strategy and various balancing acts bodes well for our future relationship. For example, his description of President Obama's Nuclear Security Summit as the biggest event of his early tenure was a deliberate and gratifying gesture. 10. (U) Amano's conversations with Energy Secretary Chu and NRC Chairman Jaczko are reported refs B and C.

The plant's inauguration took place with virtual fuel consisting of lead, which officials said was designed to simulate the enriched uranium needed to make it fully functional. The 1000-megawatt reactor is not expected to come into proper operation until later this year. Today's launch was carried out with great fanfare in the presence of high-level dignitaries and foreign journalists, in an exercise apparently designed to send an international signal of Iran's determination to achieve nuclear status. The symbolism of the event is likely to dismay western powers, who suspect Iran's nuclear programme is a front for building an atomic weapon rather than designed to produce electricity, as Tehran insists. Western concern has focused on Iran's uranium enrichment facility at Natanz rather than Bushehr, whose construction has depended on help from Russia, which has also expressed fears about the Iranian nuclear programme. Today's launch was attended by Russian nuclear officials, including the head of Moscow's nuclear agency, Sergei Kiriyenko. Russia insists that the Bushehr plant is purely civilian and cannot be used to make bombs. However, Russian involvement in the £700m-project has been problematic because of the country's status as a permanent member of the UN security council, which has imposed three rounds of sanctions on Iran because of its failure to suspend uranium enrichment. Russia completed nuclear fuel deliveries for Bushehr last year, after a series of delays blamed by Moscow on late payments but which Iran suspected was a Russian attempt to pressure them into concessions in its dispute with the security council. Work on Bushehr originally started 34 years ago, during the reign of the shah with the help of the German contractor Siemens. It was suspended shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution, when Siemens claimed it had not been paid. The mothballed plant sustained bomb damage during the 1980-88 war between Iran and Iraq, when much of its equipment was looted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/aug/29/good-companies-guide-2010","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-28T23:06:23Z","webTitle":"Good Companies Guide: easing the planet's growing pains will help business to profit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/29/good-companies-guide-2010","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/aug/29/good-companies-guide-2010","fields":{"headline":"Good Companies Guide: easing the planet's growing pains will help business to profit","bodyText":"A few diehards in the City still think sustainability is just for sandal-wearers. But how we deal with the major ecological and social challenges facing the world will have enormous implications for the global economy and for the prospects of the UK's leading companies. It will also have an impact on the pension savings and the purse strings of virtually every household in Britain. The BP oil spill, which wiped billions of pounds off the value of pension funds, is evidence that no investor, large or small, can afford to ignore the environment, or the issue of how we manage our resources. The Observer has commissioned in-depth research from The Co-operative Asset Management into how the UK's leading companies might be affected by five key sustainability issues: resource depletion, climate change, pollution, demographics and resource distribution. Its analysis suggests that 56%, or more than half of the FTSE 350 by weight, will suffer negative financial effects from depleting resources, climate change and pollution. Only 10% stand to gain by providing solutions. This is a warning of testing times ahead for both business and society. It also presents a major challenge for the pensions industry, which needs to ensure its investments will be able to provide people with retirement incomes. Ecology Business should care about ecological sustainability because of the increasing scientific evidence that human society is overshooting its limits. Sources of food, energy and water are being exploited at rates that cannot be sustained for long, and many pollution sinks are overfilled. This is likely to jeopardise economic activity and growth, and leaves us at risk of a sharp contraction. Both climate change and oil production are inextricably linked to food, energy and water systems. Oil depletion, for example, would have significant effects on food supplies, as many fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides are oil-based. Biofuels may compete with food for land use and oil use drives climate change, which adds pressure to the water, food and living systems. The critical questions for economic sustainability are, first, whether these factors will come to impose an absolute ceiling on global economic growth and, second, to what extent these limits can be pushed back or overcome. As the government-commissioned Stern report pointed out, our actions now and in the coming decades could create risks of major disruption to the economy and society on a scale similar to the two world wars and the Great Depression. Large companies recognise that they have a vested interest in this. In 2008, Shell outlined two distinct and plausible scenarios. It describes the bleaker scenario as a \"scramble\" or a disorderly decline in conventional economic growth as resources are exploited past the point of no return, in an environment where policy becomes dysfunctional and governments become protectionist about their national resources. The alternative, \"blueprint\" scenario involves a rocky transition to a new economic paradigm that requires a mixture of restrained use of resources, technological revolution and increasingly co-ordinated policy at local, national and global levels. In June, the Green Investment Bank Commission Report put a price of £550bn on the infrastructure spending needed before 2020 to decarbonise the UK alone. If the right policies and investment are put in place this will not only help ensure the future, but provide opportunities for businesses and investors. Even with such spending, companies – and the rest of us – face huge challenges including peak oil, the point at which production begins an inexorable fall, and the decline in biodiversity. The numbers of non-human vertebrates have fallen more than 30% between 1970 and 2005: a decline highly detrimental to the functioning of ecosystems on which food supply depends. Many other species are also suffering – the dramatic decline in the bee population, a major pollinator for agriculture, is a key example. Businesses are likely to be pushed into innovation and behaviour change to optimise resource efficiency and pollute less. That may reduce the constraints on growth and lead to new markets, for instance in clean energy. But there is still a significant risk that global economic growth will slow and turn negative because of ecological limitations. There is also significant potential for resource wars, particularly civil and border conflicts over water and fertile land. Society We all need food, shelter, education and healthcare, along with the ability to make a decent living. A key aspect of sustainability is meeting basic human needs within the planet's means. These concerns are shaping the actions of some of world's very richest: this month 38 billionaires have joined Warren Buffett and Bill Gates in pledging to give away over half their wealth. Demographics are a major issue here. The world's population is expected to grow from around 6.7 billion to 9 billion by 2050. Aside from the obvious pressures on resources, most of the increase will come from developing countries and that will increase pressure to distribute wealth and resources more equally, and to improve the situation of the poor. Many developed economies, including the UK and the US, have ageing populations, which presents its own risks to economic growth. People's contribution to the economy declines in older age and a smaller working-age population will have to struggle to support the elderly. Poverty is linked to global insecurity and provides a breeding ground for terrorism. Recent global crises, including food price spikes, climate change and the credit crunch, have hit the poor hardest. Many large companies have considerable power either to exacerbate or to relieve these problems and could play a major role in realising the United Nations' millennium development goals. Companies, especially multinationals, can make an important contribution to building sustainable societies by being responsive to the needs of poor people. The financial crisis has shown that corporate social responsibility and \"ethical business\" are no longer an add-on activity aimed at \"taking off the worst edges\" of the free-market system, but critical to a more stable functioning and should therefore be embedded in the way companies work and think. For forward-thinking enterprises, there is frequently a reward to be found in new markets. In particular, companies need to be wise to the situation of women. More than two-thirds of the billion people living on less than a dollar a day are female. In developing or agricultural economies, women undertake a vast proportion of the work, particularly relating to water and food gathering. Women in traditional societies have a wealth of farming experience and present a major opportunity for efficient husbandry of resources, but only if they are empowered to make decisions. Similarly, if women are educated, skilled and able to work, research has shown they use their incomes to plough back into their family, creating benefits for societies as a whole by spending on healthcare, education and better food. Food When the Russian wheat harvest failed this year because of drought, it drove wheat prices up 80%. This echoed a broader surge in food prices in 2008 that caused social unrest in a number of African countries. We do not know if climate change caused the drought, but we do know that it will bring increased volatility in future. In general terms, we are witnessing symptoms of an agricultural system that is reaching crisis point at a time of growing demand from millions of people in Asia whose standard of living is rising. The biggest mining company in the world, BHP Billiton, is bidding for the world's largest listed producer of potash, a fertiliser that will be in much demand as emerging markets show increased appetite for meat and dairy products. Unpredictable weather and bottlenecks affecting critical resources are enough of a problem, but the agricultural system will have to meet a host of other challenges. The first challenge comes from within the industry itself. Agriculture has a huge impact on the environment as many fertilisers release nitrous oxide, which has 300 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. An equally pressing problem is linked to the limited availability of arable land. A shortage of farms for growing crops has led to a land grab across the world as governments and corporations seek to secure food supplies. The issue is explosive, as Madagascar discovered two years ago. A proposed deal in 2008 with Korean car giant Daewoo to lease 1m acres of land to grow corn for Korea resulted in a civil revolt and a coup. Compounding such issues, in many countries where water is in short supply it is used intensively for crops or products which are then exported. Politics is not the only significant factor. Around the world, natural habitats are being converted to human use at an alarming rate, accelerating climate change, with deforestation at the worst end of spectrum. Experts suggest that the underlying trend is for commodity prices to rise. How will this affect business? A good rule of thumb is that a bit of inflation is good for industry, while too much destroys demand. Companies that may benefit from the new challenges are likely to include those that can ensure continuity of supply and have enough pricing power to pass on costs. In general, food producers and retailers are likely to reap dividends from price inflation, apart from vendors of animal products, where customers are likely to be put off by sharp price rises. Tobacco and beverage companies appear to be beneficiaries: high margins indicate they have few problems in passing on cost increases. Water It is estimated that feeding a world population estimated to climb to 9 billion by 2050 will require twice as much water for agriculture compared with today. Only 2.5% of the world's water resources are fresh, of which two thirds is frozen; oil is not the only resource we should worry about running out of. The market for water-related products and services today is put at over $480bn and set to increase rapidly. Opportunities for water companies are limitless. Enterprising companies can concentrate on finding new reservoirs, updating infrastructure, fixing leaks, installing water meters to encourage customers to use less, and exploring desalination technology, though the latter is energy- and carbon-intensive. But companies in general have a role to play. Beverages companies are among the leaders when it comes to water management. SAB Miller, for instance, has invested significant management time in understanding water-supply challenges and their related business implications. It has formed partnerships with public and non-governmental organisations, having acknowledged that water is too complex an issue for any one company or stakeholder to tackle on its own. For nuclear energy companies, challenges lie ahead. Nuclear power has been billed as a cleaner option than coal, but nuclear power plants use up to 83% more water per megawatt. The blueprint for meeting future energy demands tend to concentrate on CO2 emissions, while largely overlooking water consideration. Clearly, there is much work to be done. What about the implications of water for the digital industry? How many people know that a data centre operating chillers and cooling towers can consumer 18,000 gallons of water daily to dissipate the heat generated by the IT equipment? The water footprint of the internet and e-commerce is huge and growing fast. Few companies will remain unaffected by the need to manage water resources more efficiently. Without action to create more sustainable societies, economic activity will be threatened by wars, political coups, terrorism and mass migration, whilst the shadow of resource constraints looms large. But if more people are pulled out of poverty, societies are likely to be more stable and new consumer markets will open up to companies prepared to serve them. Benjamin McCarron, analyst at The Co-operative Asset Management, says: \"When the recession fades, governments and companies will have to reckon with the troubling health indicators of the planet, which pose the most formidable challenges to economic stability. Our study shows that while the risks to some companies are great, so are the opportunities for the far-sighted and the early movers.\" In the near future, enormous demands will be placed on the earth's resources. There is a wave of aspiration from disadvantaged sections of society around the world and new consumer demands from an emerging global middle class; the challenge is achieving growth and satisfying people's desire for goods and services without destroying the planet. Despite the challenges ahead, courageous companies can still prosper. Governments, consumers and businesses are slowly moving to support those that provide solutions to the planet's growing pains."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/may/21/coalition-government-michael-white-political-briefing","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-21T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"Coalition government: Living up to cosy vows is the real challenge  | Michael White's political briefing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/21/coalition-government-michael-white-political-briefing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/may/21/coalition-government-michael-white-political-briefing","fields":{"headline":"Coalition government: Living up to cosy vows is the real challenge","bodyText":"Sensible thinktanks and campaigns know that most voters want to give the Lib-Con government a fair wind, so they ploughed through today's revised coalition agreement without echoing Oscar Wilde's verdict on Charles Dickens's description of the death of Little Nell: \"One must have a heart of stone not to read it without laughing.\" That is as it should be. Those closely involved in the process speak of mutual enthusiasm, excitement about an exhilarating process of consensus-seeking between lots of clever people who believe they have the chance to make a real difference. All governments start this way. Yet the 31-page text oozes such high-minded, adjectival good intentions – 400 of them – that one recently ejected Labour cabinet minister snarled: \"It's not a programme for government. They're in love.\" The coalition will either stagger on for two years or survive two full parliaments, he predicted, adding: \"There will not be much left of the Lib Dems if it does.\" Taken at face value the agreement will bring urgently needed improvements to life in Britain. It ranges from renewal of Labour's half-achieved pledge to end child poverty by 2020, and an ambitious swath of constitutional and economic reforms, to \"proactively enforcing the grocery supply code of practice\" (good news for small farmers!) and a ban on cheap supermarket cider deals (not good news for some farms). Reporters were quick to spot up to 30 policy reviews of one kind or another, a handful of opt-outs for Lib Dem MPs (such as Trident and civil nuclear power), another fistful of fudged language (marriage tax breaks, NHS targets, that hunting ban) and countless promises to \"bring forward detailed [sometimes effective] policies\" in due course. The coalition will have a lot of long grass to mow. At an ebullient Nick Clegg's side at the agreement's launch, David Cameron reproached the \"churlish\" media for not giving credit where it was due. In some countries coalition agreements take 40 days, even 80, yet their teams – Tories Oliver Letwin, James O'Shaughnessy and Steve Hilton, Lib Dems Danny Alexander and Polly Mackenzie – had knocked one out in a mere nine. Top civil servants joined the drafting love-in too. Fair enough, assorted thinktanks seemed to reply today. Their statements spoke of being \"encouraged\" by some commitments before adding the inevitable \"but\". The King's Fund was typically diplomatic. The coalition's welcome pledge to \"end top-down reorganisations\" in the NHS must be weighed against the Tory pledge (endorsed by Clegg) to set up an arms-length board to manage the health service free of political interference, it observed. Not to mention the Lib Dem scheme (endorsed by Cameron) to elect local people to primary care trust boards. There was plenty of evidence of pages from rival manifestos being torn in half and taped together in ways that may cause trouble down the line. Europe? Banking reform? Tax policy shorn of that embarrassing Tory inheritance tax pledge (coalitions do have their uses)? Which policy landmine will provoke the first resignation? Some MPs are eyeing Vince Cable's complex conscience. Overall the document still reads more like a pre-election manifesto, full of shiny, costly plans to improve voters' lives, some MPs murmur. Where is the harsh postelection realism they were promised? Where, asked the hawk-eyed Institute for Fiscal Studies, is the agreed ratio between tax increases and spending cuts needed to reduce the fiscal deficit as urgently as the coalition promises? The pre-election Tories proposed a ratio of 4:1 in favour of spending cuts, the Lib Dems a gentler 2.5:1. Voters may learn who has won when the £6bn cuts package is announced on Monday. After all, the back page of today's agreement states clearly: \"The deficit reduction programme takes precedence over all other measures.\" Insiders say: \"It's not a spending programme, it's a reform programme. A lot of these reforms won't cost much.\" Good luck."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2010/apr/07/election-2010-bnp-respect-ukip","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-07T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Election 2010 party guides: Smaller parties","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/07/election-2010-bnp-respect-ukip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/apr/07/election-2010-bnp-respect-ukip","fields":{"headline":"Election 2010 party guides: Smaller parties","bodyText":"British National Party Founded: 1982 Members: 18,000 Latest odds to win a seat or more: Leader Nick Griffin Campaign slogan \"Standing up for Great Britain\" Campaign colours Anything on a union jack When founded 1982 by white supremacist John Tyndall who in his 17 year stewardship of the party, went to the clink three times.

Then every time I saw a clip of the speech, that clip seemed slightly absurd. Who warned: \"History repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce\"? Ralph Miliband would have known. New Labour was a tragedy. New Generation Labour, I'm afraid, seems farcical to me, already. I hate myself for it, I really do. But there it is. It seems to me that all we voters have to choose between is two brands of fantasy. Ed Miliband's fantasy is that Labour can now do all the stuff it was voted in to do in 1997, when it achieved an awesome mandate at the start of a long boom. That's certainly optimistic. David Cameron's fantasy, shared by his deputy, is that he can wipe out the deficit within five years, to the applause of a busy, purposeful and grateful nation. This sort of wishful thinking is, apparently, \"pessimistic\". Right. Goodness, the polity is weird. On Newsnight, after Miliband's speech (I'm not going to call him Ed – you know which one I mean), an audience of Labour supporters was told of the next day's Telegraph headline. A leaked letter to David Cameron, from Liam Fox, the defence secretary, had warned of the danger of cutting a draconian 10% from his ministry's budget. The assembled Labour activists clapped joyfully. Such farce. \"Why are you clapping?\" someone should have asked. Defence cuts are dangerous because ordinary working people are being killed and maimed in Afghanistan, in a war that might not have got so out of hand if all military and political eyes had not quickly swivelled their focus to Iraq. Under which the New Generation has apparently drawn a line. It's not so easy to draw a line under the consequences of that \"wrong decision\" – and anyway I'm longing to see Miliband's snaps of his happy days spent with the New Generation's outriders, marching against the war. Will defence cuts be among those Miliband has graciously indicated he will support, in his effort to persuade the electorate of Labour's fiscal responsibility? Possibly. He should bear in mind that the last historic reclamation of Labour's fiscal responsibility came with a three-year guarantee that it would stick rigidly to Conservative spending plans. That was the central promise of the so-called prawn cocktail offensive, in which Labour wooed business leaders. It was the underpinning of those heady early days, whose establishment- questioning radicalism Miliband asks everyone to remember with such fondness. Labour carried on keeping business leaders happy, of course. Wonderfully, the New Generation has drawn a line under that too. Again, the consequences are not so easy to jettison. Still, at least there is cross-party agreement on what needs to be done. A new economy must be crafted, one that isn't so dependent on financial services. It's the missing Part B in the Conservative folly. It's the missing Part B in the Labour folly too. Miliband did mention Sheffield Forgemasters in his speech. The government's cancellation of the £80m loan to the company that was arranged by Old Generation Peter Mandelson is another of the cuts that he will not be supporting . . . necessarily. Instead, Miliband wants \"an independent panel to investigate fully the government's cancellation of the Forgemasters loan and provide a binding recommendation on whether the loan should be reinstated\". That sort of fighting talk should provoke attention drift even from the New Generation. No wonder Miliband stuck with saying that the government was being \"not responsible, it's irresponsible\" in his speech. Does he even know if the government is being responsible or irresponsible? Or does he need an independent panel to decide that for him? Nevertheless, the Sheffield Forgemasters problem is interesting. Should an indebted government be borrowing from the bond markets to bolster the ambitious expansion of a limited company that is reluctant to raise money by issuing more shares, and thereby diluting their value? One problem with the \"old economy\" was the reluctance of shareholders to invest for the long-term. Can the \"new economy\" really be built by socialising that reluctance, while leaving the profits in shareholders' hands? Perhaps there needs to be a national conversation about this, rather than an investigation by an independent panel. One thing cannot, however, be denied. Miliband's hero, John Maynard Keynes, would have been minded to invest in Forgemasters. Ed Balls, who presently appears to be straddling the generations as he waits to see if he gets the job he fancies, would be minded to do so as well. Shortly before the leadership election results were announced, he told a mystified group of schoolchildren that Keynes would have generated economic growth just by hiring people to dig holes and fill them back up. Balls didn't, however, add what Keynes had added. \"It is not reasonable, however, that a sensible community should be content to remain dependent on such fortuitous and often wasteful mitigations once we understand the influences upon which effective demand depends.\" One of Britain's problems is that it paid people to dig up holes and fill them in again, during a boom. Well, it didn't, quite, because that would be \"workfare\". But it did emphasise that to find employment, people must have skills, and that those offering unskilled labour could hardly expect a living wage from employers, no matter how profitable the companies they worked for were. The government merely subsidised poverty pay, and was \"content to remain dependent on such fortuitous and often wasteful mitigations\". The New Generation has drawn a line under this too. Rhetorically anyway. How now to promote \"effective demand\"? In the case of Forgemasters, the demand is there. Britain's nuclear energy programme may not be exactly healthy (no government subsidy for nuclear development was the Old Generation's policy, under Old Generation energy secretary Ed). But Forgemasters has an eye to the foreign markets it believes will be buying the large castings that only one other company in the world presently supplies for nuclear power stations. The problem? That's £80m worth of hole-digging that will need to be cancelled somewhere else to create 181 jobs at the plant and the same again in supply lines. Liam Byrne is presently looking very New Generation. But one thing hasn't changed since his days as chief secretary: \"There's no money left.\" If only Keynes had been Labour's great hero while it was in power. Still, he will be next time. Roll on, the boom."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/138803","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-30T21:29:01Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: Nicolas Sarkozy offends the Saudis with his bad manners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/138803","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/138803","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: Nicolas Sarkozy offends the Saudis with his bad manners","bodyText":"Saturday, 26 January 2008, 11:36 S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 RIYADH 000102 SIPDIS SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 01/26/2018 TAGS FR, PGOV, PINR, PREL, SA SUBJECT: SARKOZY IN SAUDI ARABIA REF: RIYADH 0037 Classified By: Charge d'Affaires David Rundell for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 1. (S/NF) SUMMARY. French President Nicholas Sarkozy's visited Saudi Arabia on January 13-14 to make clear that Saudi Arabia is now \"at the top\" of the French Middle East policy list. Pres. Sarkozy met with Saudi King Abdullah, addressed the Shura council and spoke briefly with Saudi business leaders. Topics discussed were Iran's nuclear ambitions, Mid East Peace Process, Syrian meddling in Lebanon, security in Iraq, and French-Saudi cooperation, including the offer of nuclear energy technology. The visit can be viewed as a moderate success for French-Saudi bilateral relations, although no major announcements were made. Press reports of the visit along with a private readout by the French DCM were positive, but our Saudi contacts passed on certain displeasure with the French's conduct. END SUMMARY. 2. (S/NF) French President Nicholas Sarkozy arrived in Riyadh on January 13 for a one night/two day visit. This visit was a follow up to Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud's visit to Paris in June 2007. Pres Sarkozy was accompanied by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, Minister of Defense Hevre Morin, Minister of Justice Rachida Dati, Minister of Culture Christine Albanel and Minister of Education Valerie Pecresse. French DCM in Riyadh Emmanuel Bonne provided a private readout to Acting Pol Counselor of this visit. Topics raised included Iran's nuclear ambitions, Mid East Peace Process, Syrian meddling in Lebanon, security in Iraq, and French-Saudi cooperation, including the offer of nuclear energy technology. Additionally, the main theme was to foster a stronger personal relationship between Pres Sarkozy and King Abdullah. Overall, King Abdullah emphasized multilateral solutions, vice bilateral approaches, regarding the multitude of issues discussed. Readouts from the French and the press were positive, but our Saudi contacts privately shared displeasure with certain French conduct. IRAN ---- 3. (S/NF) Pres Sarkozy reiterated his strong concern with Iran's nuclear ambitions to King Abdullah, asserting sanctions were the best way to put pressure on Iran. Abdullah reportedly does not want to inflame the situation and recommended continued international engagement (P-5 plus Germany) with Iran. He emphasized that Iran must abide by its international obligations, specifically the Non-Proliferation treaty. Abdullah reportedly concurred, noting Iran's destabilizing activities in Iraq and Lebanon, along with Saudi belief that Iran's ultimate goal is to acquire nuclear weapons. However, the Saudis are not yet ready to take any action beyond diplomacy at this point and assured their commitment to French efforts for a diplomatic solution with Iran. King Abdullah stated that Iran knows its obligations and the next step is for the Iranians to comply. The French had hoped to make a joint communiqu on Iran, but the Saudis declined because they do not want to aggravate the Iranian situation. COMMENT: It was not made clear just how the proposed communiqu would have aggravated Saudi-Iranian relations. END COMMENT. MEPP ---- 4. (S/NF) Both Pres Sarkozy and King Abdullah agreed to support the Annapolis initiative to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Abdullah told Sarkozy that the issue of Palestinian refugees must first be resolved and that the Israelis must cease all West Bank settlement construction. Abdullah maintained that East Jerusalem must be the capital of a Palestinian state and that this section of Jerusalem must be solely under Arab control. The French had hoped to issue a joint communiqu on the Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process, but no consensus could be reached. SYRIA/LEBANON ------------- 5. (S/NF) The issue of Lebanon was raised by Pres Sarkozy. Abdullah cautioned that everyone should be very cautious in speaking with the Syrians, implying their duplicity. He added the French \"should be firm\" with Syria in regards to RIYADH 00000102 002 OF 003 Lebanon. In a separate meeting between French FM Bernard Kouchner and Saudi FM Saud al Faisal, the French supported the Arab initiative on Lebanon. Saud added he was skeptical of the current Lebanese political parties and doubted the Syrians would comply with any accord. IRAQ ---- 6. (S/NF) Regarding Iraq, both Pres Sarkozy and King Abdullah concurred that Iraq's security had dramatically improved since 2006. Abdullah reportedly opined that Iraq must remained a unified state, and that external players, such as Iran, must be dissuaded from interfering. FRENCH-SAUDI COOPERATION ------------------------ 7. (S/NF) General energy policy was discussed, including gas, oil and nuclear power. Pres Sarkozy made an offer to provide civilian nuclear energy technology (Reftel) to the kingdom. King Abdullah was receptive to the offer, but no firm agreement was made. 8. (S/NF) In his speech to the Shura Council (Septel) on January 14, Pres Sarkozy espoused tolerance of different religious faiths, women's rights, and freedom of expression. His speech barely mentioned political issues and instead focused on a \"civilization policy\" - respect and dignity for all cultures. While some of these themes are at odds with traditional Saudi society, Emb Off present at this event reported that Sarkozy was well-received. 9. (S/NF) The French delegation included various Ministers to strengthen educational, commercial and energy ties with the kingdom. Four cooperative agreements were made: 1) political consultations to coordinate regional activities; 2) energy policy regarding gas and oil; 3) vocational language training increase from 100 to 500 students to help overcome the French-Arabic language barrier; and 4) higher education with the goal to increase the number of Saudi students in France (currently 4000). Pres Sarkozy had a brief (10-minute) presentation to Saudi business leaders. 10. (S/NF) The overarching theme of the visit, according to French Embassy Riyadh, was to strengthen the personal relationship between Pres Sarkozy and King Abdullah. Former Pres Jacques Chirac and King Abdullah had a strong friendship with agreement on a host of issues. Reportedly, the Saudis were concerned by Sarkozy's election last year because of his expressed support of Israel and Jewish background. This visit was to dispel Saudi concerns and to assure the Saudis that Pres Sarkozy could be counted on as strongly as Pres Chirac. Likewise, the French told us they are modifying their Mid East policy. The Levant states have been France's top Mid East focus, while the Arabian Gulf had been at the \"bottom of the list.\" Recognition of Saudi Arabia's emerging influence and status has resulted in the French putting Saudi Arabia \"at the top\" of the French foreign policy Middle East list. GOOD VISIT, BUT NOT GREAT ------------------------- 11. (S/NF) COMMENT. Per the French DCM, they were quite pleased with Pres Sarkozy's visit. They were disappointed they could not issue any joint communiqus on any major issues, such as Iran or the MEPP. Still, they viewed the reciprocal state visits were steps forward in French-Saudi relations. Press coverage of Pres Sarkozy was positive with front page newspaper pictures of both leaders smiling together. 12. (S/NF) However, our Saudi contacts provided some negative comments. Minor in substance, but significant to Saudi sensibilities. Initially, Sarkozy's fiance Carla Bruni was expected to accompany him (but finally did not travel), which the Saudis found offensive given their strict, conservative culture against the company of an unmarried woman. Various protocol faux pas were committed by the French delegation during the visit. The French advance made, in Saudi opinion, unreasonable logistical demands. Finally, Pres Sarkozy was viewed as less than gracious, in Saudi eyes, during certain events, such as avoiding tasting traditional Arab foods and a bored look during the televised arrival sword ceremony. While these are minor points, the fact our Saudi contacts mentioned them shows their discontent. These incidents RIYADH 00000102 003 OF 003 characterized one overarching private comment from the Saudis, that Pres Sarkozy has not replaced Pres Chirac in Saudi eyes. Other usually well-informed Saudi contacts have lamented the overtly commercial nature of the visit. Sarkozy reportedly presented a list of fourteen (14) sales that French firms would like to make to the Saudi government, complete with the original price and discounts that Sarkozy was prepared to negotiate.

Forget the dangers of deepwater drilling in a strait plagued by storms and icebergs, and the difficulties – greater than in the Gulf of Mexico – of capping a leaking well there. There's an even bigger question raised by a British company's discovery of oil off the coast of Greenland. It's the same question that is invoked by the decision the British government is expected to make tomorrow: to allow exploration wells to be drilled in deep waters to the west of Shetland. Why the heck are we prospecting for new oil anyway? It's not a difficult issue to grasp. If we burn just 60% of current global reserves of fossil fuels, we produce two degrees of warming. We cannot afford to use what has already been discovered, let alone to find more. Yet no one in either the current or past governments has been prepared to engage with it. Before the election I confronted the environment spokesmen of the three major parties with this question. Only Ed Miliband seemed fully to grasp the point, but even he brushed it aside. The other two blustered and stumbled, while failing to resolve a fundamental contradiction in their manifestos: they were seeking simultaneously to reduce demand for fossil fuels and increase supply. Before the election, the Conservatives promised to wean us off hydrocarbons – and to extract remaining oil reserves in the North Sea \"to the fullest possible extent\". The Lib Dems made the same two promises, announcing that they would \"secure the maximum long-term benefit to the UK economy of the remaining North Sea reserves\". The new energy secretary, Chris Huhne, has repeated the pledge. The government has promised new tax breaks for oil companies working in UK waters in next year's finance bill. There are three possible ways of defending this contradiction. The first, as Ed Miliband did when I confronted him, is to argue that UK reserves are declining anyway, and if we restrained fossil fuel production here we would merely replace it by raising imports. The same argument could be made everywhere, with the result that no one budges. Only one country – Ecuador – currently intends not to exploit its oil. If the UK government is serious about preventing more than two degrees of warming, and seeks to avoid the charge of hypocrisy, the only consistent position is to stop prospecting and to decide which 40% of existing fossil fuel reserves should be left in the ground. Otherwise we leave other nations to make the hard choices that we intend to duck. The second is to argue, as the current government does, that new reserves will help to bridge the gap between old and new technologies: Lord make me chaste, but not yet. But it doesn't matter how much renewable energy we produce: if we burn more than 60% of current fossil fuel reserves we get more than two degrees of warming. If we burn all of them and still look for more, we'll get four, five or six degrees, regardless of our spending on nuclear power, wind or sunlight. You cannot stop climate breakdown with investment only. There needs to be disinvestment too. Developing new fossil fuel reserves also delays the transition to non-fossil energy, as it keeps the price of hydrocarbons down while ensuring that the value of green investments remains uncertain. The third defence is to insist that the link between fossil fuel burning and global warming can be broken by means of carbon capture and storage (CCS): burying the emissions produced by power stations. In theory, and to some extent, it could. But the chances that large-scale CCS will happen are becoming more remote. A new study by the National Technical University of Athens suggests that the carbon price in Europe between now and 2030 is likely to remain so weak that the subsidies for CCS currently offered by European governments won't be big enough to make it happen. As Chris Huhne observed last week: \"There is no money left.\" Pouring more state funds into a particularly expensive low-carbon technology isn't an option. Even if it were, CCS could do nothing to help reduce emissions from burning oil, almost all of which, in the UK, is used for transport and heating. There is no viable means of capturing carbon dioxide from these sources. We now obtain twice as much energy from oil in this country as we do from coal. So how do we decide which 40% to leave in the ground? The answer is obvious: it should be those reserves whose exploitation is likely to cause the highest environmental and social impacts. That would rule out extraction in both the Arctic and the waters to the west of Shetland. As I write, four Greenpeace campaigners are treading water in the open seas 100 miles off the Shetland islands. They are trying to prevent a drilling ship commissioned by Chevron from reaching its destination. Their case is sound. The West of Shetland Task Force, a federation of oil companies and government officials, classifies the area in which Chevron is trying to drill as an \"extreme/hostile environment\". The company intends to hunt for oil in 1,570 metres of water – roughly the depth at which the Deepwater Horizon was working – in an area of high winds and strong currents. In June Chris Huhne claimed that \"the impacts of the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon give us pause for thought, particularly given the beginning of exploration in deeper UK waters west of Shetland\". The pause lasted a millisecond. Even as he raised these concerns, his department was discussing tax breaks and exemptions with the companies hoping to work there. At a summit in Norway last week the UK government scuppered German proposals for an international review of deepwater drilling. BP is now lined up behind Chevron to prospect a region even harder to exploit safely than the deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico. The government insists (at the time of writing) that it hasn't yet decided whether to grant exploration licences for the seas to the west of Shetland. I suggested to its spokeswoman that Chevron would not be spending its money and risking its reputation by dispatching an exploratory vessel to the drilling grounds unless it had received a pretty strong steer from the government that its application would be approved when it got there. \"You could say that,\" she replied. Since 2006, oil companies have been carving up this region with the government's approval, in discussions to which we have not been party. Preventing runaway climate change means getting out of fossil fuels. It means renouncing two-fifths of existing reserves. It also means a global moratorium on prospecting, not just in deep water, but everywhere. If we can't use it, we should stop looking for it. theguardian.com/georgemonbiot • A fully referenced version of this article can be found on George Monbiot's website monbiot.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2010/apr/07/election-2010-plaid-cymru","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-07T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Election 2010 party guides: Plaid Cymru","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/07/election-2010-plaid-cymru","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/apr/07/election-2010-plaid-cymru","fields":{"headline":"Election 2010 party guides: Plaid Cymru","bodyText":"The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday 22 April 2010 We said below that Plaid Cymru's achilles heel was that it veers \"very close to hate of the English\".

Launching the Conservative party's green energy policy, Cameron said: \"An element of the government's approach was quite irresponsible because the problems of nuclear waste haven't been dealt with. They have got to be dealt with in order to make any new investment possible.\" Cameron did not, however, rule out nuclear power being part of the energy mix in his party's vision for decentralised \"micro-energy\". \"I do not take a view of which energy sources should be used. I simply want to see them operate on a level playing field,\" he said. An interim energy review by the party published last year suggested the Conservatives would only view a fresh generation of nuclear power stations as \"a last resort\". But Cameron said his view now was that nuclear power should not be \"subsidised\" by the taxpayer nor receive \"special favours\". Cameron was speaking at a solar-powered warehouse in north London run by campaign group, Greenpeace. He said he wanted Britain to adopt micro-generation in which homes and businesses produce energy for their own use, using combined heat and power, wind or solar photovoltaic power. He said a new system of \"feed-in tarrifs\" by which people were paid for the energy they produced would decentralise the power supply, incentivise energy saving and help to create a mass market in micro-energy. He envisaged supermarkets, schools, hospitals and community groups all becoming generators and suppliers and said it could offer public institutions a new revenue stream. Cameron described this government's approach to energy as \"grant-driven, finger pointing from Whitehall\" with government and business deciding what should be built and where. He claimed that failed to change the way the market worked. \"This process has been heavily reliant on fossil fuels and too much energy is wasted in heat loss and distributing the power to the end-consumer,\" he added. Cameron said he wanted to shift the focus on debate about climate change in Britain away from people having to pay more tax or making some form of personal sacrifice to an emphasis on research, innovation, new markets and entrepreneurial solutions. \"I want the Conservative party to champion a positive response to climate change that creates economic and business opportunities for our country,\" he said.

Barry Gardiner, Labour MP for Brent North, and Rachel Reeves, Labour MP for Leeds West, wrote to John Lyon, the parliamentary commissioner, on 3 August to ask him to investigate Clegg's conduct, less than a hundred days into his new role as deputy prime minister. The MPs told Lyon: \"We believe that the right honourable member for Sheffield Hallam has misled the house. We believe that he did this knowingly. We consider that he has failed to take any opportunity to correct the record or to apologise to the house and that a serious contempt over an issue of considerable political importance has therefore been committed.\" A spokesman for Clegg dismissed the complaint as \"spurious\". Clegg told the Commons on 22 June that the owners of the company had sought a government loan, which would have paid for a 15,000-tonne press to make parts for nuclear power stations, because directors felt that the terms they were receiving from banks were not good enough and because \"they did not want to dilute their own shared holdings in the company.\" He continued: \"Do I think it is the role of government to help out owners of companies who do not want to dilute their shareholdings? No, I do not.\" It later emerged in a letter from Clegg to Graham Honeyman, the chief executive of Sheffield Forgemasters, which was made public and dated 2 July, that the deputy prime minister accepted that the company chief had told him he was willing to dilute his share. In this letter, Clegg wrote: \"[You] made clear to me your own willingness to dilute your equity share,\" according to the Financial Times. The Labour MPs claim in their letter to Lyon that Clegg tried to cover up his error, citing as evidence an earlier draft of the letter that same day, which was drawn up following a meeting with Forgemasters. The first draft said to Honeyman: \"You explained the nature of your own stake in the company, and the reasons why the sale of any equity dilution to raise private finance for the press was such as to make it unfeasible.\" The Labour MPs said to Lyon: \"It appears he [Clegg] specifically tried to cover this up by putting in an inaccurate record of his conversation with Mr Honeyman. Had this letter not been challenged by the company it would have provided the deputy prime minister with convenient corroboration he could have relied upon in future.\" They went on to argue that by not volunteering the first letter of 2 July, Clegg had \"failed the tests of openness and accountability\" outlined in MPs' code of conduct.\" Clegg told MPs in the house on 21 July that the decision to cancel the £80m loan was \"simply one of affordability\", after Jack Straw, the shadow deputy prime minister, challenged him to \"correct the record on something that was plainly wrong\". Gardiner told the Guardian that he believed Clegg had committed a \"very serious contempt of parliament\". He said: \"I believe that Clegg has not simply misled the house. He has tried to cover up the fact that he misled the house. He has been challenged on this on a number of occasions and on each occasion he has immediately sought to change the subject rather than tried to answer the direct question put to him. He knows he is vulnerable on this and I think it is only right that the committee on standards and privileges should investigate.\" A spokesman for Clegg pointed out that the only letter intended for publication was the second version. The first letter of 2 July was only a draft, amended after a discussion with Honeyman to ensure its contents were accurate, he explained. He pointed to a written statement issued on 27 July by Vincent Cable, the business secretary, who said that, while equity dilution had \"no bearing\" on the decision not to proceed with the loan, he wanted to clarify the queries surrounding Clegg's comments. Cable quoted an interview Honeyman gave to the Yorkshire Post on 17 June in which he said that, while he was prepared to dilute his shareholding in the company to facilitate the project, he expressed doubt about other methods of funding. \"Private equity would take the whole of the shareholding away from Forgemasters and put it in the hands of somebody else,\" said Honeyman. \"That's not just my shares [49%] or the other directors'; 65% of the shop floor own the shares in the company. The amount of money to put in to fund the press would more or less have to absorb the whole of the shareholding.\" A spokesman for Clegg said of the allegations outlined in the complaint: \"It is just another example of Labour MPs playing politics with the interest of Sheffield Forgemasters instead of facing up to the fact that it was the financial irresponsibility of the previous Labour government which made the loan unaffordable.\" On the letter, he said: \"The parliamentary commissioner has to deal with any complaint that goes to him, but it is entirely spurious to suggest that anybody was misled by that letter.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/mar/22/nuclearpower.energy1","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-03-22T00:53:22Z","webTitle":"Britain and France to take nuclear power to the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/mar/22/nuclearpower.energy1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/mar/22/nuclearpower.energy1","fields":{"headline":"Britain and France to take nuclear power to the world","bodyText":"Britain and France are to sign a deal to construct a new generation of nuclear power stations and export the technology around the world in an effort to combat climate change. The pact is to be announced at the \"Arsenal summit\" next week when prime ministers Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy will meet at the Emirates stadium in north London. Britain hopes to take advantage of French expertise to build the power stations that do not rely on fossil fuels. Nearly 79% of France's electricity comes from its highly-developed nuclear power industry. The UK's ageing nuclear plants are ready for decommissioning and supply 20% of its energy needs. Brown hopes the partnership will create a skilled British labour force who would then work in partnership with France to sell nuclear power stations to other countries over the next 15 years. Britain this week started the process of licensing four generic reactor designs, including the French-designed Areva run by EDF (Électricté de France). The Anglo-French plan will be controversial among those who believe that nuclear power is too dangerous and dirty, and that governments should place more emphasis on renewable sources of power as part of an international effort to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2050. There is a growing view within the energy industry that nuclear power could be the next lucrative market. British Energy, the country's biggest reactor operator, has become the target of a potential £7bn takover bid as the UK tries to guarantee a secure future energy supply without relying on gas imports from Russia as North Sea oil and gas supplies dwindle. The nuclear deal is one of several Anglo-French initiatives the two are expected to announce when they meet on Thursday. They will also unveil a new drive against illegal immigration, with a range of measures to tighten border controls at the Channel ports and take joint action to remove failed asylum seekers. The immigration package will include: · Joint charter flights which would start in Britain, make a stop-over in France and take migrants back to countries including Iran, Afghanistan and Iraq. The French believe they can learn from the British on how to implement forced and voluntary removals, including of foreign prisoners · An increase in the number of lorry checks at French and British ports. Ministers believe more staff could double the number of lorries searched, from 1 million last year. It is claimed 18,000 illegal immigrants were stopped in trucks in 2007 · An increase in the number of French undercover officers targeting gangs smuggling people into Britain · Confirmation there would be no Sangatte II reception centre in Calais to attract asylum seekers and migrants. Sarkozy will use his two-day visit to Britain to push for a plan to sign a Europe-wide pact on immigration during France's presidency of the EU in the second half of the year. The pact would require European countries not to grant rights of residency to large numbers of illegal immigrants, and sign up to an EU policy of returning illegal immigrants either by offering incentives to leave voluntarily or by use of forced repatriation. The summit is also likely to see further steps on defence cooperation. Sarkozy is expected to tell Brown privately the details of a French deployment of special forces to the frontlines in Afghanistan, and in return seek British backing for an expanded European role in Nato."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/jun/11/confidence-climate-science-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-11T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"Confidence in climate science remains strong, poll shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/11/confidence-climate-science-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/jun/11/confidence-climate-science-poll","fields":{"headline":"Confidence in climate science remains strong, poll shows","bodyText":"Climate science's winter of discontent has not made a large impact on the British public's attitudes to global warming, according to poll of over 1,800 people. The poll, by researchers at the University of Cardiff, showed a small drop in public acceptance of climate change but not the major falls that some observers had predicted after a series of media controversies over the actions of climate scientists, combined with the failure of the Copenhagen summit and the record-breaking cold temperatures. \"By no means has there been a collapse in confidence in climate science,\" said Professor Nick Pidgeon, who led the study. \"If I was in policy circles I would not be complacent, but reassured that it has not been as serious as many thought it would be.\" The survey showed that almost three-quarters (71%) of Britons are concerned about climate change. Some 78% think the climate is changing, which is down from 91% who said it was in a similar poll in 2005. Pidgeon said there were a number of possible explanations for the decline, including the economic crisis. \"There is a theory that there is a finite pool of worry that anyone has.\" The poll, carried out with Ipsos Mori, surveyed 1,822 people across England, Scotland and Wales. It took place from January to March this year, following the high-profile release of emails from climate scientists at the University of East Anglia, which critics claimed showed collusion and conspiracy among researchers, and the discovery of a mistake in the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Green campaigners said the controversy of the UEA emails had set back efforts to tackle global warming by 20 years, while media commentators blamed it as the issue fell down the political agenda post-Copenhagen. Pidgeon said it was difficult to examine the reasons for people's attitudes in quantitative surveys such as this. But he said unpublished work from a series of parallel focus groups with people in Bristol showed that many thought the media had exaggerated the seriousness of the email scandal. The most likely effect of the release of the emails would have been to reinforce people's existing attitudes to the issue, he said. The poll showed that most people (71%) remain fairly or very concerned about climate change, compared to 82% in 2005. Some 40% said that the seriousness of climate change is exaggerated, while 42% disagreed. Just 20% thought there was serious disagreement among scientists about whether climate change is caused by humans, despite efforts by climate sceptics to undermine the consensus that greenhouse gas emissions drive global warming. Some 70% of people said it was their responsibility to act on climate change, while 63% thought they could change their behaviour to help. More than two-thirds (68%) said they would vote in favour of spending taxpayers money on British projects to tackle climate change. The poll also examined people's attitudes to nuclear power and found it had become slightly more acceptable to the public, in particular as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But there was still \"no ringing endorsement\" for expanding nuclear, Pidgeon said. The results come as a similar survey in the US shows that public concern about global warming is on the rise. The research, from experts at Yale and George Mason universities, showed that belief among the US public that global warming is happening has risen 4% since January, to 61%. Those who accept it is caused by human activity rose 3% to 50%. And the number of US citizens who said that the issue is personally important to them rose 5%, to 63%. \"The stabilisation and slight rebound in public opinion is occurring amid signs the economy is starting to recover, along with consumer confidence, and as memories of unusual snowstorms and scientific scandals recede,\" said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. \"The BP oil disaster is also reminding the public of the dark side of dependence on fossil fuels, which may be increasing support for clean energy policies.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/sep/26/north-korea-new-leader-kim","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-26T21:00:49Z","webTitle":"North Korea waits to hear that Kim Jong-il's youngest son will take over","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/26/north-korea-new-leader-kim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/sep/26/north-korea-new-leader-kim","fields":{"headline":"North Korea waits to hear that Kim Jong-il's youngest son will take over","bodyText":"The fruit crop is expected to be excellent. The apples are plump and the grape clusters heavy. Farmers smile as they toil in the fields, and people wave flags on their way to work. Tractors are bringing in another good harvest. The footage unfolding across North Korean television screens offers images of the good life, apparently unaltered for years. But change is coming to this isolated and bizarre dictatorship, as the world's first communist dynasty prepares to transfer power to its third generation. Like everything in this country, the move is shrouded in mystery. But the people are already being groomed for a phased transition, supporting the widespread belief that the leader, Kim Jong-il, will use Tuesday's Workers' party assembly to signal he has chosen his youngest son to succeed him. One Pyongyang student says there is already a song dedicated to the heir apparent. \"We were told at university that Kim Jong-un is very intelligent, that he has a military background, and that he is very young,\" added the young woman, who asked to remain anonymous. Many others seem to know his name, even though there is a reluctance to discuss the matter – at least with foreigners. His father's gradual rise was equally well-veiled for many years, sealed only at the party's 1980 gathering: its last until this year. This meeting could last anywhere between three days and almost three weeks, to judge from previous events. Seoul-based Yonhap news agency has also reported that the North may be preparing a record military parade, citing South Korean government sources. As many as 10,000 soldiers may march alongside missiles and armoured vehicles to mark the party's assembly or its 65th anniversary next month. Kim Jong-un's rise is unlike that of his 68-year-old father's in one crucial regard: time is not on his side. The elder Kim had years of experience dealing with the party and the powerful military before his father's death in 1994. Yet he appears to have neglected his own succession plans until reportedly suffering a stroke two years ago. His apparent frailty is, of course, a strictly taboo topic in Pyongyang. \"Our leader is in good shape and is energetic,\" said a guide. The family's personality cult is apparent everywhere. The viewing conditions at the mausoleum of the country's founder, Kim Il-sung, are so strict that shoes are cleaned with mechanised brushes and blowers remove dust from visitors' clothes before they can step into the room to view his embalmed body. Everybody over 13 wears a Kim Il-sung lapel pin and secondary school pupils spend a sixth of their lessons studying the thoughts of their leaders. They are taught to believe that their country stands out among nations, and that life is better there than anywhere else. \"We envy nothing in the world,\" children sing in a propaganda film. Yet the country is an international pariah that spends vast sums on its military, even though the people have suffered from hunger and poverty. Despite the sunshine and blue skies of a warm autumn, the crowds in Pyongyang are drab and mostly unsmiling, and the place retains a chilly Soviet ambience. While city dwellers appear largely healthy, it is hard to tell the age of the country children visiting the mausoleum: their faces look too old for such short bodies. Later we visit a rural area on the outskirts of the capital, where officials extol their progress in mechanised agriculture. But the farmers are working with their hands and the only tractors we see in North Korea are on television. Until the 1970s, North Korea was a fast-developing industrial economy; the envy of the region. It was easier to proclaim its progress. Now, for all its careful efforts, the signs of external prosperity are creeping in. Our guides have mobile phones, though their use remains extremely restricted. One, a young woman, wears a white T-shirt with Gucci picked out in diamanté letters across its left sleeve. She looks blank when asked what it means. Experts say the country has become more porous, with residents in border areas using smuggled handsets to make calls via Chinese mobile phone networks. They question whether an inexperienced leader can hold together the elite's different interest groups, shore up the economy and satisfy a population becoming more aware of the outside world. But North Korea permits no doubt about its future. \"North Korea is much stronger now than it was in the 1950s. We are economically and militarily much more powerful,\" states a tourist guide at one patriotic monument. An expert at the war museum is also very confident. \"Since our country has become a nuclear power, we no longer need help from other countries. We can now defend ourselves against the American imperialists.\" North Korea's defences include a Stalinist espionage apparatus that monitors both its own people and visitors. On entry, mobile phones are confiscated for the duration of the trip and officials leaf through a passenger's copy of the Economist to see if it contains anything sensitive. In Pyongyang, only the elite have access to the internet. To send an email from the hotel you must complete an application form. \"I do not believe that the internet will gain widespread use in North Korea,\" said one official. \"The reason for this is American and South Korean imperialism.\" Photography from inside a car is not allowed. People must not be photographed. Soldiers must not be photographed. There are three officials keeping an eye on seven tourists and foreigners are not allowed to leave the hotel unescorted. A British and an Irish visitor taking a morning stroll are quickly stopped by a crowd when they take pictures of street vendors selling vegetables and underwear. The men are driven back to their hotel by security officials. The North Koreans consider this a serious incident. A report is written, the memory cards of the cameras confiscated and the pictures deleted from their computers. The men are also required to write a humble letter of apology. \"This is a serious setback to the positive development of relations between Britain and North Korea,\" the director of the travel agency said. The middle-aged North Korean man responsible for the group starts to cry.

Unthinkable!","bodyText":"One of my presents for the Christmas of 1956 was a fat little book called All About Ships and Shipping, edited by EP Harnack and very nicely got up by Faber &amp; Faber with semaphore flags and rolling waves impressed on its blue cloth binding. Its prettiness helps explain its survival in boxes and cupboards for more than half a century, its original tuition (example: how to tell a barque from a brigantine) long forgotten. This week I took it out to look at the Royal Navy's fleet list in that long-ago era. Classes were lined up below their different silhouettes: cruisers, minelayers, destroyers, frigates, monitors, minesweepers, torpedo boats. There was still one battleship in service, the Vanguard, a turreted shape I can just remember seeing through a North Sea mist, but the biggest surprise was the number of aircraft carriers: Ark Royal, Eagle, Indomitable, Illustrious, Implacable, Indefatigable, Formidable … their bulldog names went on over two pages. There were 22 in all, and even if only half of them were actually sailing the high seas, the rest would have been mothballed with engines and guns greased and ready for war. Very soon, when the Ark Royal and its Harrier jets are scrapped, the Navy will be left for the next 10 years without a ship capable of flying aircraft, until the first of the two carriers now under construction is commissioned. The entire surface fleet will amount to no more than 19 warships; my little book tells me that one class of destroyers alone, the C class (Cavalier, Cossack, Crispin), had more. My point isn't to contest the wisdom of shrinking the fleet – I'm not a military strategist – but to suggest how much can change in a lifetime and not be registered as change until an incredible event occurs (incredible, that is, to people of a certain age, background and disposition). It comes as a kind of assault on the memory. A fleet without an aircraft carrier! My short-trousered, ship-watching self would have boggled at the impossibility. But all the while since the navy has been losing dockyards, ships and crew – like a long, lulling sentence punctuated with commas and waking up finally with an exclamation mark. But the end of the Ark Royal is the least of it. Britain is about to become a different country. Everybody agrees about this, with varying degrees of exultation or foreboding depending on their reading of government policy: a pulling back from the brink or a tip forward into the abyss, a leaner, fitter and more dynamic country or a smaller, meaner, more divided one. This kind of political rupture to the drift of national life is rare in peacetime history. It happened under the governments formed in 1945 and 1979, but the other big postwar date (1956, the year of Suez and my nautical Christmas gift) affected Britain's idea of itself more than the texture of ordinary lives. Never again could the state pretend to imperial power, but the people who lived in it trickled around this fissure like ants, and grew slowly but steadily richer. Next month the British Film Institute launches a retrospective of documentaries that were made during that 30-year era known as the postwar settlement. Boom Britain, the season's overall title, strikes a deliberately historic note that wouldn't have worked four or five years ago, when it could just as easily have labelled a season by current filmmakers rather than those working between 1951 and 1977. But the title turns out to be not entirely accurate: some films shine with the classic boom qualities of confidence and optimism, but others don't. They reflect concerns that are still current – the environment, women's rights, mental illness, lonely old age, abused children – and that perhaps offers the first lesson about any study of the past: that its division into tight little periods, each different to the next, can never be more than a crude and sometimes misleading generalisation. This thought, in fact, inspired the BFI's retrospective. According to Patrick Russell, its curator, the project is an act of revisionism designed to correct and enlarge the conventional history of the British documentary movement. Roughly, this story goes as follows. In the beginning was a 1929 film about herring drifters directed by John Grierson, who coined the noun \"documentary\" to describe films that dealt in \"the creative treatment of actuality\". Under Grierson's influence, several young filmmakers emerged in the 1930s who were passionately committed to social change. The brilliant wartime propaganda of Humphrey Jennings made him the most famous of them. And then after 1945 came a \"black hole\", in Russell's words; Lindsay Anderson and his \"Free Cinema\" school made a few memorable films in the late 1950s, but by then television has staked ownership to the documentary technique. The phrase \"British cinema documentary\" came to mean a black and white collage of steam locomotives, slag heaps, women in grubby kitchens and men in flat caps, searchlights and bomb damage. Certainly, that's what it meant to me. Of course, I should have known better. Anyone who grew up in the 1950s and 60s usually sat through a short, British-made non-fiction film at the cinema. We watched them impatiently – why were we learning about artificial fibre production when we'd paid to see Kirk Douglas? Later, we also watched them dubiously – what were the funders of these films, Shell or BP or the National Coal Board, trying in some insidious way to sell us? As it turns out, nothing very terrible. The BFI has made a four-DVD set (titled Shadows of Progress and soon to be released) and most films on it wear their sponsorship lightly; sometimes, as with a BP film on the world's finite resources, they're even antagonistic to its interests. There is just as much lyricism and sympathy to be found in them as in the prewar school, and their directors, photographers and scriptwriters deserve to be rescued from the charge that their backing by government agencies or big business necessarily compromised their art. Sometimes, of course, it may have done. One of my favourites is Britain Today, made in 1964 for the Foreign Office to show abroad. James Cameron, whose last work as a great liberal journalist was a weekly column in the Guardian, wrote and narrated the script. The film marches us around the United Kingdom and, goodness, what a promising place it looks. One wishes one lived there. New car plants, schools and universities, new nuclear power stations, Trident jets and blue Pullman trains. \"Nothing can stand still,\" says Cameron as wrecking balls tear down Glasgow tenements. \"The useless old must go.\" There are some unexpected moments. The crowd singing Jerusalem at the Proms is remarkably decorous, standing still as they sing and waving no flags, but these scenes follow a sequence of young people jiving: \"Britain is very old – and very young.\" This is the film's trope. Britain is a country \"sustained by its past … confident of overcoming the challenges in the long years to come\". A different and unrelated Cameron could have spoken the same script yesterday. The facts may be different, count them as you will in naval fleets, public debt or balances of trade. But the rhetoric used to address Britain's problematic future never changes – it takes us forward or backwards to the new age."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2010/apr/15/green-party-radical-policy-parliament","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-15T15:37:15Z","webTitle":"Green party's radical policies would be a boon to the new parliament | John Vidal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/15/green-party-radical-policy-parliament","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/apr/15/green-party-radical-policy-parliament","fields":{"headline":"Green party's radical policies would be a boon to the new parliament","bodyText":"Here's the scenario: it's May 9, with a hung parliament and Labour has the Lib Dems aboard but it still needs an extra one or two seats to form a government. They can't possibly come from UKIP and most of the independents are unacceptable, but what about Caroline Lucas, the first elected Green MP in the Commons? She's a crowd-puller, and Labour is kind of green, isn't it? A red-green alliance sounds good. But then the party wonks sit down and actually read the Green party manifesto (pdf). What's this?, you hear them splutter. No nuclear power? Scrap Trident? No more airport expansions, no more coal power stations. A speed limit of 55mph on the motorway, twice as much recycling, national and personal carbon budgets, organic agriculture, one million solar roofs, nationalise the railways? Petrol double the price? Eighty seven per cent of Britain \"better off\". No more free market economics? Emissions to be cut 90% in 20 years? You can hear the screams already. But only 10 years ago, if the Labour party had promised the country 15% of all power from renewables by 2015, and an 80% cut in emissions by 2050, New Labour would have blanched. Yet it promises both in its manifesto. The point is that global events can change ideas quickly and the Green party has always been a crucible of political free thinking, where radical social, economic and environmental choices can be debated and tested. Mostly the party has watched them get picked up by mainstream parties. This election, the Greens have one of the most radical internationalist agendas ever offered to a British public. Rather than accept a false choice between the economy or the environment, the party recognises the world is in a dangerous place because of climate change, war and the possible end of oil, and in response strives for a more equal, collective society. It proposes one or two big ideas that are genuinely revolutionary and which, if ever taken up, would lead to the the biggest redistribution of wealth and reappraisal of the environment in 50 years. Take the idea of personal and national tradeable carbon quotas, which David Miliband toyed with when he was environment secretary. He was politically excited, seeing clearly that climate change change required politicians to rethink how they approached questions of production and distribution. But he also saw that if you effectively made carbon a parallel world currency, and you set annual decreasing caps on emissions, the rich — who consume the most — would have to buy their carbon quotas from the poor who consume less and therefore emit less. The net result would not just be far fewer emissions, but a fairer society. No one expects the Greens to get more than 4%-7% of the vote this time, but no one underestimates their role as a party of ideas with a growing influence at the grassroots. This year, they have 330 candidates, their highest ever number, and a genuine chance of picking up two seats in parliament. The policy wonks in other parties should start taking them seriously."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/georgemonbiot/2010/apr/22/climate-debate-miliband-clark-hughes","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-22T12:16:54Z","webTitle":"Guardian's climate debate shows green politics has grown up | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2010/apr/22/climate-debate-miliband-clark-hughes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2010/apr/22/climate-debate-miliband-clark-hughes","fields":{"headline":"Guardian's climate debate shows green politics has grown up","bodyText":"Here's something I didn't expect to write: I found all three of the politicians at last night's green hustings quite impressive. I was struck by the maturity of their debate, in two senses. They tried to answer the questions they were given, rarely sought to fob us off and mostly refrained from cheap point-scoring. And they all had the kind of detailed knowledge of green issues that just a few years ago would have been perceived as superfluous to a political career. The bumbling amateurs of yesteryear have been replaced by serious-minded geeks. Greg Clark, the Conservative candidate, did better than I expected, but he still trailed behind the other two. His closing statement was particularly unpersuasive: having engaged with specific policy issues during the rest of the discussion, he reverted to sweeping, paternalistic assurances. But throughout the debate I was reminded of how much worse it could have been. Clark was repeatedly forced to defend himself against charges that the shadow cabinet and the party membership are stuffed with climate change deniers. That the Tory leadership has so far held the line against the party's own Neanderthals is a minor miracle, not least because the UK Independence Party is offering them a world where climate change is a fantasy and the lemonade springs where the bluebird sings in the Big Rock Candy Mountains. For how much longer will this last? At what point will the party abandon the science to appease its members? For now, at least, the three big parties are seeking to outgreen each other. Any one of them could have been fronting a Friends of the Earth campaign from a few years ago. The issues that were once marginal or excluded have gone mainstream. They attacked each other for not doing enough to restrain airport expansion: not long ago they would have attacked each other for not doing enough to promote it. They all defended climate science and made unequivocal statements about the overriding importance of dealing with climate change. They clashed not over the problem but over which solutions should be deployed: nuclear power sharply divided Simon Hughes (the Lib Dem candidate) from his opponents; Ed Miliband and Greg Clark tussled over whether windfarms should be approved locally or by central government, but not over whether they are a good thing; they argued over who was being most generous in allocating adaptation funds to poorer countries and about which of them was most committed to the 10:10 campaign. It's a shame that Caroline Lucas, leader of Greens, couldn't make it: she might have made life harder for the others. The real differences in style and competence became clear to me after the debate, when I put the three candidates on the spot about my own obsession: their determination to maximise the production of fossil fuels, even as they seek to minimise consumption. Ed Miliband was clever, well-briefed and deft at fending me off, though rather annoying, not least because he kept clamping his hand on my shoulder (perhaps he was attempting a citizen's arrest). Simon Hughes was affable and engaging, but couldn't quite dispose of the issue. Greg Clark floundered around hopelessly and seemed unable to answer my questions. But I came away feeling more cheerful than I was when I arrived. Green politics has grown up; the debate has changed beyond recognition.

Not just you: your book, your chair, the room around you, your home. In fact, everything is moving at the speed of light. Don't feel it? Don't worry, no one else did either until Albert Einstein redefined the substance of reality at the start of the 20th century. Neither Galileo, Michael Faraday, James Clerk Maxwell or Isaac Newton knew about the speed of light thing, despite laying the foundations for the insights that the Austrian patent-clerk-turned-physicist would eventually have. Let me clarify. We are all moving at a speed \"c\" that happens to correspond with the speed of light as it moves through a vacuum in normal space. Except that our movement is through a 4D co-ordinate system called spacetime. Unlike 3D space, which allows you to measure the position of an object, spacetime allows you to measure events (where and when). Even if you are sitting still in 3D space (not moving in any direction), you will nevertheless be moving in 4D spacetime (in other words, no movement in the three space dimensions but moving in the \"time\" direction). Spacetime is a key component in the step-by-step journey that physicists Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw take in getting to the bottom of the most famous equation in science, Einstein's E=mc2, which says that mass and energy are the same thing, and you can convert from one to the other using a constant, \"c2\", a number whose value is equal to the square of the speed of light. Knowing that mass and energy are equivalent has given us, for better or worse, the mushroom cloud and nuclear power stations, but none of these applications were on Einstein's mind as he explored the fabric of space and time. His formulation of what became known as special relativity tore apart the classical view of the clockwork universe that Newton and his colleagues had developed in the 18th and 19th centuries. Einstein started with a conundrum, the niggling problem that the ideas of Galileo and Maxwell seemed to be at odds. Galileo had shown how there was no such thing as absolute motion, that you can only define movement relative to something else. You might feel like you are sitting still right now but that is only true relative to the Earth; relative to the black hole at the centre of our galaxy, we are all moving at hundreds of thousands of miles an hour. By the end of the 19th century, Maxwell had tied together decades of work on electricity and magnetism by, among others, Humphrey Davy and Michael Faraday, to produce his masterful equations on electromagnetism. These showed that light was a wave in the electromagnetic field, much as ripples on a pond are waves in water or sound is a wave in the air. He also showed that these waves of light moved at a constant speed, \"c\", through empty space and that speed remained the same no matter who was watching. Whether you are sitting still or moving at hundreds of miles an hour towards the source of the light, Maxwell's equations say that the light you see will only ever move at \"c\" relative to you. Einstein was curious about why Galileo's ideas of relative motion seemed to break down in Maxwell's equations. He incessantly picked at this hanging thread and, in the process, unravelled the whole tapestry the physicists of the enlightenment had put together. With special relativity, he showed that Maxwell's number, \"c\", was a constant of nature, the fastest speed at which anything could go and, coincidentally, the speed of light too. In Einstein's view of the universe, \"c\" was the only thing that stayed the same in all reference frames and, to accommodate that, he showed how time and space themselves were stretchy concepts. No longer was there a fixed backdrop upon which the universe did its work: the familiar ideas of position in space, time and speed were all malleable depending on who is watching what and how fast they are moving relative to each other. Cox and Forshaw use this background to rattle through concepts that sound more science-fiction than everyday: how time slows down and length contracts the closer you move to the speed of light or why one twin can age more slowly than the other if he goes on a super-fast round trip. You need the idea of spacetime to explain why, even as you seem to sit still in space, you are still moving at \"c\" in the time dimension. Think of your normal movements in everyday 3D space and everyday time as the shadow of a more universal movement in 4D spacetime. To make the equations of special relativity work, you need to measure your motion in spacetime, rather than everyday space and time. Einstein came up with his seemingly baffling ideas as a series of thought experiments, and the fact that they were later proved by experiment is thanks to his skills as a mathematician. Another popular science book might have spared readers the gory details of what Einstein was up to, given that his ideas and results were in themselves so engrossing. But Cox and Forshaw do as much as they can to undermine the old publishing canard that equations in books don't sell. Most of the steps they take to reaching Einstein's famous equation are accompanied by some mathematics. It's not easy going in parts but then, if you really want to know what Einstein was up to and really want to know why what he did changed physics, you can't expect it to be easy. Metaphors and lay explanations will only get you so far with special relativity, you have to see the maths to really understand what's going on. If anything, the authors are too apologetic about the maths they include, constantly assuring readers that there is a purpose to the strings of symbols, that there is a key insight at the end of the abstractions. For anyone afraid of technicalities, Cox and Forshaw lead the reader by the hand through the complexity, adding in rest stops of wit and real-world examples. Even the hardest bits feel like being taken on an army assault course by the two friendliest drill sergeants in the world. You may have to read some bits twice but, boy, will you feel better for it once the insights become clear. In the process of exposing the science, the authors do a good job of showing how the hard end of research works: abandon all assumptions and re-build everything from scratch. It's frustrating, it's terrifying and it's slow. Sometimes it is hugely confusing and counter-intuitive. But patience and persistence in the face of dearly held beliefs is exactly why scientists have made such a remarkable fist of understanding (and shaping) our modern world. It's well worth your while to gulp down any fears of maths and glimpse some of that remarkable achievement in action."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2010/jul/28/david-cameron-india-pakistan-terror","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-28T20:51:00Z","webTitle":"Cameron sparks diplomatic row with Pakistan after 'export of terror' remarks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jul/28/david-cameron-india-pakistan-terror","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/jul/28/david-cameron-india-pakistan-terror","fields":{"headline":"Cameron sparks diplomatic row with Pakistan after 'export of terror' remarks","bodyText":"A furious diplomatic row erupted between London and Islamabad tonight after David Cameron accused elements of the Pakistani state of promoting the export of terrorism. Speaking on his visit to neighbouring India, the prime minister launched the strongest British criticism yet of Pakistan, warning that the country could no longer \"look both ways\" by tolerating terrorism while demanding respect as a democracy. Angry responses followed from Pakistani officials in the UK and the foreign ministry in Islamabad. The row comes as Pakistan's president, Asif Ali Zardari, prepares to visit Britain next week. He is due to stay at the prime minister's country retreat of Chequers. Writing for the Guardian's Comment is free site, Pakistan's high commissioner to Britain accused Cameron of damaging the prospects for regional peace and criticised him for believing allegations in the secret military logs of the Afghanistan conflict published earlier this week. The leaked documents suggest that the ISI, one of Pakistan's two military intelligence agencies, was encouraging the Taliban as recently as last year. Wajid Shamsul Hasan, Pakistan's high commissioner, wrote: \"One would have wished that the prime minister would have considered Pakistan's enormous role in the war on terror and the sacrifices it has rendered since 9/11. \"There seems to be more reliance on information based on intelligence leaks which lack credibility of proof. A bilateral visit aimed at earning business could have been done without damaging the prospects of regional peace.\" The prime minister initiated the row this morning in a speech to Indian business leaders in Bangalore, when he spoke of his horror at the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai for which Delhi directly blamed the Pakistani authorities. Cameron came close to endorsing that view when he said: \"We cannot tolerate in any sense the idea that this country is allowed to look both ways and is able to promote the export of terror, whether to India or Afghanistan or anywhere else in the world. \"That is why this relationship is important. But it should be a relationship based on a very clear message: that it is not right to have any relationship with groups that are promoting terror. Democratic states that want to be part of the developed world cannot do that. The message to Pakistan from the US and from the UK is very clear on that point.\" Pakistan took the rare step of issuing an official rebuttal. Abdul Basit, a spokesman for the Pakistani foreign ministry, told Radio 4's World at One: \"There is no question of Pakistan looking the other way. I think the prime minister was referring to these reports, which are unverifiable and outdated. If we start drawing inferences from these self-serving reports, then obviously we are distracting ourselves.\" Pakistani senator Khurshid Ahmad, vice-president of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party, said: \"I am deeply concerned. The basis on which this statement has been made is very fragile. The documents released are unreliable: 90% of them have been attributed to Afghan intelligence agencies, whose reports are totally unreliable and fabricated. On the basis of such a report, it is not acceptable to make the statement that has been made.\" Britain has spoken in the past of the terror threat from Pakistan, though ministers have restricted themselves to criticising Pakistan for tolerating terror groups. But the prime minister's language came close to endorsing the Indian view that authorities in Pakistan have a hand in the terror. Cameron named several terror groups which are, according to India, sponsored by Pakistan. \"We – like you – are determined that groups like the Taliban, the Haqqani network or Lakshar-e-Taiba should not be allowed to launch attacks on Indian and British citizens in India or in Britain.\" Downing Street insisted the prime minister was not accusing Pakistan's government of sponsoring terrorism. But a few minutes after his speech, Cameron made clear that official agencies in Pakistan were responsible for harbouring terrorists. Asked on the Today programme whether Pakistan exports terrorism, Cameron said: \"I choose my words very carefully. It is unacceptable for anything to happen within Pakistan that is about supporting terrorism elsewhere. It is well-documented that that has been the case in the past, and we have to make sure that the Pakistan authorities are not looking two ways. They must only look one way, and that is to a democratic and stable Pakistan.\" The prime minister's words on Pakistan overshadowed the first day of a visit to India designed to herald a new special relationship. Downing Street says the trip is meant to show that Britain can treat India as a normal trading partner, with the security issues surrounding Delhi's troubled relations with Pakistan dealt with on a separate tack. But the main business announcement – a relaxation of licence rules to allow the export of civil nuclear technology and expertise to India – had the potential to upset its nuclear neighbour. Pakistan and India have refused to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, prompting the last Labour government to refuse to co-operate with India on civil nuclear power. Ministers had feared there would be leakage to its military nuclear programme. The US sanctioned the use of civil nuclear technology to India in 2008. Britain believes today's agreement is compatible with the NPT, which bans the sale of nuclear technology to nuclear powers that have not signed it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/aug/30/bjorn-lomborg-climate-change-u-turn","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-30T19:17:15Z","webTitle":"Bjørn Lomborg: $100bn a year needed to fight climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/aug/30/bjorn-lomborg-climate-change-u-turn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/aug/30/bjorn-lomborg-climate-change-u-turn","fields":{"headline":"Bjørn Lomborg: $100bn a year needed to fight climate change","bodyText":"The world's most high-profile climate change sceptic is to declare that global warming is \"undoubtedly one of the chief concerns facing the world today\" and \"a challenge humanity must confront\", in an apparent U-turn that will give a huge boost to the embattled environmental lobby. Bjørn Lomborg, the self-styled \"sceptical environmentalist\" once compared to Adolf Hitler by the UN's climate chief, is famous for attacking climate scientists, campaigners, the media and others for exaggerating the rate of global warming and its effects on humans, and the costly waste of policies to stop the problem. But in a new book to be published next month, Lomborg will call for tens of billions of dollars a year to be invested in tackling climate change. \"Investing $100bn annually would mean that we could essentially resolve the climate change problem by the end of this century,\" the book concludes. Examining eight methods to reduce or stop global warming, Lomborg and his fellow economists recommend pouring money into researching and developing clean energy sources such as wind, wave, solar and nuclear power, and more work on climate engineering ideas such as \"cloud whitening\" to reflect the sun's heat back into the outer atmosphere. In a Guardian interview, he said he would finance investment through a tax on carbon emissions that would also raise $50bn to mitigate the effect of climate change, for example by building better sea defences, and $100bn for global healthcare. His declaration about the importance of action on climate change comes at a crucial point in the debate, with international efforts to agree a global deal on emissions stalled amid a resurgence in scepticism caused by rows over the reliability of the scientific evidence for global warming. The fallout from those rows continued yesterday when Rajendra Pachauri, head of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, came under new pressure to step down after an independent review of the panel's work called for tighter term limits for its senior executives and greater transparency in its workings. The IPCC has come under fire in recent months following revelations of inaccuracies in the last assessment of global warming, provided to governments in 2007 – for which it won the Nobel peace prize with former the US vice-president Al Gore. The mistakes, including a claim that the Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035, prompted a review of the IPCC's processes and procedures by the InterAcademy Council (IAC), an organisation of world science bodies. The IAC said the IPCC needed to be as transparent as possible in how it worked, how it selected people to participate in assessments and its choice of scientific information to assess. Although Pachauri once compared Lomborg to Hitler, he has now given an unlikely endorsement to the new book, Smart Solutions to Climate Change. In a quote for the launch, Pachauri said: \"This book provides not only a reservoir of information on the reality of human-induced climate change, but raises vital questions and examines viable options on what can be done.\" Lomborg denies he has performed a volte face, pointing out that even in his first book he accepted the existence of man-made global warming. \"The point I've always been making is it's not the end of the world,\" he told the Guardian. \"That's why we should be measuring up to what everybody else says, which is we should be spending our money well.\" But he said the crucial turning point in his argument was the Copenhagen Consensus project, in which a group of economists were asked to consider how best to spend $50bn. The first results, in 2004, put global warming near the bottom of the list, arguing instead for policies such as fighting malaria and HIV/Aids. But a repeat analysis in 2008 included new ideas for reducing the temperature rise, some of which emerged about halfway up the ranking. Lomborg said he then decided to consider a much wider variety of policies to reduce global warming, \"so it wouldn't end up at the bottom\". The difference was made by examining not just the dominant international policy to cut carbon emissions, but also seven other \"solutions\" including more investment in technology, climate engineering, and planting more trees and reducing soot and methane, also significant contributors to climate change, said Lomborg. \"If the world is going to spend hundreds of millions to treat climate, where could you get the most bang for your buck?\" was the question posed, he added.After the analyses, five economists were asked to rank the 15 possible policies which emerged. Current policies to cut carbon emissions through taxes - of which Lomborg has long been critical - were ranked largely at the bottom of four of the lists. At the top were more direct public investment in research and development rather than spending money on low carbon energy now, and climate engineering. Lomborg acknowledged trust was a problem when committing to long term R&amp;D, but said politicians were already reneging on promises to cut emissions, and spending on R&amp;D would be easier to monitor. Although many believe private companies are better at R&amp;D than governments, Lomborg said low carbon energy was a special case comparable to massive public investment in computers from the 1950s, which later precpitated the commercial IT revolution. Lomborg also admitted climate engineering could cause \"really bad stuff\" to happen, but argued if it could be a cheap and quick way to reduce the worst impacts of climate change and thus there was an \"obligation to at least look at it\". He added: \"This is not about 'we have all got to live with less, wear hair-shirts and cut our carbon emissions'. It's about technologies, about realising there's a vast array of solutions.\" Despite his change of tack, however, Lomborg is likely to continue to have trenchant critics. Writing for today's Guardian, Howard Friel, author of the book The Lomborg Deception, said: \"If Lomborg were really looking for smart solutions, he would push for an end to perpetual and brutal war, which diverts scarce resources from nearly everything that Lomborg legitimately says needs more money.\" • This article was amended on 31st August 2010 to remove an accidental duplication of the quote from Rajendra Pachauri."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/may/28/uk-conservation-credits-scheme-thames","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-28T11:06:02Z","webTitle":"UK's first 'conservation credit' scheme launched","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/28/uk-conservation-credits-scheme-thames","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/may/28/uk-conservation-credits-scheme-thames","fields":{"headline":"UK's first 'conservation credit' scheme launched","bodyText":"The first UK project allowing builders to buy \"credits\" in conservation schemes, to offset the damage they are doing elsewhere, has been launched. Conservation credit – or biobanking – schemes have been trialled in the US, Australia and South Africa and experts believe the industry could become worth billions of pounds in Britain. The initial step is the sale of shares in a £100m project to restore and reconnect fragmented wetlands, woodlands and grasslands around the headwaters of the river Thames in the west of England. The shares are being sold by the Environment Bank, a company that helps deliver \"mitigation and compensation schemes associated with planned development\". Although buying credits will be voluntary, the company said it expected developers would want to get involved. Investing in conservation would allow them to meet environmental standards attached to planning permission for development sites, without giving up as much land, and thus potential income. The idea of conservation credits has received backing from the new prime minister, David Cameron, and it is expected to be supported by a report this summer for the UN on the costs and benefits of looking after ecosystems and biodiversity. However, environment groups have a number of worries, including the possibility of developers paying for schemes which would have happened anyway. They also fear that public funds will be taken from conservation projects when private money is funnelled in and are concerned that the benefits of a specific conservation project should be at least equal to the loss of biodiversity on the development site. Rob Gillespie, a town planner and the Environment Bank's managing director, said he and Professor David Hill, an ecologist and member of the government's wildlife and countryside agency Natural England, set up the company three years ago because they were dismayed by the poor quality of conservation work done as a result of current planning agreements, which are usually limited to small fragments of land. \"Nobody wants them, nobody wants to pay for them, they become loitering areas and, added together, they have no benefit,\" said Gillespie. \"We started thinking this can't go on as it does: we have got to find a more credible way of balancing the impact of development with good-quality environmental mitigation ... \"Why not have conservation credits, landscape-scale, which deliver much more bangs for the bucks. Let the developers get on with what they are good at: they are not good at conservation.\" He added: \"We're not suggesting taking the brakes off the planning system. This is not a licence to trash.\" The scheme in the west of England is the first launched by the company, which is working up a portfolio of other projects around the country, covering a variety of habitats. For the Thames scheme, the company is working with Wiltshire Wildlife Trust, and talking to other trusts in Gloucestershire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, as well as the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust charity. In response to the concern that public funding would dry up when private developers paid for schemes, Gillespie said there was already a risk that huge public spending cuts meant government money was likely to be axed anyway. \"We may be stepping in to replace public sector finance,\" he said. Developers of projects from housing to nuclear power stations or ports would be encouraged to invest in schemes in the same region as their business, so that local communities would be close to the benefits, said Gillespie. He also said that the initiative was not intended to allow any relaxation in planning laws, such as proof that a development is needed and stronger protections for more important sites. In the US, which is at the forefront of biobanking schemes, $3bn (£2.1bn) was raised for wetlands alone in 2008, said Hill. When the Guardian first revealed the Conservative policy supporting biobanking last year, Hill said housebuilders had indicated they would be willing to pay about £5,000 per new home built if a scheme similar to the Tory proposals was up and running. \"Multiply that by 240,000 homes a year to be built: you suddenly realise the figures that could go into the natural environment go into the 100s of millions [of pounds],\" he added.ends."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2008/feb/17/ireland.nuclearpower","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2008-02-17T00:06:17Z","webTitle":"Dublin wants right to inspect UK nuclear power stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/17/ireland.nuclearpower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2008/feb/17/ireland.nuclearpower","fields":{"headline":"Dublin wants right to inspect UK nuclear power stations","bodyText":"Ireland will demand greater access to inspect Britain's nuclear facilities if Gordon Brown goes ahead with building more nuclear power stations, an Irish cabinet minister vowed yesterday. John Gormley, Ireland's Minister of the Environment, said that while the Republic accepted the sovereign right of the UK to determine its own energy policies, Dublin would be calling for more inspectors to scrutinise new British nuclear power stations. 'Since several court cases taken against the British government, there has been greater co-operation and transparency to nuclear facilities in Britain. We want that arrangement to continue, where our people can go and inspect those stations. 'There will now have to be greater co-operation in relation to this issue. That is where, in terms of north-south and east-west co-operation, we can make progress. We have a different perspective on nuclear power than Britain.' Ireland has been locked in a longstanding row with the UK over Sella-field and its alleged environmental impact on the Irish eastern seaboard. Speaking at the Irish Green Party's regional Northern Ireland conference, Gormley also emphasised that the Irish troop contingent serving in Kosovo would remain there despite today's declaration of independence by the Albanian majority. Peace and neutrality organisations, as well as Sinn Féin, have claimed that if Russia uses its veto on the UN Security Council against Kosovan independence, the Irish military presence could be unconstitutional. Under Ireland's so-called 'triple lock', all Irish Defence Forces commitments overseas have to be mandated by the UN Security Council. 'It remains to be seen what [President] Putin does, but what we have to understand is that the Irish troops there are already UN mandated. The Irish government's position is fully in line with our UN obligations. So for the foreseeable future they will stay.' Gormley also said he would be personally campaigning for a 'yes' vote in the forthcoming Lisbon Treaty referendum, despite more than two thirds of his party voting against it at a special congress last month. The minister then commented on the recent Sharia law furore in Britain and the fact that some Irish Muslims have argued for the introduction of parts of Sharia in Ireland. 'The laws in Ireland are passed by the Oireachtas [the Irish Parliament and Senate] and if we see fit to pass laws to incorporate minority groups, that would be up to the parliament, which is sovereign.' Gormley also backed the campaign by the Greens' sole member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for greater transparency in the way political parties are funded. North Down MLA Brian Wilson wants the law changed so that those who donate to parties in the north of Ireland no longer have the right to remain anonymous.

As expected, bodies on the periphery of government that advise on environmental issues or perform important green functions have been hit hard. But some of the biggest changes may be yet to come. The Green party leader, Caroline Lucas, said the changes looked \"ill-thought through\" and the implications were still \"very vague\". \"This whole thing has raised more questions than it has answered,\" she said. \"It just looks like there has been an incredible slash-and-burn approach.\" First, the uncertainty. There has been speculation that the Carbon Trust (which advises businesses and public sector organisations on how to cut their carbon emissions) and the Energy Saving Trust (which provides information to consumers) would be for the chop. They still might be, but they don't appear on the list produced by the Cabinet Office today because they are not-for-profit companies owned by the government and so not technically quangos. The same applies to the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) which promotes waste reduction. Among those who will be breathing a sigh of relief will be the Climate Change Committee (the independent body that advises the government on its carbon budgets) and the Technology Strategy Board (which supports new technology such as wave power). But the losers are many. The following are being abolished or reconstituted as expert committees: • The Infrastructure Planning Commission; • Renewables advisory board; • British Nuclear Fuels Limited; • Advisory committee on carbon abatement technologies; • Advisory committee on organic standards; • Advisory committee on packaging; • Advisory committee on pesticides; • Expert panel on air quality standards; • Royal commission on environmental pollution; • Renewable Fuels Agency; • Cycling England • The Commission for Integrated Transport. The climate change secretary, Chris Huhne, has made great play of the previous government's failure to sufficiently grow renewable energy capacity such as windfarms, so the loss of the renewables advisory board (RAB) will raise eyebrows. Matthew Spencer, an RAB board member for the last five years and director of the Green Alliance thinktank, said: \"The question is how government is now going to get advice for policy making. There has to be some way of people on the ground giving advice to ministers. Policy will be poorer if they don't get external advice. \"The biggest fear of ministers is making policy and then having nothing happen. The key to good policy is that it has been tested with the people who will have to deliver it.\" But others argue the board is no longer required. Juliet Davenport, chief executive of Good Energy and a RAB board member has said that the board has \"done some excellent work historically but going forward its existence is neither here nor there.\" Another green campaigner who wished to remain anonymous said: \"It had been fairly quiet. I don't think it is a massive loss.\" Rachel Cary of Green Alliance said that it was a mistake to transfer the functions of the Renewable Fuels Agency (RFA) to the secretary of state for transport. \"The RFA was doing a good job, while very under-resourced, of managing to bring forward sustainability standards for biofuels. With the RFA it means the already floundering renewable fuel industry in the UK will struggle.\" Cycling campaigners are concerned about the loss of five-year-old Cycling England and the variety of functions it performs (with a £140m budget over the past three years) to promote cycling. The Bikability scheme, which replaced the old cycling proficiency test and trians 300,000 people in safe cycling annually, will be taken over by the department for transport. A new local sustainable transport fund announced last month is meant to support some of Cycle England's bike schemes on a local level, but its level of funding will not be confirmed until the spending review on 20 October. \"There are still a lot of questions that haven't been answered,\" said Victoria Hazael of CTC, the UK national cycling organisation. Other major organisations face significant changes. The Environment Agency and Natural England are to be retained but substantially reformed. \"They have been scaled back and asked by government to focus on delivery, which is code for 'stop nagging us [ie government]',\" said Martin Harper from the RSPB. \"We welcome the fact that they still exist but we worry if they will have enough money to perform their essential functions. If they are to focus on delivery, then there needs to be more room for others to speak out.\" Another that is slated for reform is the Forestry Commission. Harper said he expected to see a sell-off of forested land later in the year, a move the Guardian predicted in August. \"Any sell-off must make sure that the benefits of forests, in terms of providing clean air and water and more, are protected.\" British Waterways, which maintains the 2,000 miles of inland waterways such as canals and rivers, will be converted into a charity. This change had been heavily signalled and was welcomed by the organisation's chairman, Tony Hales. \"This is excellent news and something we have been urging all political parties to support since last year ... Moving the waterways from public ownership into a charitable body recognises the need to build on that enthusiasm and marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter in their 250-year history.\" Some of the quangos to be axed have hardly had a chance to get going. The advisory committee on packaging, for example, was set up in early 2010 and has only had two meetings. The Infrastructure Planning Commission was set up last October by the last government to fast-track planning decisions on nationally important projects such as windfarms and nuclear power stations. It cost £5m to set up, and costs £9.3m a year to run (including a chairman's salary of £200,000 a year), but by April it had yet to receive a single application and both the Tories and Lib Dems had pledged to shut it down. The government had announced in July that its sustainbility watchdog, the Sustainable Development Commission (SDC), would be axed. But the announcement today makes clear that it may yet survive in some form. The SDC is a company limited by guarantee that is owned jointly by the UK government and the three devolved administrations, so if the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Ireland governments decide they want to retain its functions then it may yet live on. Even so, Lucas said that losing the functions it performs for England would be disastrous. She said it had saved the government £300m over 10 years against a running cost of £4m a year. The environment secretary, Caroline Spelman, has suggested that some of its functions could be performed by MPs on the environmental audit committee, but Lucas said this was completely impractical. \"There is no way that a parliamentary committee can absorb the work that the SDC with its 40 staff is doing,\" she said. An SDC spokesperson said it had repeatedly suggested many of the efficiency savings put forward by Philip Green, the retail magnate brought in to advise on government waste. \"For the past five years, the SDC has presented ministers with many of the points about efficiency; quality and transparency of data; and lack of co-ordination which were welcomed in Philip Green's report this week. As we face closure on the grounds of efficiency, it is hard to understand the need to commission fresh advice on subject on which the government's appointed watchdog has built up a great deal of expertise.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2010/jan/12/colleges-back-nuclear-revival","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-12T00:05:26Z","webTitle":"Colleges back nuclear revival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/jan/12/colleges-back-nuclear-revival","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2010/jan/12/colleges-back-nuclear-revival","fields":{"headline":"Colleges back nuclear revival","bodyText":"The debate about nuclear power arouses passion on both sides. But a government commitment to build new reactors has been welcomed by further education colleges offering nuclear industry-related qualifications, especially those in, or near to, economically depressed areas. But not everyone is happy. One anti-nuclear-power group is questioning a decision by the South West Regional Development Agency (SWRDA) to grant £2m towards the cost of a specialist nuclear education facility at Bridgwater College, Somerset. The South West Energy Skills Centre will specialise in nuclear training. \"The government said there wouldn't be any subsidies for the nuclear industry and we regard this is as a hidden one,\" says Stop Hinkley's co-ordinator, Jim Duffy. But those in favour of a new plant at Hinkley claim it will have a resounding impact on Somerset's economy. It's estimated that 4,000 jobs will be created during the construction phase and hundreds more in the power station's lifetime. Energy firm EDF says it wants local firms and workers fully involved. The facility will double the number of training places it can offer in trades such as engineering and construction that can be directly employed by the nuclear industry. The area has seen a steady loss of manufacturing jobs over the years. Wage levels are low, a high proportion of the workforce is low skilled, and educational attainment is below average. \"It [the training centre] provides a solid base on which to build routes to higher-level employment and university-level training,\" says Suzanne Bond, the SWRDA's executive director of people and skills. Bridgwater College principal Fiona McMillan expects that the commitment to new-build will stimulate interest among 16- to 18-years-olds. \"The industry was seen to be declining,\" she says. \"Now there's potential for long-term careers.\" The college has been working with EDF to inform young people about nuclear energy, and the British Nuclear Energy Society, a lobbying and educational body, has visited to talk about potential careers. Recently, the college started offering the 14-16 diploma in engineering. \"We also have 72 16- to 18-year-old engineering students on full-time two-year programmes, many of whom will see the nuclear industry as a great career route, and be able to study at HE level locally,\" says McMillan. Until recently, the nuclear story was one of power stations nearing the end of their life and, with that, a demand for specialist courses on decommissioning – cleaning up sites and making the waste secure. This requires an understanding of nuclear physics, engineering, reactor design and much else. Since nuclear decommissioning programmes began in 2007, Bridgwater College has trained more than 100 employees from Magnox South, the company that clears up sites for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, and from the industry's supply chain, by offering NVQs related to decommissioning and radiation protection. It has also begun offering a foundation degree in decommissioning in conjunction with the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan). But a shift in government policy has earmarked 10 sites deemed suitable for future nuclear plants. They are Bradwell, in Essex; Braystones, Kirksanton and Sellafield, in Cumbria; Hartlepool; Heysham, Lancashire; Hinkley Point, Somerset; Oldbury, Gloucestershire; Sizewell, Suffolk; and Wylfa, in North Wales. Braystones and Kirksanton are the only new locations. Now colleges are preparing to train people starting out in a wide range of careers building up and running the industry. Blackpool and the Fylde College, in Lancashire, offers a foundation degree in nuclear engineering (plant and process). The college sees it as addressing a skills deficit. It is designed to attract students from FE programmes – \"an important market\"– such as those doing national and higher national-level certificates in mechanical and electrical and electronic engineering. Simon Hughes, Blackpool and Fylde's head of engineering and computing, describes the government's backing of nuclear new-build as \"music to our ears\" in terms of supporting the local economy. \"It's very important to us – the north-west is definitely depressed,\" he says. \"We're very excited – we have a large engineering department and can upscale easily. \"While the priority is to meet immediate demand within the industry, the degree course is written in a way so anyone with the right skills set can access it. We're getting inquiries from people we wouldn't ordinarily expect, and from companies we don't normally deal with.\" If plants are built on all the possible sites – the government anticipates the first reactors being operational by 2020 – Cumbria would be home to three of them. This is potentially a boost to Workington-based Lakes College. Three years ago, it became the first FE college to offer UCLan's foundation degree in decommissioning. \"If only one is built, it would create 10,000 construction jobs and a further 1,200 in operating it,\" says principal Cath Richardson. \"Then you'll have more indirect jobs. This is fundamental to the regeneration of local communities, and it gives us a lift.\" An expansion of nuclear energy is unlikely to see significant opposition in the further education sector, it seems."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jan/10/mark-kennedy-undercover-cop-activist","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-10T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"Mark Kennedy: A journey from undercover cop to 'bona fide' activist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/10/mark-kennedy-undercover-cop-activist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jan/10/mark-kennedy-undercover-cop-activist","fields":{"headline":"Mark Kennedy: A journey from undercover cop to 'bona fide' activist","bodyText":"He turned up with long hair, tattoos and an insatiable appetite for climbing trees. Few people suspected anything odd of the man who introduced himself as Mark Stone on a dairy farm turned spiritual sanctuary in North Yorkshire. He had come alone on 12 August 2003, in the middle of a heatwave, for a gathering of environmental activists known as Earth First. Apart from the fact that \"Stone\" was apparently well-paid and ate meat, he appeared no different from the hundreds of other activists who gathered under marquees to smoke weed, play guitars and plan protests. What no one could have known was that, despite appearances, the 33-year-old \"freelance climber\" was actually PC Mark Kennedy, an undercover police officer beginning an audacious operation to live deep undercover among environmental activists. The Guardian can reveal just how successful – and controversial – the operation was. From that day Kennedy would live a remarkable double life lasting more than seven years. So embedded in the protest community did he become that about 200 people turned up for a joint celebration of his 40th birthday, described as a \"three-day bender\" on a farm. All were, of course, oblivious that Kennedy was feeding back detailed reports to his police commanders as he participated in, and sometimes even organised, some of the most high-profile demonstrations of the past decade. He took part in almost every major environmental protest in the UK from 2003, and also managed to infiltrate groups of anti-racists, anarchists and animal rights protesters. Using a fake passport, Kennedy visited more than 22 countries, taking part in protests against the building of a dam in Iceland, touring Spain with eco-activists, and penetrating anarchist networks in Germany and Italy. It was a career that involved breaking into power stations, invading airports and – according to legal papers – concluded in an operation in which he now stands accused of crossing the boundary from spy to agent provocateur. Kennedy's personal journey also appears to have ended with a remarkable twist. In recent weeks, after protesters discovered his hidden identity and circulated news that he was a police agent, Kennedy is said to have \"gone native\". He has expressed remorse to betrayed friends and is seeking some way of securing redemption. Kennedy's career as a police constable in the Metropolitan police began around 1994. It was almost 10 years later – in early 2003 – that he was selected as a candidate for a classified operation. Police have been infiltrating protest movements for decades, but Kennedy was to be one of the first to work for the newly formed National Public Order Intelligence Unit, which monitors so-called \"domestic extremists\". That summer he was issued with a driving licence and passport bearing his new identity – Mark Stone – and a plausible backstory that explained his long absences. Claiming to be a professional climber, Kennedy told people he encountered in Nottingham – many of them connected to Earth First – that he often had well-paid work abroad. Kennedy had two assets that, in the years to come, would make him indispensable to protesters. First, he could drive, and had a dark blue pick-up truck. Second, he was generous with his money, agreeing to pay for campaign literature, rented vans and fines imposed on activists in magistrates courts. His largesse would eventually earn him his best-known nickname, Flash. Almost a year after he first emerged in Nottingham, Kennedy began gaining the trust of activists. In 2004 he became involved in Dissent!, a network preparing for protests against the following year's G8 Summit in Gleneagles. In 2005 he scaled trees in London, to hang a banner protesting against BP, then travelled to Scotland, where his van was used to ship equipment to an eco-camp near Stirling. After G8 came to an end, Kennedy vanished to Iceland to campaign against the construction of a dam. He was becoming well-known among protesters, including Alex Long, a member of the London-based Wombles anarchist collective, who had met him the previous year. Looking back, Long said, Kennedy was \"too good to be true – the perfect activist\". \"He would be your best mate, but not in a contrived way,\" he said. \"If he walked in right now, I'd say to him: 'Mark, how you doing?' and then only seconds later I'd think, oh, I forgot, you're a cop.\" By all accounts Kennedy rarely expressed political views, instead taking an interest in the practicalities of protest. Craig Logan, 37, who unwittingly became a close friend of the undercover officer, said he had \"no great powers of oratory\" but made friends quickly. \"He was funny, friendly – if a bit blokey,\" he said. \"He would go out of his way for people.\" He agreed that Kennedy's van – and his money – quickly helped him to ingratiate himself with the community. Conscious of police surveillance, activists keep those who know about the logistics of a protest \"action\" to a small circle. For practical reasons, those in the know typically include people responsible for transport. By the summer of 2006, Kennedy's life as an activist was complete. He entered the circle of people planning the first of the annual Climate Camp gatherings, helping to set up the encampment near the Drax coal-fired power station in North Yorkshire. Around the same time he chained himself to Hartlepool nuclear power station and climbed a crane at Didcot power station. At the following year's Climate Camp, Kennedy was trusted enough to be given the important role of organising transport needed to set up a camp near Heathrow. But by Climate Camp 2008 – when activists gathered near Kingsnorth power station, in Kent – the undercover police officer's appetite for action was raising suspicions. Kennedy volunteered to be the driver in an action that saw 29 activists successfully hijack a train delivering 1,000 tonnes of coal to Drax. Behind his back, some protesters began calling him \"Detective Stone\". \"I was quite shocked,\" said Long. \"That is just about the worst thing you can say about an activist.\" It was not until 12 April 2009, when Kennedy's uniformed colleagues stormed into a school in the suburbs of Nottingham, that his double life began to unravel. Police had been tipped off – presumably by Kennedy – that some activists planned to break into the nearby Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station, a coal-fired plant owned by E.ON. In a £300,000 operation police swooped into a school building where protesters had gathered on the eve of the invasion. Inside, they found 114 activists including Kennedy, who had travelled from the London G20 protests. Twenty protesters were eventually convicted for the minor crime of conspiracy to commit trespass after they admitted they had planned to occupy the plant for a week, thereby preventing the emission of 150,000 tonnes of carbon. Handing down \"lenient\" sentences last week at Nottingham crown court, a judge said the intended protest would have been peaceful and safe, and recognised the activists were \"decent\" people with \"the highest possible motives\". Kennedy, it seems, was the exception. For four months he had played a key role in planning the action, leading a reconnaissance mission and giving advice on the best way to break into the site. \"We needed someone who could drive and we needed someone we could trust. Mark felt like that person,\" said Bradley Day, 23, who worked with Kennedy on the mission. Kennedy allowed his house to be used for planning meetings and, days before the protest was due to take place he used his fake ID to pay £778 to hire a 7.5-tonne truck to transport equipment. Those around said they became increasingly aware of his desire for the protest to go ahead. When a heavy police presence was reported outside the power station, activists considered abandoning the protest, but nominated Kennedy to drive out to see how big a threat they posed. When he returned, he told the group there was no police presence at all. The arrests followed soon after. Immediately some suspected Kennedy, who may have been having his own regrets. \"I remember being awake at about eight the next morning and seeing Mark sitting at the bottom of the stairs with his head in his hands,\" said one activist who slept on Kennedy's floor. Suspicions grew when Kennedy – among 27 activists who were charged – declined to use the same law firm as the others. Charges against him, but not the others, were then dropped. But it was a chance discovery of his real passport, bearing the surname Kennedy, months later that put activists on a trail that would eventually lead them to documents confirming he was a police officer. Six of Kennedy's close friends confronted him in a house in Nottingham in the early hours of 21 October last year. He confessed, breaking down in tears and expressing regret for the pain he had caused. He told those present that he was not the only officer deep undercover in the protest movement, costing the taxpayer £250,000 a year per agent. Those claims – along with his apparent remorse – were not believed by everyone present. \"He is duplicitous. He was undercover for seven years. I didn't trust a word of what he was saying,\" said one activist. Kennedy is now living abroad, but recent developments suggest his desire for redemption is sincere. In email exchanges with activists and their lawyer, Kennedy talked of taking a \"leap of faith\", giving the defence evidence that would \"assist\" them. \"I want to help,\" he said. Three weeks ago, Kennedy suddenly pulled out and ceased communications, but not before expressing an abiding concern. \"I don't want this ever to happen to anyone ever again,\" he said. \"What's happened is really wrong.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/jan/21/climatechange-tonyblair","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-01-21T17:17:39Z","webTitle":"Tony Blair insists economic downturn must not hamper green energy plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jan/21/climatechange-tonyblair","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/jan/21/climatechange-tonyblair","fields":{"headline":"Tony Blair insists economic downturn must not hamper green energy plans","bodyText":"Former prime minister Tony Blair has urged his successor Gordon Brown and other political leaders not to allow the global financial crisis to halt the fight against climate change. The former prime minister called for a new global deal that would set tough interim targets up to 2020 in a bid to \"transform\" countries to low-carbon economies. Speaking at the World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi, Blair said: \"It is right now, at the instant when our thoughts are centred on the economic challenge, that we must not set to one side the challenge of global warming, but instead resolve to meet it and put the world on path to a sustainable future.\" Blair outlined a range of steps that were required through a \"global compact\" to meet the environmental challenge. \"It needs not just a 2050 target but an interim target to get there …a target for 2020 that shows seriousness of intent and gives business a clear, unequivocal signal to invest in a low-carbon future.\" The interim goals would largely be aimed at the West but he believed it would have to be matched by obligations in the developing world. He suggested that strategic partnerships between China and America, India and America and Europe and America would be important, with all three being of \"paramount importance\". Blair said there was a need for a step change, not small steps to meet the scale of the challenge, but he also said it was necessary to be practical about what could be done. \"There is no point in demanding of President Obama something he cannot deliver. Instead let us help him deliver what he can.\" Blair said global warming required enormous changes in the way the world did its business but that global cooperation brought wider benefits. He praised Abu Dhabi for its decision earlier this week to set a 7% renewable energy target for 2020. That showed other oil-rich nations in the region what could be done and was an example of the kind of move away from pure self-interest that the world needed, argued Blair. He set out the importance of a green new deal to revitalise economies, arguing it was vital to \"invest now in these times of a low-carbon price for the times when that price rises again\". Blair, who took no fee for his speech, gave an upbeat assessment of his own 10 years in office as UK prime minister, saying greenhouse gases had fallen while economy had continued to grow. \"There are now more jobs in the new environmental industries than in coal, steel and shipping combined,\" he argued. He also encouraged the development of nuclear power as a way of lowering carbon emissions, although he acknowledged that it was \"controversial\". Observers would contest Blair's assessment of his green record, pointing out that much of the carbon dioxide reductions resulted from the demise of the UK coal industry, for economic reasons."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/jul/21/ten-weeks-revitalised-british-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-21T13:59:35Z","webTitle":"Ten weeks that have revitalised politics | Simon Hughes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/21/ten-weeks-revitalised-british-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/21/ten-weeks-revitalised-british-politics","fields":{"headline":"Ten weeks that have revitalised politics","bodyText":"It is just 10 weeks since the coalition government was formed. Today, Nick Clegg will stand at the dispatch box to answer prime minister's questions. This is not an outcome that I ever predicted before the election. But in 10 weeks we have achieved greater political change than I could have ever imagined. The coalition has already taken major steps to dismantle the draconian and authoritarian state left to us by Labour – to scrap ID cards and intrusive government databases, to end the disgraceful practice of locking up children for immigration purposes and to review 28-day detention without charge. Liberal Democrats in government have announced the most radical reforms to our political system in generations, with Nick Clegg driving them through at the centre of government. Not only will there be a referendum on a fairer voting system next year, but there will now also be an elected second chamber too – a properly democratic parliament after 1,000 years of waiting. There will also be the right to sack MPs guilty of serious misconduct, reformed party funding, a statutory register of lobbyists and radical devolution of power to local government and community groups. All these are Liberal Democrat policies. The government is also committed to a pupil premium which will target money to improve standards in the poorest areas, no third runway at Heathrow, and a banking levy to make sure that banks repay the financial support they received from the taxpayer. All Liberal Democrat policies. In the election, Liberal Democrats made clear that we had four key priorities: fairer taxes; a fair start for children; fair politics; and a green, sustainable economy. Thanks to our involvement, the new government will deliver on each of these. There have of course been difficulties. No one in our party was happy voting for a rise in VAT. But equally no one in our party would have chosen to enter government facing the largest budget deficit in the entire G20. I have been clear that despite the rise in VAT, on balance the tax changes in the emergency budget were fair. By raising the income tax threshold by £1,000 we have taken the first steps to delivering the Liberal Democrat promise to make no one pay income tax on the first £10,000 they receive. And the income tax threshold will be increased every year during this parliament. After seeing Labour drop capital gains tax to 18%, we have raised it back up to 28% – not as far as Liberal Democrats wanted, but a significant move in the right direction. We also promised to restore the earnings link to pensions, which Labour never delivered – and which the new government will now do. The next challenge is this autumn's spending review. Of course, making the kind of spending cuts which the economy needs will not be easy, and along the way we will have to make some tough choices. But the government has also committed to make this spending review the most open and transparent ever conducted in the UK. Throughout this review, Liberal Democrats in parliament and around the country must continue to make the case for fairness and justice in every department and across departments. With Liberal Democrats in many key spending departments and in the Treasury, the case for fairness will be forcibly and consistently made. At the same time, on other issues where Liberal Democrats have strong clear positions – opposition to tuition fees and nuclear power at home and campaigning for nuclear disarmament and the rule of law abroad – we must be stronger than ever in making our voices heard and presence felt. There has also been huge constitutional change in this coalition government. This is a government for a full five years – and legislation will soon be introduced to secure this. Departments have not been divided up between parties but very nearly every department has ministers of both parties. At the highest level, decisions are taken by the two parties – the prime minister and deputy prime minister together. This is constructive, grown-up government, respecting the importance of both parties – and for Liberal Democrats the guarantee that this is our government as much as that of our partners. What a refreshing change from the dysfunctional coalition of the Blair-Brown years. In the last 10 weeks we have seen three refreshing changes in the politics of Britain. There has been change from a government which had lost direction and run out of steam, to a government clear about its direction and full of energy. There has been change from one party government to coalition government for the first time for 65 years – doing what many of the public often say they want and bringing political leaders to work together in the interests of the nation. And thirdly, we have seen Liberals enter government for the first time since the second world war. This is a huge opportunity for Liberals and Liberal Democrats. Our great party at last has the chance to make sure we build for the first time in decades a truly liberal Britain. As we tackle the three great challenges of the economic, environmental and political crises we inherited, we have all to play for. With confidence, but not with arrogance, we can help to deliver the fairer Britain our country desperately needs. We have only just begun to show what a real transformation for the better this can bring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2010/mar/23/babcock-vt-merger","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-23T17:52:21Z","webTitle":"Babcock and VT agree £1.3bn merger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/23/babcock-vt-merger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/mar/23/babcock-vt-merger","fields":{"headline":"Babcock and VT agree £1.3bn merger","bodyText":"Babcock and VT group clinched a merger deal today to create a defence and support services group with sales of £3bn and more than 25,000 employees in Britain and the US. But sources said some job losses were inevitable after the merger completes in July, with several hundred positions under threat, particularly at VT's head office in Southampton. Paul Lester, boss of VT, is not being offered a seat on the merged company's board and will leave with a shares and compensation package worth at least £5m. Babcock is taking over VT for £1.32bn or 750p a share, following five bid attempts since last year when Babcock chief executive Peter Rogers made overtures to Lester during the summer. VT sought to torpedo Babcock's efforts by seeking a takeover of Mouchel, a road services firm, as part of a strategy to diversify away from defence, a sector it deemed vulnerable to cuts after the general election. But it abandoned the Mouchel bid after Babcock made it clear it intended to make a formal offer for VT and had no interest in Mouchel. Babcock refits and maintains many of the Royal Navy ships and submarines and owns or runs shipyards at Faslane, Rosyth and Devonport. Its chairman is Mike Turner, a former boss of BAE Systems, which teamed up with VT four years ago to bid for Babcock. Analysts say that a merger between VT and Babcock has been on the cards since 2003 and offers an \"all-British solution\" at a time when UK companies are increasingly falling prey to foreign predators. Although Lester bitterly opposed a takeover, he was persuaded to open his books to Babcock after pressure from City shareholders, many of whom own equity in both companies. Paul Murphy, analyst at Numis Securities, said a merger made \"commercial sense as the two companies had interests in the same areas and could pool resources to compete for a broader range of contracts.\" One area ripe for expansion is in nuclear power. Both companies are involved in decommissioning but are looking to expand over the next decade. VT also has major interests in education and training and operates transmission sites for the BBC world service. Turner said: \"The acquisition of such a high quality and complementary business is in line with our strategy to be the leading engineering support services company in the UK. We look forward to bringing the enhanced capabilities of the enlarged Babcock to new and existing companies.\" Rogers said: \"The combination gives you the ability to talk right across those who influence policy and direction within the MoD and that's extremely valuable.\" Under the terms of the deal, Babcock has increased the cash component of its previous indicative offers. It is now offering 361.6p a share in cash, as well as 0.7 new Babcock shares for each VT share. Following due diligence, Babcock has identified £50m of cost savings."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2008/aug/29/nuclear.renewableenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-08-29T00:15:45Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power generators in spain accused of putting profit before safety","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/nuclear.renewableenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2008/aug/29/nuclear.renewableenergy","fields":{"headline":"Generators accused of putting profit before safety","bodyText":"Iberdrola and Endesa, two of Spain's leading electricity companies, have been accused of cutting costs at nuclear power stations at the expense of safety. The Catalan regional government said that failure to invest had caused several incidents at two nuclear stations including a leak which led to thousands of people having to undergo radiation tests. The accusations came as Spain's socialist government vowed to gradually close down the country's six nuclear plants and get electricity from renewable sources. Prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has said his government will not build any more nuclear plants, which currently account for 20% of the country's electricity needs. Spain hopes wind and solar power will make it into a leading producer of electricity from renewable sources. But soaring oil prices have put the government under pressure to review its anti-nuclear policy. In November, a radioactive leak occurred at the Asco 1 plant, but the owners did not tell the CSN, Spain's nuclear watchdog, until April. More than 2,000 people had to undergo radiation tests. Out of 47 reported incidents from Spain's six nuclear power stations, 25 occurred at Catalonia's three power plants. Xabier Sabater, a spokesman for the Catalan government, said on the local radio: \"The problem behind the incidents is a lack of investments. Iberdrola and Endesa are spending less on maintenance and security.\" He said the deterioration began in 2002 when both companies started to sub-contract work to reduce costs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/jan/31/israel-iran-nuclear-ambitions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-31T19:14:43Z","webTitle":"Israel's view on Iran: Diplomacy not the answer for wary nuclear neighbour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/31/israel-iran-nuclear-ambitions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/jan/31/israel-iran-nuclear-ambitions","fields":{"headline":"Israel's view on Iran: Diplomacy not the answer for wary nuclear neighbour","bodyText":"Israel's government has long tried to raise international concern about Iran's nuclear ambitions and is likely to welcome the new US deployments in the Gulf if it signals a hardening of policy. Israel, itself a major but undeclared nuclear power, has been pushing for tougher sanctions against Iran and is wary of those who argue in favour of dialogue and negotiations. On Saturday the Israeli president, Shimon Peres, held a rare meeting with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Davos, Switzerland, and asked him to work \"in a serious and steadfast manner against Iran's nuclear armament\". Peres told him: \"A nuclear weapon in the hands of a fanatical regime such as the one in Iran poses a threat not only to Israel but also to the entire world.\" The Israeli administration seems so far unconvinced by Washington's approach. Shlomo Brom, a retired general and senior research fellow at the Institute for National Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv, said the current Israeli government was unlikely to be completely satisfied with the Obama administration's policies and said he too believed a stronger line was necessary. \"If the idea is to engage the Iranians and have dialogue and reach a diplomatic solution, I don't think it is possible if the Iranians don't feel some pressure,\" he said. It is not clear yet whether the new US deployments might change Israel's thinking about the possibility of a military strike against Iran, perhaps discouraging it from taking any action – which may, in part, be Washington's intention. Although Israeli pilots managed to bomb an Iraqi nuclear site in 1981, it is far less certain that any such Israeli strike on Iran today could hit its targets and far more of a concern that there would be heavy retaliation through militant groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. Last month, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, listed the Iranian threat as Israel's greatest security challenge and said he wanted the international community to take action immediately before Tehran developed the capability to build nuclear warheads. \"The time for tough sanctions is now,\" he said. \"If this moment is allowed to pass, what good will sanctions do afterwards?\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/215499","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-02T20:44:21Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: New nuclear chief a 'once-a-decade' chance to shake up UN bureacracy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/215499","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/215499","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: New nuclear chief a 'once-a-decade' chance to shake up UN bureacracy","bodyText":"Tuesday, 07 July 2009, 15:59 C O N F I D E N T I A L UNVIE VIENNA 000322 SIPDIS FOR D(S), P, T, S/SANAC, IO, AND ISN DOE FOR NA-20, NA-24, NA-25, NE-1, NE-6 NRC FOR OIP DOANE, HENDERSON, SCHWARTZMAN NSC STAFF FOR SCHEINMAN, CONNERY ALSO FOR LEADERSHIP ANALYSIS EO 12958 DECL: 07/04/2019 TAGS AORC, KNNP, IAEA SUBJECT: IAEA LEADERSHIP TEAM TRANSITION AND U.S. INFLUENCE IN THE AGENCY REF: A.

(C) Summary: The IAEA transition that will come as DG ElBaradei's term ends November 30 provides a once-a-decade opportunity to overcome bureaucratic inertia, modernize Agency operations, and position the new director general for strong leadership from the DG's office. Yukiya Amano's arrival as DG will undoubtedly see some turnover at the Deputy DG level, but we see a mixed picture as to the depth and breadth of change in senior management changes further down. Despite whatever intentions Amano may harbor upon taking office, a renewal in some key positions will take time, as several senior IAEA officials recently received promotions or extensions of their contracts, or both. This \"burrowing in\" will ensure continuity of some experienced leaders but may also confront the next DG with fixed networks of collaboration that resist supervision. Identifying a desirable DDG for Nuclear Safety and Security should be a top U.S. priority. End Summary. DG Succession a Reform Opportunity ---------------------------------- 2. (C) The entry into office of Ambassador Yukiya Amano as IAEA Director General (to a four-year term to begin December 1, 2009) should trigger a reordering of senior management posts throughout the Agency over the months that follow. IAEA departments are headed by the six Deputy Directors General, all of whom are under contract into 2010. We understand from the Japanese Mission that Amano would want most senior personnel to remain in place for some time, to brief him in and provide a smooth transition. However, some turnover of the current DDGs in the first year of Amano's term is to be expected and encouraged. A combination of (not always ironclad) IAEA-mandated retirement for positions below the D level at age 62 (60 for those hired before 1990), national and gender balance, and other factors complicate what should otherwise be the appointment of the most qualified people, committed to modernizing the Agency for anticipated challenges and for adopting new modes of networking, financing, and building excellence in fields where the Agency should be the lead. The current roster of DDGs, profiled below, requires our consideration in this light. 3. (C) Safeguards (SG), Olli Heinonen, Finland - By tradition this department is not be held by an NPT nuclear weapons state. Heinonen's current contract runs through summer 2010 and he has told Msnoff in the past he expected to retire at that time, based largely on personal considerations (but see next para). After the DG's slot, the DDG/Safeguards position is the most important at the IAEA to achieving high-priority U.S. national security objectives related to Iran, DPRK, Syria, and the generally rigorous application of IAEA safeguards globally. DDG Heinonen has played a particularly important role under ElBaradei by working to keep key safeguards investigations on an appropriate technical path. The DDG/Safeguards position will remain essential under Amano's leadership, however, as we expect the new DG to apply less of a political filter to the conduct of safeguards investigations. Thus, the decisions of the DG/Safeguards on Iran, Syria, and other sensitive cases may be the de facto final word for the Agency's safeguards approach in the states about which the U.S. cares the most. 4. (C) Mission assumes the USG would welcome extending beyond 2010 the close and constructive relationship we have had with Heinonen, and we have queried Heinonen as to his availability. He said early this past spring he did not discount the possibility he could stay until 2012, but not longer. He plans to review his situation over the summer \"once the dust has settled\" from the DG election and it is more apparent what other personnel changes will take place in the DG's office and other senior ranks of the Agency. In light of Heinonen's ongoing personal decision process, Mission recommends we confine within the USG any early thinking about possible replacements. Mission will continue to touch base with Heinonen on his thinking as it evolves. 5. (C) Management (MT) - Incumbent David Waller, U.S., in the job since early 1993, recently reaffirmed to Charge he wishes to remain under a new contract. As in analogous positions in the UN system, there is long tradition for the U.S. holding this job, which has potential oversight of all IAEA programs as well as management policies and budgeting. The Management DDG is the Agency's second-in-command, and Waller is usually the Acting DG when ElBaradei travels outside Vienna. His role has been especially critical in the ongoing debate over budget and resources. The Japanese Mission tells us Japan understands the management DDG to be the \"American seat\" and that Amano would personally favor keeping a U.S. national in this role. In the latter years of the ElBaradei administration, DDG Waller has not always exercised influence over programmatic areas or staffing as the USG had hoped. On staffing, however, the history of top-floor overrides of the Agency's own recruitment process predates the current leadership. The true final say and veto power on personnel appointments, down to the level of program manager jobs, resides with the DG, but this was true in the Hans Blix era as well. In broader management terms, the Agency has made significant but uneven progress in reform, measured for example against the UNTAI agenda: \"little to no\" progress on disclosure of internal audits to member states or whistleblower protections; \"some\" progress on an independent ethics function, implementation of IPSAS, and on program support costs (a running sore with USG); better performance on independence of internal oversight, financial disclosure by senior officials, and public access to information about the agency. 6. (C) Safety and Security (NSNS). Incumbent Tomihiro Taniguchi, Japan, informed UNVIE's Nuclear Safety Attache early in 2009 that he was under contract through November 2010 and intended to stay; Taniguchi's DDG colleague Olli Heinonen affirmed to us in late March his understanding that Taniguchi wants to remain perhaps even beyond that date. However, after his election on July 2, DG-designate Amano told Russian IAEA Governor Berdennikov and U.S. Charge that Taniguchi would step down concurrent with Amano's succession to the DG's office, emphasizing that \"Japan is a modest country\" and would not seek to hold the DG and a DDG slot concurrently. (Note: Taniguchi's early departure would be a matter of appearances for Japan; there is no legal provision barring a DDG serving under a DG of the same nationality. End note.) Taniguchi has been a weak manager and advocate, particularly with respect to confronting Japan's own safety practices, and he is a particular disappointment to the United States for his unloved-step-child treatment of the Office of Nuclear Security. Moreover, of the twenty-four management positions in the department, the U.S. holds only one, a P-5 position as head of the Incident and Emergency Center. That is, there are no U.S. managers anywhere in the IAEA's safety and security technical areas. 7. (SBU) This DDG position requires a good manager and leader who is technically qualified in both safety and security. The DDG needs to be an activist to institutionalize and insist on broad member state acceptance of nuclear security -- preventing terrorist or criminal diversion of material from civil nuclear facilities -- as a core Agency mission. However, the DDG must also have a strong safety background. The department can and should exercise a direct and substantial impact of the levels of safety and security in all of the Member States. This department is writing draft safety and security legislation and draft regulatory and security guidance documents that are being used by Member States to create their nuclear programs. \"NSNS\" performs safety and security peer reviews of facilities and provides recommendations for improvements. It also performs an enormous amount of training on all areas of safety and security. As Washington colleagues have pointed out, the new DDG must instill a culture of cooperation with other Agency elements, including Nuclear Energy and Technical Cooperation, in order to improve these services. We are aware of differing views in Washington on the advisability of \"elevating\" nuclear security, potentially as a separate department (ref D), an idea that Iran now advocates. Our bottom line is that the U.S. should push for technical competencies in both safety and security. 8. (C) Technical Cooperation (TC), Ana Maria Cetto, Mexico. TC is the department most in need of a change in culture and process. It administers assistance projects as entitlements, in which the proposals of the beneficiary states rather than an independent analysis of development needs and capacities are decisive. Although some of her subordinates are much stronger, Cetto's reputation is as an enabler of TC's \"entitlement\" approach. Ms. Cetto, the only female DDG at present, may be prepared to depart in 2010. The United States should encourage selection of a manager committed to implement the management structures put in place by Cetto's predecessor, which have become mere formalities under Cetto. Japan knows that China is interested in returning to the ranks of the DDGs, and the Chinese may have a strong candidate for the TC DDG position who is currently serving as TC Director for Asia. If the Chinese secure this position, the new incumbent would likely be male, creating an imperative for the purpose of gender balance to appoint a woman to another of the DDG positions (see also para 17, below). 9. (C) Nuclear Energy (NE), Yury Sokolov, Russia - With the right mix of expert authority, impartiality, and material assistance, this department can play an even greater role in ensuring that wherever nuclear power is developed, it is done so responsibly, safely, securely, with proliferation consciousness and safeguards by design. Agency veterans recall the NE department was established by hiving off nuclear energy from the earlier department of nuclear energy and safety, which was led by a Russian DDG. As reported in ref B (captioned), the Russian Federation will likely be determined to retain this DDG position regardless of Sokolov's personal availability. 10. (C) Nuclear Sciences and Applications (NA), Werner Burkart, Germany - Burkart has indicated he will leave the Agency at the completion of his current contract, which we understand to be November 2010. Burkart is generally viewed as a nice guy and skilled scientist but an unambitious bureaucratic leader. He advocates rationalizing staff and structures that he finds wasteful. One example -- for technical cooperation (TC) projects in which his department or NE are required to assign project officers, the parallel TC project officers are, like those in NA and NE, typically from a nuclear engineering background, and consequently apt to cut out their redundant counterparts in the technical bureaus. A second example -- the IAEA's laboratory structure, including the safeguards analytical laboratory (SAL), falls organizationally under NA (i.e., for management and personnel policies) as a service to the Safeguards Department, but is paid for with safeguards funds. A transfer of the SAL to the Safeguards Department, which Burkart supports, is underway, based on a recommendation by a Canadian management consultant. The DG's Outer Office - Perpetuating Team ElBaradei? --------------------------------------------- ------- 11. (C) As IAEA Secretariat staff consider the future under a DG Amano, many are musing about \"Who runs the agency?\" in that circumstance. We reported ref C that a Spring 2009 STAFFDEL visitor heard from Secretariat officials the concern that a Japanese corporate model of management and internal communication could come to the Agency. However, speaking with Charge on July 2, Amano emphasized (unprompted) that it would not be his intention to pack his inner office with Japanese nationals, as \"that would send the wrong message.\" Whatever their presumptions about the changes ahead, several senior IAEA officials have secured their positions in the Agency for a period into the post-ElBaradei era. Among those burrowing in are some of the Mission's most frequent and policy-relevant interlocutors (and ElBaradei's high-level troubleshooters), some of whom have not always been helpful to U.S. positions. 12. (C) In early February 2009, Vilmos Cserveny of Hungary, chief of the Office of External Relations and Policy Coordination (EXPO), was promoted to the title of Assistant Director General (ADG) while retaining his function running EXPO. Cserveny shared with DCM that his contract was extended through 2013. The ADG title is considered a \"personal promotion\" according no enhancement of authority, and it would likely return to disuse after Cserveny's tenure. As background, current DG ElBaradei held the same title while he was EXPO chief 1993-7. While Cserveny is viewed as a partisan of ElBaradei, we know him to be a consummate bureaucratic survivor who is likely to tack strongly towards Amano in the new structure. 13. (C) In late 2008, Cserveny's deputy Tariq Rauf of Canada received a personal promotion, from the P-5 to D-l level, and contract extension through 2011. As in the case of his boss, Rauf's job duties remain the same. The practice of granting \"personal\" D ranks to senior P-5 personnel is not uncommon in the Agency. Rauf's title is Head, Verification and Security Policy Coordination within EXPO. Among other duties, he is the coordinator of Secretariat efforts to develop mechanisms for IAEA-administered assurance of nuclear fuel supply to states that may suffer a politically-motivated cutoff, e.g., an international nuclear fuel bank. XXXXXXXXXXXX 14. (C) Among others staying on is the Director of the Office of Legal Affairs, Johan Rautenbach, whose contract in late 2008 was extended through 2011. Cautious to the point of reticence in most settings, Rautenbach generally projects an image of standing apart from the political fray. However, he has been known to render legal opinions in furtherance of his \"client's,\" i.e., ElBaradei's, interest, and involves himself unhelpfully in Agency-internal debates over tactics in the conduct of sensitive safeguards investigations. Rautenbach's Amcit deputy, safeguards expert Laura Rockwood, is also likely to stay on. 15. (SBU) Other key Mission interlocutors will or may move from current roles under a new DG. One significant loss will be that Kwaku Aning of Ghana, who intends to depart the IAEA at the end of 2010. Aning holds the D-2 position as Secretary of the Policy Making Organs (chief interpreters of rules of procedure and the drafters of most chair's or rapporteur's summaries). This is the only D-level position held by a G-77 country. British national Graham Andrew, Special Assistant to the DG for Science and Technology, is under contract through August 2011. He has told Msnoff privately he would like to support the next DG over a transition period and beyond, but would move to other duties in the Agency for the duration of his contract if required. Andrew would need a new contract to stay in the Agency beyond August 2011 to 2013, when he would reach the IAEA retirement age (62). ElBaradei's Chef d'Cabinet, Dutch diplomat Antoine Van Dongen, also has been extended through 2010. Having known ElBaradei since their time together at NYU Law School in the 1970's, Van Dongen is a strong ElBaradei loyalist whose role in an Amano cabinet remains to be determined. Comment and Recommendation -------------------------- 16. (SBU) Mission enjoys an excellent relationship with U.S. DDG Waller and counts him as an asset. He provides insight into Agency operations and is an interpreter and advocate of the Agency to important audiences, for example from the U.S. Congress. Waller has been highly successful in bringing Amcits into positions in his department, though much less so in other departments. In Management the U.S. currently holds two Director positions, one D-1 and one D-2, and five Section Head positions, with a total of 24 Amcits working in the department. The signals from both Waller and DG-designate Amano are that we may rely on Waller remaining in this function for the time being, should Washington so decide. 17. (C) The expected departure of DDG Taniguchi requires that we search for a compelling individual to lead the safety and security department in fashioning and institutionalizing (politically and financially) the IAEA role in combating nuclear terrorism and embedding safety culture in the (potentially) fast-growing global nuclear power sector. The safety and security of nuclear facilities and material around the world over the next ten years will be very important to the U.S., involving potential issues of regional security, energy policy, and growth in the commercial nuclear industry at home and globally. It is in our interest to be directly involved in the selection of a next DDG through whom we can increase the complement of U.S. nationals performing these crucial functions. There are rumors that Canadian Ambassador Marie Gervais-Vidricaire is interested. As she lacks technical experience, this would not be a helpful outcome from the perspective of our subject-matter experts, but the USG could be in an awkward position if confronted with a determined request for support from Ottawa. Also on the Vienna scene there are rumors that France, a country with a heavy technician presence and influence already in the safety and security areas, may move to build upon this predominance. 18. (C) With regard to the DDG/Safeguards, Olli Heinonen, Mission recommends that we remain discrete but open to an extension of his tenure should he seek it and similarly discrete in USG-internal brainstorming on potential successors. Relevant to our deliberations on the Safety and Security as well as Safeguards Departments, ref A examined approaches to staffing, reviewed current opportunities for American citizen employment at professional levels across the Agency, and noted some key positions for which U.S. citizens would not be eligible (due to national balance or traditions against staffing from nuclear weapons states) but where U.S. interests require that competent incumbents fulfill those roles. 19. (C) In weighing replacements for DDGs Cetto and Burkart, leading Technical Cooperation and Nuclear Applications, respectively, we must try to address the overlap in their two Departments that has created stubborn redundancies and inefficiencies. These have not been resolved despite years of investigations, reports, and recommendations. Both Departments have fierce political defenders in the G-77, preventing serious reform efforts (particularly in the case of TC). Mission recommends we pay vigorous attention to the future leadership of these two Departments, as the only way to fix their management will be from the inside.

So it’s time for a summary of events: • Hurricane Sandy has slammed into the US east coast, bringing destructive force despite being recategorised as a post-tropical storm. • The cities of New York and New Jersey have been hit by widespread flooding, strong winds, electrical blackouts and fires. Subway tunnels have been flooded and public transport is at a standstill, schooling is shut down and many parts of the cities remain under water. There has been further damage elsewhere. • More than 10 deaths have been reported across the 13 states most directly affected – the toll is still being counted – and more than 6.5m electricity customers are said to be without power. • Amid the emergency, a hospital in New York was forced to evacuate more than 200 patients when the main power supply and then backup systems failed, leaving some critically ill people on battery-powered life support. • A crew member from the replica tall ship HMS Bounty died when the crew had to abandon ship off the coast of North Carolina. The captain remains missing – the other 14 people were pulled to safety from the sea in a dramatic coast guard rescue operation that braved treacherous conditions. • Sandy had already left a trail of destruction through the Caribbean, killing at least 69 people in countries like Haiti that may struggle to cope with the aftermath. • The day ahead is expected to bring accounts of heavy snowfall in some states – one of the surprise effects of a storm system like Sandy. Thanks – that’s all from me. Over to you, Haroon. It's easy for this story to remain stuck on New York but Pennsylvania is one of the other states that has been hammered, with multiple deaths reported so far – the exact number depends on how you count them. Here's part of an AP report carried by philly.com An 8-year-old Susquehanna County boy died Monday afternoon when a tree limb fell on him in Franklin Township near Montrose, and a 62-year-old Berks County man taking his dogs outside Monday night was standing on the porch of a home in Pike Township near Boyertown when a 60-foot tree toppled onto the structure, killing him. Those cases were not officially deemed storm-related because the counties' coroners hadn't issued reports citing causes of death. The first storm-related death was confirmed in Lancaster County. On Sunday, an elderly man was trimming a tree in Rapho Township in preparation for the storm when a limb broke and he fell to the ground, sustaining multiple injuries. Statewide, more than 1.2 million electric customers lost power by early Tuesday. Officials warned that Sandy, which lost its status as a hurricane Monday evening, remained a dangerous storm that promised to bring power outages that could last for days. Six and a half million customers without power due to Sandy, according to CNN Weather Just about any natural disaster story inevitably comes round to what it means for people's air travel plans. So here's a rundown from the British perspective, with the help of the Press Association. Many holidaymakers are stranded in the US because of Sandy while a large number of tourists due to travel across the Atlantic have been forced to stay at home, with internal US flights also causing problems. A total of 59 flights - 47 departures and 12 arrivals - were cancelled from Heathrow airport on Monday and many scheduled services will not leave the tarmac Tuesday. British Airways axed all of its flights to and from New York, Newark, Baltimore, Washington DC, Boston and Philadelphia, and 11 of today's return flights to and from the East Coast have been cancelled. Flights to and from Boston are planned to operate as normal, the airline has said. BA has said its other US flights are operating normally and the company is also flying as usual to Toronto and Montreal in Canada. Virgin Atlantic had to scrap its East Coast services on Monday, cancelling flights to and from New York, Newark, Boston and Washington. The company also axed flights from Newark and New York that were due to arrive at Heathrow on Tuesday. The damage to the New York/New Jersey subway system is being counted. Here's a statement from Joseph J Lhota, the MTA chairman: As of last night, seven subway tunnels under the East River flooded. Metro-North Railroad lost power from 59th Street to Croton-Harmon on the Hudson Line and to New Haven on the New Haven Line. The Long Island Rail Road evacuated its West Side Yards and suffered flooding in one East River tunnel. The Hugh L. Carey Tunnel is flooded from end to end and the Queens Midtown Tunnel also took on water and was closed. Six bus garages were disabled by high water. We are assessing the extent of the damage and beginning the process of recovery. The New York Times has a good wrap-up of the evacuation we've been following at NYU hospital's Langone medical centre. The centre's backup power systems failed, forcing a big operation to move patients to safety. In some reports this is being referred to as NYU Tisch hospital: Tisch is part of the Langone complex. The sprawling complex in the low 30s near the East River began transporting all 215 patients to other facilities on Monday evening. They were still being transported to other nearby hospitals, including Sloan Kettering and Mt. Sinai, early Tuesday morning, a spokeswoman for the hospital said. “They had to evacuate everybody,” said the spokeswoman, Lorinda Klein, who said the main communications systems at NYU Langone — phones and e-mail — were down. She could not say what had caused the failure of the hospital’s emergency systems, which power critical care units there. It's important to point out that Sandy didn't spontaneously form off the east coast and descend on the US – it had already left a trail of destruction through the Caribbean, killing at least 69 people, according to Jonathan Watts, our Latin America correspondent. Here's an excerpt from his story: As the United States braced for hurricane Sandy, the Caribbean nations that have already faced its fury were burying the dead, finding shelter for the homeless and counting the economic cost of the fiercest winds and rain that many have seen in a decade. Hardest hit is Haiti. Although not directly in the path of the hurricane, the poorest nation in the Americas has confirmed 52 dead and at least a dozen more missing as flimsy buildings were engulfed in mudslides or swept out to sea by flood tides. A worse humanitarian disaster could follow. According to the government in Port-au-Prince, about 200,000 people are homeless, though emergency shelter has only been provided for 17,000. Cuba is also picking up the pieces after extensive loss of life and economic impacts. The Communist party newspaper Granma reported 11 dead and damage to 137,000 homes. It said recovery would take years. Smaller scale fatalities and damage were also reported in Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and the Bahamas, where sea waters surged over coastal barriers to deluge roads and buildings. Venezuela has been among the first to respond to the calls for assistance, providing food, drinking water and equipment to Haiti and Cuba. As many as 11 people have died in the US and Canada as a result of Sandy, according to reports. Reuters has been wrapping up the storm's toll, including one poor woman who became a victim of the deadly combination of floodwaters and electricity: Two people were killed in the New York borough of Queens - a man in a house hit by a falling tree and a woman who stepped into an electrified puddle of water. Massachusetts police said one man was killed in Peabody in an accident related to the bad weather. Toronto police also recorded one death, a woman hit by flying debris. As far as Con Ed denying that its workers were trapped in a power station: Reuters is sticking by its story and one of the workers apparently taken by lifeboat to safety doesn't seem in much doubt about what happened: In lower Manhattan, firefighters used inflatable orange boats to rescue utility workers trapped for three hours by rising floodwaters inside a power substation. One of the Con Ed workers pulled from the floodwater, Angelo Amato, said he was part of a crew who had offered to work through the storm. \"This is what happens when you volunteer,\" he said. Power off for a week in Manhattan? According to the Wall Street journal, elecricity company Consolidated Edison says it was unprepared for the tidal surge that accompanied Sandy, and also by an explosion at a substation. Here's are some excerpts from the WSJ story: John Miksad, senior vice president of electric operations [at Con Edison], said he couldn’t give a clear timetable and still needed to investigate the scope of damage left by the explosion in substation at East 14th Street and F.D.R Drive. That explosion knocked out power to about a quarter-million customers below 39th Street in Manhattan. Con Ed expects to restore power to Lower Manhattan neighborhoods below the Brooklyn Bridge — areas shutdown preemptively Monday evening and not connected to the substation explosion — in three to four days. Who ever thought hurricanes could mean snow? Another dramatic image: floodwaters gushing into Hoboken Path station in New Jersey via an elevator shaft. The image was caught on the Port Authority's CCTV system. Subway lover Bill McKibben has published this lament. To say that disruption to public transport should be expected would seem a colossal understatement. A dreadful sight. Here are some coast guard shots of the foundering HMS Bounty off the coast of North Carolina: The worst part of this story, of course, is not the loss of the famed replica of the notorious Captain Bligh's sailing ship but the death of a crew member and the fact that the captain remains missing at sea. Mercifully the rest of the crew managed to abandon ship and were rescued safely in treacherous conditions. Here's another view of the ill-fated vessel: The New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg, tweets: We're hearing more about that backup power failure and consequent evacuation at NYU hospital. The problem is at the Langone medical centre. Staff tell us 40-45 critical care patients have been evacuated to nearby hospitals. The fire department has confirmed there was no fire at Coney Island hospital, despite some reports. Meanwhile, standard procedure, and we emphasise standard procedure, is being adopted at the Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in New Jersey, with an alert put in place because of rising water levels. The creek remains within safe levels and there is backup power in case a shutdown is required but this would only happen in the most extreme circumstances. Kate Dailey of the BBC has given a rundown in a series of tweets starting with this one: The Nuclear Regulatory Commision spokesman Neil Sheehan has told the BBC there's no reason to \"freak out\": The alert was issued because water in the pumps' intake structure passed(4.5ft), but they still operate in up to 7ft. Even if the water rises that high, the plant can turn to a backup method to cool spent fuel rods. Because the plant has been shut down for a week for scheduled maintenance, there's also much less to be cooled. And if things get really bad, they could shut off the reactor all together - though Sheehan says there's no reason to do so yet. It's Warren Murray here, taking over from Adam Gabbatt. Here's a quick update from Associated Press on some of the states affected: Carolinas US Coast Guard rescues 14 members of HMS Bounty crew. One crew member believed killed and the captain missing from the tall ship. Connecticut Power outages: 381,906. One person killed by falling tree. Most schools to be closed Tuesday along with University of Connecticut. Delaware Power outages: 32,000. Dover Air Force Base being cleared of some aircraft and set up as a disaster response centre. Kentucky Power outages: 50,000. Up to 10 inches could fall in some high areas, a few inches on lower ground. Power crews coming in from Canada to help. Massachusetts Power outages: 400,000. Mandatory evacuations ordered in sections of Dartmouth and Fall River. Voluntary warnings in some other areas. Michigan Power outages: 23,000 New Hampshire Power outages: 100,000. 100 New Hampshire Guard soldiers on active duty. At least 13 shelters opened. New Jersey Power outages: 1.6 million. Widespread flooding and damage. Two people killed when a tree landed on their vehicle. Newark Liberty airport shut down until further notice. New York Power outages: 1.13m due to flood damage and deliberate blackouts to avoid damage. Some floodwater entering New York city subway. Across the state, at least five people killed. All airports closed until further notice. Pennsylvania Power outages: 640,000. A man died Sunday in Lancaster County when he fell while trimming a tree. Virginia Power outages: 123,460 West Virginia Woman killed in road crash after five inches of snow. Conditions expected to be at their worst overnight and early Tuesday before the storm moves on. A Twitter account purporting to be Con Edison has dismissed the Reuters report that its employees were trapped in a power building in Manhattan. The account is unverified. We're trying to check the story with Con Edison, more soon. One potential thing? Reuters reported people were trapped in a building. Con Edison says no people are trapped in a building. Could be nothing but worth pointing out. \"At least 2-3 blocks inland along the western edge of Manhattan, around Hudson Square and the Holland Tunnel, are completely submerged under at least 1-2ft of water,\" writes the Guardian's Laurence Mitchell. There's a heavy police presence by the water's edge, yelling at people to go home. I also saw what appeared to be an abandoned fire truck with its long ladder extended up to a building with lots of damaged scaffolding near Canal St. Incredible sounds of metal twisting and being knocked around. The wind is unbelievably strong, and almost blew me to the ground more than once. I've seen only one restaurant open in West Village called La Villette, serving stranded customers by candle light. Very romantic I thought. Remember that building that the front fell off of in Manhattan? Here's a video of the front falling off. Thanks to Slate. Reuters is reporting that nineteen workers were trapped inside a Con Edison power station on the east side of Manhattan by rising floodwaters. The news agency cited a witness but did not say whether the workers were still trapped or if they had managed to get out. Reuters says that a rescue worker said the station had suffered an explosion inside. In a statement tonight New York City's mayor Mike Bloomberg said patients are having to be evacuated from NYU hospital after its back up generator failed. He said the failure came despite assurances it had been tested. Patients are now being moved out of the hospital. Kathryn Schulz from New York Magazine has more information: An update from New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo: In Washington DC around 180,000 homes are without power, according to the Washington Post. The newspaper's live blog reports gusts of 60mph at Reagan National Airport. \"Sandy not all bad news. The obnoxious Lyndon LaRouche's DC press conference has had to be postponed,\" writes Ewen Macaskill. LaRouche, who supporters carry pictures of Obama with a Hitler moustache, had been planning a press conference at the National Press Club in DC. But Sandy has forced it to be abandoned, even if temporarily. At the press conference, LaRouche was call for the impeachment of Obama over the Benghazi killings. \"Obama's blatant complicity with the British and Saudi monarchies, as dramatised in the Benghazi killings, not only threatens to unleash a \"9/11 Two,\" but puts the world on a pathway to a thermonuclear World War III,\" according to a statement from his organisation. Many people have reported witnessing bright lights in the sky over Manhattan due to an explosion at the ConEdison plant at 14th Street on the east side of the city. It appears this video, unconfirmed but widely shared, captured that moment. It's dramatic. New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg has just given a brief statement asking people to stay indoors and to refrain from calling 911 unless the matter is serious. \"Don't call 911 unless it is a life-threatening emergency,\" he said. He warned people to \"stay off the roads, as you getting stuck\" just keeps emergency vehicles from getting to people who need them. Bloomberg said he hopes most people will have power back by tomorrow. Earlier in the day Bloomberg suggested people call 911 to report downed trees and other minor damage. But now 10,000 calls are coming in an hour, Bloomberg said. Usually the emergency services receive 1,000 calls an hour. The mayor said that much of the flooding will recede with the tide. We should begin to see a lessening in floodwater around midnight. The bulk of the rain has passed and moved to our west, the mayor says. \"So we don't anticipate anything more than a few showers from now on.\" He adds that people should \"stay away from windows close the drapes\". \"Most people have been cooperative and taken our advice. Not everyone has cooperated.\" \"Sandy made landfall right around Atlantic City, New Jersey, which it's where most forecasts predicted. Most forecasts also spoke about historic conditions and New York City, and it's safe to say that many of the most dire prediction are coming true,\" writes the Guardian's weather expert Harry Enten. The all time record tide since 1821 has already been broken with a 14 feet of tide thanks to the surge. The tide is likely to recede and get slightly better, but you should not take that as a sign that things are getting much better. Power has been shut off in southern Manhattan, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and in many of the New York suburbs. Power outages are likely to grow. We can expect flooding to continue along coastal areas as we will see yet another high tide in the morning. Many rivers in New Jersey and Pennsylvania will also peak. This tide will not be nearly as bad as what we are experiencing right now. Winds will continue to wrap around the system with 50+ mile per hour gusts lasting through the morning in New York and much of the northern mid-atlantic. 40+ gusts could last through Tuesday evening. After the morning high tide around 8 am, conditions will get likely get considerably better along the coast. Rain will not be an issue for those along the coast. Rain will be an issue further inland into Western Pennsylvania. Blizzard conditions will continue in West Virginia where reports of 3 feet of snow are possible. It will be snowing through Wednesday. Overall, this is a historic storm. It's also one that has been very well forecasted. Please stay safe and heed warnings from the National Weather Service. Water is entering the subway tunnels in lower Manhattan, a spokesman for the MTA has told the Guardian. \"There is water is entering in lower Manhattan right now,\" the spokesman said just now. He said the MTA \"don't have any specifics\" as to which tunnels and where water is entering at this time. Rumours have been circulated that the MTA has announced the subway will be closed until Friday. This is false, the spokesman said. \"Not that is absolutely not true,\" he said. \"We never gave a date. We have to do an assessment damage, we have to repair the damage and then service will be restored. But there has never been a date associated with that.\" He said MTA workers should probably be able to begin assessing the damage on Tuesday. \"Once the winds have died down and it's ok to go out and do a complete assessment and inspection they'll determine on a case by case basis when service should be resumed.\" Battery tunnel is also flooded, a MTA spokeswoman said. The MTA has said rumours of fires in subway tunnels are false. Over one million people are now without power in New Jersey, according to the Wall Street Journal. The newspaper reports that 1,136,657 customers are without electricity. Around 250,000 people are without power in Connecticut. Sandy struck New Jersey with winds of 80 mph, according to CBS. The storm had earlier washed away parts of the Atlantic City boardwalk in the state. Earlier Christie criticised Atlantic City's mayor Lorenzo Langford for supposedly telling residents not to evacuate. (Langford did infact say people should leave.) Areas in lower Manhattan are flooded, including Battery Park and neighbourhoods close to the East River. Alphabet City looks to have been severely impacted, with floodwater extending to Avenue C there. Mandatory evacuation was in place close to that street, where various people are tweeting pictures flood pictures. Guardian reader Ysabella Hincapie Gara sends this picture of flooding at 510 E 23rd street in Manhattan. This is Adam Gabbatt taking over from Matt Wells, who has lost power in Tribeca. The man died when a tree fell on his house in Queens, according to a fire official. His death is the first to be reported in New York City as a result of Sandy. There are various reports that the man lived on 166th Street in East Flushing. Sandy has now made landfall on the coast of New Jersey. WCBS reporter Alex Silverman following the flooding in Lower Manhattan, where many streets are under water now, making it difficult for the emergency services to respond to calls, particularly in the Wall Street and the appropriately named Water Street areas. The New York Stock Exchange remains closed tomorrow. The NOAA has now designated Sandy a post-tropical storm. But that doesn't necessarily mean its effects will be any less damaging: Weather Underground is reporting a rising storm tide of over 12ft at the Battery in Lower Manhattan, the most vulnerable part of the city. If the tide gets too high, the city subway is at significant risk of flooding. If a comedian tells a joke, and there's no one there to laugh, does it make a sound? David Letterman taped his show tonight without a studio audience. Half a million customers are without power now in southern New England, the Weather Channel reports, taking the total around the region to 2.2m. The main electricity supplier in New York, ConEdison, has just cut power to the Financial District in Lower Manhattan. That may be the reason why the websites of a number of media organisations based in the city, including Huffington Post, Buzzfeed and Gawker, are all down or serving pages only sporadically. We'd like to welcome refugees of these websites to the Guardian live blog. Er, Kim Kardashian has kittens. Here's a before/after picture of the damaged building. More details are emerging of what appears to be a partial building collapse in Manhattan. Reports from the scene say the building's facade has fallen off, and that the Fire Department were able to get everyone out of the building safely. This from Meg Robertson, a producer at HuffPostLive, the video service of Huffington Post. There's some dramatic news from Manhattan. The New York fire department has reported a \"multiple dwelling building collapse\" on Eighth Avenue, apparently at 92. We're checking out these reports now. Our reporter Adam Gabbatt has been out in Manhattan this afternoon and reports more treacherous conditions as Sandy approaches. The East River Park, in east Manhattan, is exposed to wind sweeping up the river and has been closed off by police. Nevertheless, there were a handful of people who were testing themselves against the conditions at around 3pm, despite gusts strong enough to send passersby into a light trot. Many were sent scampering, however, when a prolonged windy spell brought down several large branches from the park's trees. Driving through Manhattan early signs of damage are becoming apparent. In Soho police closed off a section of Broadway where it appeared scaffolding had fallen from a building, some of the debris littering the road. On a parallel street police dinghies were stacked in a trailer, the NYPD clearly preparing for worst case scenarios. The streets are largely deserted, save for police cars and a few taxis. A few people are out braving the wind, including many dog walkers, while the number of people carrying around umbrellas that have been blown inside out is unusually high. The promenade at Battery Park was flooded at high tide this morning and is particularly vulnerable to a storm surge at high tide this evening. TV news crews are gathered at this southern tip of Manhattan, cameras pointed out to the New York harbor, where the Statue of Liberty can only just be seen through the spray, rain and wind. Just as at the East River, the park is closed, although journalists are allowed to remain at their own risk. Expect to see plenty of pictures of water flooding into the area later tonight. Watch also this video that Adam filmed with Laurence Topham behind the lens. One of the two missing crew members of the replica ship the Bounty, which ran into trouble off the coast of North Carolina early today, has been found. The Coast Guard said the body of a woman, 42-year-old Claudene Christian, had been recovered. CNN says her body is apparently \"unresponsive\". She is being rushed to hospital. The Bounty sent out a distress call at 6.30pm yesterday, when the crew reported she was taking on more water than the pumps could push out. The crew made plans to stay on the ship overnight and to abandon it at 8am this morning. But in the event, the crew were forced to leave the ship at 4am this morning. Three crew members were washed overboard at this time. One was recovered alive, soon afterwards. Rescuers continue to search for the ship's captain, Robin Walbridge, 63. • Hurricane Sandy is approaching landfall near Cape May, New Jersey, on the state's southern coastline. Hurricane-force winds, rainfall and the approaching high tide present life-threatening risks of flooding and other damage. • More than a dozen states have begun to feel the destructive impact of the storm. An estimated 1 million-plus people have lost power from North Carolina to New Hampshire. Catastrophic flooding has hit coastal towns, where mandatory evacuations were in effect. • Authorities warn that power outages, flooding, wind damage and other impacts from the storm have just begun. Officials warned residents to prepare for a possible 36-hour wait for the storm to clear. • In addition to flooding risks presented by the high tide, up to 10 inches of rainfall in some areas combined with limited mobility on the part of emergency services pose severe inland flooding risks. An estimated 2-3 feet of snow is expected to fall in West Virginia, with more than a foot of snow elsewhere inland. • A hotel was evacuated in New York City after a partial crane collapse. Con Edison announced probable preemptive power outages in Manhattan and South Brooklyn. Most major bridges in the New York City area will close as of 7pm ET. • The HMS Bounty sunk off the coast of North Carolina. Two of 16 crew members are missing. • Major climactic effect extend as far as Lake Erie and beyond. Indian Point, the nuclear plant north of the city, is being watched closely for possible flooding, officials announce. The Indian Point Energy Facebook page says the plant \"is protected up to about 15’ 3” above mean sea level and even then we could take mitigating actions to further enhance our protections.\" In a briefing shown by CNN moments ago, the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, had some harsh words for residents of Atlantic City and the Barrier Islands who decided to ignore his mandatory evacuation order – and for its mayor, Lorenzo Langford. For some reason the mayor, in his initial conversations with the public, said he didn't want 'his people' to leave Atlantic City, so you have people staying, self-sheltering in their homes or staying in city shelters, one of which is a block away from the bay – in a school, which is now flooded completely. For those of you on the Barrier Islands who decided it was a better idea to ride this out than to evacuate, for those elected officials who decided to ignore my admonition, this is now your responsibilty. If you can still hear me, we need you to hunker down and get to the highest point possible in the dwelling that you're in. We will not be able to come and help you until daylight tomorrow. We haven't been able yet to find the Lorenzo quote that irked Christie. In fact, Lorenzo advised residents to leave for the mainland on Sunday. But there is no love lost between Christie, a Republican, and Lorenzo, a Democrat who is Atlantic City's second African American mayor. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has provided an update on Sandy. The head of Con Edison announced probable preemptive power outages in Manhattan and possibly in South Brooklyn. Affected areas lie between Broadway and the East River, south of the Brooklyn Bridge. Also possible in the Coney Island area of Brooklyn. Bloomberg said Public transportation including subways and buses will be closed tomorrow morning and are likely to remain closed throughout the day. A hotel has been evacuated near the crane collapse, he said. The mayor apologizes for any inconvenience. The surge will be highest at roughly 8:15, he says. It will last till about 10:30pm ET. If you are in a home or inside somewhere secure, stay there, he said. The time to relocate is over. There have been more than 1,000 reports of fallen trees in the city, he said. A jogger was struck by a falling limb near Prospect Park and was hospitalized, he said. She is fine. \"I can't emphasize enough: stay indoors.\" He said the police wrote \"a couple\" tickets to surfers today. \"The FDR is either open or closed depending whether that part is flooded,\" he said. He reiterates bridge closures. The big bridges over the east river and to Staten Island will be closed at 7pm, as announced earlier by the governor. \"Our advice is try to relax and spend the night in.\" Guardian US forecaster Harry Enten takes a look at what to expect: Hurricane Sandy is about to land. It will hit somewhere around Cape May with 90 mile per hour winds. What else can we expect over the next few hours? First, hurricane force winds are expected anywhere from central New Jersey down to Maryland. Hurricane gusts will be seen up into New York City and down to Virginia. There are already 1 million power outages, and this will climb in the coming hours. Second, rain amounts will continue to pile up. We're looking at rainfall totals that will likely exceed 10 inches in Delaware into Maryland. Rainfall amounts will likely not be great in New York City. Third, high tide is still on its way. Even if it is not as bad as expected in New York City, the worst is still to come. Do not be stupid and go outside. Fourth, snow will continue to fall in the Appalachians and will approach and perhaps exceed 3 feet in some areas when it's all said and done. Fifth, inland areas is beginning to start to get into the rain and tropical storm force winds. Our Washington bureau chief Ewen MacAskill reports on the increasingly blustery scene in the capital: DC up until the last hour has felt much like many other wet day. But in the last hour gusts are beginning to pick up in strength, enough to make those who have been sceptical about Sandy to have a rethink. At Reagan airport, the highest recorded gust has been 52mph around 5pm But it seems inevitable they are going to become stronger. There are few pedestrians in the streets but still a trickle of cars, headlamps on, crawling along in extremely poor light. Most shops and offices in Georgetown are closed, with non-essential staff having been told to stay at home or having been sent home early. Even places where there are 'essential' staff, such as Georgetown Hospital, seem to be thinning out. Its carpark would normally be full at this time of day but is near empty. The mayor, Vince Gray, has sent out a message saying not only all schools but all federal offices will be closed Tuesday. In his latest message, he said tweeted: \"We're trying to get everyone to understand the seriousness of this... and to stay off the streets.\" The DC courts are to be closed Tuesday too. It has been raining since at least dawn and, with the worst expected still to come, flooding looks like it is going to be major problem. There are already electricity black-outs and, with these gusts, there are bound to be more. Unlike most cities in the developed world, Washington's powerlines are above ground, running in some places not that high off the ground, intermingled with trees, making them vulnerable when trees or even branches fall. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter announced that city offices will remain closed on Tuesday. The mayor said that 300 people are now in city shelters after evacuating from low-lying areas. Alexander Hotz is in Gowanus, Brooklyn, where the neighborhood's namesake canal is even greener than usual -- and on the rise. Alexander talks to locals coming out to take a look: Artist Joelle Shallon, 58, owns a studio near the Carroll St. bridge. Shallon said that the water level was unusually high, especially since it was still low tide. \"This is as high as it usually gets,\" said Shallon, who has lived in the neighborhood since 1978. \"If it gets any higher I've been told to expect my building to loose electricity.\" Mia Harris, 44, was working at a local taxi service just a few doors down from the canal. Harris had come from Coney Island where she was evacuated from her Zone A apartment building. Harris, though, was not worried about her apartment and more her daughter who might go into labor soon. \"She's having pains now. It would be my first grandchild and born in a storm,\" said Harris. \"Would you believe I had my daughter in '96 during the blizzard.\" Harris's coworker Dorothy Taylor, 48, had also come out to the bridge to see the water level. \"It's just getting higher,\" said Taylor. \"And I'm just prayin.\" Sandy is expected to make landfall within the hour. At 5pm ET the center of the storm was 30 miles off the coast of Cape May, New Jersey, and the storm was traveling at 28mph, according to the latest update from the National Hurricane Center. Sandy remains a high-end Category 1 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph. Storm surge predictions from Maryland to Rhode Island remain at 4-8 feet, with storm surge in New York harbor predicted to get as high as 11 feet. Snowfall accumulation of 2-3 feet is expected in West Virginia. Between one and two feet of snow is expected for parts of Virginia and North Carolina. The storm is bringing tropical storm force winds --in purple -- to an unprecedented swath of the northeast. The storm is slamming the entire eastern seaboard north of North Carolina with a tropical storm. The Guardian's Karen McVeigh is in Red Hook, Brooklyn. The flooding has subsided in the last couple of hours; residents say most of it was from the high tide, she reports: The wind is gusting and picking up. I just saw a couple who had wandered down to the pier wall clutch each other as a gust almost knocked them off their feet. A lone police car is cruising around but no one seems to be trying to further persuade residents to leave. Police knocked on doors last night in the area, handing out notices warning residents if they didn't leave they may be subject to being charged with a misdemeanour. Those who have not yet left this area- a Zone A mandatory evacuation zone - and that appears to be many many people - say they know where the water goes and what to look out for. Ron Kyle, owner of Dry Dock Wine and Spirits is still open for business but plans to shut up shortly. He's had a steady stream of locals all day. \"We've had a good day\" he says. Kyle, who lives locally, is staying put. He moved all his basement supers to higher ground and will hope for the best. \"Whatever happens, happens\" he says. \"We've been down here for a number of years and a number of storms. I'm not freaking out thinking there will be a wall of water coming down the street. We will be watching the tide later. If things get really bad we've got bags packed and a place to go.\" New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has a message for all the children who follow him on Twitter. Maryland Closure of the main bridge across the Chesapeake Bay because of high winds from Hurricane Sandy. (wunderground.com). 450 national guard members deployed throughout the state. Closing state government tomorrow except for essential personnel. No early voting Tuesday. -Gov. Martin O'Malley Pennsylvania Non-essential government employees to stay home tomorrow.

Storm surge at Battery Park up to 6.3 feet. 14 evacuated from Fire Island. Majority of National Guard deployments to Long Island. New Hampshire Sandy is now 28 miles off the coast of New Jersey and is expected to make landfall in two hours, according to the National Hurricane Center. But because of the nature of the storm, with the winds fanning far out from the centre, winds are already lashing the New Jersey coast. A mandatory curfew has been put in place for a second night in Atlantic City, New Jersey, home to a big casino scene. The curfew starts at 6pm. The area is already being affected by very high winds and flooding. The show, it seems, will not go on tonight in New York. All Broadway theaters have cancelled their shows, and now Comedy Central has announced that it has pulled taping of the Daily Show and the Colbert Report. It's a blow – if there was any day that cable news deserved to be sent up, it's today. Jeremy Cliffe at the Economist has sent this picture of the partial crane collapse at West 57th Street in New York. You can see how precarious the situation is. Police are on the scene and are keeping people clear of the street below. Jeremy writes: We have just been for a brisk stroll in Midtown East – small objects (trash, doormats) are whizzing around and people are leaning into the heavier gusts of wind. The streets are nearly deserted. Most of those out are members of the emergency services – and homeless people bunked down in doorways. Worryingly, municipal promises to up the city homeless outreach patrols have evidently failed to bring all those sleeping rough into the shelters. A vast crane on the new skyscraper \"157\" (the tallest residential building in the city) in construction on West 57th Street has buckled right over and is dangling precariously over the side of the building. Dozens of emergency vehicles have rushed to close off the street below. We were in New York City during Hurricane Irene last year – this already looks like a much larger storm. The replica ship the Bounty, which was abandoned by its crew off the coast of North Carolina earlier today, is reported to have sunk, according ot the US Coast Guard. Two of the 16 crew members are still missing. Here's the latest from Reuters: \"The vessel is reportedly sunk, but the mast is still visible,\" the Coast Guard said, adding that it went down in 18-foot (5-metre) seas. The 14 survivors were flown to a Coast Guard air station in North Carolina and were reported to have \"no life threatening injuries.\" The air search was continuing for the two missing crew members and a Coast Guard Cutter was en route to assist with the search. The Daily Mail's story reminds us that the Bounty was used in films such as Pirates of the Caribbean and Mutiny on the Bounty, and has a good collection of pictures. As the Coast Guard steps up its search, we must hope against hope that the missing crew members are found. This is Matt Wells taking over from Tom McCarthy. I've just been out in Lower Manhattan and the wind is picking up, whipping around the skyscrapers of the Financial District and causing an eerie, constant whistling sound. Meanwhile uptown, the wind has caused the partial collapse of a crane at a construction site at 157 West 57th Street (not 1 West 57th Street, as the tweet below implies). This picture from the executive producer of the Piers Morgan show on CNN shows the damage. Guardian US forecaster Harry Enten explains why Sandy has accelerated, and what are the likely consequences. The storm has transitioned from tropical to extra-tropical storm, he writes: The difference between a tropical storm and an extratropical storm is not something that most people ever have to worry about. Tropical storms usually form in the tropics and have warm cores, while extratropical storms form further north and have cold cores. But in the case of Sandy, the difference is important. Extratropical storms move at a faster pace, so that's why the storm is speeding up right now. Extratropical storms are wider in nature. In Sandy's case, this means that the 940 millibar low of Sandy isn't producing winds of 111+ mile per hour winds at its core. Instead those winds are spread out over a wider distance. That means less extreme damage in the immediate path of the storm, but effects over a larger area. By moving faster, Sandy's rainfall may be somewhat lesser in some areas. Sandy also looks to come aboard before high tide. The wind field may be more west oriented in nature instead of northeast. Thus, New York City, which is to the northeast of the storm, may benefit from two factors that may limit the worst coastal flooding. Above is the location of Sandy at 2pm as tracked by the National Hurricane Center. Because the storm has picked up speed, landfall could be earlier than expected, in the early evening, well before high tide in New York harbor at 8:53pm ET. The storm was 175 miles from NYC and 110 miles from Atlantic City, NJ. \"The center of Sandy is expected to make landfall along or just south of the southern New jersey coast by early evening, the advisory says. The Guardian's Adam Gabbatt is speaking with people in and around the evacuation zone in Manhattan. Zuri Carr was one of a few people out and about on Avenue D, right on the border of a mandatory evacuation zone, on Monday morning: Sha Liu lives close to an evacuation zone in Manhattan. She was out for a stroll in a very blustery East River Park on Monday morning. Video also features the police telling everyone to leave the park The Guardian's Karen McVeigh has spoken with residents in the evacuation zone in Red Hook, Brooklyn who have opted to stay put for now: Many of Red Hooks residents are staying put or at least leaving their decision on whether to evacuate till later in the day. Mary Kyle, a businesswoman In her fifties said she had taken every precaution she could from stocking up on batteries to moving everything from the basement to the first floor. A group of friends greet her on her doorstep and they gather briefly to gaze at the water level in the storm drain a few feet from her house. It is high, maybe three or four feet from the street. She is most worried about storm surges she said. \"I've got my go-bag I've got a car and I can go to my brothers in Cobble Hill. I haven't decided yet\" she said. \"But we're at 11ft here it's not gonna get to 11ft\". She tells her friends:\"Have you had the cops knock on your door yet? They came here last night and said if they had to come back they'd be really pissed.\" The Guardian's Alexander Hotz finds flood precautions in the Gowanus neighborhood, at 2nd St. and Bond Ave, not far from the namesake canal: Alexander reports: The wind is very strong in Gowanus, tossing leaves and garbage down streets. Rain remains fairly light but puddles are growing on most streets surrounding the canal. Police have blocked off one lane on 9th street as large puddles are starting to form near the 9th street bridge. Most local businesses are closed and those that are not are scrambling to prepare for the storm. A PathMark grocery store on 12th street is just a few feet from the canal's rising water. Marcus Henry, 50, a manager at the store said that he had never seen the water as high as it is now, but he isn't worried. The store has fortified its entrances and exits with sandbags. Local resident Elizabeth Barrett also said she was concerned. Although the Gowanus resident lives close to the canal, she's on high ground, in Zone C. Con Edison has robo-called some customers in Manhattan saying they may shut down power in parts of Manhattan due to flooding. The message warned customers to turn off major electrical appliances to prevent damage when power is restored. It was unclear whether customers were supposed to shut off appliances immediately or were to do so in the event of an outage. Guardian US forecaster Harry Enten observes that Hurricane Sandy has picked up considerable speed as it approaches the coast, going against most forecasts. Here's Harry: Proving that it still has surprises, Hurricane Sandy is unexpectedly speeding up to 25 to 30 miles per hour. What type of practical effects will this have? First, the storm could hit Southern New Jersey far earlier than planned. Instead of 8 pm to midnight, we could be looking at a landfall around 5 pm eastern. Expect conditions to rapidly deteriorate from here on out up and down the coast. Second, the storm has a possibility of slamming into southern New Jersey with low end category 2 hurricane winds of 96 miles per hour. Sandy already has max winds of 90 miles per hour and seems to be strengthening. This will lead to more wind damage and could help allow Sandy to hold onto tropical storm force winds even further inland than expected. Third, it's possible that rain amounts could lessen because the storm may exit more quickly. We should still see those 10 or 12 inch lollypop totals, but the wider 3-6 inch totals may be more limited. Either way, flooding will still be bad. We'll have to keep an eye on Sandy as it may have more tricks up its sleeve yet. While flooding on the coasts is getting a lot of attention right now, some of the worst devastation from Sandy could come from inland flooding caused by days of rain. Here is the most recent NOAA map with rainfall predictions for the next five days. Most of Maryland is looking at 8-10 inches of rain. Washington DC and Baltimore are going to be very wet places to live this week. In West Virginia, the forecast for 6 inches of rain could produce several feet of snowfall. Welcome to our continuing coverage of Hurricane Sandy. Our previous live blog coverage, starting this morning and ending with President Obama's speech moments ago, is here. Here's a summary of where things stand: • Hurricane Sandy is within 200 miles of the New Jersey coast, with maximum sustained winds of 90mph. Landfall is expected this evening. A coastal flood warning and hurricane warning are in effect. • President Barack Obama has warned of a \"big and powerful storm\". In a briefing at the White House, he warned residents up and down the US east coast to heed the warnings of officials and take Sandy seriously. • Significant flooding has already been reported. The public safety director for Atlantic City said much of the city is underwater. Ocean City, Maryland has been equally hard hit. In Delaware, 50,000 people are under an evacuation order. • Flooding is expected to peak in New York City between 6pm and 10.30pm, as the high tide coincides with landfall. Officials say the flooding is likely to far exceed that from Hurricane Irene last year. • Public transportation across the region is at a standstill. Schools are closed. Some businesses are open. West Virginia residents braced for what could be several feet of snow. Wide power outages from wind damage and fallen trees are expected. • Thousands have lost power in Virginia and Maryland. Power outages have also been reported in Connecticut and Rhode Island. • The US Coastguard had to rescue the crew of a tall ship, HMS Bounty, which got into distress 90 miles from the North Carolina shore. Fourteen crew members were flown to safety, but two remain unaccounted for, according to latest reports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/may/20/national-grid-rights-issue","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-20T18:55:22Z","webTitle":"National Grid's green revamp will add £4 to energy bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/20/national-grid-rights-issue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/may/20/national-grid-rights-issue","fields":{"headline":"National Grid's green revamp will add £4 to energy bills","bodyText":"National Grid revealed today that new investment in a greener energy infrastructure will cost the average UK household an extra £4 a year on energy bills. The group, which runs Britain's electricity and gas networks, announced it would ask investors for £3.2bn in a rights issue next month as it steps up spending to £22bn over the next five years, from £14bn in the past five. Three-quarters of the total will be spent in the UK. The two-shares-for-five rights issue is heavily discounted at 335p and took the City by surprise. Finance director Steve Lucas explained that the company needed more equity to maintain its stable credit ratings in light of the ramped-up capital spending. Lucas said: \"This is a very major investment to get a major upgrade to the system to make it fit for the energy revolution.\" The company has worked out that the cost, which will be passed on to its clients, the energy companies, and ultimately to households, will be just £4 per average customer a year. \"That's pretty good value,\" said Lucas. Transmission only makes up 5% of household bills. The move came as the new government set out the full details of its coalition agreement. It wants to increase the 15% target for energy from renewable sources, subject to advice from the climate change committee. The measures announced include an offshore electricity grid to support a \"new generation of offshore wind power\" and promoting energy from waste through anaerobic digestion. The government also hopes to roll out a new smart meters scheme to boost the number of homes with the energy-saving devices, which will be supported by the creation of a smart grid. A full feed-in tariff system to encourage renewable energy is planned, as well as a network of charging stations for electric cars. The creation of a green investment bank was also confirmed, along with \"green financial products\" to encourage infrastructure investment. The shift to a low-carbon energy system \"requires much greater investment in the electricity and gas transmission networks to deal with a very different flow of energy on the networks,\" said analysts at Morgan Stanley. \"We believe the broad principles set out in the Con-Lib coalition agreement are supportive of this evolution, and therefore are supportive of the need to invest materially in transmission networks.\" National Grid will spend an extra £5.6bn, including the proceeds from the rights issue, on replacing its ageing network and infrastructure in the UK to help the government meet its carbon emission reduction targets. About £2.8bn has been earmarked for nine major projects to link up nuclear power and offshore wind farms in Suffolk, Somerset and Wales. A further £1bn will be spent on \"rewiring\" London and Birmingham – building deep-bore cable tunnels to replace the old system – and another £1bn on \"other opportunities\" such as installing new cables from Scotland to England and further gas interconnectors. The remaining £800m will go towards reinforcing the gas network to secure the country's liquefied gas supply from abroad. The investment programme is expected to create 5,000 new jobs. Lucas hailed the new spending plans as a \"very big step up\". He added: \"We're replatforming National Grid to a bigger company, with much bigger investments.\" The group is ramping up capital spending to £5bn a year from £3 to £3.5bn in the past. National Grid also announced annual profits of £2.2bn for last year, up from £1.4bn the previous year. There has been a debate over whether to move to a low-carbon system through developing the national infrastructure or investing in micro-generation. In recent years the Labour government came under heavy criticism for delaying decisions on energy generation and distribution, and for failing to encourage micro-generation. Lucas said he saw the coalition agreement as \"very supportive\" in terms of greening up the economy. Analysts at Nomura said: \"We think the rights issue will be well supported and will remove one of the overhangs on the shares. We expect all the additional capital expenditure to be growth- and value-enhancing. Hence any initial adverse reaction to the announcement may be short-lived.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/nov/30/tritium-in-water-cooler-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-30T19:48:03Z","webTitle":"Worker blamed for nuclear leak at Indian plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/30/tritium-in-water-cooler-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/nov/30/tritium-in-water-cooler-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"Worker blamed for nuclear leak at Indian plant","bodyText":"Authorities investigating the deliberate leaking of a radioactive substance into drinking water at an Indian atomic plant say a disgruntled worker could be behind the safety scare. The state-owned atomic power company launched an inquiry into how radioactive tritium seeped into a water cooler and remained at levels dangerous enough to make 55 employees ill after they drank the contaminated water. Urine samples found workers at the Kaiga nuclear power plant, in the southern state of Karnataka, had unusually high levels of radioactivity in their bodies. Anil Kakodkar, chairman of India's atomic energy commission, said the contamination was an \"inside job\", adding: \"Someone has deliberately done this. Those who are involved would be punished under the Atomic Energy [Act] and other acts after investigation.\" Investigators are believed to be concentrating on 15 employees. The Kaiga plant consists of heavy water reactors – which store tritium and recover the element for later use. The plant has four reactors, only three of which are operational. Authorities attempted to allay public fears, saying that no one was taken to hospital. The plant's director, JP Gupta, said the leak had \"not affected public, safety, health and environment\". The Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, played down the incident, saying it was a \"small matter of contamination\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/14/at-a-glance-guide-germany","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-14T15:08:13Z","webTitle":"At-a-glance guide to Germany","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/14/at-a-glance-guide-germany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/14/at-a-glance-guide-germany","fields":{"headline":"At-a-glance guide to Germany","bodyText":"Population Germany is Europe's most populous nation, home to about 82 million people. That might be a dreadful squash were it not also one of Europe's biggest countries - and were the birth rate not plummeting. Approximately 160,000 more people die in Germany each year than are born and there are 16.7 million over-65s, though immigration keeps the population pretty constant. As a result of its postwar gastarbeiter (guest worker) recruitment drive, every fifth person now has a \"migration background\": they or their forebears moved to Germany since 1949. At the last count, around 2.8 million Turks and almost 96,000 Brits were living in Germany, and the average baby could expect to live to 81. Religion Officially Christian, with 34% of Germans saying they are Catholic and the same percentage Protestant. There are now just over 104,000 practising Jews out of a total of approximately 240,000 living in Germany, and an estimated 4 million Muslims. Given the main party in the ruling coalition is Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, it is no surprise that the government supports what might be called Christian values. There are big tax breaks for getting married, and there is no legal right to abortion on demand (though in practice, it is unpunishable with a foetus up to 12 weeks). Getting baptised can be an expensive business, as churches are allowed to tax members 8% or 9% of their income tax once they come of age. Geography Germany is one of Europe's most beautiful and varied countries, but most Brits are too busy holidaying in France and Spain to have noticed. It has a surprising 1,500 miles of stunning coastline along what we call the Baltic Sea, but which the Germans confusingly refer to as the Ostsee (East Sea). It has numerous lakes, including the popular Bodensee in the south, which Anglophones know as Lake Constance. Then there are the vineyards of the Franconia region of Bavaria, Alpine mountains in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and natural springs around the Black Forest in Baden-Württemberg. Germany also has a lot of neighbours: it borders Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland. Economy Bafflingly successful, even to native economists. Initially, the country with the world's fourth largest GDP struggled with the recession like everyone else. Employment figures remained fairly stable, however, and in 2010 Germany enjoyed the largest growth since the country was reunified in 1989. Many attribute this to the family-run companies that specialise in quality engineering, churning out anything from solar power panels to rollercoaster parts. A strong apprenticeship system and a history of guild-based crafts guarantees that Germany's reputation for quality craftsmanship remains unsurpassed. With economic confidence at a high, there has been some disgruntlement with the bailouts of struggling eurozone economies such as those of Greece and Ireland. It's worth bearing in mind, though, that Germans are notoriously thrifty and, until that changes, the country's status as export kings (second only to China) continues to rely on happy shoppers abroad. Government Frankly too complicated even for many Germans to get their heads around properly. Parliament is made up of a lower house, the Bundestag, which is voted directly every four years, and an upper house, the Bundesrat - made up of locally elected representatives from the 16 länder, or regions. The Bundestag can cook up new laws, while the Bundesrat can pass or veto them. Just to make things more complicated, there is also not just one but two federal law courts which can put laws up for judicial review. Given this laborious setup, passing laws in Germany takes time - which means politicians think thrice before even considering changing legislation, and German governments tend to be rather stable affairs. It's different at municipal level, and minor laws can vary wildly. Ask the landlord before you light a cigarette in a pub. Intellectual life Until a recent law change, students could take as long as they liked to finish a degree, dabbling in whichever subjects they fancied and postponing their exams if they didn't quite feel up to it when the day came. And with negligible tuition fees, who can blame them? This has resulted in swaths of broadly educated individuals who are used to thinking very long and hard about things. Go to a pub with a bunch of Germans, and you are far more likely to talk about the big questions in life than who deserves to get to the next round of The X Factor (or rather, Deutschland Sucht den Superstar). Poets and novelists such as enfants terribles Daniel Kehlmann and Helene Hegemann are more likely to garner column inches than televisual highlights, though the reverence for poets and thinkers that led to the near-deification of Günter Grass, Jürgen Habermas et al seems to be on the wane. Character Germans can be quite literal, straight-forward people. If you ask if they wouldn't possibly mind moving their bag from that spare train seat, and they would rather not, they will tell you. They are not afraid to interfere in others' business if they feel they know better and do not fear admonishing their fellow citizens, whether for crossing the road on red or daring to talk in the sauna. Most Germans do as they are told, which is why there are no barriers at tube stations, and being caught with no ticket (schwarzfahren) is a big social no-no. They are not prudish or squeamish, and will feel no shame telling you about their durchfall (diarrhoea) or getting their kit off by a lake or even municipal park in summer. They are also dreadful hypochondriacs who place such unshakeable faith in doctors that a quite astonishing 50% of all German GPs fob patients off with placebos, according to a recent study. And yes, they are still punctual. If you are invited to dinner at eight and don't show up until half past, don't blame us if you miss the starter. Food and drink The German passion for all things porcine is perhaps only rivalled by Spain - another place where vegetarians are advised to point out they don't eat pork either. Sausages are still a national passion, with each region taking great pride in its own variety, from the faintly obscene Thuringian schlongs to the ketchup-smothered currywursts of Berlin. Though vegetarianism is on the increase, Germans are still not great vegetable eaters, preferring great hits of carbohydrates such as the southern German speciality of spätzle, a sort of worm-like pasta usually smothered in cheese and bacon bits, or huge slabs of cake, enjoyed at all times of day. Asparagus - spargel - is a national passion, and eating it is pretty much compulsory during the Spargelzeit (TV adverts will remind you of the season should you forget). Your average family is probably more likely to have lasagne for tea than white sausage and sauerkraut. One urban myth would have it that Berlin gave the world doner kebabs in much the same way that Brits invented chicken tikka masala. Germany is a paradise for beer drinkers, with each town favouring its own brew. German wine is vastly underrated, particularly Spätburgunder red and Riesling whites. Love and sex To understand why Germans are so confident about sex, just look at the top-selling teenage magazine, Bravo. Each week, two young readers (one girl, one boy) are photographed in the buff and interviewed about their love lives, depilatory regime, etc. There is also a legendary agony uncle, Dr Sommer, who answers letters with headlines such as \"I'm circumcised and ashamed!\" and \"My mum caught me masturbating\". As a result, sex is not taboo, and the TV presenter Charlotte Roche - who last year offered to sleep with the German president if he didn't sign a law extending nuclear power stations' life - was able to bring out a bestselling novel, Wet Lands, about a teenage girl preoccupied with masturbating with an avocado stone. Brits are often surprised to discover that Germans do not appear to require alcohol to sleep with each other for the first time. German women are legendarily feisty and tend to call the shots in the bedroom. Think the title character in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's The Marriage of Maria Braun, who, the morning after sleeping with her boss, tells him: \"I don't care what people think. I do care what you think. And you're not having an affair with me. I'm having an affair with you.\" This anything-goes attitude has consequences: apparently Aids/HIV has doubled in the last 10 years. Entertainment Germans can be positively neurotic about their reputation as a kulturnation. German cinema used to lead the way in the silent era and, every few years, collective hopes are raised for a return to the golden years. Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's Oscar-winning The Lives of Others in particular stoked talk of a revival, though anyone who has seen Otto Waalkes' Otto's Eleven, Till Schweiger's Kokowääh or even Von Donnersmarck follow-up The Tourist knows there is no point in getting too excited. Television is still swamped by badly dubbed voiceovers of American sitcoms and carbon-copy reality shows such as Dschungelcamp (I'm a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!) and Deutschland Sucht den Superstar. Cop show Tatort is set in a different German city each week and has become cult viewing for its understated drama. Musically, \"big in Germany\" is always going to be a mark of mockery in Britain, but German hip-hop is considerably better than its reputation would suggest, and electronic labels such as the Cologne-based Kompakt are respected worldwide. Lily Allen-esque singer Lena won the Eurovision song contest last year and had the country acting like a bunch of 14-year-olds, though sending her to the contest for a second time this year increasingly looks like a bad idea. History Everyone knows about German history. But post-1945 (West) Germany has gone through a painful and exemplary period of self-scrutiny, with the Holocaust acknowledged and remembered as an unprecedented crime. And there is much more to German history than the Third Reich: big literary names from Goethe (below) and Schiller through to Thomas Mann, a pantheon of classical composers from Bach and Handel to Beethoven and Wagner, the martial narrative of unification in the 19th century under Bismarck and the postwar economic miracle of the 1950s. And there are always the ancient Frisians and the Saxons, who settled on an obscure, rainy island off the western coast of Europe in the fifth and sixth centuries, taking their own peculiar dialect with them. International relations Germany has traditionally been the driving force inside the European Union, as befits its status as Europe's biggest, and most economically powerful, state. Typically, you have to add \"Franco\" when discussing Germany's EU role – as in Franco-German stitch-up. In reality, however, German foreign policy has become less idealistic/integrationist/self-sacrificing in recent years and more hard-headed/self-regarding/get-your-hands-off-our-money. Angela Merkel's decision to bail out the profligate Greeks was wildly unpopular at home. Germany also has closer relations with \"mafia state\" Russia than any other European power except Berlusconi-land. Bonus points if you can name Germany's lack-lustre foreign minister and summarise what the Americans think of him, according to WikiLeaks.

Senior western diplomats are warning that unless agreement can be reached over the next few days on a way forward for Middle East talks, the NPT review conference could grind to a halt without anything to show for it. Failure to achieve any positive outcome would be a serious blow to the credibility of the international community's efforts to deal with pressing nuclear problems, particularly in regards to Iran. At the centre of the crisis are highly sensitive ongoing negotiations on plans for a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. The idea is being championed by Egypt and the Arab nations as a way of forcing Israel to admit publicly that it is in possession of nuclear arms as a first step towards eradicating those weapons. Under a long-standing policy of ambiguity, Israel has never admitted possessing atomic weapons, though it is universally believed to do so. Israel is one of four countries that has refused to sign up to the NPT, and persuading Tel Aviv to attend any discussion on nuclear arms in the Middle East is proving difficult. So far there is no sign that the Israeli government is prepared to budge, as it says it will only sign the treaty once a full Arab-Israel peace deal is achieved. A senior western diplomat said that without Israel there could be no meeting on the nuclear-free zone, while Iran would also have to show up if the talks were to be credible given the current confrontation over Tehran's nuclear enrichment programme. Israel is under pressure from allies to conform on the issue, and talks are understood to be continuing with the US administration, which backs a nuclear-free zone. The diplomat added: \"Israel will attend if it thinks the cost of not attending will be higher than if it does.\" Parties close to the negotiations now fear that if the Middle East plan fails to get off the ground then the Arab nations will act as a bloc at the New York conference – forcing it to end in failure, which has serious consequences. \"Two major crashes of the NPT review conference in 10 years, what would that say about our ability to take forward multilateral diplomacy?\" a western diplomat said, referring to the collapse of the last conference in 2005. The concern is that another collapse would send the wrong signals to Iran at a time when the international community is trying to present an united front against Tehran over uranium enrichment. If Iran continues on a course of confrontation with nuclear regulators, it faces new sanctions after the UN security council's five permanent members plus Germany reach agreement last night. The draft resolution is largely based on the sanctions regime devised for North Korea and removes several loopholes that Tehran had exploited in previous resolutions. The security council wants to see Iran suspend all enrichment and reprocessing activities which it suspects could be geared towards the making of nuclear bombs. Iran insists it is only interested in developing civilian nuclear power. Iran today dismissed the draft resolution, saying the measures were unlikely to be approved and would not break its economy if implemented. \"The draft being discussed at the United Nations security council has no legitimacy,\" Iran's semi-official Fars news agency quoted, Mojtaba Samareh-Hashemi, a senior adviser to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as saying. The draft resolution instructs UN member states, for instance, to repel any attempts by Iran to acquire assets in uranium mining in their countries, a clause believed to relate to some parts of Africa and Latin America where Tehran has shown recent interest. Member states are called upon to inspect any ships going to and from Iran suspected to be carrying prohibited materiel that could be used in the making or ballistic missile delivery systems for nuclear weapons. Various annexes of the draft resolution relating to travel bans and asset freezes for individuals, groups and banks have yet to be agreed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/aug/18/coalition-first-100-days-verdict","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-17T23:05:18Z","webTitle":"David Cameron's first 100 days: The good, the bad and the novelty | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/18/coalition-first-100-days-verdict","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/18/coalition-first-100-days-verdict","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron's first 100 days: The good, the bad and the novelty","bodyText":"Franklin Roosevelt's insistence in 1933 that he should be judged by the changes wrought in his first 100 days in office has raised the bar high for less distinguished governments across the democratic world, not least in Britain. In the years since Roosevelt, the habit of marking a government's first 100 days has sometimes been banal. But maybe not in Britain in 2010. As David Cameron's Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government reaches its century this week, we are living in very new times. The principal novelty of this government is simply that it is a formal coalition. Britain has never before had a genuine peacetime coalition government between parties in the universal suffrage era. For us, this is territory without maps. Coalitions mean doing things differently, giving and taking, swallowing some things while insisting on others. This reality still takes some getting used to, and many have neither accustomed themselves to it nor even tried. So far, to judge by the Guardian's new ICM poll today, the public still seem to like the coalition, Mr Cameron and Nick Clegg. The enthusiasm is ebbing, though the mood will doubtless change again as time goes on. Post-election realities The coalition that now governs Britain is not the one that this newspaper wanted. For several reasons, a deal between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, with tacit minor-party support, was unachievable after 6 May. However, some coalition was better than none. In the past 100 days there has been much adjustment to new circumstances that reflects well on those who have undertaken it. Mr Cameron reacted more skilfully to the post-election realities than anyone. He has been a good learner about new politics – and a good teacher. The machinery of government has been run better under him than by Gordon Brown. Future party leaders of all parties should study Mr Cameron's work as a coalition premier so far. The coalition is neither a Tory government nor a Lib Dem government. It is a combination of the two, and it reflects their different priorities as well as their common ground. Nevertheless, the main defining feature of the coalition so far has been its collective commitment – catalysed by an exaggerated fear that the UK faced a Greek-style sovereign debt crisis in May – to largely Conservative demands for fast and deep cuts in public spending across government. These were embodied in George Osborne's budget and, come the autumn, are set to be carried forward in the most draconian spending round in modern history. It cannot be said too often that this is too much and too fast. It is not necessary to cut the government deficit so rapidly. Such cuts, reinforced by deliberate decisions on benefits, inescapably impact more heavily and unfairly on the poor than on the rich. They also put the prospects of more general economic recovery at unnecessary risk. Whatever the many failings of Mr Brown's government, Labour was right to grasp the central role of government in underpinning growth in the aftermath of the financial crisis. It was also right to insist on international action to prevent a spiral of deflationary decline. The coalition's misguidedly excessive austerity at home has been matched by a negligent approach to the potential of the G20 to safeguard global employment and stimulate growth. The Lib Dems have struggled to make an equivalent mark – a hard ask given the economic situation – on the public face of the new government. This partly reflects the electoral arithmetic on 6 May when, thanks to the unfairness of the electoral system, the Tories won five times as many seats as their junior partners. It also reflects the Lib Dems' long exile from power and the steep learning curve of transforming, almost overnight, from a party of the margins to one of government. Nevertheless, the Lib Dems have achievements of their own, lifting the lowest paid out of tax (though undermined by higher VAT), securing pupil premiums in education to help those most in need, and the first steps towards reform of the electoral system, the House of Lords and the banking system. And they have helped to empower the liberal Tory tradition against a still very disgruntled right, bolstering moves to cut back prison building, reform the criminal justice system, place the UK nuclear deterrent (though not nuclear power) on the table, ensure that ministers act maturely on Europe, and abort inheritance tax cuts – few of which the liberal Tories would have been able to carry through otherwise. All these are substantive progressive achievements. Some are overdue reversals of Labour's unlamented authoritarianism at its worst. Poll erosion These are still, however, very early days. If the coalition's introduction of fixed-term parliaments (unnecessarily rushed like much else in the reform agenda) goes ahead, the government intends to have more than 1,700 more days to run. Uncertainties in the economy, the impact of unwise and unfair spending cuts, and the inevitable waning of the coalition's novelty will all shape the longer term future. If the AV referendum goes down next May, Lib Dem nerves will fray fast. Already, the ICM poll shows an eroding electoral position. Labour, under a new leader, may begin to set out the viable alternative about which it has been silent so far. The currently exaggerated charge that the coalition is ideologically hostile to the state may become far more credible if the government becomes too reckless. The wisdom of Tony Blair's recent warning to Mr Cameron, that a prime minister is at his most popular at the beginning when he is least effective and least popular at the end when he is at his most effective, may eventually be vindicated. Already, as the chancellor's new tone made clear yesterday, the coalition is worried that it is defined by a draconian approach to public spending which may lose its appeal once the cuts begin to bite. These have been a remarkable 100 days. The coalition deserved its chance and it is still entitled to show what it can offer. But the hard political pounding has barely even started yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2010/jun/03/vince-cable-pledge-to-help-business","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-03T19:20:00Z","webTitle":"Vince Cable admits U-turn on public spending cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jun/03/vince-cable-pledge-to-help-business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/jun/03/vince-cable-pledge-to-help-business","fields":{"headline":"Vince Cable admits U-turn on public spending cuts","bodyText":"The business secretary, Vince Cable, admitted today he had changed his view on when to tackle Britain's budget deficit, coming into line with his Conservative coalition partners on early action. In his first speech since joining the cabinet, Cable promised that early spending cuts would be offset by support for economic growth, such as pressure on banks to increase lending to small firms, the creation of new apprenticeship schemes and an overhaul of regulations to make life easier for businesses. Cable laid out his priorities for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills with an emphasis on the need to rebalance the economy away from overdependence on household demand and the public sector to a better mix of sectors and regions. He will have to promote such a transformation while also pushing through cuts in his own department. The government is committed to reducing Britain's budget deficit over the next five years, starting with £6bn of cuts announced last month. During the Liberal Democrats' election campaign Cable had argued against immediate spending cuts, echoing the fears of Labour politicians that cuts could derail a fragile economic recovery. He stressed today that the timing was still critical but that his stance had altered. \"If deficit reduction comes too rapidly there is a danger of deeper recession and even bigger deficits. But like the governor of the Bank of England, and like the OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development], I have changed my view on this. I have been persuaded that early action is absolutely necessary, and that is what we are doing.\" Cable told an audience at Cass Business School in London: \"We face deep-seated problems: a very fragile recovery – both at home and in our continental European members; a massive budget deficit; a dysfunctional banking system; an economy that is seriously unbalanced.\" Citing the current turmoil in the eurozone, Cable admitted that while the \"worst of the crisis\" was over there was still a danger that global problems could return. To help Britain catch up with faster-recovering nations such as the US, he promised to make it a \"place where enterprise and innovation are made easier and can succeed\". He stressed that growth would have to come from the business sector and trade, and pledged less regulation, saying: \"Often the most useful thing governments can do is simply to get out of the way.\" Cable wants closer ties between business and universities and more focus on science and research. He pledged to overhaul regional development agencies to rebalance support towards areas with the worst problems, such as the north-east and West Midlands. The trade union Unite has written to the business secretary, warning that failure to support government loans, including that promised to the manufacturing company Sheffield Forgemasters, will \"cost thousands of jobs\" and jeopardise Britain's preparations to build a new generation of nuclear power stations. Cable's predecessor, Lord Mandelson, pledged an £80m loan to Sheffield Forgemasters but the coalition announced that it would review all Labour spending decisions taken since 1 January. Derek Simpson, Unite's joint general secretary, said: \"Failure to support Sheffield Forgemasters would be a colossal error of judgment. The company is unique, there is not another company in the world that has its skills and expertise.The \" The manufacturers' group EEF gave its backing to Cable's speech but demanded more detail. \"We now need government to work with business and to put in place a bold, proactive strategy that will grow markets, stimulate investment in innovation and skills, and put growth at the centre of plans to repair the public finances,\" the EEF chief executive, Terry Scuoler, said. Responding to complaints from business groups that bank loans are still hard to come by, Cable reiterated that he would take a tough line on those parts of the banking system \"which have not served enterprise in this country as well as they could\". He laid out three priorities – separating retail and investment banking, resolving the question of a levy on the banks to reflect the fact the taxpayer is providing insurance, and ensuring that banks' lending agreements are being honoured. The business department must take £836m of cuts this year, more than any other area of Whitehall. He also flagged up the need to reform the UK takeover laws. These have been . One of the trickiest issues in Cable's in-tray is the future of Royal Mail. He said he was keen to resolve this \"nagging problem\". \"I want to see private capital and worker-share ownership in the Royal Mail – commercial discipline alongside employee involvement.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/may/10/centrica-buys-british-energy-stake-edf","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-05-11T00:58:00Z","webTitle":"Centrica to buy 20% stake in British Energy from EDF","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/may/10/centrica-buys-british-energy-stake-edf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/may/10/centrica-buys-british-energy-stake-edf","fields":{"headline":"Centrica to buy 20% stake in British Energy from EDF","bodyText":"British Gas owner Centrica today clinched a deal valued at about £2.25bn to buy a 20% stake in nuclear company British Energy (BE) from Électricité de France (EDF), illustrating the growing importance of nuclear power to energy groups in Britain and around the world. The deal will be announced tomorrow. As the authorities clamp down on carbon emissions and force through green policy measures, energy firms such as Centrica are looking to boost their investment in nuclear power, which is carbon-free. The industry has received support from the British government, which is also anxious to reduce the country's dependence on foreign gas from places such as Russia. Ministers have given permission for Britain's current generation of ageing nuclear reactors to be replaced, opening the floodgates to foreign investment. Last year EDF paid more than £12bn for British Energy, which faced financial collapse seven years ago. The French agreed to offload a stake to Centrica, but a transaction has been delayed by months of haggling. It has only been secured because Centrica has agreed to a side deal with EDF to offload 51% of its holding in SPE, a Belgian gas and electricity supplier, for around £1bn. Centrica has been under pressure from shareholders to invest more in power generation, as it can only meet a third of demand from its own resources. Its biggest asset is the huge Morecambe Bay gasfield, but reserves are running low. By investing in BE, Centrica can lessen its dependence on the wholesale gas and electricity markets where prices are volatile, making it difficult to predict future profits, something that unsettles City investors. \"The EDF deal is an attempt to even out Centrica's earnings stream and create more certainty for shareholders,\" said one analyst. \"You should look at it as a hedge against the vagaries of global commodity prices.\" EDF needs a deal as much as Centrica, as the French-state controlled group has run up hundreds of millions in borrowings as a result of a buying spree that has also seen it acquire a stake in the nuclear assets of US-based firm Constellation. In February, Centrica announced that profits last year fell by a fifth to £904m."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/mar/12/nicolas-sarkozy-gordon-brown-entente-formidable","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-12T14:56:32Z","webTitle":"Nicolas Sarkozy and Gordon Brown hail 'entente formidable'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/mar/12/nicolas-sarkozy-gordon-brown-entente-formidable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/mar/12/nicolas-sarkozy-gordon-brown-entente-formidable","fields":{"headline":"Nicolas Sarkozy and Gordon Brown hail 'entente formidable'","bodyText":"Gordon Brown today described Britain's alliance with France as an \"entente formidable\" as he and Nicolas Sarkozy stressed the need for close co-operation and to stay \"bang in the middle\" of Europe. Speaking at a press conference after a working lunch at Downing Street today, the two leaders highlighted close political alignment on a number of policy fronts as the prime minister described relations between the two countries as \"greater now than at any time since the second world war\". Brown said he and Sarkozy were in \"harmony\" over the need to introduce a tax on banking transactions as he revealed that a report on the levy is due \"in the next few weeks\". As well as on the economy, the two countries were working \"more closely than ever\" on environmental, energy and security matters, he said. This included putting nuclear power at the heart of tackling climate change. In his first visit to Downing Street since 2008, Sarkozy echoed the view that it was essential Britain remain \"bang in the middle\" of Europe amid concerns that a Tory government may engage less enthusiastically with Europe under David Cameron. Sarkozy insisted he was not in Britain to \"play politics\" ahead of the forthcoming general election but nevertheless made comments that appeared to be aimed squarely at the Tory leader, who he is meeting this afternoon. \"I remain convinced that the position of our British friends is bang in the middle of Europe. We need you,\" the French president said. Sarkozy said he \"regretted\" Cameron's decision to pull the Tories out of the centre-right European People's party grouping in the European parliament. The two leaders used their press conference to reveal that work on a banking levy was progressing as Brown pointed to Japan's recent decision to come out in favour of such a move. \"The banks are organised at a global level now,\" said the prime minister. \"Their global contribution to society has to be measured in some way. I cannot have one set of banks undercutting another set of banks by moving from one country to another as tax havens or regulatory regimes make it too easy to pay any taxes at all. \"The global financial levy is something that is not only on the agenda but will be subject to a report that will appear in the next few weeks and I believe that the French and British positions are entirely in harmony on this and we can move forward on this.\" He said Britain's alliance with France was a partnership for the future. Both were worried about the fragility of the economic recovery, he said, so had agreed to maintain the economic stimulus, \"to stick to the course\" in their determination to create high global growth. But he stressed the need for \"more global co-operation\" in the G20. This should comprise \"more determination, more consistency and more speed\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2008/dec/19/gordonbrown-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2008-12-19T14:22:00Z","webTitle":"Gordon Brown unveils economic measures to prepare UK for downturn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/dec/19/gordonbrown-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2008/dec/19/gordonbrown-economy","fields":{"headline":"Gordon Brown unveils economic measures to prepare UK for downturn","bodyText":"Gordon Brown said today that Britain could be an international \"beacon of hope\" as he promised to unveil a wide-ranging series of economic measures early next year to prepare the country for the future. In his last Downing Street press conference of the year, the prime minister struck an optimistic note, saying that falling prices and extra government support meant that many people would enjoy more spending power in 2009. He pledged more government support for nuclear power, carbon capture technology, the digital economy, transport – including a decision on a third runway at Heathrow – and further measures on the banking system to ensure it kept lending to businesses. \"It is vital we don't lose sight of the important challenges and opportunities facing the country,\" Brown said. \"We must invest to create products and services we can sell to the world.\" Promising \"real help now and real hope for the future\", Brown said the government would be bringing forward measures for \"smart investment\" in \"green\" jobs and the digital economy. Brown added: \"We will be investing in carbon capture, digital economy, transport, there will be a decision on a third runway at Heathrow, nuclear power, further measures on the banking system to ensure they keep lending to businesses.\" There would be measures too on retraining, social mobility, and reform of the banking system, the prime minister said. \"These are uncertain and difficult times but Britain can and must be a beacon of hope and opportunity for the future. \"The scale of the challenges that we face is matched by the strength of my optimism that Britain can rise to meet these challenges. With our fighting spirit and our can-do attitude, I am confident that we can meet all the challenges ahead.\" The prime minister said an economic slowdown must not be used as an excuse to slow the pace of investment and reform to strengthen the country. \"The countries that invest through the downturn will be the countries that emerge stronger in the future,\" he said. \"There is no credible plan for getting out of this downturn that is not also a plan for building a better long-term British economy.\" In a hint that the part-privatisation of the Royal Mail could be followed by other sell-offs, the prime minister also promised to get the \"best return\" from government assets. Inviting questions from journalists, the prime minister joked: \"Please don't throw your shoes at me,\" in reference to a recent George Bush press conference in Baghdad. Brown dismissed speculation of an early general election, saying that he had given the subject \"no thought\". He also said he wanted small businesses to know that the government was taking action to restore confidence in the banking system. The prime minister admitted that 2008 had been a \"challenging\" year but insisted that he was in politics \"to do what's right\". He said: \"The traditional way people cover politics is who's in and who's out but I have learned that soon becomes yesterday's news. I know the thing that matters is: do you make the right decisions?\" The prime minister went on: \"In my view what 2008 has taught us is that the public has less interest in the minutiae, the trivia of everyday events, of the personalities and the conflicts in Westminster. \"What they really want are governments that can actually get on with the job and do what they intend to do, and that's give real help to families and businesses.\" On the subject of support for Jaguar Land Rover, Brown said that the government would do \"everything it could\" to support the car industry and that ministers were talking to all the largest producers. But he said that Jaguar had received no specific promise of support and that the \"first responsibility\" for the company lay with its owners, the Indian company Tata. Brown conceded that it was proving \"a challenge\" to get the banks lending to businesses. But he stressed that the steps taken by the government to get the economy moving, including the controversial cut in VAT, were already \"making a difference\". Brown played down fears over sterling's plunge in value, which has seen it approach parity with the euro. He insisted low inflation was the key economic concern, and he would not be drawn into giving a \"running commentary\" on the pound. \"Of course there is volatility in every economy in the world and of course exchange rates are going to go up and down depending on a number of things that happen,\" Brown said. \"But the basis of our economy is how we target inflation to get it down. The day-to-day movements of a currency and of the pound are not something I want to give a running commentary on.\" Asked about the impact of low interest rates on savers, Brown stressed that savers benefited from low inflation because it meant the value of their savings would be protected. In a clear reference to the Conservatives, Brown said that he was not aware of any other country in the world that was advocating a \"do nothing\" approach to the global economic crisis. In a separate interview earlier today, David Cameron said it was unfair of Brown to characterise the Tory position in that way. When it was put to him on GMTV that Brown was accusing him of proposing inaction, the Conservative leader replied: \"That's not right. We would do lots of things to help because we recognise what a difficult time it is for families who are struggling with kids and all the bills. \"One of the first things we would do is freeze the council tax, because after your mortgage that is one of the big bills that you have to pay, and we have identified savings in the government – the stuff they spend on advertising and consultants – and use that money to freeze your council tax for two years to try and help at this time. \"So to say we would do nothing is wrong.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/jul/08/tory-mp-march-downing-street-michael-gove-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-08T12:21:25Z","webTitle":"Tory MP plans march on Downing Street to protest against Michael Gove's education cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jul/08/tory-mp-march-downing-street-michael-gove-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/jul/08/tory-mp-march-downing-street-michael-gove-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Tory MP plans march against Michael Gove's education cuts","bodyText":"A Conservative MP said today he is planning to lead a march to Downing Street in protest at the government's decision to axe school-building programmes in his area. Ian Liddell-Grainger, the Tory MP for Bridgwater, said he was prepared to lobby David Cameron after his Somerset constituency was told that at least three of six schools it planned to build would not be given the go-ahead. Michael Gove, the education secretary, announced on Monday that the government was suspending new building projects for 715 schools and cancelling the £55bn Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme, saying it had been beset by \"massive overspends, tragic delays, botched construction projects and needless bureaucracy\". But, in an embarrassing development, Gove was forced to make an \"unreserved apology\" in the House of Commons yesterday after it emerged that, as a result of 25 errors in the Department for Education list issued on Monday, several schools had been misled into believing they would be able to go ahead with their building projects. Gove vowed to apologise to every school affected by the blunder. The schools in Liddell-Grainger's constituency learned of their fate on Monday. The Tory MP defended his plans to march to Downing Street against the Conservative-led government, claiming the schools issue was \"above politics\" and that those who had spent time on the projects had a \"right\" to lobby the prime minister to get him to reconsider. The MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier today that he had rung Gove's office to complain that the situation was unfair. \"I am meeting with all my heads on Friday and all my councillors and take – if we have to – the message to David Cameron to say: 'Look, this is a very unique situation. We have built the best tertiary college. We are about to build a new nuclear power station. We have bent over to turn an industrial town in the south west into a great success story which we have done and we need to point across. Yes, we know the problems the government has got but there are ways around this.'\" Liddell-Grainger wants to persuade the government to do a deal to keep the building of the schools going. They were going to be built under the private finance initiative. By putting back payments 20 years, the new building work could be kept off the government's balance sheets for a few years, he claimed. \"All our schools are very bad,\" said Liddell-Grainger. \"They were built a long time ago. We were promised this because we are the only industrial town in the West Country. We need those schools so we can bring everything up to date so it all dovetails in to create the engineers we are going to need in the future. I know Michael [Gove] is under an enormous amount of pressure and I want to make sure I pressurise the other way, as the local member of parliament, along with my schools, along with my councillors, along with everyone else, to say: 'Please, Michael ... we do need those schools built in our areas.'\" He added: \"When you have spent all this time through the education system and the council and others to build up these schools to what they are I think people have a right to come and say to the prime minister and to the cabinet to say, 'Look, we know what we can do, we know what we can achieve' ... If I have to stand outside Downing Street and say, 'Can we please have a chat?' then I am more than happy to do so.\" Gove has faced widespread criticism both over the cancelled projects and the errors in the Department for Education list, which misled some schools into believing their new-build schemes were going ahead. A source closely involved with a number of the cancelled BSF projects said: \"This is the latest example of Michael Gove's inept handling of the BSF programme. Firstly, he allowed projects to progress to preferred bidder stage, resulting in the private sector incurring £100,000-plus of additional costs, only to subsequently cancel them. Now he has mishandled the seemingly simple of task of identifying which schools are impacted by the government's decision.\" Schools in Sandwell, in the West Midlands, initially appeared to have had their projects saved, but that was later found to be incorrect. The same happened in Derby, Northamptonshire, Peterborough, Doncaster, Greenwich, Staffordshire, Wiltshire, Lancashire and Bexley. Gove's department admitted the errors yesterday and published a corrected list. Last night, Gove told the Commons Speaker, John Bercow: \"I'm grateful to you and to the whole house for granting me the opportunity to make this statement, and once again to unreservedly apologise.\" The department also said it \"apologised unreservedly for these errors\". Vernon Coaker, the shadow junior education minister, who had yesterday demanded Gove come to the Commons to explain to MPs \"what on earth has been going on\" thanked the minister for \"finally\" apologising for the \"serious errors\". Coaker said: \"It is right that he has apologised to this house, but he should also apologise to all the pupils and parents and teachers expecting new buildings who have now had them cruelly snatched away. The chaos and confusion around this statement was frankly astonishing.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/jun/17/job-schemes-cuts-economic-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-17T19:50:04Z","webTitle":"Job schemes to go as coalition shelves projects worth £10.5bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jun/17/job-schemes-cuts-economic-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/jun/17/job-schemes-cuts-economic-policy","fields":{"headline":"Job schemes to go as coalition shelves projects worth £10.5bn","bodyText":"The coalition government today froze or cancelled £10.5bn worth of projects announced in the dying days of the Labour government, suspending new libraries, hospitals, job schemes for young people and an £80m investment in the nuclear industry in Sheffield. The symbolic Labour policy of free swimming for children and pensioners was also scrapped outright. The government said it was forced into difficult cuts by the \"irresponsible planning\" of its predecessor, but Labour accused the Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition of being ideologically driven to reduce the size of government and its involvement in stimulating the economy. David Cameron, speaking from Brussels, said the biggest threat to jobs and economic recovery would be failure to deal with the deficit. \"You can't put a blindfold over your eyes and pretend that the world is not like that, because it is,\" the prime minister said. Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury, announcing the review of 217 schemes signed off by Labour since January, said £2bn worth of projects would be scrapped completely. They include an £80m loan to Sheffield Forgemasters, the £450m North Tees and Hartlepool hospital building project, nearly £1bn in programmes to help the unemployed and the government's £25m contribution to the new Stonehenge visitor centre. He said that Labour was spending money it \"simply didn't have\". A further £8.5bn of projects have been suspended and will be revised in the autumn spending review, including a libraries modernisation programme, the Sheffield retail quarter, a Department of Health-funded wellbeing centre for Leeds and a new magistrates court for Birmingham. The bulk of the potential savings – £7bn in total – come from suspending plans to purchase a new fleet of search and rescue helicopters. Liam Byrne, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the projects amounted to just 0.05% of government spending, \"nailing the myth\" that Labour had operated a \"scorched earth\" policy in the run-up to the election. \"Both the country and the Liberal Democrat party beyond will be aghast this afternoon at your attack on jobs, your attack on construction workers, your attack on the industries of the future and the cancellation of a hospital,\" Byrne told Alexander in the Commons. \"Let me ask you: what could be more front-line than this? In five minutes this afternoon you have reversed three years of Liberal Democratic policy of which you were the principal author. What a moment of abject humiliation.\" A loan to Sheffield Forgemasters, which manufactures components for nuclear power stations, fell victim. Pat McFadden, Labour MP for Wolverhampton South East, said: \"I'm not sure whether this was traditional Treasury orthodoxy or Liberal Democrat hostility to the nuclear industry. I do know that the effect is a huge setback for jobs.\" A new retail quarter for Sheffield was also put on hold and a £13m grant to buy the old Outokumpu steelworks in the city was scrapped, in a further sign that many traditionally Labour areas are now losing out under the coalition government. Others include Leeds, Birmingham and Hartlepool. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport separately spelled out a raft of cuts, some additional to the Treasury's announcements. It included scrapping the £45m British Film Institute film centre, which Gordon Brown had championed. The centre, on London's Southbank, was to include five screens and rival Leicester Square in hosting international premieres. The BFI said in a statement: \"We are concerned that film is bearing the brunt – over 50% of the department's cuts that have been announced are coming from film.\" The new Stonehenge visitor centre will lose £45m in public funding, though the government said it could still go ahead if private funding could be found. The sports minister, Hugh Robertson, announcing the scrapping of Labour's free swimming policy, said: \"This is not a decision that gives me any pleasure. However, the research shows that the great majority of free swimmers were swimming already, and would have paid to swim anyway. With a crippling deficit to tackle and tough decisions to take, this has become a luxury we can no longer afford.\" The announcement came as the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, was separately promising to improve child and family wellbeing, including by tackling childhood obesity, one of the key aims behind the free swimming. The roll-out of the Future Jobs Fund, an extension of the Young Person's Guarantee to 2011/12 and the two year Jobseekers guarantee – all programmes to help guarantee work or training for longer term unemployed people in the recession – were cut altogether, saving £995m. Yvette Cooper, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \"This is shocking short-termist and shows that the Tory-Liberal government clearly thinks unemployment is a price worth paying … it will cost us all far more in the long term in higher unemployment benefits and damage to our communities.\" A Treasury spokesman insisted that the schemes would be replaced by a new Single Work Programme, but the government could not give details of how this would operate, or what it would cost."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2010/sep/26/living-architecture-alain-de-botton","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-25T23:06:38Z","webTitle":"Living Architecture: giving a modernist spin to holiday homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/sep/26/living-architecture-alain-de-botton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2010/sep/26/living-architecture-alain-de-botton","fields":{"headline":"Living Architecture: giving a modernist spin to holiday homes","bodyText":"\"They're the Turkey Twizzlers of architecture,\" says Alain de Botton of houses by \"Barratt, Persimmon and developers like that\", implying that he is the Jamie Oliver of his chosen field. Just as the latter has waged war on the alliterative spirals of grease and fat and fought to raise the standards of school dinners, so de Botton wants to \"sensitise\" us to built space. He wants to make us more \"fussy\" and \"nudge\" the debate about housing \"slightly in a positive direction\". The successful writer, whose softly intellectual books offer us advice on love, philosophy, work, travel and status, has created a not-for-profit organisation called Living Architecture. Its aim is to build delightful modern houses that can then be rented for holidays or weekends, for about £2,500 for eight people for a week. The aim is to \"correct the fleeting way in which we experience most modern architecture: sleeping in a place changes your perception\". The model is the Landmark Trust, which rescues follies, gatehouses, towers, cottages and other such buildings and makes them available for holiday lets. The idea came to him, he says, following the publication of his book The Architecture of Happiness. The book \"emerged from the distress\" he felt at the physical surroundings of his then home in Shepherd's Bush, west London. It led to invitations to speak at conferences and, returning from one, he experienced \"a moment of crisis as one can on trains coming home late at night\". He asked: \"What's my life about?\" and felt a \"terrible desire to change things\". Similar crises have inspired despots, princes and aristocrats to build new cities or ideal towns and Living Architecture can be seen as a model village scattered about the English countryside. It is also touched by what I'll call Serpentinism, after the Serpentine gallery's annual pavilion in London, which is a belief in the special magic of the singular architectural object. Mark Robinson, who used to work for the Serpentine on making their pavilions happen, is now doing a similar job as director of Living Architecture. The outcome, so far, is five houses, in different stages of completion. The costs are undisclosed, but Robinson says they are \"in the £500,000-£1m range\" for each house. They are designed by a judicious mixture of architects young and old. The completed Balancing Barn, near Darsham, Suffolk, is designed by MVRDV, who are Dutch masters of provocation. The nearly finished Dune House, in Thorpeness, Suffolk, is by Norwegians Jarmund/Vigsnæs. The Shingle House, Dungeness, Kent, also nearing completion, is by youngish Scots Nord. The Long House, Cockthorpe, Norfolk, is by Michael and Patty Hopkins, who de Botton describes as \"part of the triumvirate of now classic British modernists\", alongside Norman Foster and Richard Rogers. It is due to open next summer. Also on the way is the Secular Retreat in Salcombe, Devon, designed by the Swiss Peter Zumthor, who inspires a cultish following. Of all the architects approached by Living Architecture, he was only one who doubted whether the project was worthy of his time. The beauty of the site persuaded him. Of the five, MVRDV's Balancing Barn is the most spectacular, an instant classic of Looney Tunes modernism in which much effort, determination and structural steel is expended in pursuit of a single memorable gag. Built on the top of a steep slope, it starts with a deliberately humble house shape – rectangle with triangle on top – of the kind you see in children's drawings, mortgage company logos and Monopoly houses. This is extruded into a long, silvery tube that, using the engineering you might need for a small bridge, shoots into air, the slope falling away beneath it. Like a cartoon character, it starts running in midair, with no apparent means of support. A glass floor in the living room, looking down into the unexpected void, is the punchline. The Balancing Barn is the equivalent of the Pineapple, an 18th-century folly in Dunmore, central Scotland, shaped like the eponymous fruit. This is the Landmark Trust's pin-up, and MVRDV's teetering house-beam will do the same for Living Architecture. A few miles away, at Thorpeness, the Dune House plays more gently with similar themes of anti-gravity and subverted domesticity. Here, the idea is to float an upper floor of exaggerated wonkiness, all pointy roofs in black timber, above a ground floor of perfect rectilinear glass, as perfectly level as the horizon. It is Addams Family above, Mies van der Rohe below and, with the help of some cleverness by engineer Jane Wernick, the appearance of floating works. In Dungeness, close to the garden created by Derek Jarman, the ramshackle sheds that dot the shingle have been lovingly recreated as a high-spec, and lovely, house at maybe 50 times the price. In Norfolk Sir Michael and Lady Hopkins are making a highly crafted barn, all wood, flint and precise joints. In Devon, Zumthor is arranging another unlikely mating for Mies van der Rohe, this time with a neolithic stone circle. The glass walls will have something of the German modernist's Farnsworth House, but the solid parts will be in rugged rock. Taken together, the five houses reveal several things. One is the transformation of the British countryside – parts of it anyway – to luxury artifice from thing of use. Barns and sheds become inhabitable artworks and it is striking that the weird peninsula of Dungeness, whose beauty is in its casualness, should now be treated so preciously. Not very long ago, people could chuck up what they wanted there, including a nuclear power station, but now, says Mark Robinson: \"You need about a hundred permissions to build anything. You're not allowed to move a single pebble.\" Another is the difference between statement and experience. One is the Balancing Barn's gag, the other its agreeable timber interior. Architects can do both, and both contribute to the enjoyment of space, but if you're looking for a relaxing escape, experience will eventually count for more than the transient sugar-rush of a dazzling concept. A further revelation is the way architects can't see a house without wanting to invert it and subvert it, turn it upside down and inside out. More relevant to de Botton's Jamie Oliver ambitions is the difficulty of achieving even these five houses. He has assembled impressive funding for his project, yet, thanks to the constrictions of the British planning system, his greatest difficulty is finding sites. How the beauties of Living Architecture can be translated to the everyday product of volume house builders is not yet clear. A downside of Serpentinism is that it can act as an inadvertent alibi for junk elsewhere; it concentrates quality in an exotic enclave. But de Botton is not responsible for cultural shifts in rural life and cannot tackle all the limitations of the construction industry. Living Architecture's main aim is to provide samplers of modern architecture to those who can afford the rent, and to inject some ideas and ambition into domestic design, and in this it succeeds. Put simply, it is making five houses of charm and intrigue that weren't there before."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2010/apr/18/robert-gates-iran-nuclear-threat","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-18T22:03:33Z","webTitle":"Robert Gates says White House lacks plan to deal with Iran nuclear threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/18/robert-gates-iran-nuclear-threat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/apr/18/robert-gates-iran-nuclear-threat","fields":{"headline":"Robert Gates says White House lacks plan to deal with Iran nuclear threat","bodyText":"The US defence secretary, Robert Gates, has given the White House what has been described as a \"wakeup\" call over its lack of a credible long-term plan on how to prevent Iran attaining the ability to produce nuclear weapons, it was reported today. A three-page memo written by Gates, below, to General James Jones, Barack Obama's top adviser on foreign affairs, says the administration has yet to come up with an effective strategy should Iran continue to enrich nuclear fuel and have all the other elements of a weapons programme in place. The memo was described by officials to the New York Times. According to the newspaper, the document was drawn up in January, shortly after the passing of a deadline set by Obama for Iran to respond to offers of greater dialogue over the nuclear issue. The memo comes as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, warns that if new United Nations sanctions are not imposed on Iran's nuclear programme soon there is a risk of regional conflict that will \"put the world in a more precarious position within six months to a year\". In the interview with the Financial Times, Clinton called for sanctions \"as soon as feasible\". She said the \"alternative is to permit them to continue pursuing nuclear weapons, either actual production or full capacity, which will trigger an arms race among their neighbours and would put one of the most volatile regions in the world at risk and could even trigger a conflict. And I don't believe that that's a chance worth taking\". With Tehran refusing to budge from its production of 20% enriched uranium, which it insists is solely to generate civilian nuclear power, efforts have been building within Washington to devise a road-map for action – including military options – should Iran get closer to nuclear capability. At a Senate hearing last week, Pentagon officials said Iran could have sufficient bomb-grade fuel – normally about 90% enriched uranium – for one nuclear weapon within a year, although it might take up to five years actually to create a bomb. Iran has also stepped up the rhetoric. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad today boasted about the country's army. \"Today, our armed forces have so much power that no enemy will harbour evil thoughts about laying its hands on Iranian territory,\" he said at an annual army parade. On Saturday, the supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, sought to turn US pressure over the nuclear issue back on Washington. At a conference in Tehran on nuclear disarmament, he told delegates drawn from countries that included China, Russia, France and Turkey, that the real villains were the US and Israel, both nuclear powers. He accused the US, which he called the \"sole nuclear offender\", a reference to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, of pursuing a deceptive policy \"which falsely claims to be advocating the non-proliferation of nuclear arms while doing nothing substantive for this cause\". According to the New York Times, Gates's memo reflects fears in the military that the White House has not yet prepared a set of action plans should sanctions and diplomatic efforts fail. The White House issued a swift denial of any suggestion it was insufficiently ready. \"This administration has been planning for all contingencies regarding Iran for many months,\" a White House official told Associated Press. The Republicans leapt on the report to ridicule the Obama administration's handling of the dispute. John McCain, the 2008 presidential candidate, told Fox News: \"I didn't need a secret memo to know we didn't have a coherent policy. That's pretty obvious.\" The Obama administration is having to walk a tightrope in its diplomatic efforts. On the one hand, it is dealing with China and Russia, both wary of stepping up sanctions on Tehran; on the other, it is mindful of the threat that Israel may attempt to bomb Iranian nuclear installations should the Israel government conclude that pressure alone is not working."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2008/jul/10/nuclear.energy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2008-07-10T10:30:00Z","webTitle":"Sergei Kirienko: Nuclear power is the key to resolving global crises","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/10/nuclear.energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/10/nuclear.energy","fields":{"headline":"The nuclear solution","bodyText":"All the major issues that were on the G8 agenda – the food crisis, global warming and uneven distribution of development resources among countries – are closely interlinked, first and foremost, to a shortage of energy and resulting price hikes.

Consumption is growing at a much faster pace, while new energy sources will not become commercially viable before 2030. Oil prices have risen, but even the $130-$140 per barrel will not fund new fields capable of satisfying the world economy. Alternative energy sources are currently unable to provide the necessary scale. And their costs confirm the maxim that energy is never cheap: witness the price of ethanol. Nuclear power is not the only means of overcoming the crises, but it is undoubtedly a major instrument in resolving the three problems on the G8 agenda. Nuclear power plants in Europe help prevent the annual emission of 700m tonnes of CO2, and in Japan the figure is 270m tonnes. In Russia the share of nuclear power is set to grow from 16% to 20-25% by 2030, which means that new nuclear power plants in our country will reduce greenhouse gas emission by between 10-15%. That is not a mere declaration, but a decision based on concrete sources of financing. Until now, the development of nuclear power focused on increased single-unit reactor capacity and thus unfortunately denied the benefits of atomic power to countries with under-developed energy networks, mainly on the African continent. However, today the nuclear power industry is ready to offer to the market small and medium-yield reactors, which may open-up prospects for a larger number of countries. Another major benefit of nuclear power is its capability to simultaneously desalinate water. This will help alleviate the food crisis in two ways. African countries lack fresh water to develop agriculture, and fresh water may become a major casualty of the food crisis. Access to reliable and cheap sources of energy is a major condition for sustainable economic development of any country. A growing number of industrialised countries and emerging economies realise the necessity to begin developing on their territories' peaceful atomic power technologies. Up to 600 new nuclear reactors are planned worldwide by 2030. This increases the importance of enhanced restrictions on the use of atomic power. It is the right of any country to enjoy the benefits of peaceful atomic energy. But it is the right of the world community to demand unconditional compliance with security norms and non-proliferation guarantees. Russia is both initiating the creation of a new security system for the development of nuclear power and working to launch enhanced mechanisms to guarantee nuclear non-proliferation. We have already initiated the creation of an infrastructure of international centres to provide nuclear fuel services, granting equal access to atomic energy to all the interested parties while ensuring strict compliance with non-proliferation requirements under International Atomic Energy Agency control. As an example, an international uranium enrichment centre has been created and is operating in the Russian city of Angarsk. Angarsk will have a guaranteed reserve of low-enriched uranium, managed by the IAEA board of governors, guaranteeing fuel supplies to any country of the world regardless of any political reasons. As Greenpeace founder Patrick Moore has said, opposition to nuclear power was a mistake and it is now a major means to counter global warming. The disappearance of old stereotypes on the political level will accelerate the development of nuclear power. That will help quickly lift non-market barriers in Europe and America, imposed to protect domestic producers, but which is a hindrance when the market faces shortages. A clear political signal will also guide the banking community, which is currently reluctant to get involved in nuclear power plant investment projects, due to a few radical pressure groups. We need broad international cooperation to solve the crises the world faces. We will continue to propose such an approach to our colleagues in the other G8 countries, especially when it comes to the peaceful use of atomic power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2010/oct/27/the-fiver-newcastle-arsenal-carling-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-27T15:04:37Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | More embryonic than the season itself | Barry Glendenning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/27/the-fiver-newcastle-arsenal-carling-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2010/oct/27/the-fiver-newcastle-arsenal-carling-cup","fields":{"headline":"More embryonic than the season itself","bodyText":"THE KIDS ARE NOT ALL RIGHT You know that green-screen thingummy-bob where players from each Premier League squad waste a valuable day of pre-season training sashaying up to the camera, putting their hands behind their back and gurning so that Sky can gussy up their pre-match line-up graphics and make Sundays even more super?

Obama used Wednesday's speech to mark a significant shift towards the centre, while trying to keep the left of the Democratic party with him. Democratic members of Congress, trade unions, environmentalists and, to a lesser extent, Wall Street welcomed his announcement that job creation was now his number one priority. The president devoted the bulk of the 71-minute speech to job plans, with his health reform plans taking a poor second place. Obama flew first to Tampa, Florida, where he detailed the first of a series of job creation programmes he will be highlighting over the next few weeks. He also gave details of a $8bn (£5bn) plan to invest in major new high-speed rail links in nine regions across the US. \"That investment is how we can break ground across the country, putting people to work building high-speed rail lines, because there's no reason why Europe or China should have the fastest trains when we can build them right here in America,\" he said. The push on jobs follows the stunning loss last week of Ted Kennedy's Massachusetts Senate seat, where voters complained Obama had spent too much of last year on health reform and not enough on recession-hit Americans, and complained too about the scale of federal spending and what they saw as his failure to punish Wall Street over bailouts and bonuses. Intent on showing he is not out of touch with the public mood, he is to make a campaign stop in New Hampshire next week that will also be devoted to job creation. Republican members of Congress insisted he had not learned the lessons of the Massachusetts result or last year's Democratic loss of the Virginia governorship. Senator John McCain, Obama's presidential rival in 2008, said: \"Well, the president always gives an eloquent speech and I admire that and appreciate some of the portions of his speech … but the substance of it, frankly, I think shows that he really has not heard the message of Virginia and Massachusetts.\" Although Obama insisted healthcare reform, languishing in Congress, was not dead, he offered no specific route for getting it passed. The Democrats said they would announce next Wednesday how they planned to proceed on health reform. The House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, hinted the House might accept the version already passed by the Senate, an option she had previously ruled out. Obama signalled he would continue to push his energy and climate agenda – putting the issue ahead of healthcare and making repeated mention of clean energy jobs. But he was far more concerned than in his first speech to Congress a year ago to win Republican support. Obama called for new offshore drilling and new nuclear power plants – both popular among Republicans – and said he would use his presidency to help advance a compromise energy and climate bill in the Senate. Republican and Democratic Senators as well as mainstream environment groups said Obama's support for drilling and nuclear power could help boost the slim prospects of getting a climate change bill through Congress. Passage of a climate change law in the US – one of the biggest producers of global warming pollution – is seen as crucial to securing a global climate change treaty. Wall Street expressed relief that Obama, after a week of populist rhetoric, adopted a softer tone in his address. Tom Donahue, president of the US Chamber of Commerce, said he welcomed the job moves. He told Reuters: \"I think it is a recognition that everybody is getting down to the reality [that] what keeps people happy or not happy, what is going to get us out of the recession or not, what is going to address the deficit or not is jobs, jobs and jobs.\" Richard Trumka, president of the biggest union in the US, the AFL-CIO, welcomed the concentration on job creation. \"We need more than 10 million jobs just to get out of the hole we're in. We want healthcare fixed. We want our leaders to break the stranglehold of Wall Street and the big banks and make them pay to repair the economic damage they created.\" Main points of Obama's address Job creation Most of Obama's speech was devoted to tackling the 10% unemployment rate, with a promise to create 1.5 million jobs in the coming year. Health reform Obama said the Democrats were so close to passing the bill to expand health insurance coverage to 30 million more Americans, that they should not walk away from it. But he failed to say how they intended to get it through Congress. Spending freeze To take account of voter concern about the scale of federal spending, he confirmed a spending freeze from next year. But this does not include the biggest federal spending areas, such as Medicare, Medicaid and social security. Gay rights After complaints from the gay community that he had failed to fulfil campaign promises, he promised to ask Congress to repeal 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell', the present compromise that governs gays in the military, in favour of a policy that would let them serve openly in the military. Help for students About a million students on graduating would only be required to pay 10% of their income on student loans. Climate change Obama signalled he would continue to push his energy and climate agenda, but did not use the phrase \"global warming\", unlike last year's address when he talked about the \"ravages of climate change\". He did not explicitly mention a carbon cap and trade bill – though it is widely understood to be at heart of the \"comprehensive\" energy bill he endorsed. Democrats Called on them not to run for the hills just because of the defeat last week in the Massachusetts race for the US Senate. Republicans Called for a bipartisan approach to politics, which is unlikely to happen. He warned the Republicans against being obstructionist, hinting they would be punished by the electorate for this. Foreign affairs He spent only nine of his 71 minutes on foreign affairs and said nothing new."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/mar/25/jeremy-leggett-solarcentury-under-attack-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-25T21:00:01Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Leggett: caught between low carbon and high-voltage rows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/25/jeremy-leggett-solarcentury-under-attack-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/mar/25/jeremy-leggett-solarcentury-under-attack-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Leggett: caught between low carbon and high-voltage rows","bodyText":"A tiny doorway next to a BetFair shop in south London is the unassuming headquarters of Solarcentury, a company that arguably stands to gain most on 1 April when the feed-in tariff – or \"great green rip-off\" as some call it – comes into force. The company, or at least its founder, is at the heart of the next phase of Britain's low-carbon revolution by encouraging homeowners to fix panels on their roofs to generate renewable energy. But while executive chairman Jeremy Leggett should have been devoting 24 hours a day preparing for the busiest period of his commercial life, he has been forced to spend some of his time fighting off an unexpected assault by environmentalists in the Guardian blogosphere. The irony is that Leggett is an ex-Greenpeace employee and, as a former Imperial College geologist, a powerful and knowledgeable ally to the environment campaigners on a range of issues, including \"peak oil\" – the point when global demand outstrips supply. The debate over whether the feed-in tariff costs too much for the expected carbon reductions rumbles on but even this \"social entrepreneur\", who has always enjoyed a good tussle with more traditional foes, admits he has had enough of swapping increasingly fraught online words with George Monbiot, Chris Goodall and other notable greens. \"It certainly perplexed me,\" he said. \"If I did not know the individuals involved, I'd have presumed that this is the nuclear industry pushing back at a time of imminent possible success for the renewables industries. They [atomic power firms] have declared a form of war, with EDF and E.ON having this line to government that says 'You can have nuclear or you can have renewables, but you can't have both', when previously they argued you could have both. \"But I know the actors [environmentalists] so I know it is not possible [for them to be nuclear lackeys], but George and Chris must know how damaging it is at this time. At the very minimum it is annoying that George has come out with this heady rhetoric, yet as far as I know did not actively engage in the government's long consultation on the issue.\" A third career The bruising public blog encounters and equally robust private email exchanges have taken the gloss off what should have been an exciting time for a company such as Solarcentury, which has a 50% share of the domestic market. Has public confidence been eroded by the argument? \"No, the phone lines have been ringing constantly and although the government has tailored the tariff for the domestic sector we are also getting interest from the commercial sector. The tariffs just about work for commercial companies so we can expect growth in that market as well, I think. So it's very encouraging.\" This is in many ways what Leggett has been waiting for since 1999, when he set up Solarcentury wanting to do something very practical about climate change after six years of campaigning on it for Greenpeace. He likes to think of it as his third \"career\" following a period of academia at Imperial College. From next week homeowners installing typical 2.5 kilowatt solar panels could earn up to £1,000 through selling clean power back to their electricity companies or reducing their own electricity bills, government claims. Leggett disputes Monbiot's assertions that the whole cost of the scheme to the public will be in the region of £8.6bn and represents a tax on the poor, who will end up paying for the tariff in higher bills. But he gives some ground to critics who worry that the feed-in tariff will become some kind of magnet to unscrupulous businessmen trying to sell poor-quality products to poorly advised homeowners trying to go green. \"We are really careful about who we do business with, and all the products have to be checked through the government's micro-power certification scheme, as it does elsewhere and which costs us £250,000 annually worldwide. \"We are very well aware of what can happen and that the industry is only as strong as its weakest link. I am optimistic that industry and government can work together to shut out the cowboys in a way that the double-glazing and solar thermal sectors have singularly failed to do historically. I say that with fingers crossed.\" But he also expects an influx of larger companies from the US and elsewhere that could push down prices for users and give Solarcentury – now partly owned by a large utility, Scottish &amp; Southern Energy – a run for its money. So how much of the public cash being injected into this new initiative will stay in Britain? Solarcentury, which provides builders and others with panels but also undertakes its own projects, says it sources materials all over the world but half the products it uses are assembled at a Sony-owned plant in south Wales. Leggett has also crossed swords with Monbiot over the latter's claim that it is an \"impossible dream\" to build up a proper British renewables products industry given the competition from low-cost areas such as China: \"I say that is needless defeatism because the global market is pitifully small. Seven gigawatts of solar was installed last year, the equivalent of seven nuclear power plants, and to think we cannot catch up and have a fully integrated national industry is needless defeatism.\" And this is an area where Leggett's scary view about the world running out of oil much faster than anyone expects neatly gels with the need to promote a self-standing renewables sector. \"Security of energy supply is going to be a real issue so should we not be deliberately building a vertically integrated renewables industry on the British Isles? I think the world is going to change dramatically and globalisation, of necessity, is going to be massively set back by the unaffordability of oil, so trade routes are going to shrink and there is going to be an incredible explosion of independent thinking. \"Companies and governments are going to think much more than they do now about this. We need to be making much more stuff at home. We can't be dependent on markets far overseas.\" Leggett has pushed the peak oil debate on to the political agenda by getting an increasingly broad church of industrialists – such as Sir Richard Branson, Brian Souter of Stagecoach, and Philip Dilley of Arup – to come on board. The bandwagon seems finally to have made its impact on the UK government, which is softening its former position that peak oil was being over-hyped. He still enjoys campaigning. He was in Copenhagen for the climate change talks (boasting about travelling there by boat, not plane) and even at the Oxford Literary Festival, arguing the toss on nuclear power. He has written three books about energy and climate change and you have to wonder if, in his mid-fifties, he has yet another \"last career\" left in him. and retreats to the executive chairmanship of the company he founded.Understandably, if this son of a science teacher from Hastings who now lives off Holland Park in central London has thought about it, he is not going to muse on that to the media. Leggett admits the only other job he really wanted was a professional golfer – but that was at the age of 17 and today it's hard to imagine this green on the green.

The number of claimants for jobseeker's allowance (JSA) has doubled in most areas from the low points achieved in the mid-2000s, showing how the \"bankers' recession\" has spread inexorably across the country, contrary to earlier hopes that job losses could be contained within the City and financial services. The research, by the University of Manchester's Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change (Cresc), paints a worrying picture ahead of the election. In August 1999, the number claiming JSA was 1.2 million. It fell to 770,000 in 2004 but by August 2009 was nearly 1.5 million. The latest figure is 1.6 million. Under-25s account for almost a third of claimants in most regions. London is least affected, with a quarter of claimants under 25. This week is a crucial one for economic data, with figures due on unemployment, retail sales, inflation and GDP. The UK registered a fragile return to growth in the last part of 2009, but if the number tips back into negative territory, it will be a devastating blow for the government. Many of the old industrial regions that suffered during the Thatcher era have been further blighted by the recession, with true unemployment far higher than the official national rate of 7.8% once benefits other than JSA are added in. Almost 27% of the working-age population of Merthyr Tydfil, the worst hit town in Great Britain, are claiming some form of state help linked to joblessness. Other places with more than 20% on jobless benefits include Liverpool, Glasgow, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Blackpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Dundee and Burnley, and pockets in the south such as Hastings and the London borough of Hackney. High levels of incapacity benefit claims are strongly associated with former industrial districts, because of links between long-term unemployment and ill-health, and because sympathetic doctors may have registered patients as sick to save them the stigma of the dole. In more prosperous areas such as Runnymede, south and west Oxfordshire, Rutland and Wokingham, the equivalent claimant rates are between 5% and 6%. Most of the pain is concentrated in the one-time manufacturing hubs, which missed out on the boom years because entrepreneurialism and private sector job creation failed to compensate for the factory and mine shutdowns. The majority of new jobs were generated by the public sector, leaving such areas highly vulnerable to cutbacks in state spending. Cresc says 5 million people are claiming \"out of work\" benefits; and more than 7 million are employed directly or indirectly by the state. Dr Adam Leaver of the University of Manchester said: \"More than 40% of the UK's working population is dependent on the state for benefits, for their job, or for their income. When they try to take the axe to public spending, politicians must be aware of the impact this will have., particularly in the regions. \" Other regional trends A separate report by PricewaterhouseCoopers found business leaders around the country to be cautiously optimistic, despite concerns about the fragility of the recovery and reliance on public spending. In five out of the eight regions surveyed – the north of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the south-west and the Midlands – business leaders expressed fears that spending cuts after the election could destroy the recovery. Business has been boosted by public sector spending on infrastructure, including the £800m redevelopment of Reading station, work on Birmingham New Street station and its airport, London Crossrail and the 2012 Olympics. Planned government investment in nuclear power in the north may offset further rises in unemployment, the report suggested."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2011/jun/12/observer-ethical-awards-winners-2011","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-11T23:05:32Z","webTitle":"Observer Ethical Awards winners 2011","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/jun/12/observer-ethical-awards-winners-2011","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2011/jun/12/observer-ethical-awards-winners-2011","fields":{"headline":"Observer Ethical Awards winners 2011","bodyText":"Conservation Award: Thameside Nature Park The act of conservation is often taken rather literally as preserving something that's already there. But this year's Conservation Award, kicking off the Observer Ethical Awards, in association with Ecover, goes to a local wildlife organisation seeking to create something new and ambitious. Essex Wildlife Trust's plan is to turn an 845-acre landfill site on the north bank of the Thames into a living landscape for wildlife and people. It could so easily not have happened. Thurrock doesn't have an abundance of green space and industrial creep is strongly in evidence – there is a move afoot to build a huge container port nearby. So there was an urgent need to carve out some green land for the communities of Tilbury and Standford-Le-Hope who have lived for so long next to one of Britain's biggest landfill dumps. Until December last year, this is where six boroughs of London sent their rubbish by barge. By Easter next year it will be unrecognisable, transformed into a living wildlife landscape with wetland, reedbeds, grassland (which, subject to analysis of the substrate, could be used for grazing cattle), ponds, scrubland and fledgling woodland. The judges admired the way the Trust had taken on this huge project with gusto, signing a 99-year lease to develop the land and building on a raft to counteract any subsidence. There were no half measures. Runners-up: Good Catch, Peak District Environmental Quality Mark Ethical Kids Award: Savvy BOB Our judges loved the Savvy BOB – a hybrid bat- or birdbox produced by Years 8 and 9 and Duke of Edinburgh students from Savio Salesian College in Bootle. They prounounced it both \"savvy\" and very well executed. This is also the view of renowned bat authority Charlie Liggett, chairman of the Merseyside and West Lancashire Bat Group, who told us: \"I was very impressed with the standard of design and quality of construction. I have never seen a similar type of construction, incorporating the design features for bats and birds; simple but ingenious. This design has a bright future.\" In fact the BOB is the perfect residence for wildlife under pressure (there are two different-sized access doors to help species discriminate). The students from the Savio Salesian College had already determined that, despite a healthy bat population in Merseyside, there was a dearth of roosting places. Once the design concept was drawn up theyestablished a production line in the CDT roomtwo lunchtimes per week and the first £1,500-worth of BOBs were produced and sold to Knowsley Safari Park. Our judge, Deborah Meaden, also praised the business nous of our winners. As you have to speculate to accumulate, gifts of the BOB were made to the Queen and Prince Charles, both of whom replied with glowing endorsements. Future plans for the team (and the generous bursary given by our sponsor Ecover) include a bat and bird conservation project for the wider region and working with nearby Altcourse Prison to increase production.

Some time in the mid-60s James Lovelock, a scientist of international distinction, and his friend William Golding, destined to win the Nobel prize for literature, were taking a walk near the Wiltshire village of Bowerchalke, to which they had both retreated to escape the conventions of gainful employment. Lovelock expounded his almost mystical idea that the Earth and all the plants and animals that inhabit it are a massive, self-regulating entity. Life and Earth are one. All that Lovelock lacked was a name for his hypothesis. Golding, master of literature, had the answer: Gaia, mythological goddess of the Earth. The problem was that Lovelock thought Golding was suggesting \"gyre\", a sort of giant whirlpool in the ocean. \"They're not self regulating,\" he laughs. \"We walked on for 20 minutes talking at complete cross purposes.\" If it had ended up as the Gyre Hypothesis, Lovelock may have suffered less flak from evolutionary and mathematical biologists as eminent as Richard Dawkins, Stephen Jay Gould and John Maynard Smith. They all sniped at the new-ageist notion of a self-regulating living Earth in which the evolution of all species is coupled through their shared environment. Lovelock protests Gaia, the goddess, is just a metaphor. The name has stuck. And \"in private\", he says, most opponents now admit he's right. It's paradoxical that Lovelock, the futurist, lives more like an 18th-century scientist, pottering in a barn that doubles as his lab. He was born in Letchworth in 1919, son of Nell, who worked in a pickle factory, and Tom, who had done six months' hard labour for poaching. They moved to London and James had to take a job at a photography company to help support his ageing parents. \"I learnt more science there than I did at university,\" says Lovelock. \"The most important thing they taught me is never, ever to cheat.\" The owner recognised his talents and paid for him to attend evening classes at Birkbeck College, and he won a place to study chemistry at Manchester, worked for a while on a Quaker farm, and then, in 1941, went to the Medical Research Council's National Institute in Hampstead as a research student. He \"wandered around the institute\" asking people for problems to solve – \"a wonderful way of getting around,\" he says. \"As soon as they hear you can invent something they come with their problems – a great way of making friends.\" He tells the story of making a device to measure mercury vapour and discovering that a pressure chamber designed to study the physiological reactions of divers was so saturated with mercury it would have killed anyone who used it. Early in the Second World War he registered as a conscientious objector. His views changed as news of Nazi atrocities emerged, but when he tried to enlist he was turned down because his research on ways of shielding soldiers from burns was considered more important. In 1961, after 20 years at the National Institute, just as he was beginning to feel that his work was \"dotting Is and crossing Ts\", Lovelock got a letter from Nasa inviting him to join the team working on the Viking programme, which hoped to detect life on Mars. Lovelock's job was to design sensors to measure the composition of the planet's atmosphere and soil. He recalls a pivotal event in 1965, in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. He was writing a paper with the astronomer Carl Sagan when a colleague burst in with news that French scientists, using equipment on Earth, had found that Mars is wrapped in a cloak of carbon dioxide. Lovelock immediately saw that this said more about the Earth than about Mars: our atmosphere is far from an inert equilibrium. It has changed dramatically through the 4.5bn years of its existence, and some of that change was undoubtedly caused by living things. His advice that the Viking probe was \"a waste of time\" fell on deaf ears. The mission went on, and two of Lovelock's instruments are still up there on the surface of Mars. \"I can look in the sky when Mars is visible and get a bit of pleasure from it,\" he says. After his return to Britain and self-exile to Wiltshire, he invented a device capable of detecting tiny concentrations of substances in the atmosphere, including the CFCs then used as refrigerants and aerosol propellants. A grant application to support the research failed but, in 1972, the Natural Environment Research Council offered him free passage on their research ship, the Shackleton. His measurements, compared with data from the manufacturer DuPont, produced the scary conclusion that most of the CFCs ever manufactured were still up there in the atmosphere. That was the start of the realisation that the ozone layer was being destroyed by our fridges and deodorants. It was a piece of practical environmental science that set standards for international co-operation and global action. It's hard to avoid the impression that Lovelock relishes his maverick image. He has been at the forefront of dire predictions about the consequences of global warming. \"Before this century is over billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic where the climate is tolerable,\" he wrote in 2006. Yet he is vilified by the Green movement for his enthusiasm for nuclear power. \"The public perception of the danger of the nuclear is that it's possibly the greatest danger there is,\" he responds. \"But the greatest danger is climate change itself.\" He is withering in his criticism of the \"scam\" of commercial exploitation of renewable technology – \"to produce solar voltaic energy in Britain does nothing except benefit German industry\" – and is still seen as an outsider by the stuffier cliques of academe. Yet, despite his gloomy prognostications – \"I think we expect too much of our scientists,\" he warns – he still bubbles with excitement at the possibility that cataclysmic disaster might be prevented by inventive science, ocean pumps, say, or nanoparticles injected into the high atmosphere. Grassroots Award, sponsored by Timberland: The Bristol Bike Project In a city that's become known for its parking problems the Bristol Bike Project offers a comprehensive strategy for anyone looking to ditch the car by repairing, reusing and rehousing unwanted bikes. The judges felt it went far further than being a green Band-Aid because it helps people from \"all walks of life get out on two wheels\". It is amazingly effective at involving a cross section of the community, running everything from designated cycling courses for women to a \"bike kitchen\" for repairs. Sean, a recovering drug addict, joined the project's Earn-A-Bike scheme, which provides bicycles for underprivileged and marginalised groups. He worked every day at the project's workshop to fix up a donated bike. \"This is tangible and I can see what it's done for me,\" he says. \"You get 16- to 60-year-olds in here. I can't explain the vibe, but I just feel comfortable. To whoever donated my lovely Raleigh bike [he has spent hours fixing it up in a dedicated workshop] I'd like to say thank you… I can cycle past drug dealers. This is freedom in my mind and financially. I can go to meetings without worrying about the bus fare. And I've lost half a stone.\" Runners-up: Liftshare, Putting Down Roots Ethical Fashion Award: Pachacuti Back in 1992 Carry Somers (above, centre) finished her PhD in Native American Studies and went on to help one of the most marginalised of the South American producer groups: Ecuadorian traditional panama hat manufacturers. She established Pachacuti, meaning \"world upside-down\" in the Quechua language, and followed the exhausting trail of events and trade shows to convince people that it was worth paying for an authentic and beautifully produced panama. By 2009 Pachacuti had become the first company in the world to be able to put \"Certified Fairtrade\" on its hats. This is no mean feat. Pachacuti has had to accredit every strand of straw used in its business, including the producers on the coast of Ecuador and the inland groups of weavers. Somers's business is also strikingly producer-centric with easier-to-weave styles introduced to allow arthritic older weavers to continue working. When she leaves for Ecuador the night after the Ethical Awards ceremony, she's taking a bag of rulers with her. \"I got some hats with funny brim sizes and it dawned on me that our weavers never use a ruler. When I specified 10cm brims they hadn't got a clue what I was on about.\" Pachacuti's hats go from functional and fashionable (\"It was important to develop the range so we could keep the work constant, and our weavers enjoy weaving different patterns and colours\") to high-end panamas with a silk band in peacock tones. At the Chelsea Flower Show last month these flew off the stands. \"Someone tweeted 'What could be more middle class than panama hats at Chelsea?'\" says Somers in a weary tone, \"but the interesting thing is that this is the link between some of the world's most marginalised producers and western consumers.\" A point that wasn't lost on this year's judges, who deemed Pachacuti best in class. Runners-up: Christopher Raeburn, Veja Global Campaigner Award: Greg Valerio Gold has a bad reputation,\" says Greg Valerio, winner of this reader-voted category, \"not least for corruption.\" Estimates suggest there are in excess of 100m artisanal gold miners across the world. The miners are sitting ducks for exploitation at the hands of multinationals while the small-scale nature of their business means they've gone unnoticed by economists, development theorists and governments. Yet their methods for recovering gold often cause terrible toxic pollution. Counting the cost of gold is enormous. Valerio, who also has quite a reputation (the editor of a jewellery trade magazine once called him \"the most dangerous bastard in the industry\") has worked to bring traceability, transparency and ecological standards to disorder and chaos. His company, CRED, pioneered handmined and chemical-free gold and he became an activist hellbent on taking a clean supply chain right back through the markets and dealers to the mine and miners. His conviction that the British consumer would buy clean gold from a certified supply chain led him to Harriet Lamb, director of the Fairtrade Foundation. They began work on the world's first transparent chain, from mine to retail. \"She really stuck her neck out. Without her it wouldn't have happened.\" In 2009, with the advice of the late Anita Roddick to \"bail out when you've reached your social objective\" ringing in his ears, Valerio handed CRED over to his business partners and devoted his attention to making Fairtrade gold a reality. The lobbying finally paid off this year. Valerio launched the world's first Fairtrade, Fairmined and ecologically certified gold. The first batch was turned into red carpet jewellery by goldsmith Anna Loucah and worn by Ethical Awards judge Livia Firth to the Oscars. Valerio says, \"We now have the best gold story in the world. The idea of Fairtrade gold with a traceable and transparent supply chain is a compelling idea.\" Runners-up: Avaaz, Greenpeace Local Retailer: The People's Supermarket Created by chef Arthur Potts Dawson, the store brings sustainable choices and a vibrant co-operative to London.

The company, which runs most of Britain's fleet of reactors and which reported a 50% slump in profits yesterday, has held talks with local communities around four possible sites. Bill Coley, the chief executive, said it was important to halt the discussions at some stage and start the serious planning and building phase. \"I think it's really important that the country gets on with this. We have a very old generating fleet and the UK needs new capacity. \"We can't meet our climate-change obligations without nuclear. It's just got to be done,\" he said. British Energy expects to be at the forefront of a new-build programme with EDF of France, which has tabled a takeover offer for the British firm that has been agreed by its board. Coley said he was waiting for the green light from his shareholders and the European competition authorities. The British Energy chief defended the £12.4bn deal, which came under renewed attack from some in the City, with the brokerage Evolution Securities saying that it significantly undervalued the power company. \"We continue to consider the action by the British government in forcing the bid through as wrongheaded - but as we say, the offer is a done deal,\" said Lakis Athanasiou, an analyst at Evolution. The United Nations environment programme called recently for a green new deal that would kickstart a faltering global economy by switching public money from carbon-intensive generation to clean-energy projects. Coley said nuclear new-build would offer similar benefits. \"It would bring a tremendous amount of investment into the country, create hundreds of jobs and would be great business for the domestic supply chain in this country,\" he said. British Energy, which operates 15 reactors at eight nuclear power stations, posted a 49.7% fall in first-half earnings yesterday, but said it hoped for a better second half. The group's pre-tax earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation in the six months to September 28 fell to £257m from £511m a year ago, owing to power station shutdowns and lower electricity output. It said it had put aside £2m to meet possible liabilities from using the failed investment bank Lehman Brothers as a counter party. The company has seven reactors out of action due to unexpected or routine repairs but Coley said five would return before the end of December. The group said there was potential to improve its output and performance in the remainder of the year. \"We're looking forward to a good second half,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/belief/2009/nov/17/islam-indonesian-muslims-religious-environmentalism","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-17T12:00:01Z","webTitle":"Helping Islam's green shoots grow | Nazry Bahrawi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/nov/17/islam-indonesian-muslims-religious-environmentalism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/nov/17/islam-indonesian-muslims-religious-environmentalism","fields":{"headline":"Helping Islam's green shoots grow","bodyText":"In battling climate change, Indonesian Muslims have led their counterparts elsewhere in promoting the idea that Islam must not be a fair-weathered faith when it comes to environmental degradation. They did so without the prodding of a grand conservation blueprint such as that unveiled at this month's UN-funded Alliance of Religions and Conservation meeting at Windsor Castle. Among the plan's many targets is the transformation of the 10 most sacred Islamic cities into eco-friendly sites in the next five years. Rather, Indonesian activists have acted independently to push for the greening of Islam in a movement that could be traced back some two decades when discourses about environmental conservation first appeared in the rhetoric of the Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), Indonesia's two largest Islamic grassroots organisations. In recent years, both have set up branches focused on implementing environmental programmes. For instance, the NU is working closely with the ministry of forestry to battle the depletion of trees brought about primarily by illegal logging in Indonesia's national forests. Two years back, a group of NU clerics even went as far as issuing a fatwa against the government's plan to build a nuclear power plant in central Java. They reason that nuclear fallout is plausible as Indonesia is situated along the seismically active Pacific \"Ring of Fire\" fault line. Even Islamic boarding schools or pesantren – once considered a hotbed of extremism – have turned over a green leaf. For instance, the Ilmu Giri school conducts programmes for farmers to replenish trees in their vicinity. Its founder, Nasruddin Anshory, preaches that the felling of one tree must be replaced by the seeding of two. Meanwhile, the nation's environment ministry has launched an eco-pesantren programme in about 90 schools in the Yogyakarta province to impart practical knowledge on preserving and developing the environment. In a world suffering from an environmental deficit, Indonesia's godly green shoots are a positive sign. Yet they could also wither. If mismanaged, the positive hype generated by the surging Islamic eco-activism could quickly degrade into an eco-jihad. This warning was issued by leading Indonesian environmental activist Fachruddin Mangunjaya. While he downplays the possibility that green causes could be hijacked by extremist groups, he cautions that a confrontation could break out between the state and lay Muslims if Indonesia's national council of religious leaders continues to protest against the government's plan to build a nuclear power plant by 2016. Furthermore, implementation of conservation programmes has been wanting in some areas. In the past several years, the practice by Indonesian farmers of clearing farmland by burning vegetation has been widespread, bringing about the south-east Asian haze. Such glitches suggest that Indonesia is not yet a model of religious conservationism. To this end, one of the nation's foremost tasks should surely be to translate its eco-activism into a comprehensive eco-theology. Here, Indonesia should propound an Islamic philosophy of environmentalism that is not just flora-centric but fauna-friendly too. Yet Indonesian Muslims have only demonstrated a proclivity for the former. Embracing such an ideal is tricky considering that meat consumption is a natural part of the Islamic way of life. While it is unrealistic to expect Muslims to stop eating meat, the burgeoning halal industry in Indonesia – and other parts of the Muslim world too – runs the risk of degenerating into a capitalistic venture that sees animals existing merely to satiate man's needs. Averting such an unscrupulous commodification of Islam necessitates a re-interpretation of the term khalifah in the oft-quoted Surah 2:30 of the Qur'an that describes man's role on Earth. Scholars have popularly interpreted khalifah as \"vicegerent\", implying that man is a supreme ruler over other beings. Such an interpretation justifies the indiscriminate exploitation of animals. If Indonesians are serious about religious environmentalism, they would be the first to heed Birmingham-based Islamic environmental activist Fazlun Khalid's proposal to reinterpret khalifah as \"vice-regent\". This latter term denotes that man's mandate on Earth is to not to rule but merely act in the name of another higher authority – namely, God. Muslims are thus required to treat other living beings with trepidation and humility. Such a paradigm shift would naturally give rise to efforts to treat cattle humanely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2008/nov/17/freedom-of-information-sellafield","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2008-11-17T17:53:27Z","webTitle":"Ed Miliband to exempt Sellafield consortia from Freedom of Information Act","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/17/freedom-of-information-sellafield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2008/nov/17/freedom-of-information-sellafield","fields":{"headline":"Ed Miliband to exempt Sellafield firms from Freedom of Information Act","bodyText":"Ed Miliband, the energy and climate change secretary, is to exempt from the Freedom of Information Act the new US-led private consortia taking over the running of Britain's biggest nuclear facility at Sellafield next Monday. The move comes on top of a decision by Malcolm Wicks, the former energy minister, to make the taxpayer liable for any accidents at Sellafield, which is in Cumbria, exempting the firm from the national requirement to pay the first £140m of any bill for leaks or radioactive contamination. It comes as the Speaker of the Commons has granted an emergency debate on Wednesday to Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West, who is demanding an explanation of why Wicks broke parliamentary procedures in rushing through the exemption from liabilities for the new consortia. Wicks used emergency procedures to inform Edward Leigh, the chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, of the proposals, and told MPs the documents had been put in the House of Commons library. Earlier this month it was discovered that the documents announcing the proposed exemption were not put in the library until October 14 - 75 days after the closing date for objections. In the meantime, the government had signed the deal with the consortium led by American firm URS Washington, French firm Areva and the UK company Amec for the £6.5bn contract on October 6. Leigh has since wanted the procedures reopened so MPs could have their say but Miliband has refused. In a letter placed in the library he said: \"Any proposals to rescind the prior approval of the nuclear indemnity or to subject it to a further process of review would completely undermine the contractual position that has been established between Nuclear Decommisisoning Authority and NMPL (the consortia), putting the very completion of the competition in jeopardy.\" The NDA confirmed yesterday that Sellafield Ltd - as the new organisation will be known - would be exempt from the FOI laws because it is a private company. The spokesman added, however: \"Since the NDA still owns the land and buildings people will still be able to make requests through us about Sellafield. They will not be able to request information directly from the consortia.\" Bill Hamilton, the head of \"stakeholder communications\" at the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, posted a comment to a blog on the issue last month suggesting that some liabilities might be met after all. He wrote: \"All the bidders for the Sellafield contract offered to meet some of these potential costs (these are still confidential as we have not yet transferred the shares to the winning consortia) … But, the principle has been established that these consortia will take initial responsibility for liabilities … outwith the £140m they are required by law to have insurance for.\" Details should be released at a later date."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/apr/12/pakistan-nuclear-weapons-security-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-12T18:52:56Z","webTitle":"Pakistan nuclear weapons at risk of theft by terrorists, US study warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/12/pakistan-nuclear-weapons-security-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/apr/12/pakistan-nuclear-weapons-security-fears","fields":{"headline":"Pakistan nuclear weapons at risk of theft by terrorists, US study warns","bodyText":"Pakistan yesterday came under increased pressure over its nuclear arsenal when a Harvard study warned of \"a very real possibility\" that its warheads could be stolen by terrorists. The rising concern about poorly-guarded nuclear weapons and material was the subject of an extraordinary two-day summit which began in Washington yesterday. Last night, Ukraine became the latest country to volunteer to give up its stores of highly enriched uranium (HEU), which can be used in weapons, and switch its research reactors to low-enriched uranium. There was still considerable anxiety at the Nuclear Security Summit over the safety of more than 2,000 tons more HEU and weapons-grade plutonium stored in 40 countries. There were also persistent doubts over the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Pakistan's prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, assured Barack Obama the country has an \"appropriate safeguard\" for its arsenal, understood to consist of 70-90 nuclear weapons. However, a report by Harvard University's Belfer Centre for Science and International Affairs, titled Securing the Bomb 2010, said Pakistan's stockpile \"faces a greater threat from Islamic extremists seeking nuclear weapons than any other nuclear stockpile on earth\". Experts said the danger was growing because of the arms race between Pakistan and India. The Institute for Science and International Security has reported that Pakistan's second nuclear reactor, built to produce plutonium for weapons, shows signs of starting operations, and a third is under construction. At their White House meeting on Sunday, Obama pressed Gilani to end Pakistan's opposition to an international treaty that would ban the production of new fissile material for nuclear warheads, plutonium and highly enriched uranium (HEU), but the Pakistani leader showed no signs of bowing to the pressure, US officials said. Pakistan's insistence that India reduces its stockpile first prevented talks on the fissile material cutoff treaty from getting under way in Geneva last year. Yesterday, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, added to the pressure on Pakistan by calling for talks at the multilateral conference on disarmament to start, warning that \"nuclear terrorism is one of the greatest threats we face today\". Both the US and Britain have declared themselves satisfied with Pakistan's security measures for its nuclear weapons, despite the rise of the Pakistani Taliban and other extremist groups. But yesterday's Harvard report said there were serious grounds for concern. \"Despite extensive security measures, there is a very real possibility that sympathetic insiders might carry out or assist in a nuclear theft, or that a sophisticated outsider attack (possibly with insider help) could overwhelm the defences,\" the report said. It also warned that weaknesses remained in measures Russia had taken in recent years to guard its nuclear stockpile, the world's largest. The nuclear security summit, which began yesterday in Washington, brings together leaders and officials from 47 nations, with the aim of focusing global attention on the danger of nuclear terrorism. The summit will endorse Obama's goal of locking up the world's stockpiles of plutonium or HEU within four years. The Harvard report warned that the world \"is not yet on track\" to meet that deadline. Its author, Matthew Bunn said: \"Sustained White House leadership will be needed to overcome complacency and convince policymakers around the world to act.\" As a contribution to the aims of the summit, the US and Russia are due to sign an agreement in Washington to take 34 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium out of their reserve stockpiles and use it for the generation of nuclear power. Other leaders are being called on to make concrete pledges in the main session today. Last week, Malaysia adopted much-delayed export controls to prevent its ports being used as channels for the black market in nuclear equipment. Last month, Chile shipped all the HEU from its research reactors to the US for safekeeping."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/2012/dec/11/gay-marriage-commons-statement-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2012-12-11T09:01:00Z","webTitle":"Cameron questioned by MPs on policing, crime and green policies;  Politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/dec/11/gay-marriage-commons-statement-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2012/dec/11/gay-marriage-commons-statement-live","fields":{"headline":"Cameron questioned by MPs on policing, crime and green policies;  Politics live blog","bodyText":"• David Cameron has suggested that the government will soften its \"secret courts' legislation in the face of criticism in the Lords. The justice and security bill started in the Lords and peers have inflicted several defeats on the government. Giving evidence to the Commons liaison committee, Cameron was asked whether the government would accept a Lords defeat saying the judge should always decide whether the new closed material proceedings (CMPs) are used. Cameron replied. In terms of discretion, it will always be a judge who decides whether [closed material proceedings] is appropriate. Sir Alan Beith, the chair of the liaison committee and chair of the Commons justice committee, said that that answer suggested that the government was accepting amendments proposed in the Lords. At that point Cameron said it was for Kenneth Clarke, the minister dealing with the bill, to announce the details. At one point Cameron said the new law was necessary because, under the current rules, the government was having to pay compensation to some \"unsavoury people\" because the security services could not use the evidence they needed to defend themselves in open court. Afterwards Clare Algar, the executive director of Reprieve, criticised this stance. The reality is that the government has settled cases because there has been clear evidence they were mixed up in serious human rights abuses ... If he really does have nothing to hide, why won't the Prime Minister list which cases it is that require such a dangerous departure from the proud British tradition of fair and equal justice? • Cameron has said that it would be a mistake to rule out gas as a long-term source of energy and that shale gas could be \"transformative\". This is what he told the committee. It may be that this gas revolution is really quite transformative and there is going to be a lot more gas and the price won't be as expensive. That may be true, that may not be true. We just don't know. But I think it would be a big risk just to ignore what is happening in the gas market. We should have an open mind and we should take part in fracking and unconventional gas because this might be a revolution that we should be involved in. If we ignored it completely, you could be giving your economy much higher energy prices than is necessary. This is important because America's success in unconventional gas is giving them very low energy costs and actually cutting their carbon at the same time. They are actually seeing their country re-industrialise. If we tie ourselves to unnecessarily expensive policies we would be making a mistake. • Cameron has defended his decision to block David Kennedy as permanent secretary at the Department for Energy. Kennedy, chief executive of the Government's own independent advisory body on greenhouse gas emissions, was vetoed by Downing Street even though he had the support of Ed Davey, the energy secretary. Cameron said he did not want to talk about individuals. But he suggested that Kennedy did not have enough commercial experience. Having settled on the energy policy, the most important thing we need now in the Department of Energy and Climate Change is actually commercial experience, the ability to do deals. I want to see wave upon wave of investment coming into Britain to build our nuclear-power stations, to invest in the North Sea, to build green tech, green jobs, green investment. Now we've got a determined energy policy, let's get out there and sell it to the rest of the world. That's the priority. • Cameron has said that he will consider using a proposal from the home affairs committee to use trading standards officers to crack down on the sale of \"legal highs\". (See 4.20pm and 4.22pm.) • A Tory MP has claimed that Cameron's support for gay marriage is putting his chances of winning the 2015 election at risk. Brian Binley made the claim in an open letter to Cameron. Having been an office holder in the Conservative party for fifty-three years, I find it difficult to remember a time when the party’s leader in government failed consistently to chime with the natural instincts of our supporters. There is a wide – and growing—gap on a number of issues. The media frenzy of the last week-end over gay marriage arising from your premature observations has resulted in the creation of organisational factions within the party squabbling in public over the issue. Countless activists are feeling driven to give up their much-needed support for the party, and, as any legislation progresses, this injury can only get worst .... The very instincts and core of our party are based on recognising the knowledge of those who went before us, and Conservatives should progress on that foundation. It pains me that the present leadership seems intent on disagreeing with those basic tenets on an all-too-frequent basis, and we only have a short time to turn the situation around. I implore you to recognise that our current course is one which imperils our prospects for victory in 2015, and to take the steps that, as a leader, will put it right and create a platform for the majority Conservative government that this country so desperately needs. But Nick Clegg said that gay marriage would soon become normal. At the heart of all this is a very simple idea, which is that language matters, and that wherever you find love and commitment you should be able to call it the same thing when celebrating it - namely marriage. That will very quickly seem very normal to many, many people in this country in the years ahead. • Lord Hunt, the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, has said he will shortly announce the members of a \"transition board\" as a first step to establishing a new press regulator. • The Conservative MP David Davis has backed Nick Clegg's call to send Theresa May's \"snooper's charter\" legislation back to the drawing board. • Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has unveiled plans for new cancer screening programmes to help the UK reach the lowest cancer mortality rates in Europe. As the Press Association reports, pilot programmes to screen over-55s for bowel cancer will be launched in five areas in England. The scheme will enable doctors to detect and remove polyps before they turn cancerous and catch cancer earlier - when it is more treatable. • Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's deputy first minister, has accepted opposition demands for an emergency statement to the Holyrood parliament after José Manuel Barroso indicated that an independent Scotland would have no automatic right to inherit any of the UK's EU opt-outs. In evidence to a Lords committee, John Swinney, the Scottish finance minister, said he did not accept the claim from Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, that an independent Scotland would have to reapply for EU membership. Barroso's argument was \"implausible\", Swinney said. • Theresa Villers, the Northern Ireland secetary, has told MPs that the loyalists rioting in Belfast bring shame on the Union flat. No-one can be in any doubt about this Government's support for the union and its flag, but those people engaged in the kind of violence we have seen in the past few days are not defending the Union flag. There is nothing remotely British about what they are doing; they are dishonouring and shaming the flag of our country with their lawless and violent activities. They discredit the cause they claim to support. • The Labour MP John Mann has asked the parliamentary commissioner for standards to investigate Maria Miller's expenses claims. (See 2.48pm.) • Britain's aid spending watchdog has said that it is impossible to assess whether European Union aid money is being spent effectively. • Boris Johnson has appointed leading City economist Gerard Lyons as his chief economic adviser – to the consternation of critics who point out this brings to seven the number of advisers serving the London mayor on a six-figure salary. That's all for today. Thanks for the comments. It's over. Anyone still awake? If so, I'll post a summary for you shortly. Cameron says he has been particularly influence by Paul Collier, the \"guru\" who wrote The Bottom Billion. Sir Malcolm Bruce, the Lib Dem chair of the international development committee, goes next. Cameron says he thinks trying to eliminate absolute poverty internationally is achievable over a generation. The world is trying to develop new goals to replace the millennium development goals, he says. Cameron is on a UN panel working on this. He thinks the new targets should be \"simple and inspiring\". Eliminating absolute poverty within a generation is an example, he says. Cameron says Britain used to have national housing targets. But that did not lead to more homes being built. Communities had no incentive to build homes, he says. Clive Betts, the Labour chair of the communities committee, asks if Nick Boles, the planning minister, was expressing government policy when he said that 3% of land might need to be built on to provide homes. Cameron says there is no government target. But he watched some of Boles' performance on Newsnight. He thought he was \"quite effectively\" making the point that some building would have to take place on green field sites. Britain is not building enough houses, he says. He says he represents a rural area. In villages people might accept new homes if they think they will be consulted. But they are opposed to the idea of being housing estates being approved without their say. Betts says he thought Cameron was saying earlier that there was too much consultation. Cameron tells him he should have been a barrister. He wants decision making to be localised, he says. Adrian Bailey, the Labour chair of the business committee, is asking the questions now. Q: Why won't you speed up allowing the green investment bank to borrow? The government has allowed borrowing for infrastructure projects. Cameron says the green investment bank has £3bn in its account. It does not need to borrow now. Treasury guarantees can be extended to green projects, he says. Q: But why shouldn't the green investment bank have the right to borrow on the private market? It will in time, he says. They're now on badgers. Cameron says the last government just refused to take decisions about culling badgers. This government was prepared to take a difficult decision, he says. But it was postponed for logistical reasons. Some 26,000 cattle were destroyed last year, he says. \"We looked at the science and we took the right decision.\" The Daily Mail's Tim Shipman, chairman of the press gallery, thinks the liaison committee isn't doing a particularly good job. Cameron says privatisation led to the water industry being able to attract massive investment. That would not have happened if water had been queuing behind other priorities, like health. Anne McIntosh, the Conservative chair of the environment committee, goes next. Q: What takes priority? Sustainability or growth? They go together, says Cameron. He recalls visiting eastern Europe. Environmental degradation went alongside economic failure. Cameron says the government has a \"very progressive set of green policies\". He says some in the green movement want the government to rule out gas. They want nuclear plus renewables plus energy efficiency. Cameron says that would be a mistake. The government has set out a subsidy regime for renewables, and a policy regime for nuclear. But it has an open mind on gas. If it rejected \"unconventional gas\", it could be shutting off a supply of cheap gas. America is using \"unconventional gas\" and it is becoming re-industrialised. Joan Walley, the Labour chair of the environmental audit committee, goes next. Q: How is your vision being developed? Cameron says the government has been the first to produce a green paper on the natural environment. Carbon emissions are being cut. The government is on course to meet its carbon reduction targets and its renewable energy targets. He says the government has given renewable energy suppliers guarantees up to 2017. Cameron says he wants renewable energy, nuclear energy and gas. But there's an unanswerable question about gas. No one knows how effective carbon capture and storage will be, he says. Q: Will you champion the economic advantages of leading Britain to a low-carbon future? Cameron says he does support further steps on energy efficiency. In most areas, politicians are accused of making too many speeches and not doing enough. In this area, the opposite is the case. The policy is fixed, he says. Now the government has to go out and sell it. Tim Yeo, the Conservative energy committee chairman, goes next. He says he supports Cameron on gay marriage. He would like to support him on green issues too, but he does not know who speaks for the government on these issues. Cameron says he is proud of his government's green record. But these are complicated issues. It takes time to get them right. As to why he blocked David Kennedy's appointment as permanent secretary at the Department of Energy, Cameron says it would be wrong to comment on individuals. But he thought it was very important to get people with commercial experience into the department. He wants it to start striking deals with energy companies. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative chairman of the Treasury committee, is asking the questions now. (Tyrie is also a campaigner against extraordinary rendition.) Tyrie says the extraordinary rendition compensation cases could be heard in court without the need for the new \"secret courts\" procedure being created by the government. He quotes Lord Macdonald, the former director of public prosecutions, criticising the government's plans. They could lead to something that produces less than justice, he says. Cameron says that, under the current system, the government is having to pay compensation because it cannot fight cases in court. Sometimes it is having to settle with some \"unsavoury people\". Public interest immunity (PII) certificates would not help, because they involve material being withheld from court, not disclosed to it, he says. Tyrie says the government has gone down \"amendment by amendment\" in the Lords. Q: Will you restore discretion to the judge as to whether to use the closed material procedure (secret hearings) route, and as to whether it can consider the PII route first? Cameron says the judge should have discretion. Beith says that sounds like a concession. Cameron says he cannot say any more. Kenneth Clarke has to make announcements on this. As for whether the PII route has to be exhausted, he thinks that would make things too cumbersome. Hywel Francis, the Labour chairman of the joint committee on human rights, is asking the questions now. He says his committee was worried by Cameron's comment about wanting to get rid of equality impact assessments. Cameron says he is not saying that he wants equality to be ignored. He just wants to cut unnecessary bureaucracy. Equality should be considered at all stages of policy making. For example, when the government decided to freeze public sector pay, it realised that this would impact disproportionately on women. That is why the government decided to exempt the low paid. And here's what the home affairs committee report said about legal highs. The market in new psychoactive substances is changing quickly, too quickly for the current system of temporary banning orders to keep up. Forty-nine new substances were found in Europe last year, a rate of development which makes additional measures critical. At the moment, businesses are legally able to sell these products until such time as they are banned with apparently no legal consequences when they lead to death or long-term illness. We recommend that the Government issue guidance to Local Authority trading standards departments, citizens advice bureaux and other interested parties on the action which might be taken under existing trading standards and consumer protection legislation to tackle the sale of these untested substances. A restaurant which gave its diners food poisoning, a garage which left cars in a dangerous state, or a shop which sold dangerously defective goods could all be prosecuted for their negligence. Retailers who sell untested psychoactive substances must be liable for any harm the products they have sold cause. It is unacceptable that retailers should be able to use false descriptions and disclaimers such as \"plant food\" and \"not for human consumption\" as a defence where it is clear to all concerned that the substance is being sold for its psychoactive properties and the law should be amended. Cameron said he had asked his officials to consider this carefully. (See 4.20pm.) Vaz is still asking the questions. Q: Do we need to be tougher on those who launder drug money? Cameron says he has not read the home affairs committee report on drugs yet. But he was interested in what it said about legal highs. He has asked his team at Number 10 to look at that. There should be tough penalties for money laundering, he says. Q: Should the family of Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse who was found dead after accepted a hoax call about the Duchess of Cambridge, be given the full facts of what happened? Yes, of course, says Cameron. It's a terrible case. There are lessons to learn. Having the full facts does not bring anyone back. But it helps people come to terms with what has happened. Keith Vaz, the chair of the home affairs committee, is asking the questions now. Q: Are you worried the police are demonstrating against the government? Cameron says he wants to put on record his support for the police. They are facing a number of challenges. But they are meeting these challenges \"very effectively\". Crime is falling, he says. Q: Does it concern you that 26 of the 43 police forces either do not have a chief constable, or have a chief constable about to retire? Cameron says he has had these figures checked. They were in the Sunday Times. He does not think they are right. There are some extremely capable chief constables, he says. His own chief constable in Thames Valley, Sara Thornton, has managed to deal with spending cuts without much impact on the frontline. Q: And what about the turnout in the police and crime commissioner elections? Turnout was \"disappointing\", Cameron says. When the next elections come, turnout will be higher. Q: You have criticised judicial review. Won't your plans to change this affect \"the little man being pushed around by the executive\"? Cameron says judicial review has become \"a mechanism to slow down the things you don't agree with\". Cameron says every community penalty should have an element of punishment. We need to be more intelligent about how we punish people, he says. He also says he is in favour of tracking tags. Q: Will there be a white paper or a green paper on rehabilitation? Cameron says he will have to write to Beith about this. Sir Alan Beith, the committee chairman, is asking questions. Q: Are you changing the criminal justice system because you need to restore public confidence in it? Or do you want to make it tougher? Both, says Cameron. The two go together. He says retribution is a part of sentencing. Cameron is giving evidence now. He says the government has changed the criminal justice system in some areas, for example knife crime. David Cameron will be giving evidence to the liaison committee at 4pm. The hearing will last for 90 minutes and it will cover two topics. • Future direction of policing and the criminal justice system • Green government I will be covering it in detail. Here's a short, and rather eclectic, reading list. • Hopi Sen on his blog says that public attitudes to welfare may be changing, but not quickly enough to help Labour. There is a political danger here for the left. If the tide is turning “our way”, but not running very far, very fast or particularly strongly, the risk is that we see the voters turn away from the harshest judgements of the government on society, but we mistake the depth and impact of that swing, and so spend rather a long time waiting for the pendulum to move far enough towards us that we can grab onto it. Perhaps the best way to express this is that roughly twice as many people feel benefits are too high today than did in 1983, 1987 or 1991. Similarly, In 1987 and 1991 twice as many people felt more should spend more on welfare benefits than do today. These high levels of support did not herald a new progressive dawn The pendulum probably is going to swing, but it has a loooong way to swing. • Ed Miliband tells Grazia that his wife admires Nick Clegg's wife for not getting involved in politics. • The Huffington Post reveals that Arthur Scargill has now become a fashion icon. David Cameron met the King of Jordan in Downing Street today. Afterwards Cameron's office issued this (exceedingly bland) read out of what was discussed. The prime minister met His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan in Downing Street this afternoon. They discussed Jordan's upcoming parliamentary elections and the importance of encouraging public participation in this important next step of political reform in Jordan. The leaders also discussed a range of Middle East regional issues. They shared analysis of the situation in Syria, and agreed on the need for international action to end the conflict through a political transition, to respond to the deteriorating humanitarian situation and to support the National Coalition as they continue to establish themselves as a credible, democratic and inclusive alternative to the Assad regime. On the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, the leaders agreed on the urgency of restarting direct negotiations for a lasting and just two state settlement. On Egypt, they stressed the importance of an inclusive process to agree a new constitution. The home secretary joined the first part of the meeting and briefed the leaders on the Abu Qatada case. The King and the prime minister emphasised the commitment in both countries to continue to work closely together to find a solution that would allow his return to Jordan. Maria Miller's announcement that she is going to change the law to ban the Church of England from conducting gay marriages is already generating an angry protest. Here's Chris Byrant, the Labour MP and former vicar. Here's Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary. And here's Ben Bradshaw, the Labour former culture secretary. Maria Miller has been interviewed on Sky, and she was asked about the Daily Telegraph story about her expenses. This is what she had to say. My expenses are absolutely in order. They have been audited twice. This is not something that I think should get in the way of what is such an important announcement today. For the record, here is the note from the Maria Miller press release explaining how her \"quadruple lock\" to ensure that religious groups do not have to conduct gay marriage against their will will actually work. no religious organisation, or individual minister, could be compelled to marry same-sex couples (or to permit this to happen on their premises); it will be unlawful for religious organisations, or their ministers, to marry same-sex couples unless the organisation’s governing body has expressly opted in to do so (and that would mean the religious organisation itself opting in, the presiding minister having consented and the premises in which the marriage is to be conducted having been registered); the Equality Act 2010 would be amended to ensure that no discrimination claim could be brought against religious organisations or individual minister for refusing to marry a same-sex couple (or allowing their premises to be used for this purpose); and the bill will explicitly state that it would be illegal for the Church of England and the Church in Wales to marry same-sex couples, or to opt-in to do so. Canon law – which bans the marriage of same-sex couples – will continue to apply. That means that it would require a change in both primary and Canon law before Church of England and Church in Wales would be able to opt in to conduct same - sex marriages. And here's Patrick Wintour's story with full details of the announcement. Listening to a Commons statement isn't always a constructive use of one's time, but sometimes it really does illuminate the political scene. After spending 90 minutes reporting on Maria Miller and gay marriage, two points stand out. • David Cameron has launched a full-scale, US-style culture war - and it has pitted him against the traditionalists who provide the Conservative party with its bedrock support. If, like me, you're an urban, Guardian-reading, small-l liberal, you may find it hard to imagine why anyone should object at all to gay marriage. But, even if this is mystifying to metropolitan society, there are clearly some people who find the idea profoundly unsettling. They may not be representative of society at large, but a large number of them are probably active members or supporters of the Conservative party and this afternoon their parliamentary representatives stood up and let rip. At times it was almost as dotty as hearing the House of Lords debate the age of consent, but their objections are clearly very genuine and cannot just be dismissed as marginal. A colleague recalls hearing a government aide say when the policy was originally announced that there would not be much of a fuss over gay marriage, and Cameron probably never imagined he would be provoking a backlash quite this strong. After today, he will have no illusions. The Conservative party seems to be at war. • Maria Miller's emollient, non-judgmental approach worked quite well. At the beginning of the statement, Yvette Cooper invited Miller to confront what we used to call the \"Tory Taliban\". Miller rejected this approach and instead she made a point of being as unprovocative as possible, endlessly telling her critics that she understood their concerns. It was bland and dull, but in political terms it was probably very sensible. It was an inflammatory situation, but she contained it well. The session is over. John Bercow says 62 backbenchers have contributed. I haven't been keeping a score, but it feels as if most of them were Tory MPs spluttering with outrage. I will post a summary soon. Richard Drax, a Conservative, says his constituents in South Dorset do not support gay marriage. He accuses the government of \"arrogance\" and asks by what right it is \"stamping its legislative foot\". Penny Mordaunt, a Conservative, says that as an unmarried heterosexual woman, she will certainly consider the institution if the bill goes through. Mark Pawsey, a Conservative, says marriage rates collapsed in Spain after gay marriage was introduced there. Richard Graham, a Conservative, asks if Roman Catholic churches will be given the same legal opt-out that the Church of England is getting. Miller says there will be opt-outs for the Roman Catholic church and for the evangelical church. John Leech, a Lib Dem MP, says this has been a \"divisive\" consultation process. Craig Whittaker, a Conservative, says Miller says there is a \"negligible\" risk of a successful legal challenge. What is that in percentage terms? Miller says that case law has put this matter \"beyond doubt\". Marcus Jones, a Conservative, asks for an assurance that teachers who disagree with this will not fall foul of employment law. Miller says she understands these concerns. But the courts have been clear; individuals are entitled to their private views, she says. Andrew Selous, a Conservative, says the government is passing law directly contrary to what Jesus said about marriage. Miller says there have been other moments when marriage has evolved. Parliament has been a radical campaigner on this, she says. Robin Walker, a Conservative, says that \"in principle\" he supports the idea of extending marriage. But he is concerned about the impact on churches. Will they be protected from any extra costs they incur? Miller says the government is giving churches \"concrete assurances\". John Glen, a Conservative, asks why the government is pressing ahead with this when his constituents do not want it. Miller asks Glen to consider that people who support the government's view may not have been in touch with him. Miller says gay couples will be able to get divorced on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour if adultery does not apply. Matthew Offord, a Conservative, asks Miller if she is aware of the campaign to legalise polygamy that has started since gay marriage was allowed there. Miller says that marriage is between two people. Julian Brazier, a Conservative, asks what safeguards will be put in place to protect teachers who teach that marriage is between a man and a woman. Miller says that she would expect teaching to be done \"in a balanced manner\". Laurence Robertson, a Conservative, says many people are \"deeply offended\" by these proposals. Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem deputy leader, says he supports gay marriage. But it wasn't in any election manifesto, and it was not in the coalition agreement. He urges Miller to proceed carefully, and to make it clear that civil marriage is different from religious marriage. Stephen Williams, a Lib Dem MP, says this is a major strike for equality. Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative, praises Miller for the \"sensitive\" way she is making the statement. This is not about changing society; it is about recognising the way in which society has already changed, he says. Jim Shannon, a DUP MP, says 99.9% of the people in his constituency are opposed to gay marriage. Miller says the consultation was not about whether the government would proceed with this measure, but about how it would implement it. Labour's Jonathan Reynolds asks if gay couples will have the option of a civil partnership or a marriage. Miller says they will be able to choose either option, partly to protect those people already in civil partnerships. Gerald Howarth, a Conservative, says 62% of people think marriage is between a man and a woman. The government has no right to impose this \"massive social and cultural change\", he says. The consultation was \"a complete sham\". Labour's Diana Johnson asks if Miller is happy about the established church once again opting out of equalities legislation. Miller says it is important to give the church the certainty it wants. Sir Tony Baldry, a Conservative and a church commissioner, says marriage does embody the distinctiveness of men and women. Miller says Baldry has put his case clearly. That's why there is a very clear protection for the Church of England. Peter Bone, a Conservative, says he was up late last night reading all three party manifestos at the 2010 election. Not one of them mentioned gay marriage, he says. How dare Miller bring in this measure? Miller says she respects Bone's views. The contract for equalities, that sat alongside the Conservative manifesto, said the party would consider the case for gay marriage, she says. Back in the chamber, Anne McIntosh says that in Denmark the churches have tried to get the exemption that is promised in the consultation document. But that has been ruled illegal, she says. Miller says European case law makes it clear that this is a matter for nation states. And it's not just the language in the consultation document that is quite vivid. (See 1.10pm.) The Daily Mail's James Chapman has tweeted this. Stewart Jackson, a Conservative, says the consultation is reminiscent of a Liberian election. The plans are \"a constitutional outrage and a disgrace,\" he says. The government has \"no electoral mandate\" for this. My colleague Patrick Wintour has been tweeting about the announcement. Maria Miller expects same sex marriage law in place by early 2014 with 60 % of Tory MPs at present backing her plans. Bill in January. Any same sex marriage conducted by CoE vicar, if CoE collectively opposed to such marriages, will not be recognised in law. Grounds for divorce in a same sex marriage will include adultery, but non-consummation will not be grounds for annulling a same sex marriage. There are footnotes in consultation paper on same sex marriage about \"lesser acts of sexual gratification\" that are quite vivid for HMG. Edward Leigh, a Conservative, suggests that the government cannot be trusted on gay marriage and churches. Originally MPs were told that civil partnerships would not lead to gay marriage. And then, when the government launched a consultation, it excluded allowing gay marriage in church. Here is the news release about the government's gay marriage plans. And here's the full text of the government's response to the consultation on gay rights (pdf). Labour's Chris Byrant says the government should not impose a lock on the Church of England because it may change its mind over gay marriage. Miller says that, if the church changes its mind, it can always ask the government to change the law. Miller says the government is not allowing heterosexual people to have a civil partnership because there is no significant demand for this. Roger Gale, a Conservative, says that he chaired the civil partnership bill committee when it was going through the Commons. At the time MPs were told that civil partnerships were not \"the thin end of the wedge\" and that they would not lead to gay marriage. When Nick Herbert asked his question, he said that this announcement would be widely welcomed by the public. Someone shouted loudly that this was wrong. The Tory MP Margot James has tweeted this. Another tweet from James suggests the heckler was wrong. Nick Herbert, the Conservative former Home Office minister, who is in a civil partnership, says today's announcement should reassure church groups. Miller says the \"quadruple lock\" should give clear reassurance to religious groups. Miller responds to Cooper. She appears not to like the tone of Cooper's anti-Tory comments. It is important to avoid \"polarising\" language on this, she says. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary and shadow equalities secretary, is responding for Labour. She starts by suggesting that Miller could have made this announcement yesterday. Labour introduced various measures to extend gay rights, she says. And it supports these plans. She urges Tory MPs who have opposed gay marriage not to use the hysterical language used yesterday. She urges Miller to promote these measures with confidence. Miller says disputes about wearing religious symbols have no bearing on marriage. Article 9 of the European convention on human rights says marriage is a matter for each individual state, she says. Marriage will remain a \"vibrant institution\" under these plans, she says. Miller says the chance of a successful legal challenge is \"negligible\". The quadruple lock system will \"iron clad\" protection in law, she says. First, there will be a declaration on the face of the bill saying no religious organisation or minister can be forced to marry a gay couple, or to permit a gay wedding on their premises. Second, the equalities legislation will be amended to make this clear. Third, the bill will say that gay couples cannot be married in a church unless that religious organisation has opted in to the system. That means, if a church opts out, an individual minister would not be able to conduct a gay wedding. Fourth, the bill will explicitly ban the Church of England and the Church in Wales from conducting gay marriage. Maria Miller is staring her statement now. Not so long ago marriage was dismissed as \"out of date\". But most people aspire to marry, she says. This consultation has been the subject of much debate. The government has also received 19 petitions on this. And some 228,000 people responded to the consultation. Marriage has had a long history of evolving. In the 19th century, groups like the Quakers were not allowed to marry unless they married in a Church of England church. In each century parliament has legislated to keep marriage \"relevant and meaningful\". Now there is another chance to extend marriage. Extending marriage to gay couples will strengthen the institution. • Miller confirms that religious organisations will be allowed to conduct same-sex marriages. But religious groups that do not want to marry same-sex couples will not be forced to do so, she says. She wants to be fair to gay couples, and fair to people of faith. The government is 100% clear: any church or synagogue or mosque that does not want to conduct a gay marriage will not have to, she says. • Miller says there will be a \"quadruple lock\" ensuring religious groups do not have to conduct gay marriage if they do not want to. Maria Miller, the culture secretary and equalities minister, is about to publish her proposals for gay marriage. This is what happened when she answered an urgent question on it yesterday. • George Osborne has announced that a mistake made relating to the nationalisation of Northern Rock will cost the taxpayer £270m. • The Office for National Statistics has released census data showing that over the decade the proportion of people saying that they are Christian has gone down 13 percentage points to 59%, the proportion saying they are not religious has gone up 10 percentage points to 25% and the proportion who are white has gone down five percentage points to 86%. There are more details of all the figures on our live blog. • Ed Balls has confirmed that Labour will oppose the coalition's plan to cap benefit increases at 1% for three years. He made the announcement during Treasury questions. • Osborne, the chancellor, has said that the next budget will be on Wednesday 20 March. • Downing Street has said that it will amend the draft bill extending internet surveillance in the light of criticism from a cross-party scrutiny committee. Earlier, in an interview, James Brokenshire, a Conservative Home Office minister, sought to play down the rift between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats on this issue. • Robert Chote, the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, has told MPs on the Treasury committee that if Britain were to lose its AAA credit rating, that would probably not have any \"noticeable impact\" on the cost of borrowing. It's not entirely clear that that would be providing any new information to the markets that they had not already managed to deduce from the information on which presumably the credit ratings agencies would have drawn their conclusion. I think we've seen other countries suffer that and it's not had an obviously noticeable impact on market views. As the Press Association reports, Chote also questioned the \"slightly debatable premise\" about measuring the default risk for a country that can print its own money. • The Ministry of Justice has announced plans to cut the number of fraudulent whiplash claims. • The Lords constitution committee has published a report saying that the government's defamation bill may not provide newspapers with a \"sufficiently robust and succinct defence\" against defamation claims on the basis that publication was in the public interest. • Theresa Villiers, the Northern Ireland secretary, has said she will make a statement in the Commons about the rioting in Belfast. • Ministers are planning to make some childcare costs tax deductible, the BBC has reported. Next year's budget will be on Wednesday 20 March, George Osborne told MPs in Treasury questions a moment ago. I'm doing an interview with Dave Prentis, the Unison general secretary, later this week. If you would like to suggest a question, do post it please at the bottom of this blog rather than at the bottom of the one you're reading now. There's a story in the Daily Telegraph today saying Maria Miller claimed parliamentary expenses for a home that her parents were staying in. (They were living with her family, Miller says.) This seems to have diminished her enthusiasm for giving interviews about gay marriage. You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today's paper, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here's the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must reads, here's the ConservativeHome roundup of today's political stories and here's the New Statesman list of top 10 comment articles. And here are four articles I found particularly interesting. • Vanessa Houlder in the Financial Times (subscription) says George Osborne’s “shares for rights” scheme would end up costing the Treasury £1bn. George Osborne’s “shares for workers’ rights” initiative could end up costing Britain £1bn a year in lost revenues, the Office for Budget Responsibility has warned, at the same time as the government battles to clamp down on tax avoidance schemes. The long-term potential cost of the chancellor’s policy, buried in an annex to the Autumn Statement’s costing documents, is likely to fuel controversy over the employment initiative that got the go-ahead last week in spite of a poor welcome from business. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the independent think-tank, attacks the government in Tuesday’s Financial Times for condemning tax avoidance as it “prepares to put another billion pound lollipop on the table”. He writes: “Just as government ministers are falling over themselves to condemn such [avoidance] behaviour, that same government is trumpeting a new tax policy which looks like it will foster a whole new avoidance industry.” • Rachel Sylvester in the Times (paywall) says the two coalition parties have given up pretending that they are bound together by common views. In the Lords, relations within the coalition have almost completely broken down. Lord Strathclyde, the Leader of the House of Lords, tried hosting joint drinks parties for Lib Dem and Tory peers. They have been quietly turned into separate Lib Dem and Tory events because, according to one peer, “the two groups couldn’t bear to be in the same room”. There is a growing sense of disillusionment on both sides. “We wake up every morning thinking — how can we make the country a better place? They wake up thinking: how can we screw the Tories?” says one Conservative Cabinet minister. “It’s like when the in-laws come round at Christmas and you get out the Monopoly set but you’re playing to different rules. We have a completely different attitude to power.” A senior Lib Dem sees it rather differently. “Nick is detaching himself from David Cameron and rightly so. We need to be equidistant between Labour and the Conservatives by the next election.” • Janan Ganesh in the Financial Times (subscription) says politicians need to show business more respect. Starbucks’ decision to capitulate by volunteering £20m of tax is not merely absurd but dangerous. Imagine an economy in which businesses decide their tax bill by gauging the popular pressure on them. Revenues would be impossible for the Treasury to predict. Companies with a public face, such as a chain of coffee shops, would be harassed into munificence while those doing obscure business-to-business trade go ignored. The basic fiduciary duty that companies owe to their shareholders’ economic interests would be lost ... A large part of the UK’s appeal as a place to do business is its reputation for predictable and responsible government backed by one of the world’s great legal systems. It matters, therefore, if politicians behave arbitrarily. It matters if the head of the Financial Services Authority announces that much of the business he regulates is “socially useless”, as if such a notion were measurable or at all relevant. It matters if mobs are indulged rather than defied. British politicians chuckled last month when they read about a French minister threatening to sequester a foreign-owned industrial plant to avoid job losses there. But such reckless political caprice is seeping in to the UK. Not all politicians are equally guilty. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor so often caricatured as a leftwinger, is a rigorous thinker who restrains his Labour colleagues’ urge to treat business as a branch of social work. George Osborne, the chancellor, was never much taken with Mr Cameron’s chocolate orange phase. But these grown-ups need to stand more assertively against the mob, and against irresponsible members of their own trade. It is not as if the UK’s elites have done so well at running the country that they can try their hand at moral and aesthetic questions too. • Steve Richards in the Independent says that David Cameron seems to be pursuing gay marriage for electoral reasons. I am sure Blair almost believed in locking up suspects without charge for 90 days but his view was sharpened by the knowledge the policy was popular. In the case of Cameron, Osborne and gay marriage we have evidence of simplistic political calculation. In the recent article for the Times in which the Chancellor generously outlined his strategy for the next election, the strategic importance of gay marriage was extensively highlighted. As he reflected on President Obama’s recent election victory, Osborne noted that: “President Obama’s high-profile endorsement of equal marriage for gay couples also enthused younger voters…. polls found that a majority of all Americans supported him on the issue.” The Chancellor then moved on to the situation in the UK: “It is worth reflecting that in Britain, as in America, a clear majority of the public support gay marriage, and an even bigger majority of women support it. That majority support is just as high in the North as it is the South, and it is equally high among all socio-economic groups”. Evidently Osborne hopes that support for the policy will soften the perception of the Conservative leadership – among women voters in particular. And he must hope that his stance will attract the approval of other voters from all regions and classes. As they embark on a whole range of ill thought through and in some cases outdated reforms, the Tory leadership has with this policy a shield marked “modern” – taking on some crusty old party members, archbishops and the Telegraph. In theory at least the dynamic works well for them. As I mentioned earlier, the census has got Christians down 13 percentage points. (See 9.53am.) As slumps go, Christianity is doing almost as badly as the Lib Dems. And now we're on the subject, here are the latest polling figures. Here are today's YouGov GB figures. Labour: 42% (no change since YouGov in the Sunday Times) Conservatives: 33% (no change) Lib Dems: 10% (no change) Ukip: 8% (down 1) Labour lead: 9 points (no change) Government approval: -32 (down 1) And here are the figures from TNS BMRB that come out yesterday afternoon. Labour: 41% Conservatives: 26% Ukip: 16% Lib Dems: 8% Labour lead: 15 points There's a live blog bonanza at the Guardian today. You've got me, focusing on gay marriage and (later) David Cameron at the liaison committee, but also wrapping up everything, as usual. You've got a live blog about the census figures, and the decline of religion. And now we've got a live blog covering the culture committee Leveson hearing, which will involve evidence from Lord Hunt, the Press Complaints Commisison chairman, and some chap called Alan Rusbridger. By international standards, English pupils are getting better at reading, doing worse at science and making no progress in maths, according to the Department for Education. This morning it has published the results of two international studies, the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) and the Trends in International Maths and Science Study (TIMSS). Pupils were tested in 2011. According to the department, the results show that English pupils have: fallen in science at age 10 – down to 15th out of 50 jurisdictions from seventh out of 36 in 2007; risen in reading at age 10 – up to 11th out of 45 jurisdictions from 15th out of 40 in 2006; plateaued in maths at ages 10 and 14 between 2007 and 2011, and in science at age 14. Elizabeth Truss, the education minister, claims that the results highlight the need for exam reform. These tests were taken in summer 2011 and reflect changes in the period 2006 and 2007 to 2011. The rise in performance in reading is encouraging but there is too long a tail of under-performance. The lack of progress in maths and the decline in science, linked to the removal of compulsory tests for all 11-year-olds, is a real concern. That is why we are driving forward the Academy programme and giving schools the freedom to make their own choices. That is why we are bringing in new rigorous exams that will be on a par with the best in the world and reforming the curriculum to focus on core arithmetic, algebra and geometry like high-performing jurisdictions. This is what they do in the world’s most successful education states - and we are following suit. David Cameron is meeting the King of Jordan today. The Press Association has filed a preview story. David Cameron will discuss the Government's long-running battle to have terror suspect Abu Qatada deported from Britain today when he meets the King of Jordan in Downing Street. King Abdullah's visit to Number 10 will provide an opportunity for them to address Qatada's latest success in evading his removal to stand trial in Jordan. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) last month upheld his appeal against deportation as it ruled that despite assurances from the Arab kingdom, it could not be sure evidence from witnesses who had been tortured would not be included in a retrial in his homeland. The government is appealing against the decision but Qatada - convicted of terror charges in Jordan in his absence in 1999 - remains in the UK on bail conditions including a 16-hour curfew, wearing an electronic tag, not using the internet, and not contacting certain people. It was reported today that he has moved house to what is believed to be a larger home in the greater London area. The prime minister said last month he was \"fed up\" that Qatada remained in Britain, following his release from Long Lartin jail. The Jordanian government, which has worked with UK ministers to try to facilitate his return, also expressed their disappointment with the decision. James Brokenshire, the Home Office minister, was on the Today programme this morning responding to the scrutiny committee's report about the draft bill to extend internet surveillance. Brokenshire is a Conservative, and he did his best to play down the significance of the Conservative/Lib Dem rift, insisting that the Home Office was willing to accept the committee's concerns. We are saying that we accept the substance of the recommendations from the joint committee's report. That will require work to amend the legislation ... We've already been working on this. It's not like we're at a standing start here. We've been working through this as the joint committee has been examining the evidence. We've been noting the points that has been said and therefore there is already work that is advanced in relation to making some of the changes on, for example, this balance on how much you actually state on the information that is required to be retained ... We believe that the changes that meet the substance of these recommendation can be met in a reasonable short order ... What we want to do is work through on these points, recognising that the deputy prime minister has set out his concerns and making sure that the substance of the recommendations from the joint committee are addressed. I've taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. My colleagues Paul Owen and Simon Rogers are covering today's census data on a live blog. Here are some of the key points they've identified. • The population of England and Wales on 27 March 2011 was 56.1 million. This is a 7% increase (3.7 million) from 2.1, and 55% of that is due to immigration. • One in six people were 65 or over (16%: 9.2 million). • 81% (45.5 million) described themselves as being in good or very good health. • The number identifying themselves as Christians is down 13 percentage points. In 2001, 72% (37.3 million) called themselves Christians. In 2011 that had dropped to 59% (33.2 million). • The number identifying themselves as having no religion has increased by 10 percentage points from 15% (7.7 million) in 2001 to 25% (14.1 million) last year. • 13% of residents were born outside the UK (7.5 million). Just over half of these (3.8 million) arrived in the last 10 years. • The number of cars and vans used by English and Welsh households increased from 23.9 million to 27.3 million from 2001 to 2011. There are now 12 cars per 10 households; in 2001 there were 11. London is the only region where the number of cars and vans is lower than the number of households. • In 2011 there were more people with degree-level qualifications or above, at 27% (12.4 million), than people with no qualifications (23%: 10.3 million). The Labour party will allow its MPs a free vote on the principle of allowing gay marriage in religious buildings. George Eaton has more details on a New Statesman blog. Theresa Villiers, the Northern Ireland secretary, will make a statement in the Commons later on the rioting in Belfast. This is what she told BBC News earlier. I've been in almost daily touch with the police service in Northern Ireland and they assure me they are dedicated to bringing these disgraceful scenes to a close and they assure me they are investigating the threats that have been made to elected representatives because that is a particularly disgraceful aspect of what has gone on. The idea that these people are trying to intimidate Assembly members, Councillors, even Naomi Long has received a death threat. It is utterly unacceptable and it is an affront to democracy that these threats are under way. The crucial thing is for these violent protests to stop. I think all the debates on the flying of flags needs to be taken with calm reflection, free from intimidation. That is the approach we need to build a genuinely cohesive and peaceful Northern Ireland, whether it is taking decisions on flags or other issues. I've taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. It’s groundhog day for Maria Miller. She was in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon answering an urgent question about gay marriage and this afternoon she’s back, making the formal announcement about the government’s plans. As Patrick Wintour reports in the Guardian today, some Conservative MPs are incandescent. The vehemence of Conservative divisions over same-sex marriage were exposed when one Tory MP said it would undermine “normal marriage”, another questioned whether polygamy would be legalised next, and a third claimed that European judges will soon force the Church of England to allow same-sex marriages against its will. A fourth Tory MP David Davies, the MP for Monmouth and chair of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee insisted he was not a bigot because as a boxer he had once trained with a gay boxer. He tweeted: “Once fought gay boxer. Respect &amp; like. trained with after bout so not bigoted. activists calm down – listen to other views.” We know what the government wants to do, but today we might get some clarification over the details. I will be covering the statement in full. Generally, it’s a busy day. Here’s the full diary. 9am: Elizabeth Truss, the education minister, gives a speech on international test results. 9.30am: Robert Chote, the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee on the autumn statement. 9.30am: Lord Heseltine, the former deputy prime minister, gives evidence to the Commons business committee about his recent growth report. 9.30am: Professor David Haslam, the chairman-designate of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, gives evidence in a pre-appointment hearing with the Commons health committee. 9.30am: The Office for National Statistics releases fresh data from the 2011 census. 10.20am: Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, speaks at the Britain against Cancer conference. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, speaks at the same conference at 3.45pm. 10.30am: Lord Hunt, the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, gives evidence to the Commons culture committee about the Leveson report. Alan Rusbridger, the Guardian editor, gives evidence at 11.15am. 10.30am: Steve Webb, the welfare minister, gives a speech on child maintenance reforms. 10.30am: Big Brother Watch holds a press conference on the government’s plans to extend internet surveillance. As Alan Travis reports, the publication of a report on the plans from a parliamentary scrutiny committee has triggered a deep split between Theresa May, the home secretary who is backing the plans, and Nick Clegg, who wants “to go back to the drawing board”. 11.30am: George Osborne, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons. 12.30pm: Maria Miller, the culture secretary, is announcing the governent’s plans for gay marriage in a statement to the Commons. Around 1.30pm: Theresa Villiers, the Northern Ireland secretary, makes a statement about the rioting in Belfast. Around 2.30pm: MPs begin a debate on the economy. 3.30pm: John Swinney, the Scottish finance minister, gives evidence to a Lords committee about the economic impact of Scottish independence. 4pm: David Cameron gives evidence to the Commons liaison committee about policing and the criminal justice system, and about green government. As usual, I'll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web. I'll post a lunchtime summary before Miller's statement, and another after Cameron has finished his evidence to the liaison committee.

The 34-page document, which forms the basis for the governing partnership, provides for 27 policy reviews and allows at least three opportunities for Liberal Democrat MPs to opt out of voting with the Tories in parliament. Many of the reviews are on central issues of government policy. The coalition programme – in effect a new joint manifesto – represents a blend of the two parties' pre-election programmes and was largely drawn up by Oliver Letwin, the senior Tory policy adviser, and Danny Alexander, Clegg's former chief of staff. The speed of the agreement, rushed through ahead of the Queen's speech next week, contrasts with the lengthy negotiations often held between coalition parties elsewhere in Europe. Cameron said the programme was a remarkable achievement, and Clegg said it was built on the principles of freedom, fairness and responsibility. In a foreword, the two men claimed they were offering both the \"big society\" and \"big citizen\" visions, saying it represented a blend of liberalism and conservatism. \"Though there are differences, there is also common ground,\" the programme states. Cameron and Clegg said the government's first priority would be to tackle Britain's record budget deficit, but stressed this would not prevent the government from pursuing a \"radical\" reforming programme. Tory sources later expressed delight that the plan for schools reform contained no role for local authorities in enforcing fair school admission policies. They also pointed to a pledge to \"simplify the benefit system in order to improve incentives to work\". This wording, they claimed, allows for welfare reform. But the government has retained a potentially expensive and egalitarian pledge to abolish child poverty by 2020, adding that the definition of poverty will not be changed from that used by the Labour government. No figure has been put on the proposed pupil premium to help disadvantaged children, and the document stressed that a high-speed rail system can only be achieved in stages, due to financial constraints. All key benefits for older people such as the winter fuel allowance, free TV licences and free bus passes are to be maintained. A dispute over the future of the British commitment to the European convention on human rights has been settled by setting up a commission, but any British bill of rights will incorporate and build on all obligations under the ECHR and ensure that these rights continue to be enshrined in British law. Eye-catching proposals include a crackdown on alcohol prices, an injection of private capital into the Royal Mail, 12 directly elected mayors in England's largest cities, a crackdown on irresponsible marketing to children, a gross profits tax on the national lottery and a new policy to allow political parties to hold open primaries to elect candidates in seats where an MP has held a seat for a long time. Anonymity in rape cases will be extended to defendants. The government has introduced a raft of new commissions or reviews, including into banking, human rights, the affordability of public sector pensions, Lords reform, employment rights, control order laws, sentencing policy, and the housing revenue account. There will be an autumn spending review, as well as reviews of stamp duty, legal aid, police officer employment, alcohol taxation, the Extradition Act, the renewal of Trident, and the representation of Scottish MPs at Westminster. Also sent for review are the control and use of funds of future receipts from the fossil fuel levy in Scotland, the future funding of long-term care, the taxation of non-domiciled residents, local government finance, higher education funding, support for part-time students in terms of loans and grants, the governance of national parks, a fair pay review in the public sector, the criminal records regime, family law, and vulture funds. In addition, Liberal Democrats are free not to vote with the Conservatives on nuclear power, recognition of marriage in the tax system and hunting. The sale of alcohol below cost price will be banned, and councils will be allowed to charge more for late pub licences to pay for more police. However, the 24-hour drinking laws will not be scrapped. The new government also pledged to freeze council tax in England for at least a year. It also suggests the government is pulling back from lifting the stamp duty threshold, which raises questions over its effectiveness. The two parties have given ground on prisons and criminal justice by ordering a review into sentencing policy. The right to request flexible working will be extended to all employees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2009/nov/02/simon-hughes-live-online","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-02T11:09:55Z","webTitle":"Copenhagen conversations: Post your questions for Simon Hughes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/nov/02/simon-hughes-live-online","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2009/nov/02/simon-hughes-live-online","fields":{"headline":"Copenhagen conversations: Post your questions for Simon Hughes","bodyText":"This week we're joined by Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrats' spokesman for energy and climate change, for the latest in our Copenhagen Conversations series.

The country's main generator of nuclear power had, at that time, been brought to its knees by plunging power prices, and had gone cap in hand to government for a bailout. It was an embarrassing failure for a company proudly privatised in 1996 by Conservative ministers who were keen to prove that even atomic power was not best managed by the state. But British Energy is no financial embarrassment now. It has generated profits of nearly £800m over the last two years although it is of primary interest to EDF for the ground it owns rather than the eight ageing nuclear plants and one coal-fired plant it runs. The nuclear sites - particularly Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex - are prime locations for a new generation of atomic facilities which EDF and a supportive UK government want at a time of increasing concerns about energy security and climate change. British Energy was created in 1995 with nuclear assets which had originally formed part of the state-owned Central Electricity Generating Board and South of Scotland Electrcity Board. Five English advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs) and the one pressurised water reactor from Nuclear Electric were put together with two AGRs from Scottish Nuclear. The remaining Magnox power stations, from Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, went to Magnox Electric, later to become part of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL). The Eggborough coal plant was purchased by British Energy in an attempt to diversify its portfolio. The business made a strong start to life on the stock market after 88.5% of the shares were sold by the government at 100p per share, raising £1.2bn from private investors, in July 1996. By September the following year, the share price had doubled and it was to go on to reach 750p at its best in early 1999. The company that generated nearly a quarter of Britain's electricity was benefiting from a strong rise in the cost of wholesale energy prices. It was not long, however, before the government's introduction of new wholesale trading arrangements changed the picture. British Energy's profits and shares began to rattle down as deregulation brought in new competitors who pushed down prices. In total, the price of wholesale electricity fell 40% in four years, although British Energy added to its own crisis with its ageing reactors increasingly prone to unexpected breakdown. By the middle of 2000, British Energy shares were back where they started at 100p each. Within 24 months, the company had run up an annual loss of £518m, had debts of more than £1bn and was fighting for its survival. In fact, most electricity generators were finding it hard to make money. Some rivals switched off their power stations, while at least one, TXU, went bust. Many of the big power companies survived the crunch because they had a retail arm which benefited from the lower wholesale prices. British Energy had no such prop. It had bought the Welsh electricity and the gas supplier Swalec in 1999 but, finding it impossible to pick up further assets at decent prices, soon sold it off again, to Scottish &amp; Southern Electric. The nuclear generator asked ministers to help by giving it exemptions from business rates and the climate change levy, the latter on the grounds that it was a low carbon energy producer. It also suggested it should be allowed to take over operations of BNFL's magnox power stattions to earn new revenues, but none of these initiatives came to anything. Robin Jeffrey, the then chairman of British Energy, said the company had no alternative than to seek government support while trade and industry secretary, Patricia Hewitt, insisted there was \"no question at all of taxpayers writing a blank cheque to British Energy and its shareholders.\" It was given a loan of £410m and its shares, suspended at the height of the problems, started trading again while ministers worked on a wider restructuring plan which would give bondholders more than 90% of the company's equity in a £1.3bn debt-for-equity swap. Small shareholders were all but wiped out in what was seen by some as a de facto renationalisation of a group which, for safety reasons, could never be left to cease operations. But the most controversial element of the deal was the fact that the Department of Trade and Industry agreed to take on £5.1bn of decommissioning liabilities. The government had arranged for a \"cash sweep\" under which its shares of the profits from British Energy were set aside to pay for clean-up, but then converted this into an equity stake. Ministers are now intending that a large element of the £4bn worth of sales proceeds going to the state for their remaining 35% holding can now be used to pay off any final bill for cleaning up the eight nuclear sites. The value of the business has increased dramatically since Britain gave the go-ahead to a new generation of nuclear power stations, setting no limits on nuclear expansion and adding momentum for a worldwide renaissance of atomic energy. In March, Gordon Brown and Nicholas Sarkozy said they would like to see Britain and France working together to help export their nuclear expertise abroad amid speculation that EDF was going to bid for British Energy and the French atomic plant designer, Areva, could be made a preferred bidder to win a potential £17bn clean-up contract for Sellafield. By May, EDF had emerged as the only possible bidder for British Energy, dashing hopes for an auction as other potential purchasers, RWE of Germany and Iberdrola of Spain, quit the race. In August the British nuclear generator said it was in \"advanced talks\" with an unnamed party about a possible offer. British Energy has seen its contribution to electricity production fall from a quarter to 14% due to a series of unexpected outages at its power plants, but EDF, which already operates around 80 reactors, is a serious enough buyer - and £12bn is no laughing matter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/audio/2008/aug/08/scargill.coal.nuclear","type":"audio","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-08-07T23:08:57Z","webTitle":"Arthur Scargill responds to claims that nuclear power should replace coal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/audio/2008/aug/08/scargill.coal.nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/audio/2008/aug/08/scargill.coal.nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Arthur Scargill: 'I know the dangers of nuclear'","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cif-green/2009/nov/30/84-months-counting-wind-solar","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-30T18:30:01Z","webTitle":"84 months and counting … | Andrew Simms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/nov/30/84-months-counting-wind-solar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/nov/30/84-months-counting-wind-solar","fields":{"headline":"84 months and counting …","bodyText":"On the eve of the Copenhagen climate summit we seem to be poised between the possibility of new directions for the world, and meek capitulation to environmental upheaval. Dr Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says we have just months to take large-scale action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. He calls on developing countries not to try to copy western consumer lifestyles. In an interview to be broadcast on the BBC, he adds that growth and rising GDP are an \"extremely harmful\" way to measure human progress. Pachauri's determination to think about fresh solutions, from championing less meat-eating to challenging bad economics, is a lesson to commentators who affect weariness and distaste at yet another reminder of the extreme consequences of our lifestyles. It's a call to rise above national and sectoral interests. But it's not easy. Point scoring in global talks often becomes more important to negotiators than preserving a planet fit for civilisation. Worse still, as the problem becomes ever clearer, a collective cultural \"Am I bovvered?\" seems to rise from the most materially comfortable and least likely to suffer. But are people really saying that it's just not worth fighting for the climatic conditions that make life both enjoyable and possible? If somebody threatened your child, what would you do? Only the sociopathic or comatose would sit by and let the people they love be threatened without acting. Yet inadequate climate action is the equivalent of inviting threats to our offspring. And in front of us there are clear but diminishing opportunities that really could solve the problem. We're still living in the grip of a consumption explosion. Our material consumption is rising at the same time that nature's ability to provide resources and absorb waste is weakening. Human overuse seems to be undermining available biocapacity. The latest data on humanity's global ecological footprint makes worrying reading. The UK's footprint makes our level of consumption even less sustainable: it would take at least 3.4 planets for everyone to live at our level. Globally we are using resources and pumping out carbon emissions at a rate 44% faster than the biosphere can take. It now takes just under 18 months for the earth to produce the ecological services humanity uses in one year. As Pachauri writes in the foreword to a new report, Other Worlds Are Possible: \"It is crucial that we engage in fresh ways of thinking about development and sustainability.\" Too often rich countries excuse their own inaction by pointing at the rising consumption of poor countries – as if that is the true problem. It's convenient, but ignores what many other voices from the global south are saying. Writing in the same report, the leading Indian economist Professor Jayati Ghosh takes a different view: \"The presumptions and aspirations of what constitutes a civilised life will have to be modified. The model popularised by 'the American Dream' is perhaps the most dangerous in this context, with its emphasis on suburban residential communities far from places of work, market and entertainment and linked only through private motorised transport.\" The Chilean economist Professor Manfred Max-Neef is similarly dissenting: 'Solutions imply new models that, above all else, begin to accept the limits of the carrying capacity of the earth: moving from efficiency to sufficiency and wellbeing.\" Some of those solutions are right under our noses, according to the energy researchers Mark Z Jacobson and Mark A Delucchi. Writing in the November edition of Scientific American, they describe how, by 2030, the world could shift to a virtually zero carbon energy system. Their model is based only on existing technology that can already be applied on a large scale, and excludes nuclear power and fossil fuels. It calls for, globally, the building of 3.8m large wind turbines (wind being 25 times more carbon efficient than nuclear power), 90,000 solar plants and a combination of geothermal, tidal and rooftop solar-PV installations globally. They admit the scheme is bold, but it follows Al Gore's challenge for the US to abandon fossil fuel power in the next decade. In terms of the physical challenge of producing so much renewable generating capacity, they point out that the world already produces 73m cars and light trucks every year. People forget, perhaps, the effort it took to get us hooked on oil in the first place. As Jacobson and Delucchi point out, starting in 1956 the US interstate highway system managed to build 47,000 miles of highway in just over three decades, \"changing commerce and society\". 84 months and counting ...

Ukip's manifesto contains a series of bizarre policy announcements on science, ranging from a rejection of the Commons Science and Technology Select Committee's findings on homeopathy, to a series of statements about \"climate extremists\". The Met Office comes in for particular scrutiny, with an odd pledge to link funding to the accuracy of its forecasts. Given that Met Office forecasts are generally considered to be among the best in the world and improving, that may not have the desired outcome. On the plus side, Ukip has presented a drugs policy more progressive than some, and is reasonably committed to environmental protection, if occasionally misguided on the issue. Viscount Monckton provided the answers to our questions – a surprising choice as spokesperson for its science policy considering he has so little credibility in the scientific community. Brian Cox: Science funding Do you plan to maintain Britain's science budget below the European average? Ukip's innovative approach to science funding is to set up a Royal Commission to investigate climate change in a court of law, and immediately cancel all funding \"connected with 'global warming'\" pending its outcome, thus wresting the science budget from the hands of \"rapacious extremists\". It is a policy that places Ukip squarely in the realm of fantasy. Since just about every national and international scientific institution on Earth accepts the evidence of humanity's impact on the climate, such a commission would almost inevitably conclude in science's favour. Ukip doesn't explain what it would do in the event of that outcome, having already crippled scientific research into potentially one of the greatest problems facing humanity this century. Ukip claims that the Royal Commission would allow scientists to \"reach a conclusion\" on climate change. The problem is that scientists reached a conclusion decades ago, and research shouldn't be halted on the basis that Ukip's members are incapable of keeping up with it, or don't like its findings. Even if a Royal Commission were set up as Ukip would like, it seems unlikely the party would listen to the results, given statements such as: \"The correct policy approach to the non-problem of 'global warming' is to have the courage to do nothing\" These are not the words of a party that is particularly open-minded about the outcome. Combined with its stated determination to destroy any institution or apparatus connected with solving the problem before a commission even reports, the impression given is of a party staffed by people who are far from rational. Alternative medicine If the balance of evidence suggests that a treatment does not perform any better than placebo, should it be supported by the NHS? \"The placebo effect is not fully understood, and should not be dismissed in favour of 'scientific' proof. If it works, it should be supported by the NHS ('mind over matter' etc.)\" Ukip has performed a U-turn over alternative medicine in the past year. Ahead of the European elections, its spokesman Tim Worstall was happy to declare, quite sensibly, that alternative medicines should be required to satisfy clinical trials and be regulated just like any other medicines. In contrast, Monckton's response to this question, that the placebo effect \"should not be dismissed in favour of 'scientific' proof\", was confused. Science doesn't dismiss the placebo effect. The rejection in Ukip's manifesto of the Commons Science and Technology Select Committee's detailed report on homeopathy is not explained, but if the party believes that it has evidence of the efficacy of homeopathy that the rest of us have not seen, then perhaps it would care to share it with the world. Simon Singh: Libel reform What will your party do to reduce the chilling effect of our libel laws on science? Currently there is no statutory public interest defence, so scientists risk running the gauntlet of London's High Court if they publish material they believe to be in the public interest, but that a major corporation or litigious charlatan believes to be libellous. Monckton's original response was a resounding \"no\", but a further response from the press office clarified things, suggesting a personal lack of familiarity with this issue on the part of its science spokesman. It seems Ukip is against the idea of a public interest defence, but would like to see the costs of libel law reduced. The problem, of course, is that this combination would make it even easier for companies to bring lawsuits like the one filed against Peter Wilmshurst, who is being sued for criticising a company's research findings at an academic conference. Open debate is the cornerstone of science, and Ukip does not appear particularly committed to preserving it. Climate change/Energy Should nuclear power be part of our country's strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions? How soon can we bring new plants online? \"UKIP has been calling for a rational, balanced approach to the climate debate since 2008, when extensive manipulation of scientific data first became clear\" The nature of this \"extensive manipulation of scientific data\" is unclear, but it seems Ukip's policymakers have spent a bit too much time surfing conspiracy sites on the internet. Meanwhile, Britain's energy demands will be met by commissioning \"enough fossil-fuelled and nuclear power stations to meet demand,\" which is fairly straightforward, although neither costed nor elaborated upon in Ukip's manifesto. David Nutt: Drugs policy To what extent should drug policy be based on scientific evidence? What evidence, if any, would you require to declassify a drug? Ukip's drugs policy is somewhat more liberal than that of the present government. A distinction would be made between medical use and recreational use, with restrictions placed on the sale and marketing of drugs for the latter. The severity of the restriction would, unlike the present system, be based on scientific evidence. Petra Boynton: Public health campaigns How will your party ensure public health/education campaigns are underpinned by evidence, and how will you evaluate their success? On the one hand, Ukip believes that public health policy should be informed by a \"mature evaluation\" of the scientific evidence. On the other, it disputes the results of such evaluations, with Monckton responding to this question by declaring that campaigns to reduce salt intake are based on \"the medico-scientific community who have whipped up unjustifiable fears\". The problem, again, is that while Ukip is happy to talk about evidence, it dismisses the evidence that is presented to it. Genetic engineering/Stem cell research Should Britain be at the forefront of research in these areas? What benefits do you believe such research will bring for society? Monckton's answer to this was rather quirky: \"Wherever stem cells can be obtained by means other than the killing of very small children, it is ethical only to obtain the stem cells by means that do not involve the loss of little lives.\" I can only assume that this is a reference to embryonic stem cells. They are generally obtained from surplus IVF embryos, rather than by killing very small children. Ben Goldacre: Pharmaceutical regulation Do you believe pharmaceutical companies should be forced to publish all the research data they have on the potential benefits and harms of drugs they manufacture? \"All scientists, whether in pharmaceutical, climatic or other research, should be required to archive all of the material on which they base their results, and to disclose all material known to them but not already in the public domain that may have a bearing on their results.\" This is a reasonably sensible policy, with some caveats. First, it is important to recognise that not all data can be published for a variety of reasons such as licensing issues, commercial confidentiality, data protection, patient confidentiality and so on. In addition, some datasets, in genome research for example, are simply too large for conventional web servers, PCs and storage media to handle. Second, researchers collecting data should have priority when it comes to analysing and presenting results – otherwise academics could be put in the unfair situation of spending years meticulously collecting data, only to see somebody else snatch the credit for the analysis. A final point, which I've argued before, is that an open access policy to data needs to have a proper infrastructure and support system behind it, to manage archiving while scientists get on with their work unhindered. Conclusions On science, Ukip is dire, with no credibility in the scientific community and candidates who have a demonstrably poor grasp of basic scientific principles, which perhaps explains its general disarray and flip-flopping in areas such as health. Ukip is the only significant party to support homeopathy, and the only party apart from the BNP still in denial over climate change. The appointment of Viscount Monckton as a science spokesman adds to the air of a party of old British eccentrics.

Load-shedding, the political euphemism that is used by everyone – be they state official, liberal intellectual or housemaid – to discuss the country's long, daily blackouts. Power cuts and energy shortage are nothing new for the subcontinent; in six decades of being, Pakistan's infrastructure has never been able to cope with basic rate of growth and demand for energy – let alone been able to provide unlimited, uninterrupted electricity for its people. And yet, the country's current energy crisis is unprecedented: in the last two years it has become nothing short of a national disaster. Just over a week since I arrived back in London – having spent six days criss-crossing the Punjabi province – and Pakistan is being held hostage to the most punishing heatwave in living memory. Record-breaking temperatures of 53C were recorded across the country last week, the death toll is consequentially rising even faster than the mercury. The heat is brutal, penetrative and unbearable to be caught outside in, but the real killer seems to be Pakistan's energy policy. Or, as it might be more accurately defined, the distinct lack of one. Up to 12 hours of the day are routinely being endured without electricity across the country. Cities and villages take it in turns to have the lights turned out … to keep them on. Tolerating the current heat without power, without working fans, fridges, air conditioning (for those lucky enough to have afforded installation in the first place) and light, is not just a matter of inconvenience though: heatstroke, food poisoning and dehydration are killing in their hundreds while the death of livestock, paralysis of small and large business and the real threat to livelihoods and families is hurting further. The wealthy will switch on their generators to keep a running supply of power every time the electricity trips; the poor are simply left to swelter and suffer. Foresight has rarely been a historic strength of Pakistani administrations, the last government failed to add a single megawatt of new power to the national grid under almost a decade of rule. The farcical current regime, led by Asif Ali Zardari, has been forced to scramble for a solution only to land itself between a rock and a nuclear place. An energy programme to tackle the problem long term, facilitated by the actual building of power plants and coal-mining projects (rather than through the financial aid pledged by Obama's administration), has been laid on the table by the Chinese government. Given that the two countries would be co-operating in a civil nuclear programme to build several new nuclear power plants, the project has been met with the wholesale disapproval of the US government. China has cited the rules under its membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which make it clear that no nuclear trade can be entered into with a country that has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. This, despite legislation being passed to enable similar nuclear trade between the US and India. Hypocritical twitchiness from the White House is nothing new. In this case, it does the US little favours in terms of its public perception from the region. Any attempt to block an essential power-generation deal between China and Pakistan will only be viewed with the same bitter contempt the public have for the daily US drone attacks to the country's tribal regions. Pakistan consumed just 0.39% of the world's total electricity consumption last year, but energy providers such as Pepco (a nationalised company) are still unable to cope and meet the 4,000-5,000 megawatt shortfall in electricity needed to keep powering the country. No new dams have been built or planned for, although almost a third of the country's electricity is generated through hydropower. Meanwhile, the Thar coalfield in Sindh (the second largest province in Pakistan) contains an estimated 175 billion tonnes of deposits. If a Chinese-funded coal-mining power project is to go ahead, this could provide decades of cheap (albeit highly polluting) power. The country also has vast reserves of natural gas. And yet, with 65% of the country's supply delivered by thermal power – mostly generated through costly imported oil – no steps have been taken to switch to natural gas power production. There is little doubt that Pakistan's ruling elite are to blame for short-sightedness, for being too greedily corrupt to install basic, decent utilities for the country's people. Now that moves could be made to correct this can only be a hopeful sign for the future. The Chinese policy, to offer trade and build projects rather than cash aid, is a sound one that further cements the historic relationship between the two countries. Unless the US has firm plans to propose a similar project, its intervention as a \"special ally\" is not only unwelcome but entirely unnecessary."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2009/nov/27/nuclear-power-reactor-design","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-27T00:05:14Z","webTitle":"Designs for new UK nuclear reactors are unsafe, claims watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/27/nuclear-power-reactor-design","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/nov/27/nuclear-power-reactor-design","fields":{"headline":"Designs for new UK nuclear reactors are unsafe, claims watchdog","bodyText":"Britain's main safety regulator threw the government's energy plans into chaos tonight by damning the nuclear industry's leading designs for new plants. The Health and Safety Executive said it could not recommend plans for new reactors because of wide-ranging concerns about their safety. The leading French and American reactors are central to plans for a nuclear renaissance aimed at keeping the lights on and helping to cut carbon emissions. The government needs to build a number of nuclear power stations in the next 10 years to replace old atomic and coal plants. But the HSE has to approve the safety of the designs before they can be built. \"We have identified a significant number of issues with the safety features of the design that would first have to be progressed. If these are not progressed satisfactorily then we would not issue a design acceptance confirmation,\" the agency concluded following a study of the latest French EPR and US AP1000 reactor designs. Kevin Allars, director of new build at the HSE, admitted frustration that the design assessment process was already behind schedule owing to insufficient information from the companies promoting the reactors and a lack of enough trained staff in his own directorate. The HSE's public report expresses \"significant concerns\" about the lack of separation between the safety protection and control systems on the EPR reactor design promoted by Areva and EDF of France. The safety body says another part of the reactor is \"not entirely in alignment with international good practice\". The report says it has raised a number of issues with EDF and Areva relating to the structural integrity of the EPR and it concludes: \"It is too early to say whether they can be resolved solely with additional safety case changes or whether they may result in design modifications being necessary.\" The design put forward by Westinghouse, the American firm now owned by Toshiba of Japan, is also criticised, with the HSE saying the safety case on internal hazards has \"significant shortfalls\". It criticises the company for a \"lack of detailed claims and arguments\" to support various assertions, while questioning aspects of the civil and mechanical engineering plans as well as the structural integrity and \"human factors\". It also complains that the reactor design was submitted in feet and inches rather than metric figures. Industry experts said the HSE was in a pivotal position to make or break the government's wider plans because it could delay the planned reactors from coming on stream from 2017. That is the time that ministers fear an \"energy crunch\" because most existing reactors will have been retired, many coal plants shut down and renewable power insufficiently advanced to take over. John Large, a leading nuclear consultant, said: \"The HSE as an independent agency will come under tremendous pressure to push through these designs. But if it stands up to [the] government and stops or delays these designs for two or three years until it is satisfied then developers could lose interest and we could fall behind in the queue of countries waiting to build nuclear.\" Allars said he had not received any pressure so far from the government. While he had beefed up his staff and hoped to quicken the speed of his work, he insisted it was not his problem to worry ultimately about delays. \"I am independent of government, and independent of industry and I will do what I need to protect society from any dangers of nuclear power. I will only be in a position to agree a generic design assessment if I get the right information [in future] to do that,\" he said. The HSE said it might allow so-called exclusions over some of its concerns under which it would allow construction to proceed on the understanding that the problems would be addressed later. Jean McSorley, consultant to Greenpeace's nuclear campaign, said it was highly likely reactor designs would not be ready for final sign-off at the end of the design process. \"This could leave the utilities and construction companies with real problems finishing projects, and that's very risky for them financially. Investment companies will also want to delay putting money into these projects until it is decided who takes responsibility for any potential cost overruns and delays,\" she said. Areva shrugged off the concerns raised by the HSE. \"It is important to emphasise that this is a normal part of what is a very transparent process and that it is entirely expected, as part of the design assessment process in the UK, for issues to be identified and resolved prior to licensing and construction,\" it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2010/apr/08/cillit-bang","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-08T21:00:04Z","webTitle":"The unstoppable rise of Cillit Bang!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/apr/08/cillit-bang","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2010/apr/08/cillit-bang","fields":{"headline":"The unstoppable rise of Cillit Bang!","bodyText":"The Reckitt Benckiser HQ lies on the Bath Road, on the edge of Slough, a sleek brick-and-glass building standing amid a cluster of Ford and Volkswagen outlets, a Pizza Hut delivery site and the main offices of the Lego toy company. It is an unassuming location for one of the UK's most successful businesses: despite the recession, last year Reckitt Benckiser saw profits rise 23%, and this week its chief executive, Bart Becht, broke the British record for executive pay, taking home more than £90m in cash and shares in one year. Though its name may not be instantly recognisable, the majority of Reckitt Benckiser's products are staples of our supermarket shelves: Nurofen, Vanish, Dettol, Lemsip, Finish, French's mustard. But at the helm is Cillit Bang, a range of household cleaning products famed not only for its efficacy, but also for the cartoon colours of its packaging, its brash advertising campaign, and, of course, a brand name that is decidedly Batman-esque. Cillit Bang was first launched in Hungary in 2003, before being rolled out across mainland Europe, and finally arriving in the UK in November 2004. Its arrival here was planned as a direct attack on its arch-rival, SC Johnson's Mr Muscle, and its launch saw a £5m television advertising campaign, created by J Walter Thompson, and shot in the awkward style of a home-shopping channel infomercial, all garish colours and hammy delivery. At its heart was a fictional character, Barry Scott, fond of placing a penny coin in Cillit Bang to prove its dirt-removing powers, and occasionally accompanied by a stereotypical housewife, Jill. The adverts invariably concluded with the catchphrase \"Bang, and the dirt is gone\". The effect, back in the autumn of 2004, was twofold: firstly, consumers recoiled. \"Who in the world would call this product by such a stupid name?\" wrote one blogger. \"It must be a joke. Imagine going into a supermarket and asking for Cillit Bang!\" But the second effect was that people began to buy Cillit Bang – a lot of it. After the initial postings of incredulity, the same blog soon turned into a discussion of where to find Cillit Bang, and the supermarkets where it had sold out. In no time, the degreaser had become a cult product. Soon, people began selling Cillit Bang T-shirts, and posting mock adverts on YouTube; there was even a \"hardcore remix\" version of the TV ad. Anecdotal evidence suggests that children pester their parents to buy it. (Cillit Bang advertises during children's programmes.) Last summer it gained even greater notoriety when it was revealed that its combination of sulfamic acid and phosphoric acid was so powerful a cleaning agent that it had been used to clean plutonium residue from the defunct Dounreay nuclear power station in Caithness. There have been a few catastrophes along the way, however: earlier this year it was revealed that Cillit Bang had come top of a UK-wide poll to find the most disliked brand name. But sales remained unscathed, and its continued success – as one of the television advertisements crows: \"9m UK households have tried Cillit Bang\" – has been an unlikely triumph of both sheer potency and bad taste. \"Bart Becht is a very, very successful marketer,\" explains Mark Choueke, editor of Marketing Week. \"Cillit Bang launched into a tough sector to be sexy in, competing against several super-brands in the household cleaning market, but it had a loud launch. The invented personality can work very well in advertising too – it worked for the Honey Monster and the Smash robots, and it works for the meerkats adverts now. But essentially Cillit Bang's success is down to the fact that it had a silly name and a great marketing strategy.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/11/earthquake-tsunami-death-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-11T19:51:12Z","webTitle":"After the earthquake, a tsunami of death and destruction in Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/11/earthquake-tsunami-death-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/11/earthquake-tsunami-death-japan","fields":{"headline":"After the earthquake, a tsunami of death and destruction in Japan","bodyText":"It was 2.46pm when the chandeliers began swinging wildly in Tokyo's parliament chamber. Japan's prime minister, Naoto Kan, stared in growing panic as the tremors intensified. Outside, buildings swayed like giant metronomes, roads cracked apart and people screamed and ran for shelter. The biggest earthquake in the country's history had struck. In the minutes that followed, a series of 10-metre high tsunami waves peeled 80 miles across a calm Pacific ocean from the quake's epicentre to Japan's north east coast. Their symmetry belied a raging power that left behind a boiling back wash. Hundreds were last night confirmed dead and tens of thousands missing after the huge surges crashed ashore, rocking Japan as ships and trains went missing, cities and industrial plants blazed and a dam burst sweeping away homes. It was all captured in horrifying detail as TV channels broadcast the most vivid footage yet of the devastating power of a tsunami which was by turns heart-breaking and bewildering. The foaming white tsunami turned black on landfall as it bought death and destruction and crushed everything in its path. It churned up the earth, shredded buildings, trees and crops and tossed boats and cars around like corks. The sludge surged inland surrounding homes where survivors waved white sheets from top floor windows, desperate for help. The tide erased carefully tended fields and mowed down rows of poly-tunnel greenhouses. Up to 300 bodies were found in the coastal city of Sendai which bore the brunt of the waves. Most were feared drowned. Cars were swept across the city's airport runway where people gathered on the terminal roof for safety, trapped by the water all around them. About 140 people, including children, were trapped on top of an elementary school. \"I was trying to get up to high ground,\" said one elderly man in a baseball cap in the city of Ofunato, 80 miles up the coast, which had no power after more than 300 houses were swept away. \"People up there were saying hurry up, get up here. Once I got up we watched cars flow by.\" \"The aftershocks gave us no reprieve,\" added a woman with a baby strapped to her back. \"Then the tsunami came when we tried to run for cover.\" The port at Miyako offered no shelter either and boiled like a cauldron. Cars, trucks and even a large building were churned in the torrents that pounded the harbour wall, detonating like a string of explosive charges. Off the coast, a giant whirlpool, hundreds of metres in diameter like something out of a Hollywood disaster movie, turned slowly with a leisure yacht caught in its vortex. Commercial vessels were hammered into breakwaters and a ship carrying 100 people was swept away, according to Kyodo news agency. Footage showed a trawler ploughing head on into the on-rushing tsunami, pitching almost to vertical. In one town, ships, buildings and cars were tossed around together in an incongruous mix. The images were reminiscent of the tsunami that struck Indonesia, Thailand and Sri Lanka on Boxing Day 2004, but far more comprehensive and clearer from being professionally shot from helicopters. In one heart-rending piece of footage, a lone cyclist could be seen pedalling desperately away from the advancing morass of timber and sludge surging from behind him. In another scene, a large fishing boat was forced by the water into a road bridge still being used by cars. The boat emerged the other side with its wheelhouse torn off. Cars and trucks were tossed around like toys after a smaller tsunami hit the town of Kamaichi in northern Japan. An overpass appeared to have collapsed and vehicles turned around and speed away from the danger. A train running north of Sendai on the Senseki line was reported missing with an unknown number of passengers on board. Then after the water came the fire. Swaths of Kesennuma, a hillside coastal town of 74,000 people in the hardest hit Miyagi prefecture, burned furiously into the night with no apparent hope of the flames being extinguished. A witness told the public broadcaster NHK it was sparked after the tsunami overturned several cars, causing them to leak oil and petrol. More than a dozen fires broke out across Tokyo where 4 million people were left without power. At an oil refinery, infernos raged out of control and a huge orange explosion rose into the sky in the shape of a mushroom cloud. Another blast tore through a petrochemical complex in Miyagi prefecture. Japan's infrastructure was collapsing fast. Roads were impassable, trains were cancelled and airports were closed for long periods, with international flights into Narita resuming last night. An irrigation dam reportedly burst in the north-east Fukushima prefecture and homes were washed away. But the greatest concern was for the safety of four nuclear reactors in the area. The government declared to the International Atomic Energy Agency a heightened state of alert at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power, north of Tokyo, and some 3,000 residents evacuated the area. The Tokyo Electric Power Company said the cooling function at the nuclear plant had been knocked out, causing the pressure in the reactor to rise, but that there was no radioactive leakage. \"The earthquake has caused major damage in broad areas in northern Japan,\" the prime minister told a news conference. He said the government needed to act to \"save the country\". \"We urge the people of Japan to be cautious and vigilant and listen to the news reports and we ask the people of Japan to act calmly,\" he said. Standing on the Pacific \"ring of fire\" Japan is one of the best prepared countries in the world to cope with an earthquake, but tremors were more powerful and more prolonged than any that residents had ever experienced. The land felt like liquid. Ritsuko Tachikawa, 34, a corporate consultant was sitting at a red traffic light in her car in Saitama, north of Tokyo, when the earthquake struck. \"It felt like we were in a large vessel,\" she told the Guardian. \"It started getting worse and worse and we started kind of freaking out. The ground was shaking but like big and slow waves. We could barely stand up. The brick walls beside our cars were collapsing and it seemed safer to stay in cars. It felt like the end of the world today.\" Last night, with the city's power down, her family gathered around a kerosene stove and drank green tea and ate porridge by candlelight while listening to the news on a radio. A Tokyo resident posting on the New York Times website reported he and his fellow swimmers doing laps at the Izumi Garden Tower in the Roppongi district \"were sloshed around like rubber duckies in a bathtub\". Another on the ninth floor of a residential tower in the Sumida area marvelled at the engineering of his earthquake-proofed building which \"flexed and bounced like an airliner in turbulence\". Rooftop lightning rods swayed like giant metronomes and after the tremors, a public address system broadcast a pre-recorded message, evidence of how Japan is one of the world's best-prepared countries for seismic shocks: \"This is Sumida City. Just now, a large earthquake happened. Please be careful.\" Passengers on a subway line in Tokyo screamed and grabbed other passengers' hands to remain standing. Crowds gathered in front of televisions in a shop to find out what was happening. After the shaking from the first quake subsided, crowds pointed to construction cranes on an office building up the street. \"They're still shaking\", they cried. \"Are they going to fall?\" Matt Alt, an American translator in west Tokyo, described the quake as \"a sustained attack\", and in Fukishima, in north-east Japan 150 miles from the epicentre, British citizen Ben Sabers told the BBC the quake got \"bigger and bigger and bigger\". \"It went on for five or 10 minutes and it was like 'when is it going to stop?'\" he said. \"After a couple of minutes being under the table you realised this is really serious.\" Trains across the country were halted and by nightfall the roads in Tokyo were jammed with millions of commuters trying to get home, in spite of official advice for people to stay where they are in a safe place. \"The big problem is that all the businessmen and women who commute into town from outside can't get home,\" Rie Kiyasu, an illustrator living in the Nakano district of Tokyo told the Guardian. \"We are back at home now, and outside the streets are full of people just walking. They don't have anywhere to stay for the night.\"Other residents said noodle shops were packed with people who would normally eat at home, while long queues had formed behind every payphone and out of every convenience store. \"Unending salaryman hordes, in orderly lines, waiting for eight hours or more for cabs and buses that will never come,\" Adam Ismail, 32, an equities analyst said in an email to The Guardian. Hotels filled up and people slept in offices. In downtown Tokyo, Tomoko Suzuki and her elderly mother stood at a crowded corner, unable to get to their 29th-floor condominium because the elevator wasn't working. They unsuccessfully tried to hail a taxi to a relative's house and couldn't find a hotel room. \"We are so cold,\" said Suzuki. \"We really don't know what to do.\" Tweeting the quake A Canadian living in Japan, Blaise Plant, used an iPhone to tweet every tremor from stricken Sendai: 1507 My house is trashed! I'm ok! It was spooky … the biggest one yet!! 1648 I urge everyone to keep alert … things are falling all over the place. 1649 I currently can't go home the ground is still shaking and shaking 1716 A lot of people from the neighborhood gathered together to keep warm 1724 Still big shakes … the tsunami seems to have really done damage … 1828 The city is a complete black out!

I can't say how many people are injured around this area here, but we are all safe. Pray. 2257 Big tremors. 2315 Oh no!

McEwan told the Guardian he watched the outcome of the Copenhagen summit in December \"very closely and with some despair\" and then went back to his novel, Solar, to rewrite a section a few pages from the end. The end of the book is set in summer 2009, and McEwan introduced a scene in which Michael Beard, the chief protaganist and a Nobel-prize winning physicist, receives an email that invites him to address a meeting of foreign ministers at the coming summit. \"I just slipped something in to reflect the spirit of sadness,\" he said. \"Everything has collapsed around him [Beard] and he knows that Copenhagen will be just the place for him. It is where he would be heading to add his confusion to everybody else's.\" Had the summit produced a successful deal, as McEwan wanted, Beard and his failures would not have fitted in. \"I would not have wanted my man anywhere near it,\" said the author. \"I didn't want him there, believe me.\" McEwan said he had spent four years gathering material for the book, though he had wanted to write about climate change since the mid 1990s. \"I couldn't see a way in. A subject so weighted with moral and political value is not helpful to a novel. I couldn't see a way of making it come alive.\" That changed during a visit of artists and scientists to the Arctic in 2005, when he said he was struck by the contrast between the idealistic evening discussions about global warming and the chaos of the equipment room. In an interview in tomorrow's Guardian Review section, he says: \"Clothes and equipment there to save our lives, which we should have been able to look after very easily would go missing, and I thought, for all the fine words and good intentions, maybe there was a comic inadequacy in human nature in dealing with this problem.\" McEwan said he was \"baffled\" by the media storm over the emails released from the University of East Anglia (UEA) and the mistake made in the 2007 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). \"I think those involved, in the UEA press office and the IPCC, need to get a little more nimble. These things just surge across the blogosphere.\" He said was happy to class himself as \"warmer\" — a term increasingly used by climate sceptics to describe those who agree with the scientific consensus that human activity drives warming. \"Though I am quite tempted sometimes to be a calamatist. There is something intellectually delicious about all that super-pessimism.\" McEwan added that his research on climate had forced him to reconsider opposition to nuclear power. \"We just don't have anything else that can run our cities on a windless night in February.\" Better nuclear energy than coal, he said. \"It is rare that virtue and necessity collide. Sooner or later we're going to have to find a new energy source for mankind.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/jul/29/david-cameron-defends-pakistan-comments","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-29T08:23:22Z","webTitle":"David Cameron defends comments about Pakistan and terrorism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jul/29/david-cameron-defends-pakistan-comments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/jul/29/david-cameron-defends-pakistan-comments","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron defends comments about Pakistan and terrorism","bodyText":"David Cameron today launched a strong defence of his attack on Islamabad in which he claimed that elements of the Pakistani state are responsible for exporting terrorism abroad. Amid deep anger in Pakistan, the prime minister said he would always talk \"frankly\" to Britain's friends as he insisted he had caused no offence and had not blamed the Islamabad government for promoting terrorism. Speaking in Delhi this morning on the second and final day of his visit to India, the prime minister said: \"I don't think the British taxpayer wants me to go around the world saying what people want to hear.\" Cameron dismissed fears that his comments risked overshadowing a visit next week to Chequers by the Pakistan president, Asif Ali Zardari. \"I don't think it's overshadowed anything,\" he said. \"I think it's important to speak frankly and clearly about these issues. I have always done that in the past and will do so in the future.\" The prime minister insisted that he had been talking about \"people within Pakistan\" who launch terrorist attacks abroad rather than its government. A furious diplomatic row erupted between London and Islamabad last night after Cameron's comments yesterday, when he warned that Pakistan could no longer \"look both ways\" by tolerating terrorism while demanding respect as a democracy. Angry responses followed from Pakistani officials in the UK and the foreign ministry in Islamabad. Writing for the Guardian's Comment is free site, Pakistan's high commissioner to Britain accused Cameron of damaging the prospects for regional peace and criticised him for believing allegations in the secret military logs of the Afghanistan conflict published earlier this week. The leaked documents suggest that the ISI, one of Pakistan's two military intelligence agencies, was encouraging the Taliban as recently as last year. Wajid Shamsul Hasan, Pakistan's high commissioner, wrote: \"One would have wished that the prime minister would have considered Pakistan's enormous role in the war on terror and the sacrifices it has rendered since 9/11. \"There seems to be more reliance on information based on intelligence leaks which lack credibility of proof. A bilateral visit aimed at earning business could have been done without damaging the prospects of regional peace.\" The prime minister initiated the row yesterday morning in a speech to Indian business leaders in Bangalore, when he spoke of his horror at the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai for which Delhi directly blamed the Pakistani authorities. Cameron came close to endorsing that view when he said: \"We cannot tolerate in any sense the idea that this country is allowed to look both ways and is able to promote the export of terror, whether to India or Afghanistan or anywhere else in the world. \"That is why this relationship is important. But it should be a relationship based on a very clear message: that it is not right to have any relationship with groups that are promoting terror. Democratic states that want to be part of the developed world cannot do that. The message to Pakistan from the US and from the UK is very clear on that point.\" Pakistan took the rare step of issuing an official rebuttal. Abdul Basit, a spokesman for the Pakistani foreign ministry, told Radio 4's World at One: \"There is no question of Pakistan looking the other way. I think the prime minister was referring to these reports, which are unverifiable and outdated. If we start drawing inferences from these self-serving reports, then obviously we are distracting ourselves.\" Pakistani senator Khurshid Ahmad, vice-president of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party, said: \"I am deeply concerned. The basis on which this statement has been made is very fragile. The documents released are unreliable: 90% of them have been attributed to Afghan intelligence agencies, whose reports are totally unreliable and fabricated. On the basis of such a report, it is not acceptable to make the statement that has been made.\" Britain has spoken in the past of the terror threat from Pakistan, though ministers have restricted themselves to criticising Pakistan for tolerating terror groups. But the prime minister's language came close to endorsing the Indian view that authorities in Pakistan have a hand in the terror. Cameron named several terror groups which are, according to India, sponsored by Pakistan. \"We – like you – are determined that groups like the Taliban, the Haqqani network or Lakshar-e-Taiba should not be allowed to launch attacks on Indian and British citizens in India or in Britain.\" Downing Street insisted the prime minister was not accusing Pakistan's government of sponsoring terrorism. But a few minutes after his speech, Cameron made clear that official agencies in Pakistan were responsible for harbouring terrorists. Asked on the Today programme whether Pakistan exports terrorism, Cameron said: \"I choose my words very carefully. It is unacceptable for anything to happen within Pakistan that is about supporting terrorism elsewhere. It is well-documented that that has been the case in the past, and we have to make sure that the Pakistan authorities are not looking two ways. They must only look one way, and that is to a democratic and stable Pakistan.\" The prime minister's words on Pakistan overshadowed the first day of a visit to India designed to herald a new special relationship. Downing Street says the trip is meant to show that Britain can treat India as a normal trading partner, with the security issues surrounding Delhi's troubled relations with Pakistan dealt with on a separate tack. But the main business announcement – a relaxation of licence rules to allow the export of civil nuclear technology and expertise to India – had the potential to upset its nuclear neighbour. Pakistan and India have refused to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, prompting the last Labour government to refuse to co-operate with India on civil nuclear power. Ministers had feared there would be leakage to its military nuclear programme. The US sanctioned the use of civil nuclear technology to India in 2008. Britain believes today's agreement is compatible with the NPT, which bans the sale of nuclear technology to nuclear powers that have not signed it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2008/aug/02/nuclearpower.climatechange","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2008-08-01T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Editorial: Nuclear power is part of answer for energy supply and climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/02/nuclearpower.climatechange","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/02/nuclearpower.climatechange","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear options","bodyText":"Is business as usual good enough? That question, or more sophisticated versions of it, is asked of two issues more than any other: energy and climate change. Both are huge challenges and both come with a deadline. Nuclear power straddles the two, since it inevitably forms part of the answer to Britain's energy needs and produces far less carbon emissions than gas or coal. So yesterday's collapse of a key part of the government's nuclear strategy was chalked up by many as yet another defeat for the old model of business as usual. The sceptics are right on the principle, but wrong on the particulars. What happened yesterday is that British Energy's shareholders rejected a not-terribly-good takeover offer from the French utility firm EDF. Big fund managers (the two names most often mentioned are Invesco and the Prudential) decided that the group was worth more than the £12bn on the table. Ever since EDF made clear that it was interested, investors have been haggling the offer price up; and it may well be that this happens again. That is to be expected in this market: with energy prices so high, it is a sellers' market (and all those whose pensions and investments are managed by Invesco and the Pru would surely expect their fund managers to get them a decent return). Nor did the government handle the sale of its 35% stake in the company as openly as might be expected for what is essentially the auction of a public asset. Had it gone through, the sale of British Energy would have represented a mediocre return to the taxpayer. No one should bemoan the deal that died yesterday - instead they should be calling for the government to be brokering a better one. True, it is a radioactive embarrassment for the government, which saw the sale as crucial to its nuclear programme. British Energy's reactors are all coming to the end of their lives (Sizewell B is the only plant that will still be working come 2020) and unless work begins on upgrading them soon, the UK's energy gap (the gulf between the energy needed by businesses and individuals, and that produced in this country) will yawn ever wider. That said, it was already set to be large, with the bulk of our coal-fired plants shut down by 2015, and precious few of the hoped-for renewables plugged into the National Grid. The best way to see the British Energy deal is not as a mortal blow to the government's energy programme itself, but as one of a whole series of big challenges that the business secretary, John Hutton, and his successors will face over coming decades. Indeed, a veritable steeplechase of obstacles lies between the mountain of paper that is the government's energy strategy and the reality. Taken together, they emphatically suggest that business as usual on energy policy just won't do. Imagine that ministers broker another deal for British Energy (perhaps by arranging a break-up of the company so that different sites go to different nuclear providers). Then what? The reactors still need to be built, in a long process that hinges on getting sufficient well-trained engineers and all the right bits of kit. Given that Britain is not the only country that wants nuclear (Finland is further along in its programme, and plenty more nations want more nuclear), neither the availability nor the price of people or parts can be guaranteed. Even the economically uninterested must be aware by now that the world is in the middle of a commodity crunch in which fast-developing countries such as China and India want more energy and food than suppliers have been accustomed to selling them. Well, the next big crisis may well be an engineering crunch, in which countries compete for people and kit to provide much-needed infrastructure (not just nuclear plants, but wind turbines and roads and airports). This will inevitably mean that costs rocket and deadlines slide. Is business as usual the best way of meeting that challenge?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2010/apr/07/election-2010-liberal-democrats","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-07T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Election 2010 party guides: Liberal Democrats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/07/election-2010-liberal-democrats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/apr/07/election-2010-liberal-democrats","fields":{"headline":"Election 2010 party guides: Liberal Democrats","bodyText":"The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday 22 April 2010 The article below mentioned the Liberal Democrat proposal to \"scrap the £25bn a year Trident nuclear weapons system\". The Lib Dem leader, Nick Clegg, puts the cost of like-for-like replacement of Trident at £100bn over 25 years; the government estimates Trident's cost at £72bn to £92bn over the next 20 years, including maintenance. Leader Nick Clegg. Campaign slogan \"Change that works for you, building a fairer Britain\". Two slogans for the price of one. Campaign colours Yellowy-orange. And a bit of turquoise. Another 2 for 1. Cynics attribute the blue to the Liberal Democrat fight to retain those 22 seats they hold which were once Tory. Number of MPs 63. Star performers Vince Cable and Captain Paddy Ashdown. Nick Clegg has the chance to become a household name in the TV debates so could graduate to being a full-blown star, but not his wife: she can't get the time off work. Possibly their slimmed-down election offer could also be a star performer. They have simplified it down to only four policies, acknowledging voters don't want a welter of choice: the four horsemen of apoliticism. Achilles heel Not having an Iraq-like issue on which to get \"cut-through\". And with the Tories snipping at Lib Dem heels at their 22 seats in the south and the Labour party working hard to keep their seats in the north by painting Clegg as a Tory, the Lib Dems could be squeezed - as they found out in the close election of 1992. Economy The Lib Dems will present themselves as the grown-up party on the economy. They will dismiss Tory plans to make cuts in 2010-11 as dangerously dogmatic while at the same time claiming that Labour's deficit reduction plan is inadequate. Nick Clegg has massively simplified the party's spending priorities and the only area that is guaranteed an increase is schools where the Lib Dems are committed to a pupil premium to help the poorest pupils. Public services Their education policy - a pupil premium - sounds very similar to the Tory doppleganger which has led some to suggest they have alighted on it purely to use as a calling card for possible hung parliament discussions with the Conservatives but in their defence, the Lib Dems came up with the policy almost a decade before. There are other core differences with the Lib Dems opposed to the Tory policy of schools being set up outside of local authority control. Unlike the Tories and Labour they would also look to make cuts in the NHS, beginning by scrapping strategic health authorities. None of the other two will touch the health service. Foreign and defence No striking position on foreign affairs as they did in 2005 when they were the only major anti-war party and Clegg has resisted those in his party who would have liked him to call for a withdrawal from Afghanistan. But that which they will shout from the rooftops is a proposal to scrap the £25bn a year Trident nuclear weapons system. Environment Like the other two parties, the Lib Dems will push to lower fuel consumption through schemes to help households insulate their homes and install smart metres to gauge energy use. Their distinctive policy will be no new nuclear power stations - the other two parties think new nuclear necessary to 'keep the lights on'. Instead the Lib Dems want a massive investment in renewables - something they hope will create thousands of jobs, and break reliance on fossil fuels - and a large scale decentralisation of the national energy grid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2008/jan/10/world.nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2008-01-10T11:36:56Z","webTitle":"Finance is the main hurdle for new UK nuclear plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jan/10/world.nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2008/jan/10/world.nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Finance, not politics, remains biggest hurdle to nuclear power","bodyText":"A host of issues remain before Britain greets the first batch of nuclear plants since construction started on Sizewell B in Suffolk 20 years ago. Planning constraints, a shortage of skills and complex waste arrangements are among the main obstacles. But the biggest hurdle remains the uncertainty over whether the right financial conditions exist to encourage private investment. French and German utilities such as EDF and Eon have been pushing ministers for action to thwart an energy supply shortage and fight rising carbon emissions. But before any of the dozen energy firms interested in new nuclear plants stump up the £5bn needed to build each facility, the companies want further clarification on certain issues, if not outright help, The power firms insist there is no need for any subsidies because they are prepared to pay in full the cost of decommissioning reactors and the expected burial of waste. They point to the way that wind power generation obtains incentives through the Renewable Obligation, a scheme that places a mandatory requirement for UK electricity suppliers to source more electricity from renewable generation capacity. EDF and Eon reject claims that this means they want the UK guarantees a minimum price for power, although privately both firms are pushing as hard as they can for a mechanism to come close to this. And while EDF and Eon, the most likely candidates to proceed with a replacement fleet of between four and 10 reactors, insist they are confident the economics of nuclear power can be made to work in Britain without direct aid or subsidy, there are many consultants sceptical that any reactors be built without direct government help. Jerry Taylor and Peter Van Doren, two senior fellows at the Washington DC-based libertarian thinktank the Cato Institute, say they are rarely in tune with the Green movement but on the issue of atomic power they have common cause. In the business magazine Forbes, the fellows argue that France, China, India and Russia do not build cost-effective plants. \"Governmental officials in those countries, not private investors, decide what is built,\" they wrote. \"Nuclear power appeals to state planners, not market actors.\" They added: \"We like nuclear power as much as everyone else on the right. But friends don't let friends get hooked on subsidies.\" John Large, a leading UK nuclear consultant, agrees. \"Anyone could have built a nuclear plant in Britain over the last 10 years. The reason why they did not was cost and the only real question left today for the generators is how they are going to be subsidised, although no one will use that word.\" Companies such as EDF and Eon, which supply gas and electricity to UK customers, claim they need further information on how they will dispose of waste. There is a presumption it will be buried deep underground but the sites and exact mechanics of payment have not yet been established. For the nuclear industry cost is not the only issue, says Large. It is a combination of factors, especially government support, which can influence public opinion and push through changes to the planning laws. Such changes have already been agreed in a special planning white paper, which outlines measures to avoid the massive delays that affected previous projects such as Sizewell B. However, the policy document has yet to be agreed in parliament. Government support and public opinion remains important. As one nuclear industry official said: \"We don't know how long Gordon Brown or Labour are going to be running the country and the position of the Conservatives remains uncertain.\" Public opinion has been shifting slowly recently from deep scepticism over nuclear power to cautious support as the realities of Britain's wider energy demands dawn. With North Sea oil and gas running out, renewable power proving slow to generate, and the Kyoto treaty demanding carbon cuts to combat global warming, the public has come to support nuclear power despite the inherent physical dangers. The Nuclear Industry Association (NIA) has plotted the upwards movement of public support for atomic power through the pollsters Mori, although there was a slight downward trend recorded last autumn after four years of positive results. The poll jolted confidence, providing what energy chiefs termed a \"reality check\". Safety - in particularly vulnerability to terrorist attack - remains a sensitive issue. The UK industry has a good track record but incidents including the Three Mile Island accident in the US and the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine, are reminders of the extreme dangers of radioactive particles. Business chiefs are still worried about the potential delays of licensing various new atomic reactors. EDF has already put forward a design in tandem with the French nuclear plant builder, Areva, for a European pressurized water reactor, similar to ones it is building at Flamanville in Normandy, and Olkiluoto in Finland - at present, the only two new atomic stations given the go ahead in Europe. Other atomic plant builders such as Westinghouse have also submitted proposals but a lack of manpower at the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, the state agency reviewing the proposals, is struggling to assess the plans. There have also been questions concerning skill shortages at a time when many of the present generation of engineers and technocrats near retirement - as well as the reactors they have worked on. With new nuclear plants under consideration in the US and Italy, and with a raft of new reactors already under construction in China, there are fears it will be hard to find the requisite workforce needed in Britain. Delays already dog progress on the Finnish reactor although the NIA remains convinced that new facilities can be built to meet the widening energy gap by 2017. There has also been a debate about the proposed sites for the new UK reactors. There is now a general acceptance that such plants would be built on existing sites, such as at Sizewell in Suffolk, or Bradwell in Essex. Issues concerning the impact of coastal erosion due to rising sea levels are dismissed as manageable problems. Nuclear power remains a controversial energy sector, not least because of its toxic waste and its history - especially its military use. Many commentators had written off nuclear power's prospects, but climate change, ironically, has offered it a possible new lease of life. However, even with today's green light from the government hurdles remain to be overcome before nuclear power enjoys any possible renaissance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/237614","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-15T16:42:57Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: Bahrain's changing political scene","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/237614","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/237614","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: Bahrain's changing political scene","bodyText":"ID:237614 Cable dated:2009-12-02T13:18:00 S E C R E T MANAMA 000680 SIPDIS NEA FOR A/S FELTMAN FROM AMBASSADOR ERELI E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/02/2019 TAGS: OVIP, PGOV, PREL, KDEM, MARR, BA SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR MANAMA DIALOGUE, DECEMBER 11-13 REF: A. MANAMA 660 B. MANAMA 628 C. MANAMA 651 Classified By: CDA Christopher Henzel for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 1. (C) Jeff, you will arrive in Bahrain at a time of introspection for the Bahraini regime as this year's IISS Manama Dialogue coincides with the tenth anniversary of King Hamad's accession to the throne, on December 17, 1999. During those ten years, the political and security situation has improved considerably. Our challenge is to help the Bahrainis keep things moving in the right direction, a task made considerably easier by a forward-looking and sympathetic leadership. --------------------------- TEN YEARS OF TRANSFORMATION --------------------------- 2. (C) Following the death of his father, Emir Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa in 1999, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa inherited a country torn by sectarian violence and accustomed to dealing with the Shia majority 5nderclass as a policing problem. He quickly embarked on a program of reform and reconciliation with Bahrain's Shia: he allowed exiles to return home, abolished the State Security Courts, and restored the parliament suspended since 1975. King Hamad understands that political stability is also tied to economic prosperity, and has undertaken far-reaching economic reforms intended to increase Bahrain's competitiveness, productivity and living standards. The result is that the Bahrain of today is a far cry from the Bahrain of the 1990s. Political parties operate freely and are preparing for a third parliamentary election cycle in 2010 (ref A). Street protests are significantly fewer and less violent. Perhaps most tellingly, the leader of the mainstream Shia Wifaq party has told us unequivocally that Wifaq will continue to engage in parliamentary politics because he believes there is more to gain in the long run by participating than by boycotting. ------------------------------------ REGIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY ------------------------------------ 3. (C) A graduate of the Mons Officer Cadet School and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, King Hamad takes a leading role in directing Bahrain's security policy, and carries the title of Supreme Commander. During his three decades as Crown Prince, he personally built the Bahrain Defense Force from the ground up, relying heavily on U.S. equipment and training. King Hamad believes that the peace and prosperity of the Gulf is a result of U.S. protection and friendship. The U.S. Fifth Fleet is based in Bahrain and two U.S. Patriot batteries are also stationed here. Bahrain's leaders are thus strong and outspoken proponents of a close and enduring security relationship between the United States and the region. 4. (C) Bahrain was designated a Major Non-NATO Ally in 2002, and King Hamad believes it is important that Bahrain do its part in support of regional security. In March 2008, Bahrain became the first Arab country to take command of CTF-152, one of the coalition's naval task forces in the Persian Gulf. They have also deployed as part of the CTF-151 anti-piracy mission in the Arabian Sea. On December 16, King Hamad will personally see off a company of Bahraini Special Security Forces, who will be departing to serve as part of coalition operations in Afghanistan. This activism marks Bahrain as a leader among GCC states and has encouraged others such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia to become more involved. 5. (C) King Hamad views an activist foreign policy as essential for a small state like Bahrain that wants its interests to be considered in the region. He chose the forward-leaning Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa as his foreign minister. In June, Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa penned a Washington Post op-ed in which he called on Arab leaders to engage with the Israeli people in support of the Arab Peace Initiative. Shortly thereafter, Bahraini officials traveled to Tel Aviv to bring back several Bahrainis who had been aboard a relief ship that was taken into Israeli custody when it tried to enter Gaza. Even modest steps in the direction of Israel set off criticism from local media and from members of parliament decrying \"normalization.\" Recently, MPs in the elected (and Islamist-dominated) lower house voted to criminalize any contact with Israel or Israeli citizens (ref B) even though most recognized that the (appointed) upper house will ensure the bill never becomes law. 6. (C) Bahrain was one of the first Gulf states to reopen its embassy in Baghdad, and, while wary of the Maliki government, has reached out to Iraq politically and economically. Bahraini airlines now fly regularly to several Iraqi cities. The King has established a relationship with Sayyid Ammar Al Hakim, chairman of the Supreme Islamic Council in Iraq. During Hakim's recent visit to Bahrain (ref C), King Hamad asked for his support in channeling the energies of Bahraini Shia in a positive direction, and told Hakim that he would do what he could to get the Saudis to engage with Iraq. Bahrain maintains correct relations with Iran, but has no illusions about the threat it poses to the region. Bahrain quietly supports international pressure on Iran, and consulting with the leadership will ensure that we maintain that support. ---------------- POLITICAL VISION ---------------- 7. (C) King Hamad understands that Bahrain cannot prosper if he rules by repression. Bahrain's civil society is active and is engaged with Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) programming. There is more religious freedom in Bahrain than in most neighboring countries; Sunni and Shia mosques stand alongside Christian churches and Hindu temples. The National Charter (e.g., constitution) won approval in a 2000 referendum and restored the parliament that had been suspended in 1975. Two election cycles have seen the integration of the Shia opposition into the political process. While a Shia rejectionist fringe continues to boycott the process, their influence remains limited as the mainstream Wifaq party has shown an ability to work with the government to achieve results for its constituents. Discrimination against Shia persists, however, and the government has sought to deflect criticism by engaging with Wifaq and focusing more public spending on housing and social welfare projects. So long as Wifaq remains convinced of the benefits of political participation, the long-term outlook for Bahrain's stability is good. ------------------------ COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS ------------------------ 8. (S) The 2004 withdrawal of U.S. Navy dependents represented the nadir in our counterterrorism relationship. Since then, the government has enacted a tough, new CT law and has used it to obtain several convictions against Al Qaeda financiers and facilitators. Much of that success is connected to the King's installation of new, more capable leadership at both the Ministry of Interior (MOI) and the Bahrain National Security Agency (BNSA) in 2006 and 2008, respectively. BNSA routinely shares high-quality intel and seeks out joint operations opportunities. MOI has proven itself highly capable of maintaining internal security. The U.S. is contributing to the CT mission through the provision of a coastal radar system via Section 1206 funding that will give Bahrain (and the U.S. Navy) a 360 degree field of vision around the island. --------------- ECONOMIC VISION --------------- 9. (C) Unlike its neighbors, Bahrain is not blessed with abundant oil and gas, and so has diversified its economy, establishing itself as the world's leading center for Islamic banking and finance. This sector generates just over one quarter of domestic GDP. Bahrain also boasts a strong regional tourism sector that accounts for a significant portion of GDP. The country produces approximately 35,000 barrels/day of oil, which is all refined locally, and 1.2 billion standard cubic feet/day of gas, which is all consumed domestically. In order to maintain economic growth, Bahrain must find additional sources of energy. The government has sought cheap gas from both Saudi Arabia and Qatar to no avail, and is currently engaged in slow-rolling talks with Iran. Contacts have asserted that discussions with Iran are aimed at getting the Saudis and Qataris off the dime. 10. (C) Bahrain has also expressed long-term interest in nuclear power, and in March, 2008 signed a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. on civilian nuclear cooperation. It has joined the IAEA and has deposited its Safeguards Agreement with that organization. The Government of Bahrain has formed an inter-ministerial committee to study the use of nuclear energy for power generation, and although the GOB recognizes that they do not have the resources to develop or operate a nuclear reactor on their own, they need the power and are interested in moving forward, ideally with an American commercial partner. 11. (U) In August 2006, the U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement entered into force -- the culmination of a multiyear effort to open and reform Bahrain's economy. (In 2009, the Heritage Foundation and Wall Street Journal ranked Bahrain as the freest economy in the Middle East, and the 16th freest in the world). Since the FTA went into effect, total bilateral trade has increased more than 25%. Bahrain recently rolled out its \"Economic Vision 2030\" plan, a statement of the GOB's aspirations for Bahrain's economy, government and society. The plan establishes broad goals of economic diversification and the construction of a strong middle-class as the basis for Bahrain's future. ---------------- LEADERSHIP STYLE ---------------- 12. (C) King Hamad is personable and engaging. He rules as something of a \"corporate king,\" giving direction and letting his top people manage the government. He has overseen the development of strong institutions with the restoration of parliament, the formation of a legal political opposition, and a dynamic press. He is gradually shifting power from his uncle, Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, who remains the head of the government, to his son, the Crown Prince. Crown Prince Salman received his high school education at the DOD school in Bahrain and earned a BA from American University in 1985. He is very Western in his approach and is closely identified with the reformist camp within the ruling family - particularly with respect to economic and labor reforms designed to combat corruption and modernize Bahrain's economic base. King Hamad is committed to fighting corruption and prefers doing business with American firms because they are transparent. U.S. companies have won major contracts in the past two years, including: Gulf Air's purchase of 24 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, a USD 5 billion joint-venture with Occidental Petroleum to revitalize the Awali field, and well over USD 300 million in Foreign Military Sales. ----------------------- HUMAN RIGHTS AND REFORM ----------------------- 13. (C) Internally, the acquittal of ten Shia men in October on charges of killing a Pakistani policeman in April 2008 has served to lower sectarian tensions. Local media reported that the presiding judge explained that the defendants' claims that they confessed under duress had influenced his verdict. Despite this, the GOB's overall record on human rights remains positive on the whole. Allegations of private and government discrimination against Shia persist, but the democratic reforms of the past ten years have radically changed the political space. The mainstream Shia opposition, Wifaq, remains committed to the political process and the parliamentary experiment has been largely successful (ref A). Shia rejectionist groups Haq and Wafa' inspire the youths who occasionally clash with police, but have not seriously threatened Wifaq's hold on the Shia street. 14. (C) Bahrain remains on the Tier Two Watchlist for human trafficking, but has enacted an anti-trafficking law and achieved one conviction. The government is also pursuing labor market reforms aimed at eliminating the sponsorship system. On August 1, it introduced labor mobility - allowing foreign workers to change jobs without obtaining prior permission from the current employer. G/TIP Ambassador CdeBaca's told GOB officials during his November 12 visit that they needed to focus on prosecution and victim identification. The Justice Minister noted during their meeting that Bahrain had prosecuted 280 trafficking-related crimes over the past year. 15. (C) Deputy Special Envoy for Middle East Peace Hale will have just met with the Foreign Minister on December 5 to brief him on recent developments.

Consider the latest passage of play. On July 9, a uranium leak from an Areva reactor causes a ban on all use of two rivers in Provence. The accident at the Tricastin site near Vaucluse is only grade one on an ascending seven-point French scale of nuclear danger. But perception is all in the radioactivity business. One swimmer at a lake under evacuation observes that it was as if sharks had been spotted in it. Two days later, an Areva-led consortium wins the contract to run Sellafield. The £1bn a year contract is for the next five years with a view to 17 years. Because the profits for the winner are to come from squeezing efficiencies out of running the site, unions and environment groups queue up to voice fears about safety. Two days after that, Gordon Brown says there should be no upper limit on nuclear plants in the UK. He wants to see at least eight new stations within 15 years, because most of the 10 existing plants (with their 19% share of national electricity) will be shut by then. He and business minister Hutton increasingly see long-term energy strategy as a political battleground, and want to attack the Conservatives' pro-business credentials on this basis. In their minds, it seems, they can use nukes to nuke the Tories. Within less than a week another £10bn is added to the UK nuclear clean-up bill by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, making £83bn in all. The reasons given by the NDA are inflation, a decision to tackle more complicated hazards at Sellafield, and low income from Thorp and the Mox reprocessing plants. An NDA spokesman can't give a guarantee that the cost won't rise again. The same day, British Energy announces sheepishly that four broken nuclear plants will not be back on line before the end of the year. Two of the plants, where problems were found nine months ago, involve \"significantly higher\" costs than expected for an engineering solution, and much more time than expected. The other two reactors have boiler problems. A million hours of work have already been invested in trying to fix the four reactors. Meanwhile, in France, a second leak is reported under another reactor, and an unexplained older contamination is found in the groundwater at the spill at the Tricastin site. The Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) accuses Areva of \"human negligence\" and \"dysfunctional\" processes. The French government orders a radiological assessment of groundwater around all 58 nuclear reactors. Ecology minister Jean-Louis Borloo says he is ordering the investigation because \"I do not want people to think we are hiding anything.\" Areva insists there is no threat. However, ASN's findings have been passed to the prosecutor's office, which may decide a criminal investigation is required. Who would bet on the outcome of the 58-reactor drilling and sampling programme? Evian must be among those sweating. When nuclear fans accuse clean-tech advocates of dreaming about the prospects for renewables, it seems ever more likely that a simple response will suffice: \"Go nuclear? Good luck.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2009/sep/14/edf-john-hutton-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-13T23:44:37Z","webTitle":"Nuclear advocate John Hutton in talks to take EDF job","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/14/edf-john-hutton-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/sep/14/edf-john-hutton-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear advocate John Hutton in talks to take EDF job","bodyText":"The former business secretary John Hutton, who championed the government's push towards a new generation of nuclear power stations, is in talks with French-owned nuclear energy company EDF about joining their group as an adviser.

Steve believed passionately in evidence, and was always reminding me and other colleagues at meetings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) not to duck the hard questions. He was the first to recognise that it is precisely because climate change is so uncertain that it is so important to do something about it. Back in the 1970s, when only a handful of scientists were working on global climate change at all, Steve was the first to recognise the importance of the balance between greenhouse warming and cooling due to other forms of atmospheric pollution. The most extreme pollution-induced cooling was, of course, the nuclear winter – \"more like a nuclear autumn\", as he put it. Although that scenario seems remote today, the magnitude of cooling by aerosols – tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere – and how fast the world might warm as China cleans up its power stations remain among the most important uncertainties in climate projections. As late as 1977, Steve wrote: \"We just don't know enough to choose definitely at this stage whether we are in for warming or cooling – or when.\" As the world warmed through the ensuing three decades, he readily accepted that the balance of evidence pointed towards further warming. However, he still insisted on the ability of the real world to surprise us. In a survey of expert opinion on the range of uncertainty in the warming response to a doubling of carbon dioxide levels undertaken in the mid-1990s, Steve's response stands out as by far the most uncertain. Yet he rightly saw this uncertainty not as an excuse for inaction, but a reason to be doubly concerned about this uncontrolled global experiment. A polymath and a consummate communicator, Steve believed strongly in the public's right to make informed decisions about climate change, but also that the science itself is a meritocracy, not a democracy: \"When we're talking about what to do about it, then every citizen's opinion is just as important as anybody else's, and everybody should be quoted. But not about how many degrees of warming there are – that takes a lot of knowledge, to be able to know what you're talking about.\" To judge from his book The Patient from Hell (2005, with Janica Lane), in which he described his own engagement with the doctors treating him for a rare type of lymphoma, anyone can join a scientific community, at any time. By the time he had finished his treatment, Steve was just about ready to submit for a PhD in oncology. But he believed that everyone has to start out by approaching the evidence with an open mind. Born in New York, Steve was brought up on Long Island. Having gained a degree in mechanical engineering from Columbia University (1966) and PhD in mechanical engineering and plasma physics (1971), he focused on atmospheric physics and the global environment. He was optimistic about our technical abilities as a species, and his 1971 paper on the dangers of aerosol cooling suggested: \"[by 2000], nuclear power may have largely replaced fossil fuels as a means of energy production\". He was less sanguine about our willingness to co-operate. An adviser to successive US administrations from presidents Nixon to Obama, he was a sceptical supporter of greenhouse gas legislation and international agreements, recognising that intergovernmental agreements to share out limited resources do not have a promising track record. After postdoctoral work at Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, based at Columbia, in 1972 he moved to the National Center for Atmospheric Research, in Boulder, Colorado, where he founded the climate project. He remained involved with the centre until 1996, and in 1992 joined the faculty at Stanford University, California, where he came to hold three professorships. In 2007 the IPCC shared the Nobel peace prize with Al Gore. Steve was an inspiring mentor of his many students, postdoctoral researchers and collaborators, negotiating to allow graduate students to accompany him to international climate negotiations – and he was always supportive when his fellow scientists came under fire. He also put his expertise on global climate into practice, playing a key role in studies that led to groundbreaking climate change legislation in California. One of his most influential feats came when he was 30: the founding of the journal Climatic Change, which linked the various disciplines involved. He edited the journal for the rest of his life, never shying away from publishing controversial articles. For him, anyone who played by the rules of scientific peer review deserved a hearing. Steve saw the failure of the Copenhagen meeting last year as an opportunity to open up the public debate on emission controls to alternative approaches but was frustrated, though philosophical, when the world's media decided instead to restage old debates over whether climate change is an issue at all. He was especially exasperated by those who claimed to oppose greenhouse gas legislation in the name of democracy. Were there to be uncontrolled climate change, followed by draconian emission cuts and geo-engineering, it would pose a serious threat to liberal democracy. The focus of Steve's most recent work, much of it in collaboration with his wife, Terry Root, was on tracing the influence of greenhouse gas emissions through to the systems people really care about, the tangible impacts of climate change on vulnerable ecosystems and societies. He had recently been appointed as convening lead author on the chapter on attribution for the forthcoming IPCC assessment of the impacts of climate change. He was flying back from a scientific meeting in Sweden when he suffered his heart attack, and is survived by Terry. • Stephen Henry Schneider, climate scientist, born 11 February 1945; died 19 July 2010"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/georgemonbiot/2010/may/12/coalition-environment-policies","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-12T17:05:41Z","webTitle":"Too much coal in this coalition, but I was expecting worse | George Monbiot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2010/may/12/coalition-environment-policies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2010/may/12/coalition-environment-policies","fields":{"headline":"Too much coal in this coalition, but I was expecting worse","bodyText":"Perhaps it's just as well that the environment was shoved to the bottom of the coalition agreement: by the time they got there, it seems, the Neanderthal wing of the Conservative party was too exhausted to oppose it. It's sketchy and covers only some of the issues the new government will have to deal with, but it could have been a lot worse. Possibly the most important measure it contains is the commitment to create \"a floor price for carbon, as well as efforts to persuade the EU to move towards full auctioning of emissions trading scheme (ETS) permits\". The government can't act alone on either issue, but if it's serious about this it could help turn the ETS from a useless, nobbled programme, governed by the demands of pollutocrats, into a system that forces companies to clean up. Whether you like carbon trading or not, if we're going to have it, it's got to work. But as if to show that they haven't really thought this through, they've decided to supplement the ETS belt with braces and suspenders: as well as creating a functioning emissions trading system, they intend to maintain feed-in tariffs and the renewables obligation system. This could be an insurance policy, in case a sensible ETS doesn't materialise. But if it does, they will end up with three separate and incompatible systems. Sorry, make that four. Like the renewables obligation, the proposed emissions performance standard – forcing power stations to produce no more than a certain amount of carbon – is a good idea in its own right, but it would become redundant if the ETS really kicks in. Which policy do they intend to prioritise? There's nothing in the document about the supply of fossil fuels, but judging from both parties' manifestos they'll be seeking to maximise production, even as they are trying to minimise consumption. They say that the emissions performance standard will prevent new coal-fired power stations from being built unless they use sufficient carbon capture and storage. But they don't tell us what the standard will be, so at the moment we don't know what proportion of their CO2 power stations will have to capture. In either case, without a constraint on fossil fuel supply and without any mention of stopping opencast mining, it looks as if there'll be too much coal in this coalition. None of this really distinguishes the new government from the last one. But that's the problem. You might have thought that some fresh thinking would have identified and tackled the contradictions. Another gap is the absence of policy on onshore renewable energy. There's an intention \"to increase the target for energy from renewable sources\" and introduce \"measures to encourage marine energy\", but nothing about onshore developments. Keep an eye on this issue: there could be some big bust-ups as the Lib Dems insist that onshore windfarms are needed to help meet the government's targets, while the shire Tories fight them tooth and nail. Expect plenty of aggro over nuclear power too, even though they have politely agreed to disagree. The cancellation of the third runway at Heathrow and the refusal of additional runways at Gatwick and Stansted is a definite improvement. It would have been even more cheering if the agreement had said no new airport space in the UK. The danger is that flights are displaced from the south-east to other parts of the country. If the government is serious about this issue, why not introduce a moratorium on all new runways or runway extensions? But the measures which might do more than any others to change environment policies aren't listed in the environment section. Who would have thought that a majority Tory government would introduce \"the restoration of rights to non-violent protest\"? Or, to be more accurate, that 13 years of Labour government would have made this restoration necessary? If the coalition is serious about this, and if it repeals outrageous measures such as powers to stop peaceful protests under the Protection from Harassment Act, 2000 Terrorism Act and 2005 Serious Organised Crime and Police Act, we'll be better able to make our voices heard if politicians don't protect the environment. We must push them to get these measures repealed as quickly as possible. So it's better than I had expected. The agreement's environmental policies are more Lib Dem than Conservative, and more progressive than most of the other proposals in the document. Let's see how it works in practice.

More people in cities, lots of nuclear power stations and lashings of GM crops, urges Stewart Brand. Unless green activists embrace the benefits of all three, they are not part of the solution, but part of the problem. This prescription, from the founder of that quintessential 1960s publication the Whole Earth Catalog, comes as a surprise. And his eclectically informative new book makes the most of it. I care about the Earth, and especially about the fate of humanity, says Brand. I have changed my mind about how to exercise that care, and so should you. He builds his case skilfully, weaving together a wealth of sources. The most novel material concerns cities, now home to more than half of humanity, and set to attract many millions more. Most will begin their new urban lives in the shanty towns and slums of the southern hemisphere. Viewed from the comfort of the developed world, they are pretty terrible places. They are also, Brand insists, full of people working their way out of poverty as fast as they can. They offer freedoms denied to villagers, especially women villagers, and foster a zillion micro-enterprises. And cities new and old cram many people into small spaces, exacting a lower environmental cost than if they stayed in the countryside. On nuclear power, he finds that those who know the most see the least to fear. The opposite is true of coal plants, and their vast outpouring of carbon dioxide. Monuments to nuclear fear, such as the $10bn Yucca Mountain waste depository in Nevada, are, he concludes after a visit, \"nutty\". Why commit to entombing radioactive waste for thousands of years with existing technology? The question has additional force when posed by the co-founder of the Long Now Foundation – another of Brand's many ventures – which is dedicated to long-term thinking. The way to deal with the long term is to allow for adaptation and keep options open, not lock into a single strategy. In a couple of hundred years, never mind a thousand, there is a good chance we will have far better ways of dealing with nuclear waste. On the other hand, if we are back in the stone age by then, decaying nuclear waste dumps will be the least of our worries. On genetic manipulation, he relates no Yucca-style epiphany. Brand felt that swapping genes around was no big deal back in the 70s, when scientists first worked out how to do it. The profoundly unnatural human activity, for him, is agriculture. But it has become clearer that GM crops can make it better: more productive, more sustainable, and more adaptable to climate change. Opposing such use of helpful technology, in his view, is the biggest mistake the environmental movement has ever made. Brand's arguments are good, and his mind-changing, let's-all-learn-from-my-mistakes rhetoric is pretty persuasive. How effective will it be? I am uncertain, because unsure how far environmentalists will accept his claim to be one of their own. Sure, he studied ecology with Paul Ehrlich, dropped acid with Ken Kesey and lives on a tugboat in San Francisco, so his 60s credentials are second to none. But he has always had an unusual appetite for ideas, and is as likely to be found talking to tech entrepreneurs as tree-huggers. Climate change really grabbed his attention when the Global Business Network – yet another venture he co-founded – did a famous study for the Pentagon on the dangers of rapid climate shifts. His own big idea is that the best approach to the issues he discusses is pragmatism. He fleshes it out by example, rather than by discussing its philosophical defence by John Dewey or William James. He reckons it is an engineer's approach, accepting whatever gets results. For environmentalists, he suggests, it means not a shift in ideology, but discarding ideology completely. Maybe so, but there are deeper matters of world view at stake here than that simple suggestion recognises. Some of them are taken up in the latter part of the book, where Brand offers his own vision of caring for ecosystems even as we transform them – adopting lessons from everyone from Native Americans to modern, scientifically informed restoration projects. There is a long tradition of managing, maintaining and repairing ecosystems which we have to learn from, he argues. It begins with gardening, but can be scaled up to take in a whole planet. In fact, we must use that tradition to expand our future repertoire to include geoengineering as well as the trio of cities, nukes and gene-tweaking he has already dealt with. This will be an even bigger stretch for old-school environmentalists. Discussion of serious options for geoengineering, such as pumping sulphur dioxide aerosols into the atmosphere or manufacturing artificial \"trees\" to remove carbon dioxide, is just beginning. But it can easily sound like a collection of hubristic schemes dreamed up by mad scientists. Again, Brand is pragmatic and cautious. We will soon be considering geoengineering, he argues, because mitigation is not going to work. We do not yet know which geoengineering schemes will work, either, but we must do the research to find out, especially through investment in sensors and monitoring to improve understanding of earth systems. He foresees that old-school greens will go on clinging to their opposition to the technologies they love to hate. But if that happens, they will be marginalised by a new generation of science-led, environmentally aware ecoengineers who recognise that the state of the Earth is now in our hands. Contemplating the outcome of the Copenhagen climate conference, I can only hope he is right. There will be long, impassioned arguments along the way, but this wise book is a great start.

Magnox Electric Ltd, the operator of the site, denied some of the allegations but was found guilty of breaking the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 over the way it dealt with waste on the premises. The Environment Agency, which brought the company to court, said the case demonstrated how the operator had failed to carry out inspections on a holding tank between 1990 and 2004. The company pleaded guilty to two separate offences for failing to maintain the tank. \"Our prosecution sends a clear message to the nuclear industry that we require the highest standards of operation at all such sites and will take firm action, even if the environment beyond a site's boundaries is not affected,\" said Phil Heaton, team leader of the agency's nuclear regulation group. Peter Fenn, hearing the case at Chelmsford crown court, said he would pass sentence on Magnox Electric on 17 February. Mark Harris, prosecuting on behalf of the Environment Agency, said radioactive liquid had leaked into the ground because the tank had been poorly designed and badly maintained. The most senior figure in nuclear safety had been forced to defend the regulation of the Essex nuclear power station in an interview the Guardian published on Monday. Mike Weightman, chief inspector at the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, said it was not possible to \"inspect or check every feature of a complex plant\" but he insisted that as soon as the leak was discovered the safety body did all it could to ensure that the cause of the problem was identified and dealt with. The Bradwell reactors had been decommissioned and are being dismantled, but the site is earmarked as a potential location for one of the proposed new generation of nuclear power plants. Nuclear power is seen by politicians as a way of producing low-carbon power at a time when tackling climate change and energy security are both at the top of the agenda. Yesterday the price of carbon hit new lows as power generators and industrial companies continue to cash in credits to bolster their balance sheets. The price of European Union allowances under the second phase of the emissions trading scheme has plunged to €10.15 (£8.85) a tonne compared with highs over €30 seen in July last year. Analysts at Barclays Capital warned the price could fall further to €9 and Utilyx, the carbon information provider, said: \"There seems to be no bottom to carbon prices at the moment.\" Market experts blame the decline on profit-taking and a collapse in manufacturing. Power generators and industrial firms are selling off their credits to raise cash in a credit crunch but also because they are confident they will not need so many pollution permits at a time of falling demand for their products. The slump in the price of credits under the ETS will also revive criticisms that the cap and trade scheme has turned carbon into another volatile market commodity used by speculators to make money. Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF Energy, told the Guardian last week that the operations of the ETS needed to be reviewed by Brussels before carbon was turned into a \"sub-prime tool\" by unscrupulous companies instead of doing the job it was set up for: reducing CO2 emissions as a way of tackling global warming."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2008/jul/24/nuclearpower.energy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2008-07-24T13:34:00Z","webTitle":"David Lowry: There is no safe waste management plan for nuclear power plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/24/nuclearpower.energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/24/nuclearpower.energy","fields":{"headline":"Glowing for gold","bodyText":"Professor Beck is right to highlight the overlooked risk dimension of nuclear power in the current energy strategy debate. Unfortunately, the prime minister is the culprit-in-chief. At prime minister's question time last week, he dismissed David Cameron's Conservatives by, inter alia, gratuitously stating that the Tories had \"run away\" from taking what Gordon Brown regularly terms his brave decision on nuclear power. On the same day, writing in the Guardian's climate change supplement Brown asserts building new nuclear power plants as a \"stark reality,\" in face of increasing oil insecurity and the threat of climate change, conceding that it is a \"controversial move\". Indeed it is. On July 3, Brown confidently told the commons liaison committee that by backing new nuclear, Labour is taking \"the long-term decisions that are essential for our country\". But it is what Brown omits about the long-term impact of new nuclear reactors that could prove most controversial. Even if a \"solution\" to the future deep disposal of nuclear waste were established by the time the envisaged fleet of eight new nuclear plants are all operating by the late 2020s, each of these reactor sites – and, some, Brown's spin doctors have let it be known, might even be on greenfield rather than solely on existing sites – would become nuclear waste stores, as highly radioactive \"spent\" nuclear fuel discharged from these reactors will have to remain on these sites for up to 100 years, while it cools down. According to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, which is responsible for managing the programme to establish a long-term management and disposal for existing and new-build nuclear waste, interim stores will have to contain the high-level waste arising from nuclear plants for up to a century. Those local communities currently attracted to the short-term benefits of inward investment that the construction of a new reactor might bring should also consider the longer-term detriments of hosting spent fuel for such lengths of time. While many aspects of the new-build programme are indeed controversial, the waste-management issue remains intractable, despite false claims that the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management delivered an answer to this in 2006. To go ahead with new nuclear plants under the current uncertain condition of the nuclear waste management process is akin not just to flying an aircraft without a known landing strip, but without a tried and tested landing gear too.

Two of the new plants are expected to be sited alongside the existing reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk and Hinkley Point in Somerset. The alliance was announced alongside confirmation that Centrica has taken a 20% stake in British Energy, owned by EDF, for £2.3bn. Centrica said the deal will help it to diversify its energy sources. \"We are delighted to have successfully concluded an agreement with EDF as a world leader in nuclear power,\" said Roger Carr, chairman of Centrica. \"The deal represents good value for Centrica shareholders, improves the strategic balance of our business and further underpins our green energy credentials.\" EDF acquired British Energy, which runs eight nuclear power stations in the UK, in September for £12.4bn. The French company plans to play a major role in the construction of a new wave of nuclear power stations across Britain. The government has already said that nuclear power stations must be built to address the looming threat of energy shortages as British Energy's plants approach the end of their working lives. This policy has been criticised by environmental groups, who dispute ministers' claims that it will have a significant impact on carbon emissions. EDF hopes to build its first nuclear power plant in Britain by the end of 2017, at Hinkley Point. The alliance announced today gives Centrica a 20% stake in each new reactor. They will be European pressurised reactors (EPRs) – a third-generation design developed in France. And in another move that may hasten the arrival of a new British nuclear power plant, EDF is inviting expressions of interest for its vacant land at Heysham or Dungeness. Both are possible sites for a new nuclear power plant, and EDF must sell one plot to satisfy the European commission's competition authorities. Shares in Centrica rose by nearly 4% this morning, as major shareholders welcomed the deal with EDF. \"I see this transaction as a major step forward for Centrica and one that I am confident will deliver considerable value for its shareholders,\" said Neil Woodford, head of investment at Invesco Perpetual, which owns about 4.5% of the company. \"The partnership with EDF also promises to be a driving force in revitalising the UK nuclear industry – a vital project if the UK is to meet its long-term climate-change obligations and energy security needs.\" The £2.3bn price tag is a 6% discount on the price EDF paid for British Energy last year. Centrica has also agreed to sell its 51% stake in Belgian generation and supply business SPE to EDF for £1.2bn. Centrica has been under pressure to invest more in power generation, as its reliance on the wholesale gas and electricity markets leaves it exposed to fluctuating prices. Its biggest asset is the huge Morecambe Bay gasfield, but reserves there are running low. One analyst said yesterday that the deal will \"even out\" its earnings stream. \"You should look at it as a hedge against the vagaries.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/jan/06/gas-energy-pressure","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-01-06T15:03:22Z","webTitle":"Mini-turbines set to harness energy from pressure in UK gas pipelines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jan/06/gas-energy-pressure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/jan/06/gas-energy-pressure","fields":{"headline":"Mini-turbines to harness energy from pressure in UK's gas pipelines","bodyText":"The enormous pressure inside the gas pipeline grid that supplies UK homes is set to be harnessed to generate clean electricity. Work to place small turbines inside the gas network will start later this year at Beckton in east London. This first scheme will produce 20MW by 2010 from the natural gas that rushes through the pipes. Repeated across the country, the technology could generate up to 1GW – equivalent to the output of a conventional coal or nuclear power station. Andrew Mercer of company 2OC, which has developed the \"geo-pressure\" technology, said: \"We're very lucky that somebody else has built this pipeline infrastructure. We can borrow it to produce renewable energy.\" When natural gas is drilled from underground reservoirs it is at far too high a pressure to be used safely in homes. \"It would just blow up your gas cooker,\" Mercer said. Instead, the pressure must be released at hundreds of sites across the supply network known as letdown stations. Currently, the energy contained in this released pressure is wasted. The new technology aims to capture it to generate electricity. 2OC has teamed up with the National Grid, which owns most of the gas pipeline network in the UK, to build mini-power stations at eight letdown stations over the next few years. They will install devices called turbo expanders that generate electricity as the gas pressure is reduced. The turbines used are compact – 20cm in diameter – but can generate 1MW of electricity each. The idea is not completely new. US companies experimented with turbo expanders in the 1980s and Mercer said a handful of similar efforts have already been set up in Europe. \"But this isn't a cheap way to generate electricity. The reason it hasn't really taken off is that it's expensive.\" Blue-NG, the joint venture developing the UK projects, aims to reduce costs by combining the turboexpander with a combined heat and power (CHP) engine, which generates both electricity and heat. Mercer says this boosts the efficiency of the CHP unit to over 70%. The CHP engine would run on vegetable oil squeezed from local rapeseed, though 2OC is experimenting with other fuels, such as synthetic oil made from wood. Electricity may not be the only useful product of the turboexpander technology. Reducing the gas pressure also brings about a sudden drop in temperature, typically from 10C to -30C. Mercer calls this \"free cold\" and says it could be used as a cheap and green way to replace refrigeration units and air conditioning. He says 2OC is in talks with two companies that are interested in siting computer data centres, which require massive cooling, near UK letdown stations. The technology could also cool the London Underground network he claimed, though Transport for London has balked at the likely cost. Another use could be to provide cooling for giant concentrated solar power plants, which are gaining credibility as a future large-scale energy source. One plan is to site such plants in desert regions of north Africa, and to transport the electricity generated to Europe. Mercer says a lack of available cooling water could cripple such schemes. Siting solar plants near letdown stations, which are common in gas-rich North African countries and the Middle East, would halve the costs and double the electricity generated, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2009/sep/22/diary-liberal-democrats-conference-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-22T20:33:56Z","webTitle":"Michael White | Liberal Democrat conference diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/sep/22/diary-liberal-democrats-conference-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2009/sep/22/diary-liberal-democrats-conference-politics","fields":{"headline":"Liberal Democrat conference diary","bodyText":"The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday 30 September 2009 In the article below we said that for a fringe meeting of the Chinese Liberal Democrats no listed speaker was Chinese. The Chinese Lib Dems' co-founder, Merlene Emerson, who chaired the panel, points out to us that she certainly is. ▶ Hero of the day Steve Webb MP for socking it to the party leaders by telling the conference not to \"alienate every group in society\" by making savage cuts – or to overdose on hair-shirted misery, as Lib Dems usually do. \"If Barack Obama had been a Lib Dem his book would have been The Audacity of Gloom,\" he quipped. Keep 'em coming, Steve. ▶ Villain of the day Vince Cable (66 and a bit past it). Yes, you're right, he was yesterday's hero. But rolling news needs new scapegoats 24/7. At a private meeting of Lib Dem MPs today the sage (huh!) of Twickenham was savaged by colleagues for peddling \"complete codswallop\" without consulting them. They meant his \"mansion tax\": property taxes are never popular among MPs or within sight on Sandbanks, Dorset's richest suburb. Offload Cable shares now! ▶ Freudian slip of the day \"We have had the doctrine of 'Kill Osama', then 'Root them out', 'Bolster the Kabul government' and 'Isolate the Taliban'\" – delegate Paul Reynolds in the Afghan debate. Except that he said \"Kill Obama\". Whoops. Don't give those healthcare knuckleheads ideas, they've already got them. ▶ St Peter's special prize for betrayal \"They used to say Bosnia was dysfunctional. It's not half as dysfunctional as Brussels, I'll tell you that.\" Ardent pro-European Paddy Ashdown on the frustrations of actually achieving an EU foreign policy. ▶ Rudyard Kipling prize for ostentatious knowledge of pavement politics in the Hindu Kush Ed Davey MP for being able to name six Afghan warlords and how much it would cost to buy them all off (\"$30m a month – far less than the cost of fighting\"). Another uncosted Lib Dem spending pledge. ▶ U-turn of the day Lembit Opik MP telling delegates that 12 months of intense research has persuaded him of the necessity of embracing nuclear power. \"I am not too keen on nuclear power, but I am keen to keep the lights on.\" The Lib Dem Lothario's real U-turn there is the bit about the lights. ▶ Unkindest quip about George Osborne \"Britain in recession can't risk a chancellor on work experience\" – Lord Oakeshott. ▶ Most gratuitous reference to Hitler Chris Huhne MP for reminding delegates that among the \"wackos and weirdos\" who belong to David Cameron's European Conservative and Reformist group of MEPs is the Latvian Fatherland and Freedom party, which celebrates 1,000 Latvians who fought and died with the Waffen SS in 1944. It's unkind to the Tories and upsets them. Naughty Chris. ▶ Highlight of tomorrow's session The fringe meeting of the Chinese Lib Dems.

OK, so a horsebox sounds about as glamorous as a portaloo, and, unless you are a pony-mad eight-year-old, the proposition of camping in one isn't likely to get a girl's heart cantering. But, park the horsebox in a flower-filled meadow, kit it out like a Toast photoshoot and give it a cute name – and you've got a retro-romantic-mini-break-on-wheels. After a few seasons on the festival circuit, the Lovestruck's rock'n'roll days are behind it as its creators have a new baby, so it has been put out to grass by a pond at Swallowtail Hill Farm, near Rye in East Sussex. Farmers Sarah and Chris Broadbent, custodians of the Lovestruck, couldn't have been more welcoming; they escorted us with great cheerfulness over their fields, our luggage in a wheelbarrow, especially as we had arrived – like inconsiderate city folk – at gone midnight and they had to get up in a few hours to feed the animals. Guided by the light of a torch and thousands of stars, we were definitely on our own (sleeping in a field a few feet from lots of strangers has always seemed to me to be just one of the dafter contradictions of camping). I have distinctly unfond memories of caravanning (we didn't camp: the very word makes my mum pull her something-mouldy-at-the-back-of–the-fridge face). On one particularly doomed holiday, my dad packed the car to go home more times than you might have said we had hot dinners during our stay, had my mum not pulled the knobs off the hob on first use; every time you tried to use anything, a lump of 1970s plastic would come off in your hand. Happily, I can report there is nothing as unlovely as laminate in the Lovestruck – even the curtain rails are made from bits of driftwood. (Yup, curtains. Pretty gingham ones. In a horsebox.) By candlelight it was as cosy as a horsebox can be and we were snug as bugs – which I was trying NOT to think about, given our proximity to the pond – in the little bed above the driver's cabin. One bonus of arriving in the middle of the night is the surprise of finding yourself somewhere absolutely lovely in the morning. We were woken by the croaking of frogs and sunshine streaming through the horses' little windows. The temptation to ramp up the Rosy Lee in the decor has been wisely resisted – a couple of stained-glass windows just the right side of kitsch. The bench in the \"living area\" can be used as a second bed, but – as the name suggests – the Lovestruck is meant for two: kids could sleep there, but they'd have to be old enough for the pond not to be a worry. Our welcome pack contained all the essentials for a goodlifer's breakfast: all organic, natch. The eggs – from the farm hens – deserve a special mention: the yolks as bright and yellow as the buttercups all around us. There's a state-of-the art tripod burner (made somewhere like Norway, where they know about these things) and an armoury of long-handled implements for the boy scout in your life and – and I'm my mother's daughter on this – there's everything the fussiest glamper could demand: a wood-burning outdoor shower (it takes 45 minutes to heat up – but, hey, what's the rush?); organic products; and compost loo cabins with chirpy (and possibly unnecessary) instructions. There are two other yurts in an adjoining field, so at most you might have to share with a couple of families. Finally, after cooking and washing – it's amazing how long these things can take – we were ready to explore this corner of East Sussex. Our day took us from the picturesque cobbled lanes of Rye, with its historic church, and maze of antique and tea shops and the sea-mist-shrouded expanse of Camber Sands, as crowded as a Victorian seaside postcard (except with a whole load more flesh on show), its endless skies dotted with colourful kites to the eerily beautiful isolation of Dungeness, its horizon surreally punctured by two nuclear power stations and two lighthouses. Rye - the inspiration for E F Benson's fictional town of Trilling - has attracted an impressive list of literary luminaries, while the bleak beauty of the Romney marshes continues to draw artists. We made a pilgrimage to Lamb House, home to Henry James for a period (familiar to readers of Colm Toibin's elegant Booker-shortlisted The Master), followed by a visit to filmmaker Derek Jarman's much-photographed Prospect Cottage, with its strangely pretty shingle garden, in Dungeness and a quirky studio displaying local artists' work. Despite tempting restaurant recommendations, journalistic duty – and the glorious weather – dictated a barbecue (Sarah had delivered a carnivorous feast). By chance, one of the neighbouring farms was holding a charity party, so, as we dined under the stars, we were treated to what felt like a private son et luminaire – fireworks and cover versions with a backing chorus from the frogs in the pond beside us. Who'd have thought a weekend in a horsebox could be so romantic. Visitors can try their hand at various activities from tractor-driving to archery, but the next day we lazed about like happy cows in our meadow. We were rewarded by another aerial display, this time by the two resident swallows and their young, swooping and twisting as if they were staging a recreation of the Battle of Britain, the 70th anniversary of which was being commemorated a few miles along the coastline at Folkestone. Before we – reluctantly – left, I had a peak inside the luxury yurts. They have beds – made out of driftwood, naturally. Beds. In tents. I might even be persuaded to try canvas next time. Amen to glamping. • There is a two-night minimum stay at the Lovestruck (thelovestruck.co.uk), costing from £190.

But, as you quickly realise when you step inside the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), there's precious little about the place that is obvious. The cello is resting in a corner of MIT's celebrated media lab, a hub of techy creativity. There's a British red telephone kiosk standing in the middle of one of its laboratories, while another room is signposted: \"Lego learning lab - Lifelong kindergarten.\" The cello is part of the Opera of the Future lab run by the infectiously energetic Tod Machover. A renaissance man for the 21st – or perhaps 22nd – century, Machover is a composer, inventor and teacher rolled into one. He sweeps into the office 10 minutes late, which is odd because his watch is permanently set 20 minutes ahead in a patently vain effort to be punctual. Then, with the urgency of the White Rabbit, he rushes me across the room to show me the cello. It looks like any other electric classical instrument, with a solid wood body and jack socket. But it is much more. Machover calls it a \"hyperinstrument\", a sort of thinking machine that allows Ma and his cello to interact with one another and make music together. \"The aim is to build an instrument worthy of a great musician like Yo-Yo Ma that can understand what he is trying to do and respond to it,\" Machover says. The cello has numerous sensors across its body, fret and along the bow. By measuring the pressure, speed and angle of the virtuoso's performance it can interpret his mood and engage with it, producing extraordinary new sounds. The virtuoso cellist frequently performs on the instrument as he tours around the world. When Machover was developing the instrument, he found that the sound it made was distorted by Ma's hand as it absorbed electric current flowing from the bow. Machover had a eureka moment. What if you reversed that? What if you channelled the electricity flowing from the performer's body and turned it into music? Armed with that new idea, Machover designed an interactive system for Prince that the rock star deployed on stage at Wembley Stadium a few years ago, conjuring up haunting sounds through touch and gesture. Later, two of Machover's students at the media lab had the idea of devising an interactive game out of the technology. They went on to set up a company called Harmonix, based just down the road from MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from which they developed Rock Band and Guitar Hero. From Ma's cello, via Prince, to one of the most popular video games ever invented. And all stemming from Machover's passion for pushing at the boundaries of the existing world to extend and unleash human potential. That's not a bad description of MIT as a whole. This maverick community, on the other side of the Charles River from Boston, brings highly gifted, highly motivated individuals together from a vast range of disciplines but united by a common desire: to leap into the dark and reach for the unknown. The result of that single unifying ambition is visible all around us. For the past 150 years, MIT has been leading us into the future. The discoveries of its teachers and students have become the warp and weft of modernity, the stuff of daily life that we now all take for granted. The telephone, electromagnets, radars, high-speed photography, office photocopiers, cancer treatments, pocket calculators, computers, the internet, the decoding of the human genome, lasers, space travel . . . the list of innovations that involved essential contributions from MIT and its faculty goes on and on. And with that drive into modernity MIT has played no small part in building western, and particularly US, global dominance. Its explosive innovations have helped to secure America's military and cultural supremacy, and with it the country's status as the world's sole superpower. As the school marks its 150th anniversary this month, it seems the US has never needed MIT's help more than it does today. The voices of the nay-sayers are in the ascendancy, questioning the US's ability to reinvent itself, to heal its wounded economy and sustain its leadership in the face of a burgeoning China. Questions too, are increasingly being asked about the ability of science and technology to address the world's problems, as optimism about the future slides into doubt. \"There is a profound cynicism around the role of science that is debilitating for those in the enterprise, and devastating for this country,\" says MIT's president, Susan Hockfield. \"If we can't figure out how to make technological innovation the path to the future, then America is not going to have invented the future, some other country will have.\" She fears the US is increasingly suffering from what she calls a deficit of ambition. While 85% of MIT students are studying science and engineering, in the US as a whole the proportion is just 15%. That leaves the world's creative powerhouse vulnerable. \"If you travel to Asia, to Shanghai or Bangalore, you feel the pulse of people racing to a future they are going to invent. You feel that rarely any more in the US.\" Which makes MIT's mission all the more essential. \"MIT has an enormous responsibility right now,\" Hockfield says. \"We feel that deeply. It needs to be a beacon of inspiration around the power of science and technology to create a brighter future for the world.\" No pressure, then. From the moment MIT was founded by William Barton Rogers in 1861 it was clear what it was not. It was not like the other school up the river. While Harvard stuck to the English model of an Oxbridge classical education, with its emphasis on Latin and Greek as befitted the landed aristocracy, MIT would look to the German system of learning based on research and hands-on experimentation, championing meritocracy and industry where Harvard preferred the privileges of birth. Knowledge was at a premium, yes, but it had to be useful. This gritty, down-to-earth quality, in keeping with the industrialisation that was spreading through the US at the time, was enshrined in the school motto, Mens et Manus – Mind and Hand – as well as its logo, which showed a gowned scholar standing beside an ironmonger bearing a hammer and anvil. That symbiosis of intellect and craftsmanship still suffuses the institute's classrooms, where students are not so much taught as engaged and inspired. There is a famous film of one of MIT's star professors, the physicist Walter Lewin, demonstrating the relationship between an oscillating metal ball and mass. Halfway through the experiment he climbs on to the ball and starts swinging himself around the lecture theatre in a huge oscillating arch as though he were appearing in Spider-Man on Broadway. When Emily Dunne, an 18-year-old mechanical engineering student from Bermuda, was taking a course in differential equations recently, she was startled when her professor started singing in the middle of the lecture. \"He was trying to show us how to understand overtones. It was kind of weird, but then everyone here is a little quirky,\" she says. Mind and Hand applies too to MIT's belief that theory and practice go together; neither is superior to the other, and the two are stronger when combined. That conviction is as strongly held by the lowliest student as it is by its Nobel laureates (there have been 50 of them). Take Christopher Merrill, 21, a third-year undergraduate in computer science. He is spending most of his time on a competition set in his robotics class. The contest is to see which student can most effectively programme a robot to build a house out of blocks in under 10 minutes. Merrill says he could have gone for the easiest route – designing a simple robot that would build the house quickly. But he wanted to try to master an area of robotics that remains unconquered – adaptability, the ability of the robot to rethink its plans as the environment around it changes, as would a human. \"I like to take on things that have never been done before rather than to work in an iterative way just making small steps forward,\" he explains. \"It's much more exciting to go out into the unknown.\" Merrill is already planning the start-up he wants to set up when he graduates in a year's time. He has an idea for a new type of contact lens that would augment reality by allowing consumers to see additional visual information. He is fearful that he might be just too late in taking his concept to market, as he has heard that a Silicon Valley firm is already developing similar technology. As such, he might become one of many MIT graduates who go on to form companies that fail. Alternatively, he might become one of those who go on to succeed, in spectacular fashion. And there are many of them. A survey of living MIT alumni found that they have formed 25,800 companies, employing more than three million people including about a quarter of the workforce of Silicon Valley. Those firms between them generate global revenues of about $1.9tn (£1.2tn) a year. If MIT was a country, it would have the 11th highest GDP of any nation in the world. Ed Roberts, MIT's professor of technological innovation and entrepreneurship, says such figures belie the fact that the institute is actually quite small, with just 10,000 students and about 1,000 faculty. \"That's not big. But when all those people sign up to a mission to forward entrepreneurship, you have a dramatically bigger impact. In MIT, people are encouraged not just to think bold, but to do it boldly. \"If you come up with a brilliant idea, that's OK. If you win a Nobel prize for your research, that's fine. But if you take that idea and apply it and make something transformative happen, then in MIT that's deeply admired.\" Inevitably, perhaps, there is a nerdy quality to the place that is reflected in one of its much cherished traditions – the student \"hack\". Hack is a misleading word here, as it is less to do with cracking into computers than with hi-tech high-jinks. \"Prank\" is a better description. In the student canteen you can see two of the most famous MIT hacks preserved for prosperity – a police car that was balanced on top of the institute's great dome, and a functioning fire hydrant that was erected in one of the lobbies. The latter hack, dating from 1991, was a wry comment on a former president's remark that \"getting an education from MIT is like taking a drink from a fire hose\". Then there is the Baker House Piano Drop, an annual institution ever since students first dropped a stand-up piano from a sixth-storey dormitory in 1972, then measured the impact that it made when it crashed on the pavement below. Wacky, perhaps. Geeky, certainly. But also extraordinarily difficult technically and requiring great imagination and ingenuity. MIT in a nutshell. The current president offers two other important clues to MIT's success as a cauldron of innovation. The first is meritocracy. Hockfield is MIT's first female president, which is significant for an institution that since the 1990s has been battling against its own in-built discrimination against women. Women still make up only 21% of the faculty. But the gender balance of its students is almost 50:50, and about 40% of its staff members were born outside the US, underlying how MIT remains a huge magnet for talented individuals around the world. \"It's one thing to talk about fostering creativity, but unless you strive for a true meritocracy you are driving away the best people, and what would be the point of that?\" Hockfield says. MIT delights in taking brilliant minds in vastly diverse disciplines and flinging them together. You can see that in its sparkling new David Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, which brings scientists, engineers and clinicians under one roof. Or in its Energy Initiative, which acts as a bridge for MIT's combined firepower across all its five schools, channelling huge resources into the search for a solution to global warming. It works to improve the efficiency of existing energy sources, including nuclear power as it has its own nuclear reactor, a lesser-known fact that MIT prefers not to brag about. It is also forging ahead with alternative energies from solar to wind and geothermal, and has recently developed the use of viruses to synthesise batteries that could prove crucial in the advancement of electric cars. Before my tour of MIT ends I am given a taste of what this astonishing abundance of riches means in practice. In the space of half an hour I enjoy the company – in the flesh and spacially – of three of the towering figures of the modern age. I begin by dragging Tim Berners-Lee away from his computer screen to talk to me about how he ended up here. The Briton who invented the world wide web is part of the global brain drain to MIT. He created the web by linking hypertext with the internet in 1989 while he was at Cern in Geneva, but then felt he had no option but to cross the Atlantic. \"There were a couple of reasons I had to come – one was because the web spread much faster in America than it did in Europe and the other was because there was no MIT over there.\" What is it about MIT that Europe could not offer him? \"It's not just another university, it has this pre-eminent reputation and that in turn sets up a self-fulfilling prophecy: as soon as it becomes seen as the cool place to go for technology, then people will head there as I did. Even though I spend my time with my head buried in the details of web technology, or travelling the world, the nice thing is that when I do walk the corridors I bump into people who are working in other fields that are fascinating, and that keeps me intellectually alive.\" Berners-Lee offers to take me to my next appointment, and in so doing makes his point about MIT's self-fulfilling prophecy even more eloquently. We walk along the squiggly corridors of MIT's Stata Centre, which was designed by Frank Gehry. It is a classic Gehry structure, formed from undulating polished steel and tumbling blocks of brushed aluminium that reminds Berners-Lee, he tells me, of the higgledy-piggledy Italian village one of his relatives grew up in. After negotiating a maze of passageways Berners-Lee delivers me at the door of Noam Chomsky. It sums up this wild place: the inventor of the web leads me through the work of a titan of modern architecture to one of the world's foremost linguists and anti-war activists. Chomsky is in a hurry. On the night of our meeting he will appear on stage alongside the Kronos Quartet at the world premiere of a new piece of music dedicated to him. The composer? Tod Machover, he of the Yo-Yo Ma cello. I put it to Chomsky that it's a revealing paradox that he, as a leading critic of the US's overweening military might, has been based, since the 1950s, at an institution that was centrally involved in erecting the burgeoning military-industrial complex he so incisively opposes. After all, MIT has long been a leader in military research and development, receiving huge sums in grants from the Pentagon. It was core to America's prosecution of the cold war, developing ever more sophisticated guidance systems for ballistic missiles trained on Moscow. \"What people don't understand is that the role of the Pentagon,\" Chomsky says, \"to a large extent was developing the technology of the future. There were some odd things about it. This building was also one of the centres of the antiwar resistance, and it was right in there, 100% funded by the Pentagon. But they didn't care.\" What does that tell us about MIT? \"I was just left alone to my own devices. Other people took days off to run their businesses; I went off as an antiwar activist.

The delay raises fresh doubts over the \"nuclear renaissance\" planned by Britain, France and other European countries to ensure security of energy supplies and combat climate change. Areva, the French state-owned group building the European pressurised reactor (EPR) at Olkiluoto with German partner Siemens, is expected to take a further charge on top of the estimated provisions of between €1.5bn (£1.2bn) and €2bn it has reportedly set aside. The EPR is one of a series of reactors being reviewed by the British government as it embarks on a programme to build up to 10 nuclear plants towards the end of the next decade. The Finnish EPR, originally budgeted at €3bn, is now expected to cost at least €4.5bn. Now delayed four times, the 1,600-megawatt plant was due to come on stream next year. The Areva-led consortium building the plant blames the Finnish utility TVO for the delays, accusing it yesterday of taking an average of nine months to validate documents it sends to the Finnish safety authority instead of the agreed two. It has begun arbitration proceedings over the contract. TVO said the latest delay had arisen because civil (cement) construction works would take \"several months longer than originally expected\". Its project manager, Jouni Silvennoinen, insisted it was not due to shoulder any of the losses. But Areva, which admits the project \"is and will remain challenging to the end\", says it has completed the manufacture of the primary components - the reactor vessel and the first steam generator. French reports suggest the delays are due to the \"fierce commercial will\" of Areva's chief executive, Anne Lauvergeon, to produce the first EPR."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2008/oct/30/edmiliband-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2008-10-30T11:59:09Z","webTitle":"Government accused of breaking rules over Sellafield decommissioning plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/30/edmiliband-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2008/oct/30/edmiliband-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Government accused of breaking rules over Sellafield decommissioning plans","bodyText":"The government was last night under pressure from parliament's most powerful watchdog committee to re-open consultations on the deal which has landed taxpayers with the bill for nuclear accidents and leaks when a private consortium takes over the decommissioning of Sellafield next month. Edward Leigh, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, has written to Ed Miliband, the energy and climate change secretary, telling him that his ministry had broken Treasury rules and failed to given MPs the opportunity to object to the indemnity to private firms. The row originally broke out after MPs discovered that Malcolm Wicks, the former energy minister, had used emergency procedures to get the deal through during the parliamentary recess. He had consulted Leigh, who then let it through, on the understanding that details of the indemnity would be placed in the House of Commons library allowing other MPs to object. Last weekend it was discovered that the documents were not put in the library until October 14 - 75 days after the closing date for objections. In the meantime, the government had signed the deal with the consortium led by American firm URS Washington, French firm Areva and the UK company Amec for the £6.5bn contract on October 6. In his letter Leigh said: \"In future, your department should make every effort to lay minutes in parliament in a more timely fashion, and I should be obliged if you would explain the reasons behind the failure in this instance. I must also add that it is my view, and that of the committee, that the period for objection should be reopened.\" Last night Austin Mitchell, Labour MP for Greater Grimsby and a member of the committee, said: \"The feeling among some of us was that the department was being very devious and the behaviour of the ministry was unacceptable.\" The new Department for Energy and Climate Change has insisted it was an oversight by an official that led to the breach of procedures. But Wicks was unrepentant. \"It would have ridiculous to expect firms to meet the uninsurable cost of a nuclear accident,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/jun/06/industry-manufacturing-sheffield-cable-clegg","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-06T19:30:47Z","webTitle":"Saving industry needn't pit sentiment against machismo | Julian Glover","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/06/industry-manufacturing-sheffield-cable-clegg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/06/industry-manufacturing-sheffield-cable-clegg","fields":{"headline":"Saving industry needn't pit sentiment against machismo","bodyText":"There's something sensual about steel. The other day I went to see smoke, sparks and sweat: industry as it ought to be, raw metal pounded and sliced. Retail feels flat; banking is suits; Britain's service sector a fool's paradise compared to making things. Some part of our brain tells us that effort must produce a tangible product, the modern hunter-gather instinct. Yet industry has been so unfashionable that it is usual to assume this country no longer makes much. There's embarrassment about the collapse of the workshop of the world. Germany does cars, the Chinese do iPads, the Italians clothes – and Britain? Well, there's Land Rover, just about, and pharmaceuticals and JCB and maybe Hunter wellies – but even HP Sauce is made in Holland, and Sheffield is more famous for Meadowhall shopping centre than for cutlery. We do coffee shops and consumer debt. Get off the train at Meadowhall, though, and you'll see why this assumption is dangerous. Beyond Argos and Primark there is an industrial scene in the Don Valley. The 200-year story of Sheffield Forgemasters is the story of British manufacturing: the place where they invented stainless steel, a half-mile long hall where crankshafts were made for Spitfire fighters, before the usual postwar mess of nationalisation, privatisation, strife, foreign sale and bankruptcy. Except that this story, unlike those of so many other factories, has a twist: a management buyout in 2005, investment, a growing workforce that showed its commitment by putting its savings into shares in the business, and exports – 80% of production goes abroad. Now Forgemasters is at the centre of another chapter in the story of industry – picked by Peter Mandelson for an £80m loan before the election, it waits to see if his successor Vince Cable delivers. In a wise speech last week the business secretary criticised what he called the anti-market \"new interventionism\", \"micromanaging the economy at the level of individual companies\". His theory is sound. The consequences sometimes painful. Walking around Forgemasters it is impossible not to be stirred: great misshapen lumps of scrap steel, red heat shining through furnace doors, huge presses, and a machining hall where the black crust is cut from immense forgings to produce shiny precision-engineered parts. This factory can do things that can be done nowhere else: I passed the core of a submarine's reactor, lying near the shaft of a power station turbine. There are customers for these products. This is not a dying factory afraid of foreign competition. The instinctive reaction is to want to help this firm grow. Forgemasters' 800 jobs – and 800 more among suppliers – seem more worthwhile than 800 others stacking shelves in Meadowhall. It would be wrong to say Britain has let its factories go hang: this is, by some measures, the sixth largest manufacturing country, adding over £150bn a year to GDP. But it hasn't been cool to admit it. Governments and economists, like Cable, warn against picking winners. Rover wasn't rescued, and Labour let Corus shut the Redcar steelworks. There's been a machismo about non-intervention. Forgemasters is the test. The company was saved from bankruptcy by the state's willingness to take on its pension liabilities but now it is waiting for help of a different kind, Mandelson's £80m loan. The case for the Forgemasters' money is strong. It matches private loans to invest in a 15,000-tonne press, which could stamp out the castings needed for the 400 new nuclear power reactors likely to be built around the world. The only other place that can do this is in northern Japan. Yet Forgemasters is profitable and growing. So why does it need government help? The dilemma has buried other industrial firms. Forgemasters, independently owned, is in City terms small, its £12m profit a blip on a bond traders' screen. The investment it needs is larger than the value of its equity and banks are reluctant to back a business that went bust a few years ago. Much private money is being put into the Forgemasters deal. But government help makes raising it easier. The management could sell out to a bigger company able to raise all the cash privately, and they aren't short of suitors. But the buyer would surely be foreign – there are hardly any big British engineering groups left – and Forgemasters' knowledge and order book, and maybe its jobs, might go abroad, too. Should government step in? Mandelson said yes. Cable's instincts say no. Both make a good case. Cable argues skills matter more than bailouts; he does not worry about foreign ownership; he thinks the chances of the government backing the right companies is small. Mandelson helped a few firms, with small dollops of cash. But to Forgemasters that £80m could be transformative, and Sheffield won't easily forgive local MP Nick Clegg if the coalition says no. It isn't as if non-intervention is a doctrine consistently applied. All parties are happy to promise what government will do to create green jobs. The state can't pick winners, say the theorists, yet Forgemasters are already winners. It would be a pity if speculative future industries attracted more support than present success."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/250737","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-16T21:30:34Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: Indian concern over security in Afghanistan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/250737","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/250737","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: Indian concern over security in Afghanistan","bodyText":"Thursday, 25 February 2010, 12:56 C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 NEW DELHI 000355 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 02/17/2020 TAGS PGOV, PREL, PTER, PARM, KNNP, ENRG, IR, PK, IN SUBJECT: NSA MENON DISCUSSES REGIONAL SECURITY AND TRADE ISSUES WITH CODEL MCCASKILL Classified By: Ambassador Tim Roemer for Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 1. (C) SUMMARY. In a meeting with CODEL McCaskill February 17, National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon touched on regional security issues including Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran, as well as several trade-related issues including defense acquisitions, India's Medium Multiple Role Fighter Aircraft (MMRCA) tender, export controls, civil nuclear cooperation, and genetically modified foods. Menon credited intelligence shared by the United States with helping to protect targets in the vicinity of the February 13 Pune bombing, leaving the terrorists no alternative but to go after a soft target instead. Terrorism would be \"the primary issue\" in the planned February 25 Foreign Secretary-level talks with Pakistan, but Menon allowed that the agenda could expand after the first round of talks depending on Pakistan's response. Menon cautioned that if the Pakistani establishment felt U.S. commitment was flagging in Afghanistan it would not do what was needed in the West. Menon was skeptical about the effect of new sanctions on the divided Iranian elite, but India would continue to implement any sanctions approved by the UN Security Council; Menon hoped they would be carefully targeted. He emphasized the importance for the U.S.-India relationship of \"being seen to be sharing technology,\" and would encourage the Indian Embassy in Washington to explain India's proposed reforms on export controls directly to Senate staff. Menon confirmed the government would introduce civil nuclear liability legislation in the next Parliament. END SUMMARY. Menon Touts \"Full-spectrum\" Relationship, Discusses Pune Bombing - - - 2. (C) In a wide-ranging meeting with CODEL McCaskill February 17, National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon touched on several regional security and trade-related issues. Whereas the U.S.-India relationship used to be too narrow, Menon said we now had the opposite problem, a \"full-spectrum\" relationship touching on virtually every area of life, with correspondingly high expectations for what we can accomplish together. 3. (C) Menon welcomed the condolences offered by Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) for the February 13 bombing in Pune that killed 10 and injured dozens. The bombing was \"a shock, yet not shocking,\" considering India's familiar experience as a terrorist target. Menon credited intelligence shared by the United States with helping prompt the Indian government to protect targets in the vicinity of the attack, such as the Chabad House and Osho Ashram, perhaps leaving the terrorists no alternative but to go after a soft target instead. Three groups had claimed responsibility, but the government had not come to any conclusions about the perpetrators. In India's long history of dealing with terrorism, Menon said, \"Most attacks lead back to Pakistan.\" \"Many Pakistans\" - - - 4. (C) Menon recounted that India had entered into the Composite Dialogue with Pakistan on the basis of former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf's assurance that India would not be targeted by terrorists as long as the talks continued. This dialogue process entered into a pause in 2007 at Musharraf's request when he was faced with difficult domestic challenges, which ultimately led to his ouster. Since then, India endured serial bombing attacks throughout 2008, two attacks on its embassy in Kabul (one he attributed to the Haqqani Network and the other to Lashkar-e-Tayiba), and then the November 26, 2008 attacks in Mumbai, known as NEW DELHI 00000355 002 OF 004 \"26/11.\" Menon lamented that Pakistan had shown itself to be \"unable or unwilling to wean itself off from terror as an instrument of state policy.\" He alluded to evidence that serving Pakistani officials were involved in the 26/11 attacks. 5. (C) Menon shared his perspective that \"We are dealing with many Pakistans, so we need to run many Pakistan policies at the same time.\" He stressed that even after the Mumbai attacks India did not sever trade or travel ties with Pakistan because these elements of the relationship were important to achieving an eventual peace with Pakistan. As a \"true democracy,\" public opinion defined the limits of India's forebearance, but Menon stressed that India did not wish to play into the hands of the terrorists by shunning dialogue. 6. (C) Terrorism would be \"the primary issue\" in the planned February 25 Foreign Secretary-level talks, but Menon allowed that after the first talks \"it will be up to the Pakistanis how they respond.\" A peaceful, stable Pakistan was in India's national interest, which was \"why we keep trying.\" Menon confessed that the Indian government's expectations for talks today were lower than when India had entered into talks with Pakistan in the past because \"We don't think Pakistan is capable of delivering much, but what's the alternative?\" He concluded, \"A peaceful, stable Pakistan is in our interest; we will work at it even if they make it hard for us.\" Afghanistan: Menon a \"Minority of One\" - - - 7. (C) Turning to Pakistan's role in Afghanistan, Menon cautioned that if the Pakistani establishment felt U.S. commitment was flagging in Afghanistan it would \"sit it out and use the Indian threat as an excuse for not doing what was needed\" in the West. Menon said he may be a \"minority of one,\" but he thought there was more potential for success in Afghanistan than most observers in India. The British were convinced the Coalition would lose because they lost three wars there, but others had been able to tame the country. Menon trumpeted India's assistance program of small, community-based projects, saying it took Indian officials one-and-a-half years to navigate around the ministries in Kabul to get direct access to local people, but it had paid off enormously. He cited one instance in which 13,000 Afghans had applied for exams to qualify for Indian scholarships; not all of them were qualified, but it showed how strong the desire was for such opportunities. He concluded that success will require \"more than just a military effort.\" 8. (C) McCaskill agreed we had a chance to succeed because we had adjusted our strategy. McCaskill was confident the United States would continue to sustain the 300,000 strong Afghan National Security Forces even if we began to draw down troops in 2011. Menon observed that \"the wonder of the U.S. system is how quickly you learn; that cannot be said of any other country in the world.\" Iran: A Choice Among \"Unsatisfactory Strategies\" - - - 9. (C) Menon agreed with Senator Jeff Merkley's (D-OR) assertion that a nuclear Iran would be bad for everyone. Merkley had supported the Obama Administration's efforts to seek dialogue with Iran, but it was now clear the Islamic Republic was not open to dialogue. Menon replied that \"the last thing we want is another nuclear power in our neighborhood.\" That was why India voted against Iran three times at the IAEA and implemented UN sanctions. Iran was NEW DELHI 00000355 003 OF 004 \"hopping mad\" over India's IAEA votes and Iranian Foreign Minister Moutakki \"blew up\" at former National Security Advisor M.K. Narayanan during his last visit to Delhi. \"It goes without saying,\" according to Menon, that India would continue to implement any sanctions against Iran approved by the Security Council. 10. (C) India had a more complex relationship with Iran and was convinced that it could work with Iran on some issues. For instance, Menon asserted that Iran was more worried about the Taliban today than ISAF, which was not the case a year ago. The trouble was that the Iranian elite was divided, so the normal rules of Iranian politics no longer seemed to apply. Under these circumstances, Menon asked, \"What effect will sanctions have?\" \"If you must impose sanctions, we will go along with it,\" according to Menon, \"but we should be aware that it could end up benefiting the regime.\" He said any sanctions should be carefully targeted so they do not end up hurting the people rather than the elite. He concluded that the Iran situation was \"very unsatisfactory from our point of view as well,\" and that the United States had \"a choice among unsatisfactory strategies.\" Trade Issues: Fighters, Export Controls, Civ Nuke, GM Foods - - - 11. (C) Menon said he appreciated all that the India and the United States had been able to accomplish together, and said we needed to do more on defense cooperation. McCaskill remarked about the Boeing presence in St. Louis and inquired about the MMRCA fighter tender. Menon said the technical evaluations would wrap up in April and the tender would be awarded following a fair process. He added that the C-17 deal was almost done and only a few \"loose ends\" needed to be tied up. 12. (C) \"In order to kick the relationship into a different gear,\" according to Menon, we needed \"to be seen to be sharing technology.\" We both have complex legal and regulatory structures, some left over from the Cold War, \"ancient stuff.\" It could take years to change this, but we have to try. McCaskill agreed, suggesting the possibility of using the annual Defense Authorization Legislation, which moves through Congress annually \"like clockwork,\" to eliminate \"legislative handcuffs.\" Menon said he would ask the Indian Embassy in Washington to be in touch with McCaskill's staff to walk them through India's proposed changes. 13. (C) Merkley praised Menon's role in helping to conclude the Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, and inquired about progress on implementation. Menon mentioned planned Reprocessing Consultations March 2-4 in Delhi, adding, \"If we could accomplish the 123 Agreement, I don't see how this can stop us.\" Menon said unequivocally, \"We're introducing liability legislation to the next Parliament.\" 14. (C) McCaskill noted that if there is one issue with regard to India that makes Americans \"cranky\" it is that India was stealing our manufacturing base. Pointing out that Monsanto was also located in Missouri, she conceded that genetically modified foods were controversial, but noted that the United States purchased Indian GM cotton. Menon said we were just catching \"the peak of the wave\" on this issue in India, noting that the papers were full of vigorous arguments on both sides. He thanked McCaskill for reminding him that in difficult economic times these issues had the potential to take on added proportion in the relationship. 15. (C) Codel McCaskill did not have the opportunity to clear this cable.

The note ran through the key topics to be covered in Holbrooke's various meetings with senior Indian officials and political figures when he stopped in Delhi on his way. \"The encouraging news for US interests is that whereas India, over the previous 40-odd years, had tended to quickly and suspiciously dismiss US intentions in the region, our recent improvement in relations have made Delhi much more amenable to co-operating,\" Holbrooke, who died earlier this week, was told. Three months later, John Kerry, the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, was also on his way to Delhi. India was a \"raucous democracy\", the senator was told by the embassy in the Indian capital in another briefing paper, with a government that was \"a true partner\" of the US. There were some issues on which the two states differed, such as Iran and Burma, and several areas of tension – including US policy in Afghanistan and Pakistan – but, on the whole, the news was good. \"The US-India defence relationship\" was \"progressing rapidly\", sales of weapons could reach $4bn (£2.5bn) in the coming year and India was \"beginning to understand it must address the climate issue not as a poor developing nation but rather as the major economy it has become\". Four thousand cables from the US embassy in New Delhi reveal a difficult but increasingly warm relationship between a prickly emerging power anxious about its security despite its size and increasing wealth and a superpower that is keen to be friends but very much on its own terms. In the cables, American diplomats complain of bureaucratic inertia, a lack of capacity, oversensitivity, corrupt or populist politicians, a bureaucracy that is stuck in the era of \"the cold war\" and profound suspicion of their motives. However they appear to recognise that a respectful and conciliatory approach to the booming and increasingly self-confident India pays dividends. For its part, the Indian government appears keen to obtain US assistance, especially military or counter-terrorism technology, and diplomatic support on issues such as getting a permanent seat on the UN security council, but reluctant to make many reciprocal gestures. A complicated regional environment, the Kashmir issue, concerns about terrorism and nuclear civil technology both unite and divide the two powers. Despite worries about torture, corruption and deep social problems, US diplomats still appear impressed by India's \"vibrant and diverse\" democracy, seeing the country as a natural ally in the region and viewing Manmohan Singh, the 77-year-old economist and prime minister, as a natural friend. The US view of Indian politicians is variable, however. Particular vitriol is reserved for India's still-powerful communists, who worked to block a key nuclear power agreement which would see, the US diplomats say, a major boost for clean energy in India and a market of $150bn (£96bn) for US companies. Prakash Karat, the Communist party of India (Marxist) general secretary, is described as an \"extortionist\". The failure of Sonia Gandhi, the chairman of the ruling United Progressive Alliance coalition and the president of the Congress party, to overcome his opposition to the nuclear deal is criticised heavily. \"With the future of Indian foreign credibility hanging in balance, Sonia Gandhi has been unable to show principled leadership even when it might benefit her party at the polls. Mrs. Gandhi never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity,\" one cable, sent in November 2007, said. A veteran former Congress minister, Arjun Singh, is described as being from the party's \"Jurassic\" wing, the former Minister of the Interior is \"spectacularly inept\" and public anger after the terrorist attacks on Mumbai, the Indian commercial capital, in November 2008 had \"served as a catharsis for people to vent other long simmering grievances against government – its corruption, its pompous use of symbols of authority like security guards and vehicle sirens, its indifference to providing health and education services, and its paralysis on building infrastructure,\" a cable sent in December 2008 said. A constant theme in all conversations, particularly after the attacks in Mumbai, is Indian protests that the US is too soft on Pakistan. Diplomats make repeated demands that Washington insist that Islamabad – or the Pakistani army – shut down Lashkar e-Toiba, the Pakistan-based militant group responsible for the attack. A former Indian national security advisor told the director of the FBI in a meeting last year that \"if you want to end malaria you have to get rid of the swamp\". Another priority for the Indians is the fear that the US will withdraw from Afghanistan, allowing a \"fanatical\" regime to take over and Pakistan to exert significant influence there. The cables also reveal sharp differences over Burma. US diplomats make it clear they would prefer India to be less friendly towards the ruling junta and work to encourage democracy. Their Indian counterparts are frank about their priorities in Burma. One, in 2004, is reported as saying that the democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's \"day has come and gone\" adding that the UN has little credibility and the EU is too \"obvious, shabby, shortsighted and full of contradictions\" to play a meaningful role in the country\". Another, in 2007, speaks bluntly about India's economic interests in Burma. At the moment, he says, \"we are getting screwed on [natural] gas\". On Iran too, there are major differences. In May 2008, an acrimonious exchange took place between the then foreign secretary, India's top foreign affairs diplomat, Shiv Shankar Menon, and the then US ambassador, David Mulford, shortly after a short stopover by the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in India. Though admitting he did not like Ahmadinejad's \"self-congratulatory, self-referential\" style, Menon cautioned the US against telling India what to do, especially in public. \"This government has to be seen following an independent foreign policy, not responding to dictation from the US,\" Menon said. India must work with Iran to deal with Afghanistan, he continued. (id:152068) The cables also give glimpses of a shadowy battle for influence on public opinion played out across the subcontinent between Delhi, Tehran and Washington. One cable reveals a worried Indian official informing the Americans that the Iranians were to fly a dozen elite opinion-makers, described as \"notorious anti-American critics\" by the embassy, to Tehran on an all-expenses paid trip. The Indian told their US counterparts that \"this trip was part of an effort on the part of the Iranian government to encourage anti-American, pro-Muslim scholars and thinktankers in India to influence Prime Minister Singh's supporters to take a more pro-Iranian, anti-US view\", the cable reported. The Americans told Washington that they had already seen evidence that Iran has been buying off journalists, clerics and editors in Shia-populated areas of [the northern state] of Uttar Pradesh and Kashmir, doling out large sums to stoke anti-Americanism. Now, the officials said, \"it seems Iran is focusing squarely on influential elite audiences in Delhi, with a view to shaping the debate of India's International Atomic Energy Agency policy and the nuclear deal\". Another cable reports that Delhi hopes to use links between Shia Muslim clerics in the Indian city of Lucknow and their counterparts in the Iranian religious centre of Qom to influence the Iranian political leadership. Such manoeuvres are kept well away from any publicity. One key theme in the cables is the degree to which the growing proximity between India and the US still has to be hidden due to a strong popular suspicion of US motives and latent anti-Americanism. One cable describes Indian officials \"loathe to admit publicly that India and the US have begun coordinating foreign policies\". However, top Indian officials still told American visitors that there was a lack of a \"big idea\" to energise Indo-American relations. Last January, the US assistant secretary for South and Central Asia, Richard Boucher, and the Indian national security advisor, Shiv Shankar Menon, discussed a variety of bilateral issues as Obama took power. Menon stressed the importance of focusing on issues with popular appeal. Many good things were happening on health, education, and agriculture, he said, but nothing that \"captures the imagination\" and Indians were beginning to view the relationship with the US as only about political-military and nuclear issues. Boucher challenged Menon to think about formulating \"the next big idea\" to frame the bilateral relationship for the next several years, suggesting that one possibility might include global issues such as the environment and trade. Menon warned that, for the moment, the issue of Pakistan had become defining, adding that he was very keen that the incoming US secretary of state should visit India as soon as possible but \"was unsure who to ask\". The relationship between India and the US appears best characterised by a 3 August 2006 meeting between Maria Shriver, the wife of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor of California, and Sonia Gandhi, the widow of the assassinated prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, leader of the ruling Congress party, head of the coalition government and the most powerful single individual in India. (id:73748) The meeting lasted an hour and, US diplomats reported, went exceptionally well. \"Usually withdrawn and reserved in public, Gandhi spoke at great length and radiated confidence on women's issues and some aspects of her private life,\" one official wrote to Washington. \"This was a more relaxed Sonia, possibly because she felt a personal rapport with Maria Shriver.\" Some of the more controversial points Gandhi made – such as describing reports of the mass sterilisation campaigns under the government of her mother-in-law Indira Gandhi in the 1970s as \"highly exaggerated\" and \"politically motivated,\" – escaped her interlocutors, who were impressed by her \"broad knowledge of Indian culture and traditions\" and lack of defensiveness about the country's social problems. Yet a different reading of the meeting was also possible. When Shriver congratulated Gandhi for her resoluteness over the years and described her as \"courageous\", she was \"clearly embarrassed by this adulation\" and \"made no response\". When Shriver invited Gandhi to the next women's conference – the conferences bring 11,000 women to California each year to discuss relevant issues – and reinforced the point that \"women can change the world,\" Gandhi \"made no commitment to attend\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2010/oct/26/the-fiver-russia-england-paul-octopus","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-26T15:07:03Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | Russian cousin; and psychic octopus | Barry Glendenning and Tom Lutz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/26/the-fiver-russia-england-paul-octopus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2010/oct/26/the-fiver-russia-england-paul-octopus","fields":{"headline":"Russian cousin; and psychic octopus","bodyText":"ALL APOLOGIES Here at Fiver Towers, an edifice on which gaudy minarets are conspicuous by their absence, we've never warmed to our Stolichnaya-drinking, Speedo-wearing, Cossack-dancing, army surplus-selling, Lada-driving, Communist-propagandising, mob-bossing, Gulag-dwelling Russian cousin Valery Aleksandr Rasputin Fiverski.

Indeed, the Russian is to be commended for not derailing England's bid altogether by drawing attention to London's infestations of rats, beggars and Australians, its ridiculously high cost of living and the identity of its buffoonish straw-haired mayor. Today in the dormant volcano that serves as Fifa HQ in Zurich, Sorokin was unrepentant, arguing that he was merely making a comment on how overseas media operated in contrast to Russia rather than launching a KH-55 Granat Strategic land-attack cruise missile at England's bid. \"I don't feel that what I said originally requires an apology,\" he growled from behind a commemorative copy of Pravda celebrating 50 accident-free years of nuclear power in Russia and the former Soviet Union. Should England's World Cup 2018 bid officials wish to undermine Sorokin's argument and make him look a fool in front of Fifa, they could do worse than pay a visit to Kenilworth Road. Such is the apparent contempt the resident goalkeeping coach and former Russia international Dmitri Kharine has for his home town of Moscow, he would rather live in the desolate urban concrete-scape that is Luton Town instead.

PAUL THE OCTOPUS 2008-2010 At some point in the early hours of this morning, Paul the 'psychic' octopus floated wearily over to two boxes containing mussels. He briefly scanned the first box, which depicted a grinning octopus celebrating its seventh birthday. He turned away slowly and opened the lid on the second box – coffin-shaped and depicting a gravestone – and ate the arsenic-laced mussel inside. He died shortly afterwards, a shadow of the octopus who had blazed on to the world stage earlier this summer. Born Paul the 'normal' octopus in a garden in the shade near a cave, he was the son of a lady octopus and a man octopus. He shot to fame at the 2010 World Cup by predicting some team or other would beat another team. Paul quickly proved popular, particularly with websites desperate for cheap hits on slow news days and Sky Sports News, which didn't have the rights to show any actual matches. Paul's apotheosis came when he predicted Spain would beat Holland in the World Cup final although, in fairness, even Alan Shearer the rubbish 'pundit' was on to that one. But fame was a heavy burden. Despite commercial enterprises ranging from special clothing lines to a mobile phone application, he only got some new rocks and a miniature castle for his tank. Although he had an outstanding knowledge of football – Jonathan Wilson was a close friend – he wasn't taken seriously as a pundit. \"The care provided for him by our dedicated displays team could not have been bettered,\" said Stefan Porwoll, the manager of the Oberhausen Sea Life Centre in Germany that Paul called home. Paul is survived by 983 children. An additional 211 predeceased him when they were eaten by a hungry turtle. • Paul the 'psychic' octopus, clairvoyant cephalopod, born 2008; died 26 October 2010.

Ministers insist they still expect only one high-level geological disposal facility (GDF) will be needed at a possible cost of £12bn but a discussion paper produced by the department of energy and climate change (DECC) indicates a second cannot be ruled out. The moves come as the British Geological Survey (BGS) and the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) argue that more research is needed on whether different kinds of waste can be stored together. The DECC pre-consultation discussion paper on the costs of waste disposal says \"cost-modelling needs to take account of the possibility that, with a large new nuclear programme, co-disposal proves not to be feasible and another GDF would naturally mean a significantly greater total cost, although such cost would be spread over a larger nuclear programme.\" The document goes on to state that the extra waste dump needs to be looked at \"for cost-modelling purposes only\" and should not be considered as a change in government strategy. Companies such as EDF which are interested in building new atomic facilities have presumed they will be able to store their spent materials in a site largely paid for by the government. Being forced to build a second site - especially one dedicated to the new stations - could change the delicate economics of the industry. EDF was unavailable for comment. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), the government agency charged with overseeing clean-up, backed up the DECC argument with a spokesman saying the organisation was largely concentrating on the technical needs and capabilities of one high-level repository to complement the low-level waste site at Drigg in Cumbria. But a recent meeting of the BGS and CoRWM in Nottingham highlighted their worries about the government being over-reliant on \"inherited\" research and development in an NDA strategy that presumes all kinds of waste can be put together in one waste dump. Minutes of that BGS meeting say: \"Despite assurances from the NDA that a variety of concepts are under consideration, the NDA research and development strategy appears to be centred on a single GDF that can be engineered to accommodate a multiplicity of wastes.\" But the minutes go on to say: \"A major uncertainty is whether it will actually be technically possible to co-dispose, intermediate-level waste, high-level waste, [and] spent nuclear fuel in a single repository.\" CoRWM and the BGS also go on to question the NDA's apparent assumption that work done in Sweden on such facilities can be transferred to British waste and geology. Jean McSorley, senior adviser on the nuclear campaign at Greenpeace, said the uncertainty surrounding how waste should be dealt with meant plans for new stations should be put on hold. \"You can't proceed with any form of nuclear power without this issue being settled and that is years away,\" she said. \"It is quite clear this consultation on fixed costs will expose the different views there are on this issue at a time when everyone is supposed to be coming together.\" Professor Gordon MacKerron, an energy expert at Sussex University and a former chairman of the CoRWM, said building two repositories could have major political advantages because the government could face opposition from local communities to hosting an unlimited amount of waste from new power stations rather than a finite amount of legacy waste from existing sites. \"There are different political, social and ethical issues surrounding these two types of waste and it is important to consider them separately,\" he said. The cost of two dumps need not be prohibitive, he claimed, although he admitted there may need to be a fairly large building programme to make the economics work."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/feb/26/babcock-vt-group-takeover-panel","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-26T19:09:49Z","webTitle":"Babcock faces action by Takeover Panel in battle for VT","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/26/babcock-vt-group-takeover-panel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/feb/26/babcock-vt-group-takeover-panel","fields":{"headline":"Babcock faces action by Takeover Panel in VT Group bid battle","bodyText":"The Takeover Panel is to intervene in the battle for control of VT Group, the defence services provider, by issuing its predator, Babcock International, with a put-up-or-shut-up order, forcing it to make a firm bid within a month. A ruling from the panel is expected next week, with the authorities keen for the bidding war to be brought to a swift conclusion after weeks of uncertainty. Babcock has made two indicative offers in the past fortnight; its latest bid values VT at about £1.25bn, or 700p a share. The company, which runs submarine bases for the Royal Navy at Faslane and Plymouth, also made two informal approaches to VT last year, both of which were rebuffed. The situation is complicated by the fact that VT has for several months been trying to buy Mouchel, a smaller rival. Its efforts have been thrown into disarray by Babcock's approach. Headed by Paul Lester, VT amassed a cash pile in 2009 after selling its shipbuilding interests to BAE Systems. Lester has called Babcock's indicative offer \"strategically unsound\" and has hinted that VT could abandon its bid for Mouchel and return funds to shareholders as part of its defence against the unwanted approach. A merger of VT and Babcock would create a support services group with interests in defence, engineering and nuclear power. But VT has spent the past five years withdrawing from building ships for the Ministry of Defence, moving instead into support services. For instance, it provides engineering back-up for the coastguard's search and rescue helicopters. VT argues that a return to focusing on defence would make the combined group too vulnerable to cutbacks in military spending after the general election. An observer said: \"This is an argument about scale, which would be achieved if VT merged with Babcock, versus diversification via a deal with Mouchel.\" According to Babcock, a takeover of VT would see the two companies cutting about £27m off combined annual costs. Babcock, whose chairman is Mike Turner, the former BAE chief executive, insists that it will make an offer only on condition that it is allowed to conduct due diligence at VT. It has approached the target's shareholders to try to persuade them to force Lester to begin negotiations and open the company's books. About 40% of investors in VT have stakes in Babcock and vice versa. But shareholders are split over whether Lester should talk to Turner. Insiders at Babcock, which employs about 17,000 staff, point out that VT itself tried to buy Babcock four years ago, showing that the two companies are an obvious fit. But VT contends that Babcock is strategically challenged because it could find itself heavily exposed to defence cuts. However, Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at the City broker BGC Partners, said: \"This [battle] involves the two largest and most successful UK-based engineering support businesses. The logic for a merger is very hard to argue against.\" Besides refitting ships and submarines, Babcock trains military engineers and has sizable civil interests: stringing high-voltage electricity lines, repairing railways and decommissioning nuclear plants. VT also has substantial defence service contracts. Both companies developed into service groups from manufacturing origins. Babcock has indicated that it is prepared to offer between 685p and 715p a share for VT. But analysts said today that they believe the price should be at least 750p a share, or as high as 775p. VT closed tonight up 6p at 667½p."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/mar/22/samantha-cameron-pregnant-mumsnet","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-22T20:06:32Z","webTitle":"Samantha Cameron's labour bombshell: pregnant – but not in a political way","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/mar/22/samantha-cameron-pregnant-mumsnet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/mar/22/samantha-cameron-pregnant-mumsnet","fields":{"headline":"Samantha Cameron's labour bombshell: pregnant – but not in a political way","bodyText":"Bless. Sam Cam is pregnant, and isn't it lovely news? I remember when everyone found out about Cherie Blair's pregnancy, with the miracle fourth born Leo. Well, that's handy, I said, having heard somebody else say it. That's a nice spike in popularity, after the post-97 honeymoon had worn off, I repeated, having heard it most probably on the Today programme. It was the nearing the close of 1999, Y2K loomed, fin-de-siecle anxiety dominated and everybody was worried about the future and whether or not their hard-drive would survive. People (well, my mother) were stockpiling water. What better way to penetrate humanity's fundamental optimism in those rocky times, than with a bonny baby, the first to be born into No 10 Downing Street in 150 years? It was like New Labour's Falklands, all the feelgood factor with none of the death. Well, now, of course, with the benefit of childbirth hindsight, I realise how deeply improbable it is for a woman of any stamp, let alone a woman of independent mind, to surrender her uterus for a political boost. Not the most doting wife in the world, the most forgiving, not even Pauline Prescott would sprog for the Mumsnet vote. You would be more likely to get a tattoo, for the small (but easily influenced) body-art vote than you would do something so, ahem, labour intensive for the sake of your husband's career. Having said all that, it would be foolish to deny that this is good for Cameron. This is the Mumsnet election: a mistake often made about Mumsnet is that there is any internal harmony in its discursive space. They fight like ferrets, the mumchatters, about almost anything: however, there is one thing, on which they manage agreement, and that is a nice, excited feeling upon the news of a pregnancy. Mumsnet, incidentally, along with individual mumsnetters, all deny furiously that this will sway them one way or the other. They are keen to remind the participants of this election that, while they might be the swing vote, they can't just be bought off with soft-focus bump-fetishism. They are political creatures. They want to talk about nuclear power and the pensions crisis. But you can't help it, can you? It's not just the fact of a baby at the end of it (though babies are nice); there's an element of schadenfreude (ha! See how much your fancy Downing Street domestic arrangements help you when you're up all night and your wife rings you up twice an hour just to shout at you) that humanises everybody concerned. Plus you are forced to consider the fact that they must, you know, have sex, and that punctures at least some of the electioneering windbaggery (returning to the memory of the Blairs, Germaine Greer wrote a hilarious piece at the time, exorting Tony to just \"get off her\" – I think she was pretty well alone in openly instructing the Blairs to stop their marital activities altogether, but it's an instructive reminder of the sense of ownership or involvement this news bestows, which in politics is not necessarily a bad thing). There is obviously the impact on Sam Cam, specifically, to consider – she's not just generic woman, she is also a person, and quite an idiosyncratic one. At the weekend, a \"racy\" photoshoot of her, modelling weird clothes, on a variety of very 90s sofas, emerged, to David's \"embarrassment.\" With no slur intended to her character, her face in repose is haughty and distancing. She can, in the wrong light, look a bit too perfect, too self-possessed, too controlled, too groomed; all useful qualities when complaining to your mobile phone provider, less so when you're trying to make a nation fall in love with you. Ha! If there's one thing that is definitely, positively, to be said about being pregnant, it will put paid to the charge of being too groomed, in a heartbeat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/oct/12/dong-energy-coal-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-12T16:24:29Z","webTitle":"Clean coal dealt second blow as Danish energy giant pulls out of Scottish plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/12/dong-energy-coal-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/oct/12/dong-energy-coal-plant","fields":{"headline":"Clean coal dealt second blow as Danish energy giant pulls out of Scottish plans","bodyText":"Plans for a new generation of \"clean coal\" power stations were dealt another severe blow after the Danish energy giant Dong Energy announced it was pulling out of plans for a major new coal-fired plant in Ayrshire. Dong said it was withdrawing from the 1.6GW Hunterston power station scheme, which would eventually use carbon capture technology, and a further coal-fired plant in Germany, to focus its efforts on green energy and cutting its CO2 emissions. The decision raises further doubts about the future of UK and Scottish government plans to invest heavily in \"clean coal\" plants after the energy firm E.ON said last week it was shelving proposals for a new coal-burning station at Kingsnorth in Kent. It cited the drop in demand for power due to the recession. The news caps a dizzying few days for environmentalists, with an announcement at the weekend from airports operator BAA that put plans for a third runway at Heathrow airport in severe doubt. BAA said that it would not submit a planning application for the development ahead of the general election. If the Conservatives win the next general election that will effectively kill the project because the party has said they will include a manifesto commitment not to expand Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted. Dong, which brands itself as a climate-friendly power company, said that the economics of coal were too difficult for it to invest in new plants. Its withdrawal raises significant problems for the junior partner in the 50:50 joint venture at Hunterston, the Manchester-based property company and airport operator Peel Holdings. It has invested in windfarms and has a 24% stake in the mining company UK Coal but it has never built a coal-fired power station. Environment campaigners and the Scottish Green party urged Peel to completely drop the proposal. Liz Murray, Scottish campaigner for the World Development Movement, said: \"It's clearer than ever that dirty coal is a risky investment. Energy companies are finding it impossible to justify such climate-trashing developments.\" Richard Dixon, director of WWF Scotland, said: \"The Hunterston coal proposal was the wrong sort of scheme in the wrong place. It would have locked us into major climate change emissions for three or four decades, long past the time when we need to have kicked our addiction to burning coal.\" E.ON's decision last week suggests the energy industry is unwilling to risk fresh investments in coal but Peel insisted it would continue with the application. Dong would continue giving it technical advice, said Owen Michaelson, chairman of Peel Energy. \"We can all appreciate the business drivers behind this decision,\" he said. \"We are sorry to lose Dong Energy as an investor on this project but are pleased the relationship will continue through their design services.\" \"Ayrshire Power's [the company formed by Dong and Peel Energy to build Hunterston] overall strategy for the project is unaffected by this decision. We have just completed the latest stage of our public consultations with the local community and other key stakeholders and we now look forward to continuing to progress through the planning process.\" The UK energy secretary, Ed Miliband, has insisted no new coal-fired plants can be built in England without the capacity to use carbon capture and storage technology which will bury waste CO2. Environmentalists say this is unacceptable, as the technique is unlikely to be available until 2020. The Scottish first minister Alex Salmond has publicly backed the Hunterston proposal, since it too would have the capacity to use CCS technology and would allow Scotland to entirely phase out nuclear power. The Dong plant would sit beside Hunterston nuclear power station, which is due to shut down its last reactor in 2016. The Scottish government has given Hunterston significant support by adding to its national planning framework, which allows it to sidestep local planning rules."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/sep/28/angela-merkel-germany-government-coalition","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-27T23:43:32Z","webTitle":"Merkel to head centre-right coalition in Germany as Social Democrats sink","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/28/angela-merkel-germany-government-coalition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/sep/28/angela-merkel-germany-government-coalition","fields":{"headline":"Merkel to head centre-right coalition in Germany as Social Democrats sink","bodyText":"The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was tonight swept back into power as the head of a centre-right government with the pro-business Free Democrats that aims to cut taxes and stop the phase-out of nuclear power. Initial election results revealed that her Christian Democrats (CDU) and their sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), had secured 33.8% of the vote, with the Free Democrats (FDP) taking 14.5%, giving the parties 323 seats in the Bundestag. The result brings an end to an unwieldy four-year \"grand coalition\" between the CDU and the Social Democrats (SPD). The new government is expected to define itself by cutting taxes and extending the life of Germany's 17 nuclear plants until more renewable energy is available. It has positioned itself as the coalition with the best policies to steer Germany out of economic crisis. The SPD suffered its worst result for 60 years. It secured only 23.1% – a drop of more than 11% since the last election. A lacklustre campaign, driven by personalities rather than policies, attracted Germany's lowest postwar turnout, with only 72.5% of the 62 million eligible voters taking part, compared with 78% in 2005. The night's winner was seen to be the FDP, which secured its best result, \"stealing\" around 1.74 million voters from other mainstream parties and increasing its vote share by five percentage points from 2005. Its leader, Guido Westerwelle, who advocates lowering taxes and relaxing employment rules and is also the first openly gay leader of a German mainstream party, is almost certain to become the next foreign minister when the FDP enters government. It will be the first CDU/FDP coalition since 1998, when the 16-year-old government of Helmut Kohl came to an end. Other fringe parties enjoyed a record surge in support as voters abandoned their traditional allegiances. The Greens secured 10.5%, an increase of 2.4 percentage points, and the Linke (Left) party took 12.1%, an increase of 3.4 points. Figures showed that 26% of Germany's unemployed voted for the extreme-left Linke, underlining the extent to which the two-year-old conglomeration of former communists and disillusioned Social Democrats has won voters from the SPD. Addressing a glum group of SPD supporters in Berlin, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the outgoing foreign minister and SPD candidate for chancellor, said it was a \"bitter day for German social democracy\". He said the SPD would now form a \"strong opposition\", in particular fighting to keep the nuclear power plant phase-out. In the CDU's headquarters, supporters were jubilant. \"This is an evening in which Angela Merkel has achieved her goal to form the government she wants,\" said Roland Koch, the leader of Hesse state, referring to 2005 when the CDU's share of the vote dropped by more than 6 percentage points and it was forced into an unwanted partnership with the SPD. \"This is a clear vote of confidence for the politics for which she stands.\" With her steady leadership, Merkel now enjoys the highest popular support of almost any leader since the second world war, with three-quarters of Germans saying she is doing a good job. She was greeted with cheers as she addressed supporters at the CDU headquarters in Berlin. \"You're happy today – so am I,\" she said. \"We've managed to secure a stable coalition and that's good.\" She said she wanted to be a \"chancellor for all Germans, so Germany does better, particularly in a crisis\". Although she \"didn't want to encourage sobriety\" on election night, \"the work starts now\" , she said, and her priority was to secure jobs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2010/jan/13/snow-nuclear-birds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-13T13:40:23Z","webTitle":"Everybody's talking about: the snow, nuclear fears and birds in the big freeze","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/jan/13/snow-nuclear-birds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2010/jan/13/snow-nuclear-birds","fields":{"headline":"Everybody's talking about: the snow, nuclear fears and birds in the big freeze","bodyText":"Over the last week the weather has featured in many conversations, not least on environmentguardian.co.uk.

Brown said he had struck an agreement on further nuclear co-operation with France in talks last week with Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, but stressed that both countries would retain their own independent deterrents. \"We have agreed a degree of co-operation that is, I think, greater than we have had previously but we will retain, as will France, our independent nuclear deterrent,\" he said. \"We wish, of course, to see multilateral disarmament around the world and we are ready to contribute towards that, but in a world that is so insecure, particularly with other countries trying to acquire nuclear weapons, we do not see the case for us withdrawing the independent nuclear deterrent that we have.\" Brown also called for fresh international measures against countries such as Iran which were, he said, trying to acquire nuclear weapons. \"Countries like Iran who try secretly to develop nuclear weapons must face concerted and decisive action by the international community, including more far-reaching international sanctions,\" he said. Describing himself as a \"committed internationalist\" and a \"passionate European\", Brown warned against \"drift\" in the international community in tackling global issues. \"The truth we have learned in the last two years is that global problems cannot be answered by national or even regional solutions alone; global problems need global solutions; because we need more, not less, global co-operation.\" In a sideswipe to the Conservative grouping in Europe, he added: \"We must turn outward not inward. So I disagree with those who misguidedly seek an isolationist and anti-European option.\" On climate change, Brown said there was a need for \"fast start\" finance for developing countries to deliver the commitments in the accord signed in Copenhagen by more than 100 countries last December. Brown said he would personally co-chair the first meeting of the climate finance group with Meles Zenawi, the prime minister of Ethiopia, on 31 March. In a nod to next week's budget, Brown said his chancellor, Alistair Darling, would announce new plans to promote investment in clean energy and boost green jobs, as part of the drive to create a low-carbon economy. Brown also outlined the next steps needed to stabilise the global economy and complete the task of rebuilding it. Speaking ahead of the forthcoming summits for the G20 and G8 meetings in Canada and Korea, Brown said: \"We must now show a fresh collective commitment to fully implement the G20 framework for strong, balanced and sustainable growth, to co-ordinate more effectively the regulation of our financial systems and to build a co-ordinated approach to levies on the banks to deliver a fairer balance between risk and reward.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2010/apr/28/conservatives-science-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-28T15:17:16Z","webTitle":"Conservative science policy ticks (nearly) all the right boxes | Martin Robbins | General election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/apr/28/conservatives-science-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2010/apr/28/conservatives-science-policy","fields":{"headline":"Conservative science policy ticks (nearly) all the right boxes","bodyText":"According to their manifesto, the Tories want me to join them in running the country. I'm a bit busy right now and not the most organised of people, but I'm happy to say a few words about their science manifesto commitments and their responses to our 10 key questions. Not the typical party of choice for generally left-leaning academics, the Conservatives have nonetheless clawed back some ground in recent years with their strong support in areas such as libel reform. Adam Afriyie, their shadow science and innovation minister, will most likely keep control of my constituency, but among science activists he remains something of a mystery, less vocal on scientific issues than his opposite numbers Lord Drayson and Evan Harris who – whether or not you agree with their views – are clearly passionate advocates at the grassroots level. At 131 pages long it's difficult to condense their policies into a couple of paragraphs, but the Campaign for Science and Engineering has done a decent job picking out areas relevant to science. Among the more notable features are an intention to review the controversial concept of \"impact\" in research, and a welcome declaration that grant proposal decisions should not be based on research projects' potential economic impact. Nonetheless, there is a very business-oriented theme to the Conservatives' science policy, with a strong focus on producing more science, technology and engineering graduates, including a £350m commitment to fund 25,000 new masters degrees in these subjects. One interesting manifesto pledge that seems to have originated with Afriyie (who answered our questions) is to set up \"science literacy inductions\" for all new Conservative MPs after the election. Of course, it would be nice if these were compulsory, and available for all MPs regardless of their party allegiance. I analyse some of their answers below, but you can read the Conservatives' full responses to our questions here. Brian Cox: Science funding Do you plan to maintain Britain's science budget below the European average? Frankly, it's difficult to drive much of a wedge between the three main parties in this area, with the answer in each case being that with the economy still in crisis and heavy cuts in public spending likely, few guarantees can be made. The Conservative strategy is to improve financial stability by allocating multi-year budgets that improve the Research Councils' ability to plan ahead, and to encourage investment in high-tech spin-offs. Of course, the words \"stability\" and \"investment\" do not mean that a Conservative government would \"increase\" spending on science. Alternative medicine If the balance of evidence suggests that a treatment does not perform any better than placebo, should it be supported by the NHS? Afriyie's comment that it would be, \"wholly irresponsible to spend public money on treatments that have no evidence to support their claims\" is welcome, and positions the Conservatives alongside the Liberal Democrats in rejecting claims that alternative medicine has a future in public healthcare. With Prince Charles' ailing Foundation for Integrated Health at the centre of a fraud investigation, and would-be alternative medicine regulator the CNHC struggling to bring practitioners on board, the future looks grim for quacks. Simon Singh: Libel What will your party do to reduce the chilling effect of our libel laws on science? Currently there is no statutory public interest defence, so scientists risk running the gauntlet of London's High Court if they publish material they believe to be in the public interest, but that a major corporation or litigious charlatan believes to be libellous. The Conservatives have joined the cross-party consensus on libel reform, and Tories such as Joanna Cash have been active at the grassroots level pushing for changes in British law. However, it is a cause for concern that they have failed to set out specifics in their manifesto, or their answers to us. Afriyie states that they \"look forward to continuing that discussion in the next parliament\". The Libel Reform campaign's victory in achieving a cross-party consensus that reform is necessary will be followed by an inevitable fight in the next parliament over the details of that reform. Climate change/Energy Should nuclear power be part of our country's strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions? How soon can we bring new plants online? While many in the scientific community are rightly concerned about climate denial on the fringes of the Conservative party, Cameron-era Conservatives have actually been quite robust on the issue, with a strong green showing among their MEPs. Like the other main parties, the Conservatives are committed to deep reductions in CO2 emissions, with a reasonable aim to generate 15% of energy from renewables as soon as 2020, and a pledge to cut emissions by 80% over the next 40 years. Nuclear power features strongly in their energy plans, which will be controversial for some, but anticipating questions over costs they pledge that no public subsidies will be involved. It's interesting to note how Cameron pitches initiatives on climate, with a strong focus on the potential economic benefits of making Britain a world-leading energy-secure, low-carbon economy, rather than playing up the environmental benefits. It's tempting to think that this might be indicative of the way environmental policies have been sold within the party. Of particular interest is the Green Deal, a very sensible-looking policy that will allow people to spend up to £6,500 on energy improvement measures in their homes, with the costs repaid from their future fuel bills. David Nutt: Drug policy To what extent should drug policy be based on scientific evidence? What evidence, if any, would you require to declassify a drug? The Conservatives believe that drugs policy should have \"a basis in evidence. We have no desire or intention of ignoring scientific advice.\" But, \"there may be times when ministers decide to take account of other considerations.\" As the Transform Drugs Policy Foundation points out, this is fairly indistinguishable from the last government's stance, and will be a disappointment for those who feel that \"other considerations\" is political code for \"pressure from the Daily Mail\". It's hard not to feel depressed that after decades of failed policies on drugs, the two biggest parties in British politics still seem more interested in knee-jerk populist gestures than in creating a policy based on the best available evidence to tackle the problems. Drugs policy is a failure of politics and a failure of the media, with elements of the right-wing press determined to shut down sensible debate or discussion. Whoever wins, drugs policy will continue to be a key science battleground after the election. Petra Boynton: Public health How will your party ensure public health/education campaigns are underpinned by evidence, and how will you evaluate their success? PR companies are increasingly influential in directing both the content and delivery of public campaigns, frequently at the expense of expertise from scientists, healthcare providers and academics. \"I think we can learn a lot from countries like Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands where they seem to have a better record of monitoring the impact of public health policies. We need to embrace this good practice, and go further. We will mandate the publication of results from all national and local public health strategies online, along with tools which allow people to compare and benchmark performance.\" It's a remarkable commitment, which makes it all the more bewildering that the same commitment to open evidence-based policy doesn't seem to apply to drugs. Genetic engineering/Stem cell research Should Britain be at the forefront of research in these areas? What benefits do you believe such research will bring for society? \"We must stay at the forefront of research so that we have the chance to create the jobs, treatments and consumer products that support our quality of life\" An answer that on the surface is pro-science and in line with, say, the Liberal Democrats, is given a slight twist by a phrase that crops up not just in Afriyie's answer, but elsewhere in Tory policy statements. They repeatedly talk about scientific research moving forward \"within the boundaries set by parliament\". It's a qualifying statement that makes the rest of their pledge fairly difficult to interpret, because, well, what does it actually mean? And how much influence will movements within the party like the deeply religious Cornerstone Group exert? Pandemic readiness Do you believe the swine flu pandemic posed a significant risk to Britain? What action would your government take if a similar situation emerged in the future? \"One of the big problems with swine flu was the confusion among the public about what official advice was. Our plans to give much more responsibility to local directors of public health should make a big difference on this.\" Afriyie asserts that the public were confused about what the official advice was, but then suggests devolving the problem to local directors of public health, which seems like a bit of a contradiction to me. Instead of one official line during a pandemic there will be several. Conclusions Clearly a party undergoing significant change, the Conservatives talk the talk on a number of issues, but remain something of an unknown quantity due to a certain vagueness about some of their pledges, and the failure of their shadow science and innovation minister to engage with grassroots science activists to the same extent as his Lib Dem and Labour counterparts. Nonetheless, they come out well from this exercise, apparently recognising the importance of science and its continued independence. Their dismissal of alternative medicine is welcome, and they have several innovative policies such as the Green Deal, and a pledge to publish data on the performance of public health initiatives. However, their commitment to evidence doesn't seem to be universal, with drug policy a particular area of concern. Best candidate With so many new and relatively unknown candidates poised to join the next parliament it's a difficult choice, but Totnes candidate Sarah Wollaston stands out for her observation: \"I just don't think that there are enough people in Westminster who can read a scientific paper.\" Hear, hear. Worst candidate Just how does alternative medicine work? Bosworth candidate David Tredinnick claimed £750 worth of astrology software on expenses on the basis that astrology might have some bearing on the issue. A passionate advocate of homeopathy, Tredinnick's views provoked the formation of the Science Party in his constituency, founded by exasperated science writer Dr Michael Brooks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2010/feb/22/regeneration-localgovernment","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-22T22:17:29Z","webTitle":"David Cameron launches Tory plan to curb out-of-town developments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/feb/22/regeneration-localgovernment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2010/feb/22/regeneration-localgovernment","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron launches Tory plan to curb out-of-town developments","bodyText":"Local councils would be handed back powers to give them a greater say in stopping the development of out-of-town supermarkets under Tory proposals described by David Cameron as one of the biggest shifts in power in decades. A version of the so called \"needs test\", scrapped by Labour, would be restored by the Tories to allow councils to focus regeneration on neglected high streets. The plan to curb out-of-town developments was one of the main measures in a Tory green paper on planning – Open Source Planning – launched yesterday by Cameron. The Tory leader outlined his proposals in a speech on the \"post-bureaucratic age\" – a phrase borrowed by the Tories from the Clinton White House to describe the era in which voters, rather than central or local government, hold the initiative in developing public policy. A key step in that direction would be taken, the Tories say, by restoring a version of the rules on out-of-town developments introduced in 1996 by the then environment secretary John Gummer. These included the \"needs test\" which required developers to prove the need for additional out of town development. The Tory green paper says: \"We will undo Labour's changes to planning rules which have weakened councils' ability to stop unwanted out-of-town development. We will ensure that a needs test is readopted, and will enable local councils to take competition issues into account when formulating their local plans.\" Cameron's inner circle regard yesterday's green paper as a highly significant element in devolving powers to local communities. In a key proposal, modelled on a scheme in Concord, Massachusetts, a new system of local plans would see every household invited to neighbourhood meetings to discuss the development of their area. The local plan, in which a village could decree that houses would have to be built with thatched roofs, would be posted on the internet and developers would have to consult it before they submit their plans. Cameron said: \"Our local plans represent one of the biggest shifts in power for decades. It's genuinely one of the most radical and transformative policies that a Conservative government – or any government – can introduce. Suddenly, you can see how a system that was controlled by a few can be run by the many. You can see how it's possible to get neighbourhoods to come together to solve problems together. So this won't just help to improve our broken planning system – it'll help to build stronger communities and help to mend our broken society.\" Labour is likely to claim that the Tory plan would increase \"nimbyism\" by giving local communities a greater say in blocking controversial developments such as wind farms. The Tories say their plans would reduce nimbyism by giving local communities a sense of ownership of developments and financial incentives. Developers would have to split fees they have to pay between local communities and local authorities. The neighbourhoods would consult with local authorities to ensure that important local developments, such as building a hospital, can go ahead. Major national development, such as high speed rail lines and nuclear power stations, would still be considered by the new fasttrack planning system introduced by Gordon Brown. But the Tories would ensure that the relevant secretary of state would have to give final approval, to ensure politicians take responsibility and are accountable for such projects."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/jun/11/us-nuclear-industry-plans-new-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-06-11T17:46:10Z","webTitle":"US nuclear industry tries to hijack Obama's climate change bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jun/11/us-nuclear-industry-plans-new-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/jun/11/us-nuclear-industry-plans-new-reactors","fields":{"headline":"US nuclear industry tries to hijack Obama's climate change bill","bodyText":"America's nuclear industry and its supporters in Congress have moved to hijack Barack Obama's agenda for greening the economy by producing a rival plan to build 100 new reactors in 20 years, and staking a claim for the money to come from a proposed clean energy development bank. Republicans in the House of Representatives produced a spoiler version of the Democrats' climate change bill this week, calling for a doubling of the number of nuclear reactors in the US by 2030. The 152-page Republican bill contains just one reference to climate change, and proposes easing controls for new nuclear plants. In the Senate, Republican leaders, including the former presidential candidate John McCain, also called this week for loan guarantees for building new reactors to rise from $18.5bn (£11.2bn) to $38bn. Other Republicans have called on the administration to underwrite the $122bn start-up costs of 19 nuclear reactors, whose applications are now under review by the department of energy. \"If you care about climate change ... 100 new nuclear power plants is the place to start,\" said Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee who is the strongest proponent of nuclear power in the Senate. Another crucial element of the Republicans' \"nuclear renaissance\" are two rival proposals for a \"clean energy bank\" now before Congress. One version, under consideration by the Senate, envisages almost unlimited federal loan guarantees to encourage wind and solar power and, nuclear proponents hope, new reactors. Ellen Vancko, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: \"The nuclear industry would like to be able to finance the next generation of nuclear reactors using the faith and credit of the US taxpayer to underwrite the expansion. They don't want to be responsible for any risk of financing these plants and neither do their lenders.\" No new reactors have been ordered in 30 years, not least due to the challenges of raising $5bn-$12bn to build a new plant. But the industry is hoping for a surge in orders for new reactors around the world and assurances from Obama's energy secretary, Steven Chu, of nuclear power's place in America's long-term energy mix. Nuclear industry executives told Congress this week that 429 new nuclear plants were planned or under construction around the world. In the US, the energy department is reviewing 19 applications for new nuclear reactors. Construction, if they are approved, could begin in 2011. Much of the push for nuclear power comes from the conservative south, which has more reactors than anywhere else in the US and which is less suited than other regions for wind or solar development. The campaign faces two challenges: the huge cost of construction and the lack of permanent storage for nuclear waste. The Obama administration has blocked a 22-year project to dump waste from reactors in Nevada's Yucca Mountain. But the biggest obstacle to Republican dreams of a nuclear renaissance is start-up costs. Last month, John Rowe, chairman of Exelon, which operates 17 nuclear reactors, said he would cancel or delay construction of two new reactors in Texas without federal loan guarantees. He said the government assurances were \"imperative\" because of the high capital costs of nuclear reactors. Obama's $787bn economic recovery plan set aside $50bn for the nuclear industry but Democrats in Congress cut out the funds. Frustrated fans of nuclear power, such as McCain, accused Obama and Chu of ignoring its potential. \"They remember Chernobyl and Three Mile Island and all those scenes in the movies that are apocalyptic about nuclear power,\" he said. If Republican efforts in Congress for a nuclear energy bill and a clean energy bank fail, the US nuclear renaissance is likely to be restricted to new reactors already being built. Jim Riccio, Greenpeace nuclear analyst, said: \"The renaissance is on hold or maybe dead on arrival.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2010/feb/13/photographs-coal-miners-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-13T00:05:12Z","webTitle":"Ukraine miners: Coalfaces","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/feb/13/photographs-coal-miners-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2010/feb/13/photographs-coal-miners-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine miners: Coalfaces","bodyText":"On the night of 30-31 August 1935, the Soviet miner Alexey Stakhanov set a new record for coal production. Working deep inside the bowels of a mine in eastern Ukraine, Stakhanov managed to hew out 102 tonnes of coal in five hours and 32 minutes. This was 14 times more than the standard daily norm. Although it later emerged he had help, Stakhanov's super-human feat became a synonym for heroism and communist endeavour. In a matter of months the \"Stakhanov\" movement had spread across the Soviet Union, with workers and farmers urged to set their own norm-defying records for personal productivity. Seventy-five years later, miners still work at the mine where Stakhanov set his record. In a series of 100 remarkable portraits, the Russian photographer Gleb Kosorukov has captured the Ukrainian miners on their return to the surface from a six-hour shift underground, amid dust, dirt and artificial light. Most of the miners agreed to be photographed for the project. A handful refused. They were indifferent to Stakhanov's record, Kosorukov says. They regarded themselves as underpaid. They were also deeply cynical about their country's eternally feuding political leaders. \"Oil and gas have been so much in the news in recent decades. Coal has almost disappeared from the territory of Europe. People imagine that it doesn't exist any more,\" Kosorukov says. \"In fact, coal is responsible for a major part of the world's energy. I wanted to make coal visible.\" In practice, coalmining has hardly changed over the past 100 or 200 years – miners then, as now, face an omnipresent fear of death. \"It's an archetype of the working class. It encapsulates all the things we think about working class. Miners face extremes in their profession. Mortality is high,\" Kosorukov says. \"There is a little bit of heroism in their life. In some ways they are modern saints. They know that some day they may never come back from the mine.\" The photos were taken in September 2009 at the Stakhanov mine, 40km from the eastern industrial town of Donetsk. The mine was named after its most famous ex-employee following his death in 1977. It is part of a complex of four mines owned by the state. Production has fallen since Soviet times, from 1m tonnes a year under communism to 375,000 today. There are fewer miners, too: 2,381 compared with 10,000-12,000 in the mine's heyday. Little has changed, however. The miners continue to use the old Soviet equipment. And yet despite this production decline, Kosorukov argues that coal will continue to play a crucial role in the world's energy needs. He also sees it, moreover, as the answer to Ukraine's energy problems at a time when Russia regularly uses gas as a weapon against its smaller neighbour. \"Coal is responsible for more than 40% of the energy produced by humans, more than twice exceeding respective figures for oil and gas. Because of the restrictive security limitations put on development of nuclear power plants, the situation will hardly change in the near future.\" glebkosorukov.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2009/oct/12/climate-change-green-britain-vision","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-11T23:06:23Z","webTitle":"Climate change: Vision of green Britain calls for swift carbon emissions policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/12/climate-change-green-britain-vision","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/oct/12/climate-change-green-britain-vision","fields":{"headline":"Climate change: Vision of green Britain calls for swift carbon emissions policy","bodyText":"A green and pleasant land, with millions of electric cars powered from wind turbines and travelling between super-cosy homes and offices: that is the vision for Britain in 2020 set out today by the government's climate watchdog. That cleaner, greener country, playing its full part in averting disastrous global warming, is both possible and affordable, says the Climate Change Committee – but only if the government acts immediately to implement radical policies on energy efficiency and low carbon technologies, as well as dealing with the threat of the recession to carbon trading schemes. The recommendations from the CCC, which sets legally binding carbon budgets and advises the government on how to reach them, could see teams of renovators working street by street to insulate homes and eco-driving techniques a standard part of the driving test. Chief executive David Kennedy said that despite the recession, the changes remained affordable at 1% of GDP, and would improve our quality of life. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) published an ambitious plan to move to a low-carbon economy in July. But the CCC report, Meeting Carbon Budgets – The Need for a Step Change, is first time the committee has published its analysis of what is needed for this to be achieved. Kennedy directed his heaviest criticism at the government's leading policy, to reduce carbon emissions from homes by 35% by 2020. The carbon emissions reductions target (Cert) came into effect last year and places an obligation on energy suppliers to help homeowners reduce household emissions until 2012. \"Cert has been very good at insulating old ladies' lofts and sending energy saving lightbulbs through the post,\" said Kennedy. \"But we need a national programme for energy efficiency.\" He added that companies selling energy were not always best placed to advise customers on how to reduce demand. The committee recommends insulating 10m lofts and 7.5m cavity walls by 2015, plus solid wall insulation for 2.3m homes by 2022. This would require a \"whole-house approach\" under which an audit of each house is carried out, says the report, and schemes that would see work carried out street by street. Paul King, chief executive of the UK Green Building Council, said: \"This analysis confirms what we've known for some time. Current government policies will not deliver the programme of home refurbishment that is needed to tackle energy security and climate change. Homeowners are put off by the high upfront cost of more expensive measures and the hassle of getting reliable information and trustworthy installers. The industry is crying out for strong political leadership.\" Dramatic improvements in the energy efficiency of buildings must be coupled with a 50% cut in the carbon emitted by the energy sector by 2020, says the committee. It backs the government's plan for coal stations with carbon capture and storage, but says three new nuclear plants should be operational between 2018 and 2022. The government has yet to specify its nuclear ambitions. The CCC has also recommended that 23GW of wind power be added to the current installed capacity of 4GW. This would mean the equivalent of 8,000 3MW turbines by 2020. Some energy experts doubt the likelihood of meeting the committee's targets. David Hunter, at energy consultants McKinnon and Clarke, said: \"To achieve 50% 'decarbonisation' of energy by 2020 is a really big ask when we are starting at such a low base.\" \"It is laudable that we set these goals. But wind is available 30% of the time, so 70% of the time you have to rely on something else like fossil-fuelled power stations. Nuclear and wind aren't good bedfellows because nuclear produces a steady baseload and can't step in when wind is down.\" He also noted that the CCC was pushing back the likely timescale for new nuclear power stations and expressed doubt that the suggested construction timescales could be met: \"I would eat my hat if you can build a [nuclear] power station in 18 months.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/2010/jun/21/john-hutton-labour-traitor","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-21T08:48:09Z","webTitle":"John Hutton: Labour traitor or public-spirited masochist? | Michael White","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/jun/21/john-hutton-labour-traitor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2010/jun/21/john-hutton-labour-traitor","fields":{"headline":"John Hutton: Labour traitor or public-spirited masochist?","bodyText":"When does cooperation with a rival political party constitute betrayal, treason or even the milder epithet \"collaboration\"? John Prescott has no doubt, and yesterday weighed into his former cabinet colleague John Hutton after it emerged that Hutton is to chair an inquiry into containing the cost of public sector pensions. But Prescott is deeply tribal in his politics – life in general too, I suspect – as well as having a very short fuse. His blog lumps Hutton's conduct in with moves by other Labour ex-ministers, Frank Field and Kate Hoey, to work with the Tories – Boris Johnson in her case, the LibCon coalition in Field's. Labour also tried to embrace opponents while in office, if you recall. The issue seems to have got less attention than Chris Huhne's tangled love life, which is surely a private matter, even in prurient modern Britain. It's OK to be deeply tribal. Some people are, some aren't. It's the difference between Tony Blair (not) and Gordon Brown (very). I imagine George Osborne is more of a tribal Tory than David Cameron, though it's early days. Nick Clegg? Not very tribal at all, I'd say. Me, I have my loyalties, but never feel very tribal about party politics. No one has a monopoly of wisdom or virtue. I feel the same about the World Cup. It would be nice if England won and cheered a lot of people up, but it looks as unlikely as usual in 2010. Due to prior engagements I have been lucky enough to miss both the team's matches in South Africa so far. God willing, they will have my support on Wednesday. Who knows, it could make the vital difference. But what about John Hutton's acceptance of the government's proposal that he look at the public sector pension problem? Prescott – who has disappointed some fellow tribalists by unexpectedly accepting that peerage – assumes the former work and pensions secretary is providing political cover for a Tory onslaught on the system. But that argument cuts both ways: if Hutton comes up with the \"wrong\" answer, they can't easily ignore him. On BBC1's Andrew Marr Show yesterday, George Osborne praised Hutton as \"a man of real intelligence and knowledge in this area\", one who could bring a cross-party perspective to the problem \"in a fair and equitable way\". So far so good. Hutton was a capable minister who took longer to get into the cabinet than he should have done, a victim – so I suspect – of the Blair-Brown feud. He was too Blairite, and Brownites had to get promotions first to balance the ticket. Having privately predicted that a Brown premiership would be \"a fucking disaster\", he later resigned from the cabinet and would have joined the attack on Brown's leadership if he'd thought there was any point. But Hutton correctly concluded that nothing would happen, so he saved his breath. Hutton is therefore equipped to do the job and Osborne is right to say that consensus matters. In office Hutton helped to create one for wider pension reform, just as all parties failed to do – too close to the election – in the related matter of social care for the elderly. You need consensus to make reforms stick and have them not be reversed by the next government. To my mind it's a matter of motive. Ex-sports minister Hoey, the MP for Vauxhall, gives sports advice – her speciality – to Boris Johnson, the mayor of London. Field is to chair a commission to re-examine definitions of poverty, his area of expertise and one he has strong views on. Both are members of Westminster's awkward squad and therefore to be cherished, although I am wary of Field's ego and wayward judgment. Hutton's case is different. He is just 55, not driven by thwarted self-importance and has plenty of opportunities ahead of him. As ex-MP for Barrow – in nuclear Cumbria – he has just joined the board of Hyperion, the US nuclear power firm, and chairs RUSI, Whitehall's in-house defence thinktank. He won't starve. So Hutton doesn't have to take on tricky jobs for a government he doesn't need and to whom he doesn't owe anything. There's bound to be an element of personal calculation – what's in it for me? – in his acceptance; there usually is for most of us. But there's also an intellectual challenge. That challenge is how better to balance the costs of public sector pensions, at a time when private sector pensions are taking a hammering from our old friend economic realism, and British taxpayers in general are as ill-disposed to finance better pensions than they get themselves as Germans are to fund Greek ones. Coalition media and ministers, including Clegg, used dud-but-scary figures off the back of the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) warning that the cost of public sector pensions is becoming unsustainable. And don't forget that most such pensions are modest – not like the plump cat pensions enjoyed by some pretty middling mid-level housing managers, chief executives etc, who attract the wrath of the Daily Mail. The awkward fact is, as I constantly have to remind student audiences, \"the Daily Mail is not always wrong\". It may exaggerate in its own brutal and selectively indignant way, but its pensions campaign is on to something. If we are all going to live longer in retirement (we already do) we are going to have to work longer, contribute more – or get less – to finance our own lives, be they private or public pensions (or a mixture of both). So it's a tough one, but some well-qualified masochist with a bit of political nous has to do it. Rather John Hutton than me – or Lord Prescott."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2007/nov/26/uk.theairlineindustry","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2007-11-26T09:36:15Z","webTitle":"Brown to endorse new generation of nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/nov/26/uk.theairlineindustry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2007/nov/26/uk.theairlineindustry","fields":{"headline":"Brown to endorse new generation of nuclear power","bodyText":"Gordon Brown will call for an acceleration of nuclear power today in a speech to business leaders designed to show he is focused on the long term and will not buckle in the face of negative headlines. During his annual address to the Confederation of British Industry, the prime minister will also give his personal endorsement of the third runway project at Heathrow. He will tell business leaders: \"Long-term reforms will intensify and be stepped up. We must leave behind the old policies of yesterday and plan for new long-term policies which will serve us better tomorrow. There are no answers to be found in old and outworn dogmas.\" Today's speech is likely to draw fire from environmentalists, who will also be looking at how the CBI intends to tackle climate change in the long term. The government said in a consultation paper last week \"a strong case\" existed for an expansion of Heathrow. But Brown will go further: British prosperity depends on the third runway, he will say. \"We know that even as we place strict environmental limits on noise and air - pollution and ensuring aviation pays its carbon costs, we have to increase the capacity of our airports, particularly Heathrow,\" he will say. \"Our prosperity depends on it. Britain as a world financial centre must be readily accessible to the world\". A third runway and sixth terminal would increase the number of flights at Heathrow from 470,000 a year to more than 700,000 and destroy the village of Sipson, which borders the current Heathrow site. On nuclear power Brown will say: \"We must and will take the right long-term decisions to invest now for the next generation of sustainable and secure energy supplies.\" He was forced by the courts to hold a second, as yet incomplete, consultation on building nuclear stations so he will not make an announcement today in case he is accused again of pre-empting the outcome. But it is clear that he sees a new generation of stations as vital to Britain's energy security and emission targets. Brown's decision to tackle two of the most contentious issues - and tackle environmental concerns along the way, comes as Alan Milburn warns that Labour must develop a sense of forward progress. Interviewed in Australia, where he worked closely on the victorious campaign of the country's new Labor prime minister, Kevin Rudd, the former cabinet minister said there were \"lessons in common\" between the political situations in Britain and Australia. \"For Britain the lessons are very straightforward. Any party of government has to ... look ready to deal with new challenges,\" he said. \"Elections are all about the future.\" Speaking after this weekend's Australian election, Milburn warned that \"the hardest thing of all is for a party to renew itself in office and keep on winning\". A close friend of Tony Blair, he is believed to be unhappy at Labour's failure to hold a contested leadership election this year. In remarks some may interpret as aimed at Brown, he said that Australia's longstanding prime minister, John Howard, lost because his government had \"developed a sense of invincibility\" after 11 years in power. \"There was a sense of tiredness and staleness and it was not until the election was called that his Liberal party tried to find any sense of forward momentum and new policy,\" he said. Milburn has been in regular contact with Rudd since he took over as leader of Australia's Labor party last year. He has advised him on campaign strategy and speeches, celebrating a landslide victory on Saturday night with the new PM at his headquarters in Brisbane. He attributed Labor's victory, which leaves Australia's conservative coalition out of power at federal and state level across the country, to its leader's \"strong sense that he had to be the change\". He was \"a man with a plan, fresh ideas and new energy who captured the mood of the country\". He said he became \"good friends\" with Rudd after leaving government for the second time in 2005 - a move that did not rule out talk that he might have challenged Brown for the Labour leadership."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2009/jun/02/european-nuclear-energy-forum","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-06-02T14:00:00Z","webTitle":"European nuclear body accused of stifling critical voices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/jun/02/european-nuclear-energy-forum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2009/jun/02/european-nuclear-energy-forum","fields":{"headline":"European nuclear body accused of stifling critical voices","bodyText":"The European Nuclear Energy Forum (Enef) was set up to bring together the nuclear power industry and green groups to encourage \"an open debate without taboos\" about the future of nuclear power.

The seal of approval for nuclear power – a cause embraced by Republican senators – came on day one of a full-on lobbying effort by the White House for one of Obama's signature issues. Obama sent four of his top lieutenants to the Senate – his secretaries of energy, interior, agriculture and the head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) – to try to drum up support for a global warming bill. The PR effort saw direct appeals to the farming and nuclear lobbies – some of the fiercest critics of Obama's clean energy agenda – with Steven Chu, the Nobel-winning energy secretary, calling for new nuclear plants to re-establish America's technological dominance in the world. \"I think nuclear power is going to be a very important factor in getting us to a low carbon future,\" Chu told the Senate's environment and public works committee. \"Quite frankly, we want to recapture the lead on industrial nuclear power. We have lost that lead as we have lost the lead in many energy technologies and we want to get it back.\" The endorsement of a nuclear revival – a generation after the last reactor was commissioned – suggests the Obama administration is open to further compromises as it seeks to find a path through the Senate. The House of Representatives narrowly passed a climate change bill late last month. Republicans in the Senate, who are almost universally opposed to action aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as well as Democrats from rust belt states, have been clamouring for a \"nuclear renaissance\" in America, which would see the construction of 100 new nuclear power plants by 2030. The administration officials also tried to make inroads among the powerful farmers' lobby, saying they hoped the effort could help ensure passage of the bill through the Senate. Yesterday's hearing marks the opening round of a second major push by the White House for Obama's climate and energy agenda. Obama is in Europe where he hopes to persuade the G8 to commit to limiting global warming to 2C, and to persuade Russia to make its lumbering industries more efficient. But the White House acknowledges it must also demonstrate American willingness by ensuring passage of a climate bill through both houses of Congress by December, when international climate change negotiations end in Copenhagen. It is widely believed that the international community will not sign up to action on climate change without evidence of US commitment. The Democratic leadership in the Senate hopes to use the house bill as a template. It has pencilled in a schedule that would see the bill clear the committee process by mid-September and move to vote by late autumn. But the way ahead is daunting. Despite the Democrats' 77-seat advantage in the house, the bill gained just 219 votes – one more than a bare majority – and the reform package had swollen to more than 1,427 pages. Much of that bloat was in the political sops to ensure the bill's support: concessions to farmers that ultimately damage the bill, protectionist measures to help heavily polluting industries – and even a hurricane centre in Florida. The administration's case is also damaged by rising criticism of the bill, from environmentalists who say it does not go far enough as well as those opposed to any action. Lisa Jackson, head of the EPA, stopped short of endorsing the package yesterday, saying: \"It sends the right signal and you all in the Senate have work to do.\" But she said the Senate had little choice, and that inaction on climate change could lead to America's global economic decline. \"Clean energy is to this decade and the next what the space race was to the 1950s and 60s and America is behind,\" Jackson told the Senate. \"Governments in Asia and Europe are ahead of the United States in making aggressive investments in clean energy technology.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/sep/01/climate-change-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-01T17:19:42Z","webTitle":"Britain admits it is not green enough, reveals Guardian/ICM poll | Julian Glover","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/01/climate-change-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/sep/01/climate-change-poll","fields":{"headline":"Britain admits it is not green enough, reveals poll","bodyText":"Britain has become a nation of guilty greens – people who admit they do not do enough to fight climate change – according to a Guardian/ICM poll published today. While almost everyone claims to have made some effort to live environmentally-friendly lives, almost two-thirds also say they could do more. The poll was carried out ahead of the launch of the 10:10 climate campaign, backed by organisations including the Guardian. It finds widespread agreement that climate change exists – 85% say it is already a threat or will be in the future. It also shows strong public support for individual action to reduce carbon emissions: 85%, for instance, say that people should fit low energy lightbulbs and 86% agree that people should turn down their heating. But a majority also agree that they have not done enough so far. Only 32% believe they already do enough to fight climate change, while 61% say that although they do some green things they could do more. Only 7% claim to make no effort to help the environment. In total 95% say they are making at least some effort to be green. They are the target of the 10:10 campaign, which is urging people and businesses to make individual efforts to cut carbon emissions by 10% during 2010, regardless of government action or the outcome of the Copehagen summit in December. 10:10 was launched today at an event at Tate Modern in London, which saw hundreds of people sign up to a pledge to cut personal emissions by taking a series of steps such as cutting down on flights or eating locally-sourced food. The poll suggests that warnings about climate change are now firmly imprinted on the public mind: only 11% say that climate change is not a threat, while 37% say it has already become one and a further 48% say it will threaten future generations unless action is taken. Most people also accept that climate change is caused by human activity, despite publicised suggestions that other natural factors might be responsible. While 71% say climate change is mainly man-made, only 23% point to other causes. However these results have barely changed since the Guardian and ICM last asked such questions in 2005. Campaigners may take comfort from the fact that the economic crisis has not stopped people taking environmental issues seriously, as happened during the recession in the early 1990s. But four years of campaigning seems to have had little effect on public awareness. In 2005, 40% thought climate change was a current threat and 49% feared it would become one – both figures marginally higher those today. Many people also question whether individual behaviour will make any difference. A small majority, 52%, say climate change will take place regardless of the way individuals behave. Slightly fewer, 46%, think that they can make a difference by acting differently. That finding shows the scale of the challenge facing campaigns such as 10:10. Even though an overwhelming majority say climate change is or will be a threat, most do not think changing their own behaviour is the answer. As in 2005, people are also keener on small fixes such as changing lightbulbs than on things that would push up prices or force people to live differently. But there have been shifts in attitudes on some issues, such as nuclear power, flying and locally-sourced food. In 2005, as today, 83% of people agreed people should consider buying more fuel-efficient cars. More people now think people should drive less, 75% (67% in 2005). More also think people should cut down on flying, 69% (56% in 2005), and more think people should buy less food from outside Europe, 75% (63% in 2005). There continues to be stronger resistance to measures that could push up taxes. Only 33% back a pay-per-mile scheme for roads (26% in 2005). Even fewer, 29%, say they are prepared to pay more for gas and electricity to cut waste. However the expansion of the renewable industry is less controversial than opponents believe. Public backing for windfarms has grown since 2005, with 79% saying they would not object to one being built within 20 miles of their home (up from 69% in 2005). A remarkable 67% say they would even support a windfarm in sight of their house, although that theoretical backing may not be born out in practice. Nuclear power, which has won government support since 2005, is also now less unpopular than before, with 32% saying they would not object to a nuclear power station being built within 20 miles of their home (19% in 2005). A sizeable minority, 20%, even claim they would not mind a nuclear plant being built in sight of their house. • ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,011 adults aged 18+ by telephone between 28 and 30 August 2009.

According to Carla and the Ambitious, a book by two French journalists, written, it's said, with the first lady's co-operation, Madame Bruni-Sarkozy used police and intelligence services to flush out her rivals and to uncover the source of rumours that the couple were having extramarital affairs. At the same time as Bruni-Sarkozy is denying having co-operated with the authors Michaël Darmon and Yves Derai (despite giving them a series of taped interviews over an 18-month period), the president is attempting to manage the fallout from his controversial decision to deport several thousand Roma people as part of a crackdown on illegal camps in France. The policy has been denounced as \"a disgrace\" by the EU justice commissioner, but Sarkozy is carrying on regardless. At a European summit on Thursday, he was reported to have rowed with José Manuel Barroso, Commission president, while defending his position, an exchange described by David Cameron as \"very lively\". He is also embroiled in a scandal involving L'Oréal heiress Liliane Bettencourt. Sarkozy, who has been implicated in the suggestion that Bettencourt made illegal campaign contributions to his party, is facing an investigation into the claim that he ordered counter-espionage services to track down the source of damaging leaks concerning the affair. According to Aurélie Filippetti, the French socialist politician: \"This is a new scandal worthy of Watergate.\" The 55-year-old president has probably become accustomed to the accusation of unnecessary melodrama since his election three years ago. First, there was the on-off romantic tussle between him and his ex-wife, Cécilia. Then there were titillating rumours that Sarkozy's glamorous former justice minister, Rachida Dati, was consulting him rather more closely on affairs of the heart than of state, an impression heightened by Dati's persistent refusal to name the father of her one-year-old daughter. Then there was his highly public courtship of the former supermodel and singer Carla Bruni, who, rather improbably, became Sarkozy's third wife despite a 13-year age gap and a significant height difference. But all of that pales into insignificance compared to the extraordinary allegations that emerged last week in Carla and the Ambitious (a second biography, Carla – A Secret Life by investigative writer Besma Lahouri, also appeared in French bookshops last week). It is hard to imagine the same thing happening in Britain, which has always had a rather bumbling attitude to political scandal (even the outraged indignation over MPs' expenses was leavened by the comic possibilities surrounding the purchase of duck houses, Hobnob biscuits and massage chairs). Yet the French always seem to have a more sophisticated approach when it comes to political and sexual intrigue. \"I think it's perhaps because the French have such a strong separation between personal and public lives that they handle scandal with a bit more grace and maturity than the British,\" says Agnès Poirier, a French cultural and political commentator. \"There's a sense that anybody's private life is not our business. The fact that Carla Bruni has had affairs with men in the past, so what? Ordering the intelligence services to investigate is something different, but I think it comes from him, not from her. After all, she is not in power.\" Suddenly, the soap opera comparison seem out of place. Phone tapping, dastardly political plots involving millionaire heiresses and illicit love affairs are not the kind of thing one expects to see in EastEnders. Dallas, maybe. Or a glossy box-office movie thriller. But whatever impact the recent fracas might have had domestically, over the Channel, it has simply underlined our deep fascination with France's first couple. The Nicolas-Carla love story has gripped our attention at every unlikely twist and turn. And like all the best fictional lovers, their partnership has been defined by one overriding question: what is she doing with him? It is not just the aesthetic disparity that intrigues us – Bruni has graced the cover of Vogue; Sarkozy was depicted on the cover of the Economist as a pair of tiny feet under a giant Napoleonic hat – it is also the fact that while she spoke openly of her left-leaning political sympathies, he once styled himself as France's answer to Margaret Thatcher. Yet, when they met at a dinner party in 2007, we are told the attraction was instant. After a string of lovers, including Mick Jagger, Eric Clapton and philosopher Raphaël Enthoven, Bruni had declared her intention to pursue a man of \"nuclear power\". Sarkozy had at his disposal more than 350 nuclear warheads. It was a fusion made in heaven. Within a month, they were posing for Paris Match in the Elysée palace, complete with Rolex watches. Sarkozy, who had sailed into power with 53% of the vote and was cresting the wave of popular approval, seemed overly pleased with his newfound celebrity status. The press dubbed him \"President Bling-Bling\". For some, Sarkozy's willingness to conduct his private life in public marked a welcome modernity; previous French presidents had generally cultivated a patrician gaze, a dispassionate air and an aura of superior detachment. Sarkozy, with his supermodel wife, his immigrant background, his penchant for Montblanc pens and Cuban heels, was a breath of fresh air, a pugnacious politician who promised to reinvigorate France. According to Antoine Michelland, of Point de Vue magazine in Paris: \"For Sarkozy, his private life and his public life are in the same bag and he likes to use both to manipulate coverage for himself, as a means of communicating with the electorate.\" But for others, Sarkozy's flagrant desire for the spotlight seemed inappropriate in a country that prides itself on stringent privacy laws and the rigorous separation of personal and public life. \"There is a terrible distaste in France for that kind of showiness,\" says Poirier. And according to Vivienne Walt, Paris correspondent of Time magazine: \"French society is very divided over what it thinks about [Sarkozy]. He is criticised by lots of people for not being presidential enough, not mysterious enough, too on show, too much like an average politician… I think the best thing you can say about Sarkozy is that nobody's neutral.\" Perhaps most harmful to his reputation was the feeling that he was somehow not taking things seriously. Recently, he seems to have changed his stance on key policies – on pension reforms and retirement age, for instance – according to what might curry more favour with his rapidly dwindling electoral base. His wife did little to help matters when she released an album of breathy songs, including one in which she admitted to having had 30 lovers and another in which she compared the president to a class-A drug \"more deadly than Afghan heroin\" (admittedly, the lyric sounds better in French). In recent months, Sarkozy's popularity has seen a devastating slide – his approval ratings dipped to an all-time low of 34% in August. The last thing his already shaky presidency needed was the publication of a book purporting to tell the story of what really goes on behind the gilded doors of the Elysée. According to Darmon and Derai, Bruni-Sarkozy is even alleged to have received a police report suggesting there had been a plot between Rachida Dati and the president's former sister-in-law to oust her and – bizarrely – to persuade Sarkozy's former spouse to return to his side. In a further mind-boggling show of indiscretion, Bruni-Sarkozy is also said to have recounted a conversation with Michelle Obama in which the American first lady is supposed to have confessed that life in the White House was \"hell\". The comment was swiftly denied by Mrs Obama's spokeswoman. There is more to come as the allegations in the two new books are digested and scrutinised. Carla – A Secret Life includes, as its publishing house suggests, \"everything from Carla's relationship with secret lovers to plastic surgeons\". The picture is drawn of a fast-living adventuress obsessed by money and fame. With the promise of further revelations lurking around the corner for France's first couple, it seems the Sarkozy soap opera is about to go prime time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/feb/21/tax-avoidance-comment","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-21T00:10:24Z","webTitle":"Time everyone paid their fair share of tax","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/21/tax-avoidance-comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/feb/21/tax-avoidance-comment","fields":{"headline":"Time everyone paid their fair share of tax","bodyText":"In praise of paying tax. Now there's a controversial idea in a country like the UK that is in thrall to the tax avoidance industry, as we explore on pages 48-49. Millions of us have little or no choice about our tax affairs as the money is deducted through PAYE, but many companies and wealthy individuals view tax as discretionary expenditure. They threaten to relieve us of their presence at the merest suggestion they might not be granted the tax breaks they crave, and finding ways legally to wriggle out of paying is big business. The idea that tax breaks for the wealthy and for businesses were a way to stimulate growth was a key tenet of the economic liberalism of the Thatcher/Reagan years. But instead of having the trickle-down benefits intended, it resulted in pandering to the City's desire for ever-lower taxes while generating little in return for the rest of us. Any tax system reflects the priorities of society. The architecture of ours was shaped around attracting non-domiciled financiers and Russian oligarchs, luring the rich from other nations and encouraging them to settle here. Encouraging investment in say, energy and transport infrastructure came lower down the list of priorities, as did help for entrepreneurs. So while the non-doms flooded to London, chunks of our electricity and nuclear power industries, as one example, have been sold off to the French state: pensioners in Paris will benefit when someone turns on their lights in Peterborough. Before its election in 1997, the incoming Labour government took huge pains to establish its low-tax credentials. That was understandable at the time, but led to all manner of contortions to avoid raising the basic headline rate of income tax. It was coupled with a bizarre reluctance to challenge benefits for the super-wealthy, including non-dom status and privileges allowing private equity barons to pay a lower rate than their cleaners. Rather than concentrating on making the UK competitive at wealth-generating activities, the emphasis has been on tax competition, leaving us at the mercy of the rootless rich. The swallowing of the City's low-tax mantra has another, more basic flaw, which is the erroneous idea financial services should be seen as an engine of wealth generation in its own right; in a functioning economy, banks are meant merely to serve the productive sector. It is no wonder that politicians from both major parties find it so difficult to have an honest discussion about the inevitable fiscal tightening we face. Paying more tax is seen as philosophically unacceptable, and that has made it almost impossible to talk sensibly about the taxation of bankers' bonuses, or about how to recoup some of the costs of the bailout from those responsible for the crisis, instead of parking the whole burden on the little people on PAYE. Any sentient being knows taxes will have to go up, but politicians are not allowed to say so. Paying tax has terrible PR. But it is actually a good thing to pay the right amount of tax. It is also a good thing when the economic substance of a taxpayer's affairs reflects the picture they have painted to the Revenue and not some sham structure. The contempt for taxpaying of the past few decades has gone hand in hand with greater inequality, strained public services and an unthinking faith in the market, ideas that are now discredited. As we head towards an election, it's time for a new way of thinking."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2008/sep/24/britishenergy.edf.nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-09-24T07:53:17Z","webTitle":"EDF to buy British Energy for £12.4bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/24/britishenergy.edf.nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/sep/24/britishenergy.edf.nuclear","fields":{"headline":"EDF to buy British Energy for £12.4bn","bodyText":"Britain's plans for a new generation of nuclear power stations received a major boost this morning when French energy giant EDF finally agreed to buy British Energy in a £12.4bn deal. Taxpayers will also get a windfall as the government owns 36% of British Energy having stepped in to rescue the firm in 2002. Assuming shareholders approve the deal, EDF will be in a prime position to develop the UK's nuclear power industry. The government hopes to build several new nuclear generators around the UK to solve the looming energy crisis, and British Energy's eight sites are seen as likely locations. \"We are delighted that the British Energy board has unanimously accepted this offer,\" said the EDF chairman, Pierre Gadonneix. \"This paves the way for investment in the UK.\" British Energy currently produces 15% of the country's power. Its shareholders rejected an earlier £12bn bid in early August, which left the government's energy policy facing crisis. EDF has now agreed to pay 774p a share, with an alternative of 700p plus a new \"nuclear power note\" linked to the future performance of the generating company. However, it is understood that some shareholders may not support the takeover. Shares in British Energy jumped 6% to 767p this morning, up 43p. More details of the proposal will be released later today at a Paris press conference. EDF is expected to hand back several of British Energy's sites to the government, who could then sell them on to rival energy companies. British Energy runs eight UK nuclear sites with adjacent land on which reactors could be built: Dungeness B in Kent, Hartlepool, Heysham 1 and 2 in Lancashire, Hinkley Point B in Somerset, Hunterston B in Ayrshire, Sizewell B in Suffolk and Torness in East Lothian. The group also owns a coal-fired power station at Eggborough, north Yorkshire. Shortly after the deal was announced Centrica, owner of British Gas, revealed that it is in talks to acquire a 25% stake in British Energy from EDF. At one stage Centrica was a potential buyer of the whole company, but struggled to put together a cash bid. With wholesale prices so high, the company is keen to produce more of its own energy rather than having to buy it in."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2009/nov/01/mikes-big-british-bike-adventure","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-01T00:05:14Z","webTitle":"Mike's big British bike adventure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/nov/01/mikes-big-british-bike-adventure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2009/nov/01/mikes-big-british-bike-adventure","fields":{"headline":"Mike's big British bike adventure","bodyText":"For some, it's visiting every football league ground, for others, tube stations.

It skirted the base of the chalk cliffs of Minnis Bay, as if I was riding under the ramparts of some giant alabaster castle. \"Where's that?\" I asked a man in Herne Bay, pointing to a town in the distance across the water. \"Southend,\" he replied. \"Southend,\" I said, in whispered awe, in much the same way I imagine that Columbus did upon sighting the New World. \"I was there five months ago. Can you believe it?\" The man, without the benefit of context, seemed able to believe it quite easily. Through lovely Faversham, and then out into the fields and orchards, the feral escapees lining the lanes groaning with fruit. I stopped to eat some succulent wild pears and then cycled on to the marshland village of Conyer, and along the levees, floating across the sunken landscape, past the ribs of eviscerated boats sticking out of the mud like dinosaur carcasses. Gillingham, Chatham, Rochester – a sign read \"London 30\". At Gravesend, the Thames reappeared, not wide and majestic, as it had been the last time I'd seen it at Whitstable, before the Isles of Sheppey and Grain had obscured it, but imprisoned by concrete banks. I felt faintly claustrophobic, flushed with a sense of loss, grief even, for the absent vastness of the sea, my constant companion for almost half a year. I passed the gigantic Bluewater shopping centre, then the Dartford Bridge and Erith. I was being sucked into London. Thamesmead, Woolwich, then there, beyond the Thames Barrier, were the towers of Canary Wharf. The Woolwich ferry shuttled back and forth across the river. I considered jumping on it and going round one more time. Greenwich. New Cross. Red buses. Sirens. Very familiar streets now. My town. Not my town. I stopped at a red light and looked down at my bike. I thought about the places it had taken me to – across the bouncing bridges suspended in the sky, past the castles of Northumberland, to wild Cape Wrath, through the Assynt mountains, the lonely, windswept Outer Hebrides, around the majestic sweep of Morecambe Bay, the Gower peninsula, up and down the murderous hills of Devon and Cornwall, to Land's End, and, finally, Bermondsey. It seemed impossible that this piece of steel could have carried me through all that. At Tower Bridge, a friend was waiting for me. We had a few beers at a riverside pub. He asked how the trip had been, but it already seemed like a fast-receding dream and I struggled to remember much detail. We walked up to Blackfriars Bridge, where it had all started five months before. All I had to do now was ride across the Thames and the circle of Britain was complete. The rain had started to fall gently. I felt reluctant to cross, as if this were the best book I'd ever read and this the last precious page. Finally, I said farewell to my friend and rode onto the bridge, feeling dazed, heading for home alongside the cycling commuters, as the rain started to fall more heavily. • Miles this week 285.

A quick global overview","bodyText":"The future security of freshwater resources around the world is of increasing concern. Due to our interlinked global economy, water scarcity in many parts of the world could harm the global economy in ways we had not thought of. Shortfalls in crop yields and more variable food prices could be an early impact. Our demand for water is closely linked to economic growth. As we grow wealthier, the more freshwater we require to supply cities, power plants, factories and the production high protein food such as dairy, meat and fish. It is not just a question of more people requiring more water. Rather, it is a case of more wealthy societies demanding much more water. During the 20th century, while population grew by a factor of four, freshwater withdrawals grew by a factor of nine. If we take these past patterns and look forward, the outlook for 2030 is stark. Currently about 70% of the world's freshwater withdrawals are for agriculture, 16% are for energy and industry and 14% are for domestic purposes. Recent work suggests that unless we change our historic approach to how we use water, we could face a 40% gap by 2030 between global demand and what can sustainably be supplied. Why is this, and what are the implications? To meet the forecast growth in demand for food over the next 20 years, farmers will need to increase production by 70-100%. Changing diets will increase demand for meat and dairy products in particular. A kilogram of meat requires up to 20,000 litres of water to produce (compared to about 1,200 litres to produce a kilo of grain), and global demand for meat is forecast to increase 50% by 2025. Herein lies the water challenge. If we already use over 70% of freshwater withdrawals for agriculture and face an increase in demand for food by 70% by 2030, especially for water-intensive meat and dairy, it is clear that a business-as-usual approach is not an option. We cannot use over 100% of our freshwater for agriculture. Significant, perhaps radical changes in agricultural water usage will be required. At the same time, our demand for energy will also grow; and energy is also a thirsty sector. The International Energy Agency forecasts that the world economy will demand at least 40% more energy by 2030. McKinsey and Company estimates that 77% of the power stations we will need by then have yet to be built. By that year, China will need to expand its power generating capacity by over 1,300 GW (1.5 times the current level of the US) and India by 400 GW (equal to the current combined total power generation of Japan, South Korea and Australia). Increasing access to energy is a priority for many countries. 1.5bn people in the developing world still lack access to electricity and over 3bn rely on biomass for heating and cooking. Yet, energy needs a lot of water. In richer countries, up to 50% of freshwater withdrawals can be used in the production of oil, gas and electricity. Take the US for example. The US Geological Survey estimates that to produce and burn the 1bn tonnes of coal the country uses each year, the mining and utility industries withdraw 55tn to 75tn gallons of water annually. That's about equal to all the water that pours over Niagara Falls in five months. In other words, about half of all water withdrawals in the US today are used to cool electricity generating stations (It is important to note that this water is not consumed, it is withdrawn from rivers and reservoirs and used for cooling etc, then returned. But access to the freshwater is still vital. No water, no power station). By 2030 the US is forecast to increase its energy demand by 40%. Using current energy systems this could translate into a large increase in freshwater access needs, up to 165% according to some analysis. The maths suggests that, with the demands from other areas such as agriculture, this simply can't be done. More challenging still, many 'clean' energy solutions that the US may wish to pursue to meet its wider environmental obligations, such as carbon capture and storage, shale gas, nuclear power and solar thermal plants, can actually require even more water for their systems than a coal fired power station. Against this water and growth conundrum, General Electric has asked if there will be enough water in the US to power the future. The Economist has written about the end to farming in the California valleys as a result of water shortages and water reallocations. In the future, the US will likely have to depend much more on other country's agriculture and water, so it can import its orange juice and raisins (and potentially its wine). Even the US Department of Energy recently told Congress that energy production in the US is at the mercy of water availability. This water for food versus water for energy dilemma which the US already faces is similar to that which many fast growing economies will have to tackle very soon. As much of Asia urbanises and industrialises (and is encouraged to pursue lower emission energy choices), more water will have to be directed towards energy and away from agriculture. Some modeling suggests a 76% increase in water demand for energy and industry will be required across Asia by 2030 compared to today. Recall that this will occur at exactly the same time as these countries will also need to almost double their food production. Against a baseline of 70% of water already being used for agriculture, how can these competing challenges be squared off? We can see first responses to the growth challenge of the food-energy-water nexus already being played out around the world as water-scarce, fast growing economies in Asia and the Gulf seek to acquire agricultural land in water-rich countries like equatorial Africa. These so called 'land grabs' are really about water. If our global trading regime offered a more effective trade in agricultural goods, there would be much less need for such land/water deals. This challenging scenario of water trade-offs over the next two decades should also be set against the context of today's water management challenges. Unfortunately, the story gets worse. Due to a historical profligacy of water use, the old adage of \"You wouldn't want to be starting from here\" holds true. Many countries are extracting groundwater faster than it can be replenished (Mexico by 20%, China by 25% and India by 56%). Over 70 of the world's major rivers now hardly reach the ocean due to the extensive diversion of water for human use. If current trends continue, by 2030 increasing water scarcity could cause annual grain losses equivalent to 30% of current world consumption (just as we need 70% more food). As demand continues to grow, competition for water will intensify between economic sectors, as well as between geographies In addition, let's not forget that a potentially changing climate will simply accelerate freshwater security challenges faced in many places around the world. Unlike options in energy, there are no substitutes or alternatives to water. We will simply have to adapt. This is not just a problem for the very poorest nations. Water security will affect people in Australia, the Balkans, California, China, India, Jordan, Greece, Mexico, North Africa, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, South Africa and Turkey among others. Even southern parts of the UK can already be classed as under water stress. For all these reasons business as usual is not an option. We cannot manage water into the future as we have in the past. Given the timescales associated with turning things around in the water sector, the need for long term planning, and the dire conditions some countries already find themselves in, senior analysts suggest we have about 10 years to act. The good news is that the next few years hold great potential for a transformation in the world's water management. Unlike climate change, no-one can argue that the problem does not exist, or that solutions are quickly required. New technologies, new arrangements and new policies will be required. The water services sector, water processing, water recycling technologies and water policy links to the energy and agricultural sectors are fast becoming a busy space for business, financial and professional services firms, policy makers and issue specialists. The World Economic Forum itself has embarked on a major initiative to help develop an improved fact base, and a public-private platform of advisory services to help governments that wish to engage in transformational water reform. This will tackle many of the challenges set out above in real time and in real situations, and I will write more about what we find as it gets under way. Suffice to say the arrival of a space to talk about water and its links to business, governments and growth is very timely. My congratulations go to the Guardian Sustainable Business section for embarking on this exercise. I look forward to a vibrant expert community of bloggers emerging and sharing thoughts and experiences on water, water and business and water and our wider economic growth. *While Dominic Waughray is senior director and head of environmental initiatives at the World Economic Forum, he emphasises that he is writing in a personal capacity.

It was taken on the day that the women's peace camp was set up in the early 1980s. We were there to lend support. I have many childhood memories of my dad's activism. I recall my brother and I being taken to numerous marches and rallies and somehow they were always made fun. The issues weren't drummed into us, however. My dad had a blue, rectangular box that he kept in his wardrobe. The box had a CND sign that he had pasted on the lid - he ran the local anti-nuclear group and kept all the documentation inside. I remember it was a constant presence in the house, but I never understood what it contained. One evening in winter, I remember my mum taking this box into the driving snow and dropping the contents over the pavement. My dad ran out to gather the papers and my mum shut him out in the snow. I couldn't comprehend why either of them behaved as they did. It was an incongruous event in our happy family and their companionable marriage and that is why the memory of my dad in the snow is so salient. Sarah Ellis A letter to Great Aunt Julia On the bookcase in my flat in Belfast sits a sepia photograph of three remarkably beautiful young women. They stare out boldly, brazenly at the camera - Sibyl (my grandmother), Rhona and Ruby (my great aunts). The Victorian photographer has posed them cleverly. A charming trio, each of them clasps a musical instrument - a violin, a viola and a cello. The reference to the classical muses is obvious. A fourth sister? That might have spoiled the artist's composition. By the time this photograph was taken, Great Aunt Julia, you - the missing fourth sister - were either a tiny skeleton, decaying in a wind-swept churchyard at the other end of the Earth, or you were copying your sisters' sparkling example and breaking the hearts of the young men of Christchurch, New Zealand. I have no idea which of these versions of your death or life is true. In 1865, your father, my great-grandfather, Matthew, left Ireland for New Zealand, accompanied by his new and much-loved young wife. Perhaps significantly, she was called Julia, too. When they arrived in New Zealand, Matthew quickly found work on an Ashburton sheep farm and developed a vocation as a lay preacher. Your mother had three daughters in quick succession. All healthy. All fighting fit. No reason, therefore, to worry when she became pregnant for the fourth time. But things went badly wrong. You were born early, weak and sickly. Your mother developed puerperal peritonitis. I imagine that her death was cruelly painful, not just for her but for all those who loved her. I find it hard to write about what happened next. Of course, Matthew must have been devastated. And her unexpected death left him with four small girls, all under the age of seven, thousands of miles away from any family who could have helped bring them up. He decided to return to Ireland. All this is quite understandable. What is much less easy to understand is that he left you behind in New Zealand. He gave you up for adoption by a family from his local church. I can see how it is possible to justify this seemingly harsh decision. You were ailing, judged unlikely to survive a long sea voyage and that would undoubtedly have been the reason given to friends and family. Perhaps, on a darker, more unacknowledged level, he blamed you for the death of your mother. But I think of how hard it must have been for your three little sisters. Their mother dead, hauled away from the only life they knew and their friends to an uncertain future in a land that was completely foreign to them. And you, the fragile little bundle they last saw in the doctor's arms, lost to them for ever, abandoned. When they arrived back in Ireland, Matthew trained as a Church of Ireland minister, was ordained and married again, an Englishwoman this time. The girls' new stepmother did not encourage them to talk about their mother or about New Zealand. Questions were, quite simply, out of the question. Your eldest sister, my grandmother, Sibyl, believed - perhaps from something she overheard, or perhaps from a convenient lie she was told - that you did not live beyond infancy. But neither she nor any of the rest of our family have ever been sure. Your ghost has never been laid to rest. So this coming spring, I am travelling from Belfast to New Zealand to see if I can find any trace of you. The odds are very long. I know how to find my great-grandmother's grave in Christchurch cemetery, but no matter how short or long your life may have been, I doubt very much that you are buried there. Moriarty is a relatively unusual name, but my guess is that the family who adopted you would have given you their own name and even, perhaps, changed your given name of Julia. Truthfully, it is less of a search and more of a pilgrimage, a way of trying to give you a long overdue but heartfelt apology. And yet, sometimes, as I pass that bookcase and glance at the photograph, I have the strangest sensation: of four pairs of eyes following my every move and willing me, willing me on. Your great-niece Geraldine We love to eat Nan's one-pot mince Ingredients 450g minced lamb 1 large onion, halved Tinned carrots Frozen peas Potatoes, cut into chunks A handful of oats to thicken Cover the mince with water, bring to the boil and skim off the froth. Add the onion, potatoes, carrots and oats. Stir to mix. Cover and allow to simmer for about an hour and a half. Add the peas and leave the lid ajar while it cooks for a further 30 minutes, allowing it to thicken a bit. Frankly, you could walk away and forget about it bubbling on the stove; it wouldn't suffer from neglect. Hmm, maybe that's why Mum used to make it ... My nephew and I grew up together - there are only five years between us - and he used to spend school holidays with Mum and I when his parents were working. Mum used to make this one-pot dish simply because it was a cheap and easy way to feed hungry tummies. My late brother used to wolf it down when he lived at home. Mum was always a bit puzzled at our enthusiasm: \"It was just a bit of mince,\" she would say. We all loved it and it has since passed into family legend as \"Nan's mince\". My nephew's children used to ask him to make it for them and it's definitely my comfort food of choice. You absolutely have to use tinned carrots - somehow it doesn't work with \"real\" carrots. Mum died last year, aged 95, but her mince lives on. She'd like that.

I was thrilled to meet her some months later when the WTG commissioned a play of mine. I shudder to remember this dramatic representation of nuclear power, with singing and dancing atoms, but Clare made a wonderful kind of English blonde-bombshell atom, full of fun and verve. At the time, she lived with her photographer sister Lel in a lovely house with some cats, but she decided she needed her own place and we agreed to look for flats in the same building. In a year of searching, I got to know her well. I relished her sense of humour, her wry observation, and also her anger at the state of the world. Clare was great company. Her intelligence zoomed in on any subject, her imagination enriched it and then her zany wit made you laugh. When she showed me an early draft of Low Level Panic, I remember thinking – not without a pang of envy - that she had become a fully fledged writer overnight. No early-draft fumbling: the play was fully formed, funny, with marvellous parts for women. Perhaps her acting experience had helped her create these quirky, touching characters, which feel completely true, bursting, alive, from the page. My favourite play of Clare's was The Thickness of Skin. I remember the producer Frith Banbury saying it was the kind of work that years earlier would have easily slid into the West End. It ruthlessly captured the naivety of the liberal conscience and followed the consequences with an unsparing eye. Before her illness had completely incapacitated her, we went to the Royal Academy together. Clare had a wonderful eye for painting. She looked beautiful, translucent. She knew she was facing a bleak future and, as we wandered around the galleries, she described the quack remedies (\"pineapples!\") she was being offered, with her usual hilarious sense of the absurd. Her adaptation of Stefan Zweig's towering novel, Beware of Pity, had a reading at Rada some years ago. We were all riveted by her powerful version: this rich and heartbreaking play should be staged."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/2011/jan/18/teaching-methods-government-reforms","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-18T08:00:02Z","webTitle":"Teaching guru is optimistic about education","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jan/18/teaching-methods-government-reforms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2011/jan/18/teaching-methods-government-reforms","fields":{"headline":"Teaching guru is optimistic about education","bodyText":"Dylan Wiliam once had only one ambition: to become a famous and successful jazz musician. He turned to teaching only so he could raise enough money to buy amplification equipment. He could hardly have imagined then that fame would eventually come his way in the form of two one-hour, peak-time BBC2 documentaries on teaching techniques. Called The Classroom Experiment, they were broadcast last September and featured Wiliam, black-browed, bald and slightly menacing (he looks a bit like one of those Doctor Who characters who's about to dynamite the universe), chivvying Hertfordshire teachers into using lollipop sticks, coloured cups and mini-whiteboards, and the pupils into doing 15 minutes of exercise in the gym each day before lessons. It was entertaining enough, and the Times TV reviewer called it \"utterly gripping\", but it all seemed a bit gimmicky. As another reviewer observed, Wiliam came over as a man with a box of unrelated tricks. Wiliam agrees that the programme failed to convey a coherent message, but says that, embedded within it, you will find the main elements of his educational thinking, the product of 25 years' research. That thinking challenges almost every attempt, by governments of any political party, to raise educational standards. To the fury of the teachers' unions, Wiliam, until recently deputy director at the London University Institute of Education, argues that cutting class sizes and putting up new buildings don't deliver value for money. \"The evidence from research,\" he says, \"is that adequate lighting and decent acoustics are very important in schools. But for new buildings in themselves, very few studies show any effect at all. Yes, they improve attendance, but there are cheaper ways of doing that. Building Schools for the Future was quite extraordinary: £40bn investment without any cost-benefit analysis at all.\" As for class sizes, if they were cut from 30 to 20, the average pupil would gain four months' learning a year. But classes of 20 would mean recruiting an extra 150,000 teachers to English schools and, assuming they were all weaker than those we now have, pupil progress would fall by five months a year. Wiliam regularly trots out statements like that, and you wonder how he can possibly be so sure, but he's a mathematician with a PhD in psychometrics and he's looked through hundreds of pieces of research, so I suppose we have to take his word for it. Instead of relying on grandiose policy initiatives, Wiliam argues, we should be raising teachers' skill levels. By that, he doesn't mean recruiting better-qualified teachers, since the correlation between qualifications and effectiveness is close to zero. Nor does he mean weeding out a small minority of \"incompetent teachers\", which wouldn't affect most children's education. The trick is to raise everybody's game. So the most cost-effective improvements, he argues, are cheap, low-tech changes that will improve teachers' lessons – and this was the main message of the TV programme, which reported that, after a term of Wiliam's interventions, results were up in English and maths. Take that most common of all classroom scenes: the teacher asks a question and children put their hands up. The answers, Wiliam points out, always come from the same pupils, and the teacher has no idea whether the others understand anything. \"Hands up\" should be banned. Instead, advises Wiliam, use lollipop sticks; write a child's name on each and pick at random the one to answer the question. Or tell all pupils to hold up answers on mini-whiteboards, which will give you a snapshot of how the whole class is doing. Or hand out green, amber and red paper cups, which children can hold up to show that they understand what you're telling them, find it difficult or haven't a clue what you're on about. As for the morning exercise, US research shows it improves attention and learning throughout the day. Above all, teachers should stop awarding grades each time children hand in work. Instead, they should make constructive comments and ensure children read and act on them. \"We're addicted to grades,\" Wiliam says. \"I've nothing against grades at the end of the school year. But telling students, after every piece of work, that they're at levels 5, 6 or whatever is bizarre, perverse. The national curriculum levels were meant to be descriptions of the totality of achievement over an entire key stage, not judgments on individual pieces of work.\" Assessment, he explains, should be part of a conversation with pupils that helps teachers to decide where lessons should go next. It should be \"assessment for learning\" (AFL), not \"assessment of learning\". This view was first set out in 1998 in Inside the Black Box, co-authored by Wiliam with Professor Paul Black of King's College, London. (The black box is the classroom, into which policymakers feed inputs in the vague hope that a desirable output will emerge.) It declared that \"formative assessment\" (a term Wiliam prefers to the more commonly used AFL) would, at the minimum, raise pupils' GCSE scores by between one and two grades. Acclaimed in some quarters as the most important educational research report of the last 20 years, the self-published volume was an extraordinary bestseller, shifting 100,000 copies. It was really, as Wiliam puts it, \"a polemic with footnotes\" written, by the standards of educational research, in lucid and accessible language, almost like a political manifesto. After publication, Wiliam and Black addressed, between them, an estimated 50,000 teachers. They later produced a pack of AFL materials bought by a third of English secondary schools. But given the report's initial impact, the results were disappointing. What the authors envisaged was a transformation of teacher-pupil relations, in which the two would move towards being partners in learning. \"We were naive about how hard it is to change things in classrooms,\" admits Wiliam. \"The Labour government couldn't get their heads round it. We tried to get them to build these ideas into the numeracy and literacy strategies, but they just weren't interested. When they eventually picked it up, their take was simply that teachers should keep more records and track children's progress more carefully. So grading became part of everyday classroom life. It was nothing like what we intended.\" So Inside the Black Box led to something worse than before? \"Yes, yes.\" Wiliam, now 55, was born in north Wales and brought up as a monoglot Welsh-speaker. His father was a University of Wales lexicographer who coined new Welsh words for modern developments such as nuclear power stations, and also a BBC Wales newsreader. Only when Wiliam went to grammar school in Cardiff and later Manchester did he speak much English. His conversations with his father, who died two years ago, were always in Welsh, but today the accent is hardly noticeable. For most of his schooling, \"I was very average, badly behaved, a stammerer, incapable of writing legibly, and physically unco-ordinated, the sort who was always last when other boys chose teams\". Only in his later teens did a talent for maths emerge – he won the school maths prize for the best A-level results – and, after two years of weight-training, sufficient co-ordination to play rugby so well that he became house captain and carried on with the game until he was 42. His academic performance, however, did not greatly improve at Durham University, where he just scraped a pass degree. He spent far too much of his time, he admits, on his bass guitar. Like many graduates with mediocre degrees and few ambitions, he fell (his word) into teaching, first at a private school in Worcestershire and then in inner-London comprehensives. Meanwhile, his band, playing what it called \"jazz-folk\", gave occasional gigs in pubs. \"I hadn't realised how hard it is to make any kind of a living as a musician. If you get enough money to cover your petrol, you're lucky.\" So he gave up semi-professional music, dedicated himself to teaching (\"I was enjoying it more\") and, partly because he taught a \"shortage subject\", enjoyed a rapid rise. At his second London school, he became deputy head of maths and, when the head refused him a further promotion, he walked off to work on a research project at Chelsea College (later merged with King's) in London. It involved a scheme called Graded Assessment in Mathematics, an early version of formative assessment. A lectureship in mathematics education at King's followed, and Wiliam eventually became dean of the school of education and the college's assistant principal. In 2003, he moved to Princeton, New Jersey, to join the Educational Testing Service (ETS), the main producer of the multiple-choice tests which, Americans like to believe, eliminate the effects of social privilege and private coaching and guarantee purely meritocratic entry to higher education and many sought-after careers. ETS is an enormous, unimaginably rich corporation with a 376-acre campus and a staff of 2,700, administering 20 million exams a year worldwide. For an assessment specialist, it seemed a natural home. But the appointment, as senior research director, was not an unqualified success. He describes ETS as \"dysfunctional and bureaucratic\" and his work on developing a formative assessment package for American teachers ended \"somewhere in the bowels of the organisation\". He told his bosses that, if he was to make more impact, they would have to appoint him a vice-president. They demurred, and in 2006 Wiliam moved back to London and the Institute of Education. He stepped down from the deputy directorship last summer and now inhabits a small, cold, untidy office, full of unsorted files. He saw me between trips to Sweden and Norway and says cheerfully \"I've been far too busy to sort it out\". A colleague observed that he didn't care much for the minutiae of administration and \"he's probably happiest with his numbers and structures and figures\". Wiliam envisages a future as a freelance, self-financing academic. \"I can match my present salary on just 40 days' consultancy a year. Then I'll buy video equipment to shoot things in classrooms. I want to train students to do videos from the learner's point of view. I envisage students and teachers working collaboratively on school improvement, rather than treating it as something teachers do to students.\" He also hopes to do more work on \"teacher-based learning communities\", meeting monthly to discuss the development of formative assessment and related ideas. \"We're beginning to put together the right combinations of ideas and support for teachers. You can't do this kind of thing in initial teacher training; it involves high-level pedagogical skills, which you can develop only if you're controlling a classroom. I was talking to a teacher recently who, instead of putting comments on students' essays, wrote them on strips of paper, got the students in groups and then asked them to match the comments to the essays. A delightful twist, which re-engages students in their learning. I'm constantly surprised by teachers' ingenuity.\" I ask Wiliam if the advent of a Conservative-led government makes him more hopeful. After some hesitation, he replies: \"Yes. I've almost given up on policy because, for the past 20 years, policy has been relatively ineffective. But the difference between Labour and Conservatives is beautifully encapsulated in the 1988 Education Reform Act, where there is a self-denying ordinance: a statement that nothing in the Act should be construed as telling teachers how to teach. As soon as Labour got into power, you had Excellence in Schools saying setting should be the norm in secondary, and the literacy and numeracy strategies telling primary teachers how many bits their lessons should be divided into. It cost half a billion pounds for just one extra student to reach level 4 per primary school per year. \"I don't think this government will tie things down so tightly. There will be potential for better things to happen below the radar. That's why I'm optimistic.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2007/nov/08/nuclearpower.energy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2007-11-08T00:06:48Z","webTitle":"Clean-up of nuclear power stations in disarray","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/08/nuclearpower.energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2007/nov/08/nuclearpower.energy","fields":{"headline":"Clean-up of nuclear power stations in disarray","bodyText":"Plans to speed up the dismantling of Britain's atomic power stations were in disarray last night after the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority admitted it was slowing down the clean-up process owing to soaring costs and fuel reprocessing problems at Sellafield. One private clean-up company has already switched staff to a four-day week. In a separate development, shares in the country's main nuclear generator, British Energy, dropped 10% after it discovered more safety problems and could not say when four affected reactors would be brought back on stream. The problems will do little to create confidence in the nuclear industry at a time when the government needs to convince a sceptical public that new atomic plants might be needed to provide energy security for the UK. The NDA said it had been given an £8.5bn budget by the Treasury for the next three years - an increase of £671m compared with the last three years - but made clear that this was not enough to deal with a total clean-up bill that it now estimates at £73bn, 16% higher than 12 months ago. \"So the key strategic challenges now facing us are how do we address hazard reduction in a pressurised funding environment?\" the NDA asked in its business plan, before saying it would need to prioritise funds on the most complex and difficult sites, Sellafield and Dounreay. The NDA admitted its task was complicated by \"logistical issues\" at Sellafield which means it will not be possible to defuel the 11 Magnox stations within the original timetable. \"It is likely that the reprocessing of Magnox spent fuel at Sellafield, which was due to be completed by around 2012, will not be completed until 2016 or later,\" it explained. The difficulties have been spelled out just a few weeks after the NDA suspended the planned competition process to put out to private tender work on several reactors grouped together under a Magnox South licence. It denied that this was connected to funding problems. Nick Baldwin, the NDA's interim chairman, denied that it was a \"gloom and doom\" scenario facing the agency just two-and-a-half years after it was established with a mission to increase efficiency and speed up the national clean-up process. \"Its always possible to look at things with the glass half empty but we have a success here. We have had been given more money in a very tough spending round and while we had aspirations to accelerate the pace of decommissioning we are dealing safely and efficiently with one of the nation's most challenging issues,\" he explained. But the unions expressed anger at a situation which they fear will lead to hundreds of redundancies and destroy the UK's nuclear skills base. Mike Graham, general secretary of the biggest nuclear industry union, Prospect, said: \"The NDA's strategy is in tatters. This revised business plan reflects heavily on the problems but does not provide any solutions. It strongly promotes the idea of diverting monies from Magnox decommissioning sites to Sellafield high-hazard reduction, but does not deal with the consequences of such actions. \"The revised plan leaves Magnox hanging in the balance and risks losing the confidence of local stakeholders, for which industry has fought hard. There is no detailed examination of the cost of meeting the severance terms for employees on the sites where clean-up will be suspended, or recognition of how overall costs will soar for every year decommissioning is put on hold.\" Meanwhile British Energy said it had discovered a corroded wire in a reactor at its Heysham 1 plant similar to a problem discovered at a Hartlepool reactor last month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/feb/11/michael-white-older-care","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-11T22:56:35Z","webTitle":"Long-term care of the elderly and infirm splits the house","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/feb/11/michael-white-older-care","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/feb/11/michael-white-older-care","fields":{"headline":"Long-term care of the elderly and infirm splits the house","bodyText":"This week's prime minister's question time produced more broken glass than usual as Gordon Brown and David Cameron failed to resist the temptation to embarrass each other over an issue too serious for one-a-side political football: long-term care of the elderly and infirm. Does the spat make it much harder to achieve the cross-party consensus that heavyweight politicians know is needed to see a difficult policy safe into harbour through waves of voter disapproval and financial squalls? Yes, but it can be done eventually, as pension reform shows. As usual, the blame this week was shared, though fastidious MPs felt it was a bit rough of Cameron's campaign team to rush out gothic billboards, complete with graveyard \"RIP off\" headstones, to denounce what some bright spark decided to call \"Gordon Brown's death tax\": a reported £20,000 inheritance levy to pay for care. What was it about? Two related government initiatives, both stemming from last July's much-delayed green paper on options to sort out decent end-of-life care as Britain's large post-1945 baby boom generation – the demographic \"pig in the python\" – grows old. In September Brown rifled through a green paper from the health secretary, Andy Burnham, for a conference initiative. This resulted in the much-criticised personal care at home bill, now in the Lords. It promises free care at home for up to 280,000 of the neediest. But councils are uneasy about the cost. While Burnham fought to quell these doubts, he was also completing his public consultation on the July green paper, part of an exercise to build consensus on one option. In advance of the white paper, the result is due soon, but officials will not hint at it for fear of another Tory poster. In July focus groups pointed to a state insurance scheme with a £10,000-£12,000 voluntary opt-in. The real damage done at PMQs was on private consensus-seeking talks between Burnham, Andrew Lansley (his Tory successor-in-waiting) and Lib Dem Norman Lamb. Were the talks Lansley's naive-but-wholesome idea? Was he told the £20k option was a runner – or the opposite? Versions vary, but Labour is keen to blame Cameron's media rottweiler, Andy Coulson, for the \"death tax\" poster. Voters have seen all this before. Before the 1997 election the then-social security secretary, Peter Lilley, proposed replacing the fast-eroding state pension with a long-term fully-funded system. Serious stuff but, like Brown-Burnham today, a bit too close to election day. Privately sympathetic, the Labour opposition hesitated for 48 hours, then opened fire – as Cameron did at PMQs. Yet the pension crisis persisted. By 2006 Adair Turner had produced a report around which Blair and, more grudgingly, Brown, settled a package that now includes a higher pension age, a new contributory pension, and a restored link between basic pension and earnings (first floated by the Tory David Willetts). The opposition backed it. They often do; on the Northern Ireland peace process, on climate change (touch wood) and, slowly, on nuclear power. On ID cards and Heathrow's third runway they don't, though Lord Adonis has joined the Tories in backing high-speed trains. Europe? Don't even ask, though they managed it for the referendum in 1975."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/feb/06/iran-uranium-deal-us-sanctions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-06T14:49:00Z","webTitle":"US dismisses Iranian claims of nuclear agreement","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/06/iran-uranium-deal-us-sanctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/feb/06/iran-uranium-deal-us-sanctions","fields":{"headline":"US dismisses Iranian claims of nuclear agreement","bodyText":"Western officials have disputed claims by Iran's foreign minister that his country is \"approaching a final agreement\" in its nuclear programme. Manouchehr Mottaki told a security conference in Munich yesterday that Iran was \"serious\" about making progress on a deal agreed in principle last October to swap most of its enriched uranium stockpile for fuel rods to use in nuclear power stations. Governments in Europe and the US fear the stockpile could be refined to make nuclear weapons. But despite Mottaki's assurances, the US defence secretary, Robert Gates, today dismissed the idea that a deal was close and said it might be time to push forward with sanctions. \"The reality is they've done nothing to assure the international community\" or \"to stop their progress toward (building) a nuclear weapon,\" Gates said. \"And therefore various nations need to think about whether it is time for a different tack.\" Gates, who is in Ankara for talks with the Turkish government, said that in his discussions with Turkey and other allies he had sought to underscore the threat Iran poses to them. \"Iran is the only country in the region that has publicly declared its intent to destroy another country in the region,\" he said. If Iran proceeded with its nuclear programme \"unrestrained\", there was a \"real danger of proliferation\" that would destabilise region, he said. The German foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, whose country has joined the five permanent UN security council members in negotiations with Tehran, dismissed Mottaki's comments as nothing new. \"If it's not more than we heard yesterday, then we have to say unfortunately this is not a new transparency,\" Westerwelle said. \"It does not mean there is a change. That is the situation and we have to face it.\" Mottaki said Iran should set the amount of uranium that would be exchanged, suggesting that less than the 1,200kg of low enriched uranium provisionally agreed last year would be exported. Such a change could render any deal worthless in the eyes of western governments, for whom the whole point of the bargain was to deplete Iran's stockpile. Mottaki said today that he had a \"very good meeting\" about Iran's proposals with the new head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano, who is attending the Munich conference. The meeting came a few days after Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, raised the possibility of low enriched uranium being exported and returned within five months in the form of fuel rods. The president did not mention how much might be exported, and his offer was met with scepticism from western capitals, where it was seen as a gambit to buy time and forestall sanctions. Preliminary discussions have begun at the UN in New York on a further round of punitive measures aimed at Iranian individuals and institutions linked to the nuclear and missile programmes, and the Revolutionary Guards who control both. However, a security council resolution is seen as highly unlikely in the near future because of Chinese opposition. Speaking at the Munich conference, China's foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, made clear the country was prepared to stand alone among the permanent members of the security council in opposing sanctions. He insisted Iran had not closed the door on negotiations over the export of its uranium, and called for patience and \"a more flexible, pragmatic and proactive policy\" towards talks with Tehran. The EU foreign affairs chief, Catherine Ashton, said she agreed with the Chinese foreign minister that the possibilities of dialogue with Tehran were not exhausted, but added that \"dialogue takes two\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"climate-change-and-you/party-policies-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-16T14:19:39Z","webTitle":"Party policies on the environment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/climate-change-and-you/party-policies-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/climate-change-and-you/party-policies-environment","fields":{"headline":"Party policies on the environment","bodyText":"Individuals can agitate against climate change and act to mitigate its effects. But it's politicians who presently hold the purse strings and develop public policy frameworks. How've they been doing, and what are their plans for the future? The UK's Labour government boasts it has been at the forefront in the global fight to curb emissions. \"We have led the way internationally on climate change: we were the first to put climate change at the heart of the G8, the first to call a UN Security Council meeting on climate change, and the first to introduce a Climate Change Bill which binds the UK government by law to reduce carbon emissions by a third by 2020 and by 80% by 2050,\" it says. Result? UK CO2 emissions fell by 10.8 million tonnes last year (though the recession helped) and greenhouse gas emissions were 66 million tonnes lower than in 1997, the Government says. UK greenhouse gas emissions are now 21 per cent below 1990 levels, \"beating our Kyoto target.\" Acknowledging there's still much to be done, Labour says: \"Our ambition is to reduce our CO2 emissions by at least 20 per cent by 2020.\" How will this be achieved? Through a £100bn blueprint to triple renewable energy production to provide 30 per cent of electricity needs, up to 10 new nuclear power stations and the use of 'clean' fossil fuels – new coal driven power stations with built-in carbon capture and storage. These are \"the trinity of low carbon fuels of the future\" according to Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Milliband who recently unveiled for consultation six draft national energy policy statements. Linked to these, a controversial new Infrastructure Planning Commission has been created to fast-track major projects – a vital tool to avoid unnecessary and bureaucratic delay says the Government; a potential threat to local democracy according to critics. Then there's a target to make all new homes zero-carbon from 2016; five million households have already received help towards insulation with plans to aid five million more, while recycling has quadrupled since 1997. A 'waste strategy' for England should deliver reductions in greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to at least 9.3 million tonnes of CO2 per year by 2020. Britain now has more offshore wind capacity than any country in the world, says Labour. Last year it provided electricity for 2m homes, with more on and off-shore sites planned. And 100m low energy light bulbs are being distributed and other energy saving products will be provided to 4 million homes, while businesses with an energy bill of more £1m a year must comply with new legislation to reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency (The Carbon Reduction Commitment) from next year. Carbon reporting will be mandatory for many firms from 2012. However, international carbon 'cap and trade' schemes backed by all main parties and aimed at curbing industrial emissions are ineffective and possibly sowing the seeds of future financial crashes, according to Friends of the Earth. Meanwhile, the Government has pledged that emissions from aviation will not be above 2005 levels in 2050 and has allocated £250m to hasten the arrival of electric cars, although the chairman of the government's own Climate Change Commission Adair Turner said the CCC wants £800m of public money invested in a network of charging points. Lord Turner also believes that it will cost between £10,000 and £15,000 to turn each existing household into energy-efficient, low-carbon units. The Government says: \"In the teeth of a recession we had a budget which found £1.4bn for new investment in developing a low carbon economy. More than 20 per cent of public investment since last November has been on sustainable and green projects and more than 1.2 million people will be in 'green jobs' by 2020.\" Looking ahead to the UN's December climate change meeting in Copenhagen, Ed Miliband says: \"The stakes couldn't be higher.\" He wants a deal to limit climate change to 2 degrees by ensuring global greenhouse gas emissions peak and start to reduce by 2020, with strong monitoring, reporting and verification guaranteed, while support is given to the poorest countries to cut emissions and adapt to climate change. In Scotland, talk of the Copenhagen meeting is like a red rag to a bull. The ruling Scottish National Party – it steered through the Scottish Parliament a Climate Change Bill which a target of an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050 with an interim target of 42% reduction by 2020 – is campaigning for a Scottish Minister to be part of the UK delegation in Denmark. SNP MSP Shirley-Anne Somerville said: \"Our bill is world-leading and it is achievable but there must be an international agreement that ambitious targets must be set. It is ridiculous that despite the example Scotland has set to the world the UK Government refuses to allow a Scottish Minister to join the delegation.\" The SNP opposes any extension of nuclear power, arguing that Scotland has the natural resources (including wind and wave-driven power plants) to generate clean, green energy. And a state-backed community project, PURE, on the Shetland Island of Unst, has produced among other pioneering work a hydrogen-charged electric car as an alternative or supplement to Lord Turner's plans. \"The creation of an infrastructure to refuel road vehicles with hydrogen means that there will be a realistic alternative to petrol and diesel,\" says SNP MSP Rob Gibson. \"The prospect of a 'Hydrogen Corridor' between Aberdeen and Inverness is an exciting first for Scotland and the UK.\" Like the SNP, The Liberal Democrats are also opposed to any extension of the nuclear programme although their 2009 Conference did pass an amendment recognising that 'clean coal' would be part of the planet's energy sources. However, Liberal Democrats alone dare to talk openly about so-called 'green taxes', albeit in the form of inducements. They will create 'real incentives' for businesses and individuals to go green. \"Through our green tax switch and changes in general demand, environmentally friendly technology can become a booming market.\" On Transport, Liberal Democrats propose a Future Transport Fund to invest in a UK-wide high speed rail network; to work with the EU to introduce steadily-tougher mandatory vehicle emissions targets with zero-carbon emission for all new cars by 2040; to require at least 10 per cent of all transport fuels to come from renewable sources by 2015 and to ensure that the UK emissions target in the Climate Change Bill includes aviation and shipping. Energy proposals include the production of bio-gas energy from waste while \"we will invest in a Grid upgrade to provide incentives for massive expansion of renewable projects in the North Sea.\" Predicting that current Government policy could soon lead to power cuts for the first time since the 1970s, The Conservative Party says: \"With our energy supplies increasingly sourced overseas, and with urgent action needed to combat climate change, it's time to rethink the way we supply and consume energy in Britain.\" The answer, say the Tories, is urgently to move to a low-carbon economy \"in order to strengthen our economy, help guarantee our energy security and protect our environment for future generations.\" So any future Conservative Government pledges to make the development of renewable and low carbon energy sources a priority. The Tories plan to create 'a decentralised energy revolution' by introducing a system of 'feed-in tariffs' to encourage the micro-generation of electricity. This would be accomplished by transforming electricity networks using 'smart grid' and 'smart meter' technology that automatically matches supply and demand, \"allowing a huge increase in renewable power.\" This would be coupled with an expansion of offshore wind and marine power which would see government backing for a network of large-scale Marine Energy Parks. There are also pledges of up to £6,500-worth of home insulation improvements, enabling households to reduce their gas and electricity bills, not to mention emissions. The Conservatives will only permit coal-fired power stations to be built with clean carbon capture and storage technology and while nuclear power will be part of the energy mix, \"it is not an alternative to developing and expanding renewable forms of energy.\" Regarding transport, the Tories say they will cancel all moves to a third runway at Heathrow; deliver a national recharging network to boost greener driving choices and the switch to electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, while ushering in a \"high speed rail revolution.\" Looking ahead to Copenhagen, Shadow Energy and Climate Change Secretary Greg Clark recently told the House of Commons: \"It is vital that a clear message goes out from the UK that there is complete unity of purpose between the British Government and the Conservative Party in securing a deal that is fair, ambitious and binding.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2010/oct/28/fiver-newcastle-manchester-united-michael-owen","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-28T15:23:05Z","webTitle":"The Fiver | The Newcastle Library of the Society of Literature and Philosophy | Barry Glendenning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/28/fiver-newcastle-manchester-united-michael-owen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2010/oct/28/fiver-newcastle-manchester-united-michael-owen","fields":{"headline":"Paranormal Activity, and Michael Owen","bodyText":"DON'T SCOFF, NEWCASTLE REALLY DOES HAVE A LIBRARY OF THE SOCIETY OF LITERATURE AND PHILOSOPHY According to some of the foremost ghost-hunting opportunists in north-east England, the Newcastle Library of the Society of Literature and Philosophy is haunted by at least 16 tortured phantoms. Whether the spirits' anguish was caused by Kevin Nolan's defunct-but-not-forgotten column on the BBC website is not known, but the spook-stalkers' website, for its part, does detail some of the symptoms of paranormal activity that have occurred in the library: \"Sounds of pages being turned and footsteps when there is no one there have been reported by numerous witnesses,\" quiver the hunters, and it cannot be denied that witnesses being present to notice there's no one there is very strange. \"The feeling of been [sic] watched from the balconies when you enter the second floor of the library,\" continue the intrepid hunters, is \"an unnerving feeling when you are alone in the women's reading room.\" So, some women in Newcastle are being furtively ogled from behind bookshelves? Yep, it's got to be ghosts. All the same, if you ask the Fiver, far more inexplicable phenomena are currently afoot in the north-east. Consider, for example, the persistent rumours that Chris Hughton is on the verge of the sack, and may, despite denials from the club last night, be cast out of St James' Park as early as this weekend if Newcastle lose to their bitter candy-striped neighbours, Sunderland. There are two puzzlers here: firstly, if it is true that some loons connected with the Toon want Hughton to go, where are they going to find the supernatural being it would take to do a better job than Hughton has done in guiding the team first to promotion and then a creditable start to their first campaign back in the top flight, including a 6-0 demolition of Aston Villa and an away League Cup win over Chelsea? Secondly, consider this. Middlesbrough have just replaced a manager who previously excelled at the Queen's Celtic with a manager who was the biggest flop in Glasgow since alcohol-free beer. Sunderland are managed by a gaffer who has led the team to just 17 wins in his 54 matches in charge and is so inspirational that the club's captain asked to leave last summer, a key signing hasn't figured out how to play for 90 minutes without copping a red card and no way can be found to squeeze the most expensive striker in the club's history into a regular starting position even though they never score. Which leads to the obvious question: how is Hughton the most beleaguered manager in the north-east? QUOTE OF THE DAY \"We're ready. Why not?\" - the most recent report of a Spurs victory at Old Trafford may have appeared on the Bayeux Tapestry, but Luka Modric remains confident his side can get a result this weekend. OWEN'S GOALS Possibly because he never plays football any more, Michael Owen has been busy promoting his many good works for charidee ... not that he likes to talk about them. While emphatically not talking to Big Paper about the millions of different ways he's been helping the children, he basically admits he's over the hill, has been for the best part of a decade and that he doesn't mind never playing at all ever so long as the club paying his wages wins most of the time, but would absolutely and definitely draw the line at having to never play at all ever for a club that isn't doing so well. It was in an interview with Five Live, however, that Owen made perhaps his most telling comment, during a broadcast in which he defended himself, his teammates and indeed his profession in general. \"People like to judge footballers as a whole but I think that's pretty unfair,\" he said. Well of course he does, because anyone judging Owen as a whole would have to conclude that he's basically useless, while anyone judging Owen just in part – say, leaving his hamstrings to one side – could possibly decide that he's the single greatest striker of the last 20 years. He might potentially get nudged off that particular podium by Fat Brazilian Ronaldo, who using the same rules can be judged without reference to his knees and is thus the second most amazing player in the entire history of the game. Neither of them can however hold a candle to the overall best player of all time (with inconvenient body part or parts discounted), Joey Barton, who is perhaps only a few disconnected synapses away from the global ambassadorship for the sport that many people, particularly in the Barton household, consider his rightful destiny. If only he didn't have a brain he ... hang on ... er ... nope, we appear to have found a flaw in this argument. WIN! WIN! WIN!

It prophesied \"behind-closed-doors politics, indecision, weak government, a paralysed economy and yet another election within the calendar year.\" Yesterday in a chilly Downing Street rose garden, with Sarah Brown's vegetables in the corner the only reminder of the ancien régime, Cameron embraced the concept of coalition politics not as a grudging encumbrance but an entirely inspiring form of new consensual politics. The prime minister's performance yesterday did not feel like an act as he waxed ever more lyrically about the joys of working in partnership with his new flatmate, Nick Clegg. Cameron even came close to forming a new party, saying he was leading \"a Liberal Conservative government\". If the personal chemistry between the two men had got any more intense, there might have been an explosion. In a play on a joke once cracked by Tony Blair, a Conservative quipped afterwards: \"If I was Samantha, I would worry David is going to run off with the man next door.\" Although formally the junior partner, Clegg did not behave as the minor figure. Indeed, he spoke for longer than Cameron in their two opening statements. Often their remarks were interchangeable, as neither man did anything to rein in expectations of what they thought they could achieve together. In the only sign of division between the two parties, the two leaders' spin teams operated separately afterwards. Cameron – befitting a man on his first day in a new house, and undertaking a new job – was beyond expansive in his opening remarks: \"Today we are not just announcing a new government and new ministers. We are announcing a new politics. A new politics where the national interest is more important than party interest. Where co-operation wins out over confrontation. Where compromise, give and take, reasonable, civilised, grown-up behaviour is not a sign of weakness but of strength. \"One of the biggest problems of the last few years has been a chronic short-termism in government. With this coalition agreement we've got five years to think about the long term and to make the big decisions about our country's future. And that is the true significance of this new coalition. It can be a historic and seismic shift in our political landscape. This is the first coalition government for 65 years.\" Clegg was equally determined to argue that British adversarial politics was at an end. \"We have been through a campaign: now we have a coalition. Until today, we have been rivals: now we are colleagues,\" he said. \"That says a lot about the scale of the new politics which is now beginning to unfold. This is a new government and a new kind of government.\" He then made a first stab at defining Cam-Cleggism. \"You can call it fairness. You can call it responsibility. You can call it liberalism.\" In his first reply to gentle media questioning, Cameron explained how in the wake of the election, and the failure to secure a majority, he had wrestled in private discussions with Clegg over whether to go for a coalition, or simply work on the basis that Cameron would operate a minority administration, with Clegg's party giving an undertaking to support the Queen's speech and the budget. Cameron then gave a long, passionate soliloquy that his predecessor would never have delivered in a million years. Discussing the idea of running a minority administration, he said: \"We talked about it extensively, and we had a meeting about it over the past couple of days. \"We said: 'This is so uninspiring. We can do it – it might last for a month, or six months, or a year, or maybe a bit longer. But it is not actually going to do what we came into politics to achieve: to give the country good government, to sort out the problems of the deficit and the debt.' \"This would not have done anything. It might have put me in there [pointing to No 10], but it would not actually mean anything. We both just looked at each other, and said: 'This is really uninspiring. Let's aim for something bigger and better.' \" The duo eventually were asked about the detailed policy agreement but came under no pressure on how much they differed on issues such as tuition fees, a British bill of rights, nuclear power, marriage tax, Trident, immigration or the scale of schools reform. There were few – if any – sticky moments. Electoral reform? Cameron dived in: \"I've made very clear my views about our electoral system and about proportional representation. But I feel it was right, given the result, given the need for strong and stable government, to make the important concession of saying that we should have a referendum on the alternative vote system.\" It was only at the end that Cameron finally put a brake on the love affair, acknowledging that the two parties were not going to merge. Drawing on his large knowledge of European politics, Clegg said that if their experiment worked people would find coalition politics relatively unsurprising, relatively quickly. And after the tumult of the last month or more, who in British politics could dare to argue with that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2009/nov/13/corrections-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-13T00:05:23Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/nov/13/corrections-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2009/nov/13/corrections-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• A photograph with David Conn's Inside sport column did not show Hull City fans watching their team as the caption suggested.

The results were treated with scepticism by green campaigners who pulled out of the process last week. Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, WWF and the Green Alliance are among the groups accusing the government of a \"public relations stitch-up\". The government has already been forced to repeat the consultation after the high court ruled in February that a previous study had been \"seriously flawed\" and \"manifestly inadequate and unfair\". Now the environment coalition is considering taking the matter back to court, a move which could severely delay a decision on the future of nuclear power. Nine meetings held over the weekend were part of the consultation to determine whether ministers can push ahead with plans to build a new generation of nuclear power stations. Of 1,000 people surveyed at the meetings across the UK, 46% supported the continued use of nuclear energy, with 25% opposed the plan. However, the dangers of nuclear power still appear to be at the forefront of public concern, with 89% of people worried about safety and 92% alarmed at the prospect of creating more nuclear waste. The business and enterprise secretary, John Hutton, said: \"We have a preliminary view: that nuclear should be able to play a part in providing the energy that we need to keep the lights on and help cut carbon emissions.\" More detailed results from the meetings in Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Exeter, Liverpool, London, Newcastle and Norwich, are expected early this week. The consultation ends on October 10. Neil Crumpton, nuclear representative for Friends of the Earth, said: \"There are good options in terms of renewable energy but these were not in the presentations and the delegates were not exposed to them. We were never able to put our side of the case across.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/apr/04/scientific-responsibility-nuclear-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-04T21:00:00Z","webTitle":"Science's nuclear responsibility | Martin Rees and Des Browne","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/04/scientific-responsibility-nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/04/scientific-responsibility-nuclear-weapons","fields":{"headline":"Science's nuclear responsibility","bodyText":"This week Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev will sign a new strategic arms reduction treaty. Since the US and Russia own 95% of the world's nuclear weapons, the signing of this treaty is the most significant step towards nuclear arms reduction since the original document was signed in 1991. Despite this advance, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty is under increasing pressure. Nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation are firmly back at the top of the political agenda and their importance at this time cannot be overestimated. Every country has a responsibility to contribute towards disarmament efforts, strengthening the non-proliferation regime and ensuring our nuclear security. At the same time, we also face the spread of nuclear technology as growing numbers of states harness the use of civil nuclear power for their increasing energy demands. States that can enrich uranium and reprocess spent fuel can more readily acquire the capability to create a nuclear weapon, so a truly international and non-discriminatory regulatory system is urgently needed to govern these technologies. We would argue that since scientists helped to create nuclear weapons, the scientific community today has a profound responsibility to help reduce and ultimately disarm them. Governmental co-operation with scientists is essential if we are to ensure that the spread in nuclear expertise does not introduce new dangers and instabilities that could undermine nuclear disarmament. At this relatively early stage on the road to nuclear disarmament, the most effective way for scientists to fulfil this responsibility is to ensure that their advice is heard by policymakers. Likewise, policymakers need to ensure they listen to this advice and act upon it. Investing in the necessary research would pay huge diplomatic dividends and provide concrete evidence of nuclear-weapon states taking seriously their obligations to pursue disarmament. The scientific community often works beyond national boundaries on problems of common interest, making it ideally placed to facilitate the widening of discussions beyond Russia and the US to prepare the groundwork for future negotiations that will include China, France and the UK. Science diplomacy like this will play a decisive role in an area where international relations are greatly complicated by political and historical considerations. We in the UK need to take advantage of the wealth of British scientific expertise in this area, following the example of the US. At the end of last year the Jason group in the US, a body of independent scientists, produced a report, Life Extension Options for the US Nuclear Weapons Stockpile. It looked at the ways in which the US could ensure the security and reliability of its nuclear arsenal without testing or developing new warheads, at the same time as confirming their scientific and technical viability. This assessment allowed Obama to speak with confidence and clarity when setting out his vision for a world free of nuclear weapons. The timescale for complete nuclear disarmament will be long, and focusing on the detailed challenges of the final stages may be premature. But the scientific community can make an immediate practical contribution by developing technologies to monitor whether countries are complying with their disarmament obligations. International co-operation can help build much needed trust between states, and help catalyse the political conditions necessary for multilateral disarmament. For this reason, the Royal Society recently embarked on a project to evaluate the potential risks a nuclear renaissance may pose and how they should be managed. It will include assessing the potential of new technologies and new governance to make nuclear technology more resistant to proliferation. The international community is debating various proposals for placing uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing capabilities under international control. This would be a crucial element of a comprehensive system needed to help verify a ban of all nuclear weapons, and it cannot be implemented without the full co-operation of the scientific community. One year ago today Obama proclaimed \"America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons\". While this week's treaty signing may give cause for hope, there is still a long way to go on the road to multilateral nuclear disarmament. The scientific community has a critical role to play in this journey. Despite recent successes, as the Harvard professor Graham Allison recently reminded us, \"the global nuclear order may be as fragile today as the global financial system was a few years ago [but if the non-proliferation regime collapses] there will be no bailout\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2007/sep/09/energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2007-09-08T23:06:06Z","webTitle":"City meetings debate nuclear power merits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/sep/09/energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2007/sep/09/energy","fields":{"headline":"City meetings debate nuclear power merits","bodyText":"More than 1,000 people, selected as a cross-section of the British public, gathered in nine cities yesterday to debate the merits of nuclear power.

He's an Oxford professor and a former head of research at the World Bank, as well as being a UN and British government adviser. He is an authority on war and democracy, he has addressed the UN general assembly and has given a seminar at 10 Downing Street. His previous book, The Bottom Billion, a provocative look at the economics of the poorest, was lauded by US treasury secretary Larry Summers and billionaire George Soros. In short, Collier now sits on the top shelf of intellectual big cheeses – a ripe Stilton in the larder of the global liberal establishment. Like most orthodox economists, he was trained as a utilitarian. His instinct is to be suspicious of environmentalists. Now, global events and the emerging politics of climate change have led him to try to make sense of man's rapidly changing relationship with the natural world. It is an area that desperately needs exploring but I fear that his ideas on how we should live in the new world of climate change and resource pressure are inadequate and grim. His first premise is simple, if dull: economists and environmentalists must come together because they are on the same side in a war that is being lost. His second is contentious – that economic sustainability need not imply preservation and that economic growth is not an enemy. His third is unproven and I suspect wrong: that the world will inevitably starve if we try to achieve harmony with nature; and his last is politically dangerous – a set of neo-liberal economic proposals that seems to boil down to the poorest countries having to open themselves up for exploitation further and faster, and take responsibility for the climate change which they did not cause. If only Collier had stuck to straight climate economics like Lord Nicholas Stern, or to new ecological research like the Indian Pavan Sukhdev. What we get is a regurgitation of the politically convenient opinions of rich governments and institutions who fete him. And the further he blunders through the thickets of science into the ethics of resource depletion, the more he reveals the greed that grips the liberal establishment when it comes to nature. His messianic championing of GM foods and global agribusiness could be written by the US department of agriculture; his belief that nuclear power is \"completely carbon free\" is plain wrong; his proposal that \"commercial\" or \"scientific\" farming replace smallholders to provide more food is socially and ecologically dubious; and his big idea that the UN should be given control of fish stocks and should then auction them back to fishermen to sell is . . . well, barmy. Here is a man who works in the interests of Africa yet whose utilitarian instincts offer little hope for its 50m pastoralists and the 200m who depend on growing crops and cattle. He has no faith in the great mass of peasants because they are inefficient food producers; he argues that the continent needs many more mega-cities like Lagos because people in them are \"more productive\", yet he does not consider the reality of life in them. The world's 400m marginalised indigenous peoples get one line. Instead, he fears African countries are so corrupt they will deliberately destroy their own economies to ensure they get more climate change money. Indeed, the core of his argument is that Africa's problem is not so much that it has suffered \"resource curse\" or been plundered for its resouces, as that only around 20% of its assets may have been exploited so far. The suspicion that we may be dealing with an ecological outrider interested largely in justifying business as usual is compounded by Collier's assertion that the total depletion of a non-renewable natural resources is not intrinsically an economic sin \"because the ethics of depletion depends on how the money generated gets used\". By this weird argument, it's OK to trash the earth if the money earned from doing so is used to colonise other planets. But Collier – he thankfully sees the irony of his ancestors being coalminers – is so keen to address climate change that he trips himself up and makes elementary mistakes. He makes no distinction between energy and electricity or carbon and carbon dioxide. He twice says the Himalayas – as opposed to the glaciers – may melt; he wrongly claims that \"all minerals can only be used once\"; and he erroneously states that polar territories are not assigned to any nation. When he says that it's impossible to \"scale up\" solar or wind power, the average power company will despair. We know what he means, but for a leading academic, it's sloppy and it undermines his other arguments. Even worse are his northern prejudices and perjorative asides. \"People will not bother to plant trees on land they do not own\" is nonsense; \"rural bliss is precarious, isolated and tedious\" is deeply patronising; \"sometimes Nature does not respect frontiers\" is rubbish; and who exactly are these \"environmental romantics [who] are perversely gleeful about global warming\"? Collier seems to have no knowledge of the benefits of conservation, and his lumping together of environmentalists as \"Prince Charles-type romantics\" is wilfully ignorant. This book will be taken seriously because it represents state-of-the-art liberal establishment economic thinking. But I fear Collier's recipes for economic growth are mainly in the interests of folk like him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/02/copenhagen-climate-change-science","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-12-02T21:00:01Z","webTitle":"Enough posturing politics.

Time to let the experts lead","bodyText":"We can only marvel at the disarray. Here we are, 17 years after the signing of the UN framework convention on climate change, two years after the decision in Bali to agree a new climate policy, one year after Barack Obama's election, and days out from the Copenhagen conference. Yet a real global strategy to avoid catastrophe remains elusive. Yes, there is some progress. The Obama administration has now offered a 2020 and 2050 target on emissions reduction. China and India have stepped forward with commitments to slow the rise of emissions, and Mexico has tabled creative proposals for climate financing. New technologies offer the possibility of low-cost abatement of greenhouse gas emissions. Through the fog of policy speeches, international meetings and domestic debates, one can begin to see a path to a low-carbon economy. The mayhem, however, is at least as great. Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere continue to mount, and will do so for years or decades to come. The Wall Street Journal, America's biggest circulation paper, rails each day against climate science. Backroom deals in the US Congress with industrial lobbies threaten to eviscerate already watered-down proposals for limiting carbon emissions. A vote on the US legislation has been postponed till next spring at the earliest, and a similar bill has just been defeated in Australia. The truth is that even if we reach a political agreement, we're not yet on track to achieve practical, significant and sustained progress. Whether it's the US debate that ricochets among activists, deniers and lobbyists, or the global debate – which veers between empty agreements and bitter finger-pointing – we've somehow turned a life-and-death challenge into a scrum. After Copenhagen, which probably will be concluded with a patch-up accord, it will be vital to change paths from the one we've been on essentially since before Kyoto in 1997. We've debated for years about who should control emissions, by how much, when, and according to binding or non-binding commitments. Yet we can't settle these issues without also getting into the details about the deployment of low-carbon technologies, social behaviours and the quantitative realities of energy systems, transport technologies, food production, water scarcity, and population trends. We will continue to go around in circles until we are much more systematic in bringing scientific and engineering realities to the table. Our negotiations need much greater grounding in our true options and their costs. These issues are tough and complex. Each nation's plausible choices depend on what technologies will be available and when. It's pretty vacuous to spend a couple of years debating whether the emissions target for 2020 should fall by 20%, 30%, or 40% compared with 1990, or perhaps 2005, without knowing how and with what extra costs and disruptions such targets might be achievable. We will need, in short, a lot more brainstorming than negotiation, at least until the world's plausible options and trade-offs come into view. When can low-carbon power plants truly be brought online? When will electric vehicles be ready for mass sales? Will carbon capture really work and if so, where? Which countries and regions within them have the right kind of geology to store carbon underground, and who is going to monitor it? Dare we advocate a massive revival of the nuclear power industry, in a world fraught with nuclear proliferation? During two years of lead-up to Copenhagen, the official negotiations never gave a place for such questions to be posed, much less answered. Here, then, is a proposal for the post-Copenhagen attempt to square up national and global policies so they add up to something more than more years of empty promises. Let's start by recognising that most of the human-made crisis emerges from a few pivotal human activities: how and what we grow to eat; how we mobilise and distribute energy; how we transport ourselves and our freight; and how we build our buildings and lay out our cities. Each related sector requires its own intensive strategy – to identify the kind of research and development activities, public infrastructure investments and public policy to accompany a positive price on carbon emissions, through permits or taxes. Countries would have a lot to share – for instance in new technological options – and a lot that would distinguish them, according to geography, resource base, development level, and more. We have spent a lot of time debating the merits of tradable permits versus taxation but have failed to understand that operational policies must go far beyond either instrument. The future of nuclear power, for instance, depends not so much on tradable permits as on issues of safety, reliability, and risks of proliferation or terrorism. Similarly emissions trading may eventually spur the use of carbon capture and sequestration, but only after several such plants have been tried on the public expense, to investigate the real engineering and costs of possible technologies, and the real feasibility of safe, long-term storage in geological sites. The scale-up of solar and wind power will depend on land use choices, the future of the power grid, and the ability to store power. The costs of these approaches can only be judged after more thorough testing and analysis. Thus the side payments that rich countries will have to make to poor ones to adopt such technologies can't yet be determined precisely. When the EU or any country announces their contribution to the poorer countries in Copenhagen, the number will be pulled out of the hat, and probably far too low. It's past time to do any of the real financial homework. Perhaps it's no surprise we are stuck. Climate change is the most complicated issue the world has faced. Complex – but not hopeless. It's time to put the expertise at the front table, not to supplant public debate and discussion but finally to inform it. Copenhagen should be the end of negotiation by politicians with technical issues kept in the shadows or ignored. Let's get scientists, engineers and ordinary citizens involved in a true discussion about our common future, and especially the tradeoffs, costs and choices. Together we can prove that our world is still capable of reaching long-range agreements when our children's lives and wellbeing hang in the balance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2010/jun/29/green-investment-bank-low-carbon-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-29T17:51:50Z","webTitle":"Government commission urges rapid setting up of green investment bank","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/29/green-investment-bank-low-carbon-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/jun/29/green-investment-bank-low-carbon-economy","fields":{"headline":"Government commission urges rapid setting up of green investment bank","bodyText":"Scores of government-backed organisations face being swallowed by a new UK green investment bank , under radical proposals announced today. Billions of pounds that are being spent by disparate quangos and officials funds should instead be ploughed into an eco-bank, a group of leading financial and environmental experts recommended. The green investment bank commission argued that cutting the number of state-funded green bodies would \"radically improve\" the task of cutting the nation's carbon output – an area where Britain continues to lag behind official targets. The commission was led by former Merrill Lynch chairman Bob Wigley. It warned that the scale of the looming crisis means that the government needs to rapidly set up a bank to fund Britain's low-carbon future, ideally within the next six months. \"The scale of the investment required to meet UK climate change and renewable energy targets is unprecedented, and of a size not seen since the post world war two reconstruction,\" warned the commission, which was set up by George Osborne last year when in opposition. The government has estimated that building the new low-carbon infrastructure that the UK needs will cost £550bn between now and 2020. The total bill over the next 20 years could hit £1tn. Wigley's team have named three quangoes with an annual budget of £185m to be folded into a green investment bank (GIB) - the Carbon Trust, the Energy Technologies Institute, and the low carbon wing of the Technology Strategy Board. They also have their eye on six government funds with a total budget of £2bn. In their 50-page report, which was welcomed by the government, they say that these nine groups have been \"initially identified\", indicating that the bank could go hunting through the \"quango jungle\" for more organisations to \"rationalise\" as its first tranche of funding runs out. Wigley strenuously denied that he was keen to abolish the Carbon Trust, which helps businesses cut their CO2 output. \"The opposite is the case. Some of the best ideas in this report come from the Carbon Trust, and I hope they could be at the heart of a green investment bank,\" Wigley said. The Carbon Trust's chief executive, Tom Delay, said he was \"pleased to see the Wigley report has incorporated our ideas to increase private sector investment.\" And he pledged to work closely with the government as it formulates its plans. Today's report also appeared to put pressure on Osborne as he works towards this autumn's comprehensive spending review (CSR), by warning that the task of setting up a GIB needs to begin immediately. The government said the report was \"a very important piece of work.\" \"We are totally committed to working towards a low carbon economy in a way that underpins the global competitiveness of the UK,\" said Gregory Barker, minister of state for climate change. \"We see a Green Investment Bank as a very important part of a transition that puts the UK at the forefront of green technology,\" he added. Alistair Darling proposed setting up a green investment bank in his 2010 budget. Under his plan, it would have been capitalised with £2bn, a small fraction of what Wigley's team believe is needed. The present government has also pledged to create a GIB, but Barker emphasised that these plans will not be announced until after the CSR on October 20. This may grate with the Commission's recommendation that the Bank's chairman should ideally be appointed in August, with the rest of the board in place before November. Wigley ruled himself out of running the bank as chief executive, but indicated that he might be open to a \"part-time board role such as chairman\". Analysts have warned that the uncertainty over the government's plans for a Green Bank may actually be hindering the flow of funding, with potential investors staying on the sidelines until the situation becomes clearer. Financial firepower Wigley is convinced that the private banking alone cannot provide the financial firepower needed to meet the UK's carbon reduction targets. Under the commission's blueprint, a GIB would be made up of two parts – a banking division to encourage and nurture private investment, and a funding arm which would allocate grants, loans and subsidies to low carbon schemes. Together, they would help generate and spend the £50bn a year needed to fund clean energy projects, from building new wind farms to making the nation's homes and offices energy efficient. Only some of the funding would come from existing quangos. The rest could come from the sale of bonds to leading investors such as pension funds to finance long-term projects, while individuals could be offered 'Green Isas'. A levy could also be placed on energy bills, and money from the sale of assets such as the Channel Tunnel rail link could also be handed to the GIB. While the government would not underwrite projects, the Bank might tempt developers to invest in ecological projects by guaranteeing them a fixed income, removing the fear that a change of official policy could suddenly render a scheme uneconomical. Wigley is confident there would be demand for long-term bonds to fund capital-intensive projects such as a wind farm. \"Once it is built, the additional running costs and risk are limited. The wind is unlikely to stop blowing,\" Wigley pointed out. However, as the Guardian reported this week, the proportion of power delivered from renewable sources in the UK fell last year – partly due to low wind speeds. Wigley also suggested that the building of new nuclear power stations could fall within the remit of the bank, as could installing a network of power points across the country for electric vehicles. The commission's report received broad backing from the City and environmental groups. Hugh Savill, acting Director of Investment Affairs at the Association of British Insurers, said a Green Investment Bank could help direct long-term funding into eco projects. \"As investors, insurers have an appetite for long term instruments to match their liabilities. Provided the details are right, targeting bond issues at insurers' long term investment horizons will encourage more partnership between insurers and government,\" said Savill.\" The British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association also gave its support. \"This marks the next step in implementing a well-designed Green Investment Bank that will facilitate and accelerate private sector investment and build public support for reaching Britain's low carbon, renewable energy and energy security targets,\" said Simon Walker, chief executive of the BVCA.

It is about remembering the sacrifices of 1948 and later wars, marking national achievements, nostalgia – and having fun. But this year's is not the happiest of anniversaries: the hottest talking point of recent days is that former prime minister Ehud Olmert is suspected of involvement in a huge corruption scandal when he was mayor of Jerusalem. Controversy is raging too over the arrest of a young woman accused of a damaging security leak ‑ about the army's killing of wanted Palestinian militants ‑ to the liberal Haaretz newspaper, a row that underlines profound differences between right and left over media freedoms and patriotism. Prospects for what is still called the \"peace process\" with the Palestinians have never been so poor, while Barack Obama's determination to force a resolution of the conflict is unsettling to a country long used to near-unqualified support from Washington. \"Obama doesn't understand Israelis,\" is a common complaint. \"He's tough on the good guys but not the bad guys,\" is another. Binyamin Netanyahu's grudging and temporary West Bank settlement moratorium and US and Arab fury over plans to build housing units in East Jerusalem are stark reminders that the core issues remain as intractable as ever. Even if Obama's envoy, George Mitchell, does manage to start \"proximity\" talks, no one knows how direct negotiations can resume. Many Israelis worry more about the nuclear ambitions of Iran's Holocaust-denying president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. These are widely seen, and officially presented, as posing the greatest danger to the Middle East's only (though still unavowed) nuclear power. \"We face two cruel possibilities,\" the rightwing military expert Ya'akov Amidror commented in an eve-of-holiday newspaper article. \"Living with a nuclear Iran or setting the Middle East ablaze by attacking it.\" Officials and ordinary citizens complain of the \"de-legitimisation\" of the Jewish state. This comprises campaigns in Europe and the US for anti-apartheid-style boycotts, disinvestment and for bringing war crimes charges against Israeli politicians and generals. It all reinforces a sense of outraged victimhood that takes little account of the international impact of last year's war in Gaza ‑ seen as self-defence against Hamas rockets by a majority of Israelis ‑ in which 1,400 Palestinians were killed. So it's no surprise that the mood this independence day feels a tad subdued. \"Israelis are exhausted after 62 years,\" argues writer Yigal Sarna, sipping latte in a Tel Aviv cafe. \"People are fed up with the news. As far as most Israelis are concerned the conflict was over once the West Bank wall was built. It's a state of total denial. But at the end of the day this conflict is destroying us.\" Optimists in what remains of the Israeli peace camp see hope in the achievements of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. Its prime minister, Salam Fayyad, is building a stronger economy and institutions that should be the nucleus of a future state, regardless of the political impasse. Western governments, in line with Quartet envoy Tony Blair, call this \"the only game in town\". Critics sneer that propping up the PA is making it easier for Israel to maintain its 42-year occupation with Palestinian help. Surveying the events of the past year, the veteran Haaretz newspaper columnist Yoel Marcus urged Netanyahu to bow to Obama's pressure for substantive negotiations with the Palestinians ‑ or accept the likelihood of an internationally imposed peace settlement before Israel's 63rd independence day. Historian Tom Segev has spent years arguing for a two-state solution but confesses that he has all but lost hope of progress, even if the president does eventually table his own peace plan. \"In principle the US can force us to do anything,\" he says. \"But it won't happen. There's no sense here that we have to make fateful decisions.\" On the Israeli right the mood is of defiance in the face of international pressure and the absence of any prospect for successful negotiations. Benny Begin, a hawkish Likud minister who Netanyahu cannot ignore, protests that the west is appeasing Iran, Syria and their allies, and that the mainstream Fatah movement is out to remove the \"Zionist presence\", despite the PLO's formal commitment to a two state-solution. \"The notion of an independent sovereign Palestinian state in Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] that is viable and peace-seeking is an oxymoron,\" Begin warns. \"I don't see the minimum military needs of Israel being met by a Palestinian state.\" Amid the celebrations, the bitter arguments about politics, peace and territory go on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/sep/27/angela-merkel-german-election-victory","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-27T17:55:09Z","webTitle":"Angela Merkel claims German election victory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/27/angela-merkel-german-election-victory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/sep/27/angela-merkel-german-election-victory","fields":{"headline":"Angela Merkel claims German election victory","bodyText":"The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was today on track to form a centre-right government with her preferred coalition partners, the pro-business Free Democrats, initial election results showed. Exit polls issued by state television revealed that her Christian Democrats (CDU) and its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), had secured 33.5%, with the Free Democrats (FDP) taking 15%, giving a Bundestag majority of at least 308 seats. The results bring an end to an unwieldy four-year \"grand coalition\" between the CDU and the Social Democrats (SPD). The new government is expected to define itself by tax-cutting measures and a push to extend the lives of nuclear power plants whose planned phase-out was one of the main policy achievements of a previous centre-left government. It was a night of bitter defeat for the SPD, which suffered its worst result for 60 years. The party secured only 22.5% – a drop of almost 12% since the last election. A lacklustre campaign, driven by personalities rather than policies, attracted Germany's lowest postwar turnout, with only 72.5% of the eligible 62 million voters taking part, compared with 78% in 2005. The night's winner was seen to be the FDP, which secured its best result, increasing its vote share by 5.2% from 2005. Its leader, Guido Westerwelle – who advocates lowering taxes and relaxing employment rules and is the first openly gay leader of a German mainstream party – is almost certain to become the next foreign minister when the FDP enters government for the first time in nine years. Other fringe parties enjoyed a record surge in support as voters abandoned their traditional allegiances. The Greens secured 10%, an increase of 2.3%, and the extreme-left Linke party took 12.5%, an increase of 3.8%. Figures showed that 26% of Germany's jobless voted for Links, underlining the extent to which the two-year old party – a conglomeration of former communists and disillusioned Social Democrats – has won voters from the SPD. Addressing a glum group of SPD supporters in Berlin, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the outgoing foreign minister and SPD candidate for chancellor, said it was a \"bitter day for German social democracy\". Accepting defeat, he said the SPD would now form a \"strong opposition\", in particular fighting to keep the nuclear power plant phase-out in place. In the CDU party headquarters, supporters were jubilant as the news of the conservatives' win came through. \"This is an evening in which Angela Merkel has achieved her goal to form the government she wants,\" said Roland Koch, the leader of Hesse state, referring to 2005 when the CDU share of the vote dropped by more than 6% and the party was forced into an unwanted partnership. \"This is a clear vote of confidence for the politics for which she stands.\" Last night's result was seen as a clear sign of approval towards the steady leadership style of Merkel. She enjoys the highest popular support of almost any leader since the second world war, with three-quarters of Germans saying they thought she was doing a good job. She was greeted with cheers of \"Angie! Angie!\" as she addressed supporters at the CDU headquarters in Berlin. \"You're happy today and so am I,\" she said. \"We've managed to secure a stable coalition … and that's good.\" She said she wanted to be a \"chancellor for all Germans\", \"so that Germany does better, particularly in a crisis\". She added that although she \"didn't want to encourage sobriety\" on election night, \"the work starts now\" and that her priority was to \"secure jobs\".

I think Gordon Brown is more experienced, he's got us through a lot of tough things. The other two are not there yet. Also, David Cameron talks about ringfencing this and that, says on telly he is going to help vulnerable people, but I don't believe him. My disabled friend gets a lot of help and I think people like her would be at risk if the Conservatives got in. I had a cancer scare and I was seen within five days and cleared in two weeks, you wouldn't get that with Conservatives. They slag Gordon Brown off but he has made things better for poorer people. I've got bored of the campaigns by the end, there is too much of it. I felt sorry for Gordon Brown, after all that bigot stuff. Clegg has done well, but think he's fading a bit, but as for the other one [Cameron] I can't stand him. All this 36-hour stuff, who is he trying to impress? He doesn't impress me. He'll probably get in but what can you do? Middle Britain voter Jo Clayton, 37 Environmental consultant, Brompton Ralph, Somerset I'm going to vote for David Cameron. I think we need change and his schools policy is right up my street. His policies on immigration are also important to me. I don't like Clegg's idea of an amnesty, don't think it is sensible or achievable. I think the Conservatives are more committed to bringing on more nuclear power and pushing green issues. I think all the parties thought the campaign was going to be much more clear cut and the Clegg brigade turned it into something else. Hopefully it will encourage people to vote. I'd like to see a clear Conservative win, I think a hung parliament will just mean there are no decisions, and we'll just have to go through it all again in a few months. We need strong leadership. Cameron has had a decent campaign, but hasn't really grabbed us. He hasn't come sailing through with any great show of leadership, but he's the best of what is on offer. First time voter Edwin Ssekabira, 18 Manor Park, east London I am going to vote Labour because I think they have the right policies for my area. Things like equal opportunities, combating child poverty, education policies, providing opportunities for disadvantaged people and helping the poor. The Conservatives are not the party for people who don't have money. The Lib Dems are a good option but they are not yet ready to take power. The best moment in the campaign for me was when Gordon Brown had an election assembly at Citizens UK on Monday at the Methodist central hall in London. He gave a very passionate speech about the living wage, it felt like a speech from the heart, and got a standing ovation. I think on Friday we won't know who has won, but would like to see a pure Labour victory. Floating voter Jenni Danson, 66 Keighley, West Yorkshire I'm afraid I still haven't decided. Sometimes I think I'll vote Lib Dem and blow the result of the seat, but then I think I don't want a Conservative government. I imagine getting to the polling booth and voting Labour reluctantly. If I though they had a hope in hell in this seat I'd vote Lib Dem. They've banged on about the same things in this campaign. I'm not convinced that Britain's broken, but maybe if you are told it often enough then you start to believe it. I think this Big Society idea is a whole load of codswallop. Then again, when Labour talk about improving things, you think, why haven't you already? I'm tired of it. The Lib Dems have at least done a lot better than they would have without the debate, and journalists are all taking them quite seriously for the first time. On Friday I want to wake up to a Lib Dem Labour coalition with no BNP MPs, but I've got a horrible feeling it's going to end up being a Conservative government. I'll keep fingers crossed until Friday morning. Angry voter Old Holborn Political blogger standing as an independent in Cambridge I'm going to be elected in a 100% swing and then I'm going to storm parliament. Actually, I am not going to vote. We are in this situation because of politicians so it makes no sense to ask them to get us out of it. My faith in the political system is at all time low, whoever wins the majority will still lose. There are some positives. For the first time in 65 years we're on the brink of change, but will they lose bottle at last minute? I think we are in for a Labour decimation on Friday, whatever the polls say. We are in a situation where lot of people still will not vote Tory, and I think the Lib Dems are in with a sniff of being in a coalition government. But if they don't use this chance to get change, they'll never get another one. This is the last chance saloon for them. The Tories won't offer electoral reform, so I think they will go to Labour, who will force an ATV system which they will probably accept.

But Michael Beard was anhedonic; his fifth marriage was disintegrating and he should have known how to behave as his philandering had ended the previous four. This time, though, it was his wife, Patrice, who was having an affair with Tarpin, a horny-handed Essex builder who knew nothing about cavity-wall insulation. Beard waited for Aldous to collect him. Gosh, how he hated the polar bear rug in the hall. Still, everyone would soon have one, he supposed, if the polar ice-cap continued to melt. Not that Beard was yet wholly committed to the climate- change agenda, but having won the Nobel prize for his Beard-Einstein Conflation on Photovoltaics, an idea he was very thankful he was never asked to fully explain, he had been happy to head the New Labour Climate Change Laboratory. \"I'm afraid it's not a Prius,\" Aldous said. \"I'm not surprised, as they were only sold outside Japan in 2001,\" Beard replied. Aldous was one of his pony-tailed post-docs who was being forced into working on the New Labour cul-de sac of wind turbine energy. Beard nodded off. He was very familiar with the McEwan Conflation of cramming loads of dull facts about climate change into a book and calling it fiction. \"Tarpin hit me,\" said Patrice. \"He hit me too,\" Beard replied as he went off to visit an endangered glacier in the Arctic for 30 pages. He returned to find Aldous in his flat. \"I admit I'm having an affair with your wife,\" said Aldous, \"but I've worked out that your Conflation can satisfy the world's energy needs.\" At which, Aldous slipped on the polar bear rug and died, a victim of climate change. \"I could make it look like Tarpin did it,\" McEwan thought. He had no real experience of writing comedy and the gags creaked as much as the plot. But it was an improvement on his previous books, so the judge mercifully sent Tarpin to prison. 2005 As his plane stacked over New Mexico, Beard passed the time unnecessarily recalling his childhood before patting his gut. He had put on 35lb. He couldn't stop consuming; it was almost as if his size was a metaphor for the world's greed for natural resources. Still, there had been something in Aldous's calculations after all, and he was looking forward to seeing the photovoltaic laboratory the Americans had built for him. Back in England, Beard looked angrily at the man who was helping himself to his crisps and snatched them away. Only later did he realise they were actually the other man's crisps! \"That's the oldest comedy plot twist in the repertoire,\" said Melissa, his new girlfriend. \"I know,\" Beard shrugged, \"But Ian thinks that, like climate change, it may be old but it doesn't mean it can't happen.\" \"Really,\" Melissa yawned. Beard reckoned it was time to move to the safer ground of rehashing large chunks of climate-change data and inventing an unlikely intellectual disagreement. \"I don't think the serious climate-change sceptics are fighting over feminism and postmodern relativism,\" Melissa said. \"By the way, I'm pregnant.\" 2009 Beard had put on another 90lb and his belly was as over-extended as the metaphor. Worse still, the plot was falling to pieces. One of his American lovers, Darlene, had rung Melissa to say they were getting married, and Tarpin had been let out of jail. \"I took the rap for Patrice,\" Tarpin said. \"I know she killed Aldous because he was beating her up.\" Beard looked quizzically at McEwan. \"I'm sorry,\" Ian said. \"I'm OK on the climate-change stuff, but I don't really understand human psychology or comedy. Do you mind if Tarpin smashes up all your solar panels?\" \"We've had enough,\" said the New Mexicans. \"We don't mind you being sued for stealing Aldous's ideas, it's just we think David Lodge does this kind of story so much better.\" \"Oh dear,\" Beard said. \"Maybe I should go back to climate change. Perhaps nuclear power is the answer. Or how about a bit of pathos with my daughter?\" \"Enough trees have died for this already,\" Melissa sighed.

Artistically, there is not much to connect a Roman amphitheatre with a nuclear reactor. Yet the pairing has significance, especially for McDonald, director of Strathclyde University's centre for energy and the environment. As he points out, Torness may soon be relegated to a footnote, like Pompeii, in our history books. Certainly, Alex Salmond has made it clear he wants Torness to be Scotland's last nuclear reactor and has pledged to block planning permission for replacement plants both for Torness (to be decommissioned in 15 to 20 years) and its sister station at Hunterston (to be closed in five to 10 years). Scotland will then join a special European non-nuclear elite, along with Portugal, Italy and one or two other smaller states. For greenies, it would be a dream come true. I am not convinced, however, and neither is McDonald. 'Scotland requires about 5.5 to 6 gigawatts of electricity to keep its offices running, its homes warm and its factories working,' he points out. 'We can now generate almost 10 gigawatts and export the excess to England. With no replacements for Hunterston and Torness, that will stop. Nuclear power now provides 40 per cent of our power baseload. Without it, we would end up importing power and I don't see how a country seeking full autonomy can justify that.' Indeed, if the rest of Britain decides, as expected, to replace its ageing atom plants with new ones - unlike Scotland - much of the electricity pumped north to fill the nation's power vacuum would be nuclear. Morally and economically, Scotland would be on dodgy ground. So are our leaders really sure we can make it as an industrial power without nuclear energy? Can we definitely rely only on renewables to ensure our industrial strength? A brief glance at the options is illuminating. Our hydro-electric power capacity is near its limit, while wave and tidal energy technology, although of considerable promise, is in its infancy. That leaves us with wind, a source of immense potential but, like nuclear, bedevilled by committed opposition. The sight of huge turbines swirling on our hills drives walkers, landowners and activists into lathers of apoplexy. Some authorities, such as Perth and Kinross council, have reacted simply by blocking all wind farm applications. Others, such as the Highland council, have granted some, but not all. And then there is the grid. Like an ageing tenement flat, Scotland needs rewiring. If it hopes to ship electricity from wind - and one day wave - plants from the north to the populous south, new transmission lines will be needed. But a plan by power companies to upgrade the key electricity link, already close to capacity, that runs down Scotland's spine from Beauly to Denny is stalled by a public inquiry. Opponents are dismayed by the proposal to built 600 towers, each 213ft high, over prime Caledonian estate - including Ardverikie, where the BBC's Monarch of the Glen series was filmed. But if the Beauly-Denny upgrade is rejected, the consequences would be disastrous, says Jason Ormiston, chief executive of Scottish Renewables. 'There are 60 wind farms planned for the north that can only work if there is an upgraded line to carry their electricity.' Wind power is also an intermittent energy source. Sometimes cold, still Arctic air grips the nation and turbines stop. Scots rushing home to switch on kettles and central heating would therefore be disappointed with a future dominated by wind power. Which leaves us with coal, gas and oil. All are major carbon-emitters. Yet Scotland is pledged to reduce its carbon output by 80 per cent while electricity demand continues to rise at a steady 1 per cent a year. It is hard to see how to reconcile these factors with a non-nuclear future, as McDonald stresses: 'Two years ago, the Torness nuclear plant was closed for several months for repair. Nearby coal-burning Longannet took up the slack. The result was a massive jump in Scotland's carbon output.' Admittedly, there are some useful technologies being developed to help coal and gas plants reduce emissions- carbon capture and storage, for example - but again too many schemes are in the doldrums. For example, a prime opportunity to use the North Sea's depleted Miller oil field to store carbon dioxide, extracted from power plant emissions, appears to have been lost thanks to Whitehall prevarication. And that takes us back to nuclear reactors, an industry equally beset with problems. It has an appalling record for cost overruns, for example, while the fact that the issue of nuclear waste disposal is only now being dealt with, after 40 years' dithering, is a UK disgrace. It is not surprising then that the idea of new atom plants dismays so many activists and politicians, though a little caution is required. Consider Italy. After Chernobyl, it voted to shut all its reactors. As a result, Italy now has to import most of its electricity from Europe (a sizable chunk from French nuclear reactors) and has to pay more for its power than other European nations. Not a role model to be envied, I would argue. More to the point, new nuclear reactors, based on French or US designs, are now cheaper, safer and more reliable than current atom plants. 'It is a tested technology today which is not yet the case for carbon sequestration, wave power or tidal energy,' says McDonald. 'We need a couple of new reactors to replace our old ones and help keep ourselves going while we develop renewable sources to their full potential.' It is a good point. Nuclear power is not an alternative to renewables, but part of an energy mix in which fossil fuels should be used less while carbon storage is encouraged and wave and tidal power promoted and developed. Atom plants may be a financial risk, but a future without them is an even bigger gamble. · Ruaridh Nicoll is away"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/apr/11/obama-nuclear-summit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-11T14:18:44Z","webTitle":"The nuclear summit papers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/apr/11/obama-nuclear-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/apr/11/obama-nuclear-summit","fields":{"headline":"The nuclear summit papers","bodyText":"Washington is in the throes of grinding to a halt for the Nuclear Security Summit on Monday and Tuesday, when delegations from 47 countries, 38 of them led by heads of state or government, come to town to talk about locking up the world's \"loose\" nuclear material. This is Act III of Barack Obama's nuclear strategy, following the publication of the Nuclear Posture Review and the signing of the New Start treaty with Russia. Act IV will come next month in New York, at the review of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. The common aim is to contain the twin menace of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism, which Obama has identified as the principal threats to his country and to global security. The NPR and Start have both underwhelmed arms control purists, but have generally been welcomed as positive steps towards disarmament given the political environment Obama is operating in. The Nuclear Security Summit is likely to trigger the same mixed emotions. The copies of the summit's final communique and workplan that I've seen inevitably read like the lowest common denominator documents they are. The communique preamble, reads as follows: Nuclear terrorism is one of the most challenging threats to international security, and strong nuclear security measures are the most effective means to prevent terrorists, criminals, or other unauthorized actors from acquiring nuclear materials. In addition to our shared goals of nuclear disarmament, nuclear nonproliferation and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, we also all share the objective of nuclear security. Therefore those gathered here in Washington DC on April 13, 2010 commit to strengthen nuclear security and reduce the threat of nuclear terrorism. Success will require responsible national actions and sustained and effective international cooperation. We welcome and join President Obama's call to secure all vulnerable nuclear material in four years, as we work together to enhance nuclear security. That nails down the main formal aim of the exercise - official backing for the Obama deadline to secure the world's stocks of plutonium and highly enriched uranium (HEU). The communique puts \"fundamental responsibility\" for looking after the stockpiles in the hands of national governments, but asks for more support for the various international conventions on the issue, which mostly languish unratified or ignored, in particular the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. The accompanying work plan goes into more detail, calling itself a political (voluntary) commitment to take concrete actions. But those actions include efforts to bring the two UN conventions into force as legally binding documents. The plan calls for more support for the IAEA so that the agency can help states tighten their own security through an evolving set of guidelines. Rich countries are also urged to help poorer countries to better guard fissile material in the research reactors dotted around the world. Also: Participating States will consider, where appropriate, the consolidation of national sites where nuclear material is held; and Participating States will consider, where appropriate, converting highly-enriched-uranium fueled research reactors, and other nuclear facilitiesusing highly enriched uranium, to use low enriched uranium, where it is technically and economically feasible; There is to be another summit at a yet-to-be-specified location in 2012, to assess progress, but the bar for that progress is set comfortably low. What is lacking, even in the UN conventions, is any 'gold standard' for what the security on a nuclear site should look like. (Ian Kearns at BASIC has written a paper called \"Keeping the lid on\", on what ought to come out of the summit) Even the IAEA security guidelines would not provide adequate protection against a determined terrorist assault on a university research reactor. The main point of the exercise however is to get leaders from over 40 countries together to focus on an issue that is normally paid lip-service to. It sets a benchmark for good global citizenship, and more importantly a new benchmark for getting along well with Washington. To that end, the world leaders have all been asked to bring something to the party, and that is where the real meat of the summit will be found. Chile shipped its HEU to the US last month, just in time for the summit. Other states, probably including Ukraine and Canada, will promise to convert HEU reactors to more proliferation-proof LEU. And the US and Russia will sign a deal on Monday to each dispose of 34 metric tons of plutonium removed from weapons by using it to generate nuclear power. The invited leaders will also be feel some pressure to come up with some concrete achievement to bring back in 2012, and so orders will be given and officials chivvied to do something.

Ten countries - primarily the UK, US, France and Canada, but also including Japan, Korea, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa and Switzerland - have set up the Generation IV International Forum. It will develop a successor nuclear energy system to the previous Generations I (Magnox) and II (advanced gas-cooled reactors and the Sizewell B light water reactor) and follow the Generation III systems now being built. The latter includes the French Areva evolutionary pressure reactor (EPR), the prototype of which is being constructed at Olkiluoto in Finland, with another being built in France. Improved versions It is intended that these Generation III models, plus (hopefully) improved versions in future, will lead reactor orders through to 2030, after which it is hoped that Generation IV will kick in, with the goal of nuclear sustainability. However, the roadmap to get there is beset by practical problems that may prove insurmountable. Generation II and III nuclear plants operate in a \"once-through\" mode, which means that only half the 0.7% fissionable uranium 235 content of natural uranium goes into the fuel, while most of the heavy metal ends up in enrichment tails and in spent fuel as waste. This, therefore, requires a constant and increasing supply of natural uranium to meet the rising demand for electricity, while intensifying the already unresolved problem of what to do with vast accumulations of radioactive waste. Even the International Atomic Energy Agency and the optimistic Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development put the total world uranium reserves at 4.7m tonnes, and that assumes a purchase price of at least $130/kg. In fact, prices are currently nearly twice as high, yet primary uranium production is falling. But even if the figures were roughly correct and not significantly inflated, the total of known uranium resources is expected to be exhausted by 2030. If fast reactors were to be introduced by then, which is the centrepiece of the strategy, a further 10m tonnes - twice the known resources - would have to be ready for production, and this could only come from \"speculative and undiscovered resources\". The nuclear power industry answers this by referring to the universality of uranium in the Earth's crust and in sea water. But the enormous energy needed to extract it from these low-concentration sources would exceed the energy output of the fission of the fuel provided. These pressures are already being felt. The US gets half its nuclear fuel from diluted former nuclear weapons' highly-enriched uranium from Russia. And even Russia, with insufficient primary production, will be forced to rely on ex-weapons material to power its planned expansion. The UK's aim to secure energy supplies will not be aided by importing 100% of nuclear fuels, and that's on top of increased dependence on imported fossil fuels, notably gas. Meanwhile, Japan has closed seven nuclear power stations built on an earthquake fault line. The Olkiluoto reactor is already two years behind schedule after just two years' building and has a £1bn cost overrun so far, and there can be no reliable evidence on the economics of nuclear power until the new designs of the Westinghouse AP1000 and European EPR water reactors have been fully tested over many years in service. Contrary to claims by the industry, unresolved questions of cost and the looming shortage of uranium are the biggest challenges to the nuclear revival. To overcome the fragility of this recovery, the industry looks to Generation IV development of the fast reactor by 2030 as the key to ultimate nuclear sustainability. However, if for this purpose the fast reactor were adopted in \"breeder\" mode, an even greater quantity of highly radioactive actinoids (plutonium, neptunium, americium and curium) would be generated, exacerbating still further the waste management problem. If, on the other hand, the fast reactor were adopted in \"burner\" mode, as currently seems likely to prevail, the waste problem is alleviated, but there is no sustainability. The Generation IV fuel systems offer at present six types, of which two are emerging as likely candidates. One is the very high temperature thermal reactor (VHTR), which can be used for coal gasification as well as thermo-chemical hydrogen production. The US government favours this because a hydrogen economy is seen as the solution to the exhaustion of oil reserves, and the petrol derived from it. The main problem with VHTR, which has a coolant system outlet temperature of about 1,000C, is likely to arise from irradiation characterised by the Wigner effect - the displacement of atoms in a solid caused by neutron radiation - and from progressive disintegration by neutron bombardment. Indeed, a similar problem with the Wigner energy in Pile 1 at Windscale (now Sellafield) caused the fire in 1957 and melted the fuel elements. Given the very high temperatures needed for this complex and quite likely unstable process, its viability would need rigorous and exhaustive testing before such a problematic reactor were ever adopted. Repetitive cycle The second favoured Generation IV candidate is the sodium-cooled fast reactor system (SFR). The idea here is that as the supply of natural uranium declines, it is replaced by a plutonium-based fuel that is incrementally augmented by fresh plutonium in a repetitive cycle, providing claims of sustainability. It is envisaged that there is a gain in the plutonium in a surrounding \"blanket\" of uranium 238 over and above the plutonium consumed in the reaction, with a doubling time of 15 to 20 years. Again there are two key problems. It is a burner reactor, not a breeder, so that while reducing waste management problems, it does not provide for sustainability. Second, even if fast reactors of this kind could be successfully deployed - a big if - the doubling time of 15 to 20 years would require supplies of natural uranium to be maintained for decades, if not centuries, until the fleet of \"once-through\" reactors can be progressively replaced. And the uranium simply is not available for that timespan. So, a nuclear renaissance?

The planned levy on household bills would add £44 to an annual electricity bill of £500 and contradicts repeated promises by ministers that the nuclear industry would no longer benefit from public subsidies. There is mounting pressure on the power industry to show it can keep the lights on, with fears growing of an energy gap as ageing nuclear stations are retired and plans for new coal plants attract hostile protests. Ministers have become concerned that power companies such as E.ON and EDF Energy are reluctant to commit themselves to building nuclear stations because energy prices have fallen and they fear they will not be able to recoup the multi-billion pound cost of building new nuclear stations. The government believes that only by artificially increasing the cost of electricity generated by coal and gas stations through an additional carbon levy on household bills can nuclear become more competitive and encourage new reactors to be built. One European utility executive told the Guardian: \"New nuclear will not happen without sorting out the carbon price.\" The Guardian understands that the Office of Nuclear Development (OND), set up by Lord Mandelson's business department, has promised nuclear companies that the price of carbon under the EU emissions trading scheme – now about €13 per tonne – will not be allowed to fall below €30 per tonne, and ideally €40. According to the energy consultancy firm EIC, the new carbon levy would add £44 to the £500 annual electricity bill paid by an average household. The matter has come to a head as governments around the world prepare for December's global climate change summit in Copenhagen. For weeks officials from the OND have been privately assuring companies that if Copenhagen fails to secure a deal which significantly boosts the market price of carbon, the government will act to do so early next year. Politicians and environmental campaigners are increasingly pessimistic about the prospects of the summit reaching any significant agreement, making intervention by ministers to support the nuclear industry likely. Nuclear developers, such as the French-owned group EDF Energy, will need to decide whether to commit funds to start building reactors in less than a year, which is why ministers are keen to act soon. The carbon tax would take effect from 2015, to encourage developers like EDF planning to have reactors operational from 2017. A senior government source said: \"We know what companies' investment criteria is. If Copenhagen does not reach agreement on it we will do it next year, either via a subsidy, levy or tax. We will look at it – the utilities know it.\" He added: \"The way we look at it is: the answer is €30 a tonne, what is the question?\" The executive director of Greenpeace UK, John Sauven, said: \"Nuclear power has always been a byword for monumental taxpayer handouts. Now the likes of EDF Energy are getting cold feet over the cost of new nuclear stations, it looks like the government is trying to sweeten the deal with public money. This is despite saying categorically that any new reactors will have to survive without subsidy. Without huge financial support, nuclear power doesn't make economic sense. Even the big utilities now admit this.\" The government wants energy companies to build at least eight new reactors – costing more than €20bn – to replace those being decommissioned and to provide a secure, low carbon supply of electricity. After giving public backing to new nuclear early last year, ministers have been overhauling the regulatory and planning regime to make it happen. The government's independent committee on climate change last week floated the idea of intervention in the carbon market, but claimed that this option had not been assessed in the UK before. The revelation that the government is far ahead of the committee on climate change's thinking shows how committed ministers are to ensuring nuclear reactors get built, even if it means consumers have to subsidise them. The government will make its formal response to the committee's annual report in January, when it is expected to publicly endorse the carbon tax. Ministers will argue that the tax will also benefit low carbon generators of electricity such as clean coal and renewables. But nuclear would be the biggest winner. Subsidies have recently been boosted for offshore windfarms, while clean coal is at least 15 years from being viable. A government spokesman said there were no \"current plans\" to put a floor on the carbon price or introduce a carbon tax, but did not rule it out in the future. Politicians are loath to admit that they are planning to introduce a subsidy for the nuclear industry. Anti-nuclear groups have accused governments of being too close to the industry, which they say already benefits from indirect subsidies. The government has promised to guarantee the cost of disposing of nuclear waste and also pay for the cleanup resulting from any nuclear accident."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cleantechrevolution2009/artemis-intelligent-power","type":"article","sectionId":"cleantechrevolution2009","sectionName":"The Clean Tech Revolution","webPublicationDate":"2009-12-18T14:09:41Z","webTitle":"Finalist - Artemis Intelligent Power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cleantechrevolution2009/artemis-intelligent-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cleantechrevolution2009/artemis-intelligent-power","fields":{"headline":"Finalist - Artemis Intelligent Power","bodyText":"Remember Salter's Duck, the promising wave power device sunk by an accounting device in 1982, when civil servants altered its costs by a factor of 10, so favouring investment in nuclear power? Well, at last the technology has got the recognition it deserves through these awards - Salter's Duck has been reincarnated in the car industry. The digital displacement (DD) hydraulic drive train, a derivative of the original design, is a key development of hyper-efficient hybrid vehicles of the future. And Emeritus Professor Stephen Salter, inventor of the eponymous duck, hasn't gone away either: he is director on the board of Midlothian-based Artemis Intelligent Power, developer of the DD technology. Instead of a conventional drive train with an engine that has to work across a broad range of speeds and loads, hybrid vehicles have an engine tuned to run highly efficiently at a specific setting, which can both drive the wheels and feed power into a battery. The battery can be used to power slow urban driving, and to provide a boost for overtaking on the open road. Energy normally lost while braking is used to charge the battery by way of regenerative braking. Hybrid cars are more efficient and less polluting than conventional models - in principle. But in real world conditions the regenerative braking underperforms, while the extra weight of the complex drive train offsets other gains. In the end you might as well get a superior diesel car at considerably lower cost. But hybrid technology has got real gains to offer, if you do it right. And that's where the DD hydraulic drive train comes in. \"Hydraulics are a powerful but historically very inefficient technology,\" says Win Rampen, Artemis's chief executive, \"and that has limited what you can do with it. We have now turned this around so the energy transmission is 70-90% efficient, which means it competes favourably against mechanical and electrical drive systems.\" DD technology has been deployed in construction and agricultural off-road vehicles, and tests have demonstrated a 25% reduction in energy losses, dramatically reducing heat generation and fuel consumption. Tested in a BMW saloon car, a DD drive train reduced fuel consumption by 27% compared to a standard manual transmission, and a fully developed DD hybrid is expected to reduce emissions by 30%, combining reduced energy losses with more efficient engine operation. Artemis's main target market is large urban vehicles such as buses and garbage trucks - although they are a small part of the vehicle fleet, they account for 40% of fuel consumption. Based on a 20% market share, this offers a potential reduction of millions of tonnes of emissions a year in the UK alone.

So the next time you are in Starbucks, please do purchase a latte (using your own mug, of course) in honor of their generosity to science, medicine and the environment. Without further ado, here's this edition of Scientia Pro Publica for you to read and enjoy. As always, please do leave questions and comments on these essays. Biology This essay part of an ongoing series by LabRat about Xtreme bacteria – bacteria that thrive under some of the most inhospitable conditions that you can imagine. Be sure to nominate your own favourite Xtreme bacteria in reader comments. Jeremy, a doctoral candidate who writes the independent blog Denim and Tweed, discusses a recently published study that suggests that the sort of interaction between plant-eating insects and their host plants also determines how specific those interactions are. More than Honey presents a charming and personable narrative about how one bee aficionado figured out \"bee miles\" – the distance that a honeybee flies for every kilogram of honey they produce. After finishing this seemingly simple exercise, the author concludes that. (1) Numbers can be deceiving. (2) Different numbers don't always mean right and wrong. (3) Variation can be (and in biological systems most often is) part of the game.\" Chuck presents some data that call into question the belief among fishermen on the west coast of the United States that spiny dogfish are the source of crashing fish populations in his essay Voracious Beyond Belief? published at Ya Like Dags?. This essay was nominated by David \"Why Sharks Matter\" Shiffman. This story is part two of an ongoing series about endangered species 2010: Sarcopterygii and Chondrichthyes. The author of Ninjameys, who goes by the pseudonym Thonoir, is an independent blog writer and zoology student about to embark upon an MRes in wildlife conservation at the University of Leeds, where I attended the British Ecology Society meeting last week. This is a meticulously researched and beautifully written blog article by The Roaming Naturalist about the coyote – Coyote: Leader of the Bad Rap Crew – and why it is so hated in the western United States. This essay is an excellent example of why I particularly love long-form blog essays: it gives the writer the space necessary to carefully explore and discuss an important and complex issue. The birders in the crowd will enjoy Kazimierz's photoessay about his guided birding tour through several habitat types in Costa Rica, published at Science &amp; Soul. Earth and Geology John takes a look at those mysterious round holes bored into solid rock in his photoessay, Patience Pays Off for Pothole Populations, published at Kind of Curious. He also mentions the unique populations of animals that appear in these potholes. Several images are quite striking. What do maps, history and Texan religious wingnuts have in common? This amusing story, Antarctica Made Large, answers that question beautifully. This essay was nominated by David \"Why Sharks Matter\" Shiffman. Environment This is a \"blog\" in the traditional sense because it provides space for reader comments and discussion. But it is important to note that this is actually an interactive graphic that was created by a media company instead of an individual blog writer. I include it here for two reasons: first, I think this is an example of one direction that blog writing (and online media) will develop in the future, and second, because this graphic is a powerful (and valuable) look at humans' many damaging effects on the planet. Health Dr David Rabiner, who co-writes the group blog Sharper Brains, presents a long but thoughtful discussion of a recently published paper that investigates the effects of altering the diet of children who suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): A Controlled Trial of Herbal Treatment for ADHD. Ah, the power of belief when treating illness is always a tricky issue to address or even to understand. My friend and colleague Akshat, who writes The Allotrope, discusses the state of homeopathy in a country where 62% believe in its mystical powers. Speaking of beliefs, there is a growing number of us who are either agnostic or atheist – people who either doubt the existence of a god or gods, or who are convinced that god(s) do not exist at all. The author of the blog Epiphenomenon focuses on trying to understand why some people still believe in god(s), and what the psychological and social consequences of those beliefs are. This short essay presents data from a recently published scientific study that compiled responses to a survey mailed to people in south east England (Woking and Guildford, to be precise). Have you ever wondered why people can react to the same experience in opposite ways? Warren Davies, author of Positive Psychology Digest, wondered the same thing. In this piece, he pokes around in the primary scientific literature to understand the phenomenon of differential susceptibility. The author of Providentia provides an interesting transition from psychology into our next topic area, astronomy, by discussing the overlap between these fields. Comet Crazy collects some of the stories about the wacky things that people do when a comet pops up in the night sky. Astronomy I have met too many people in my life who accuse scientists of being unable or too logical to experience \"wonder\" when confronted with a natural phenomenon. I counter this silly assertion with my own silly response (hoping they will realise how silly we both are): the \"wonder\" that a scientist experiences is far deeper than what a non-scientist experiences because a scientist understands what she is seeing and still is astonished. For example, Phil Plait, author of Bad Astronomy, wrote this interesting piece about his sense of wonder when he realised he was looking at the dying gasp of a very, very strange star system. Maths It wasn't very long ago when an incomprehensible (to non-mathematicians) paper was published that made a lot of people jump up and take notice. My friend and colleague, Mark, was one of those people. He discusses this paper in his amusingly entitled essay Holy Freaking Cow… P ! = NP?? The reader comments that accompany this piece are also interesting reading (keep reading to the end). Science, Law and Society Blog writing is often criticised by scientists, especially if they discover that one of their colleagues has the temerity to write a science blog. But if you read science blogs regularly, then it is not news to you that the science blogosphere is playing an increasingly important role in the criticism and occasional retraction of scientific papers that are ... just plain bad. This short blog entry, Journal, heal thyself, published by one of my Nature Network colleagues at The Great Beyond, draws attention to this process. Since I mentioned that the science blogosphere has been involved in several paper retractions in the recent past, I thought you might be interested to know what happens to a scientific paper after it has been retracted. Ivan Oransky at Retraction Watch provides a case study about the process of retraction due to falsified data that occurred in the journal Endocrinology. Here's a long but very interesting study from Vision of Earth, a group of (mostly) graduate students based in Canada: Does nuclear power lead to weapons proliferation? According to co-author Ben Harack, this article is one of several that relied upon months of research into the feasibility of nuclear energy for the authors' home province of Saskatchewan. Ben writes: \"We believe that this [article] may be the most important subject with regards to society's possible acceptance of nuclear energy.\" Before I stop, I thought I'd leave you with a disconcerting thought: Did you know that 20% of your genes are patented? According to the US Government Patent Office, more than three million gene patent applications have been filed so far, and over 40,000 patents are currently held on sections of the human genome, covering roughly 20% of our genes. This raises all sorts of issues, many of which are deeply worrying. This online interview and video, Who Owns You? 20% of the Genes in Your Body are Patented, is by Drew who writes Singularity Hub. --- This ends the 39th edition of the blog carnival, Scientia Pro Publica.

The nuclear power company British Energy yesterday revealed that units in Hartlepool and Heysham, near Morecambe, Lancashire, had been shut down after problems were detected during inspections. John McNamara, a spokesman for the NIA, confirmed that this brought the number of inactive stations to seven of the UK's 16 reactors, which between them produce around 18% of the nation's electricity. Energy expert Professor Ian Fells, of Newcastle University, said problems with ageing power plants could mean the lights going out if the winter was cold. \"We are relying on ageing coal-fired power stations and ageing nuclear stations, and we are not in a position to rebuild them at the moment,\" Prof Fells told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \"[This is] because it is a privatised industry and people have to come in and say: 'We will spend some money and build some new power stations.' \"At the moment, they are still confused about the future development of the industry. It is disturbing. We are going to have to rely on it being a warm winter and if it is not, maybe we will have power cuts ... it's a really quite serious matter.\" Asked whether it was correct that seven nuclear plants were currently out of action, Mr McNamara said: \"Absolutely.\" He stressed that up to four plants would be closed down at this time of year for regular maintenance and refuelling, and said the others had been shut down on decisions made by British Energy. One power station is due to come back on line today, and another two or three within weeks. \"This isn't a safety issue, this is an issue where British Energy have called this themselves,\" Mr McNamara told Today. \"They have decided they need to do some investigative work and consulted the regulator and pulled those reactors off at a time of year when we often have reactors off. \"Unfortunately, they are ageing plants and there are issues ... in our opinion, it means, in time, that there should be greater focus on building a new generation of nuclear power stations to a standard design.\" The former environment minister Michael Meacher, a long-time opponent of civil nuclear power, told the programme: \"I think it is extremely worrying that one of the major sources of electricity is half down at this time. \"This is a very high proportion - 16 nuclear power stations, seven out of action. That's almost unprecedented, and I think it is pretty worrying that they themselves have a major problem as a result of breakdowns and the need for repair and maintenance. \"One needs certainty and the nuclear industry doesn't provide it.\" A spokesman for the National Grid said the shutdown would not lead to any blackouts or power shortages. \"We are going into winter with a 26% generation margin, which is the difference between the available energy generation and forecast demand, so we will be able to meet demand,\" he added. He said that it was not usual for a number of nuclear or coal-fired power stations to be closed at any one time. Neil Crumpton, a Friends of the Earth nuclear campaigner, said the shutdown of almost half Britain's nuclear power stations demonstrated the unreliability of this form of energy. \"If there is a problem with one nuclear power reactor, others which follow the same design will also have to close,\" he said. \"Critics say that renewables are unreliable, but this shutdown shows that nuclear power is intermittent.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2008/sep/24/britishenergygroup.edf2","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-09-24T14:30:00Z","webTitle":"Consumer groups voice fears over EDF takeover of British Energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/24/britishenergygroup.edf2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/sep/24/britishenergygroup.edf2","fields":{"headline":"Consumer groups voice fears over EDF takeover of British Energy","bodyText":"Consumer groups today voiced concern that the £12.5bn takeover of British Energy by EDF of France could lead to higher domestic electricity prices. EDF confirmed that its successful acquisition of British Energy would raise its share of total UK electricity generating capacity from 6% to 25%. However, it stressed the move would make it \"a market leader, not a monopolist\". The company said it was confident of winning EU competition clearance for the deal. However, the UK consumer group energywatch said there was already widespread concern about the soaring cost of heating and lighting homes, describing further consolidation as unhelpful. Meanwhile the Alex Lambie, the boss of Welsh Power has written to the energy minister, Malcolm Wickes, calling the EDF/British Energy tie-up \"a stick up at the expense of the UK's electricity customers.\" He said any deal should be delayed until completion of an ongoing investigation into the energy sector had been concluded by the Competition Commission. There should be a referral anyway to the Office of Fair Trading, said Lambie. The energywatch campaigns director, Adam Scorer, said: \"Our concerns are not about foreign ownership or the rights and wrongs of nuclear power, they are around putting more power into the hands of the big six energy groups.\" \"We think the current level of concentration has already led to prices being higher than necessary, and this situation has just got worse.\" The watchdog pointed out that Centrica - which owns British Gas - Scottish and Southern Energy are the only members of the big six quoted on the London stock market and therefore give detailed breakdowns of their financial arrangements. Npower and Powergen are owned by big Continental utilities, RWE and E.ON, while Scottish Power is now controlled by Iberdrola of Spain, leading to what energywatch said was a worrying lack of transparency. Meanwhile, EDF said the British Energy deal would give it the land to build four new atomic plants in the UK, two at Sizewell, Suffolk, and two at Hinkley Point, Somerset. \"We are delighted that the British Energy board has unanimously accepted this offer,\" the EDF chairman, Pierre Gadonneix, said. \"This paves the way for investment in the UK.\" The company, which is 85% owned by the French government, has also agreed that it will sell off British Energy land at Bradwell, Essex, and more at either Heysham, Lancashire, or Dungeness, Kent, to rivals who are also interested in constructing and operating a new generation of nuclear stations. The moves were welcomed by Gordon Brown, who said: \"New nuclear is becoming a reality. This deal is good value for the taxpayer and a significant step towards the construction of a new generation of nuclear stations to power the country.\" Ministers have been promoting nuclear energy - once opposed by many senior Labour figures - as a low-carbon answer to the UK's looming power shortage. Taxpayers will also get a windfall because the government owns 36% of British Energy, having stepped in to rescue the firm in 2002. However, the cash will go towards funding the clean-up of the nuclear company's historic waste liabilities. British Energy's shareholders rejected a £12bn bid in early August, which left the government's energy policy facing crisis. EDF has now agreed to pay 774p a share, with an alternative of 700p plus a new \"nuclear power note\" linked to the future performance of the generating company. It also confirmed that it was holding tyalks with Centrica about selling on a quarter stake in British Energy, whose shares jumped 6% to 767p - up 43p - earlier today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2007/oct/22/1","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2007-10-22T16:41:00Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power fault sends British Energy shares tumbling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/oct/22/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2007/oct/22/1","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power fault sends British Energy shares tumbling","bodyText":"Britain's biggest electricity generator, British Energy, saw its share price drop today when it announced that two of its nuclear power stations were out of service after a problem was discovered at one of its units. The two power plants affected are Hartlepool and Heysham which have two reactors each and together account for about 25% of British Energy's generating capacity. The news saw British Energy shares fall 13% at one stage today on concerns about the impact on the company's profits. By the close of trading the shares had recovered some of the lost ground to end 9% lower at 526p. British Energy, which runs the country's nuclear power stations, accounts for about a fifth of Britain's electricity generating capacity. National Grid, which tracks capacity against demand, said that despite the loss of Hartlepool and Heysham there was an \"adequate margin\" between capacity and demand in the UK. British Energy said that an inspection at the Hartlepool 1 reactor had revealed \"an issue related to wire winding\" which would delay its return to service and which could have implications for the other Hartlepool reactor and sister units at Heysham in Lancashire. It said it had taken a \"conservative\" decision to take the units at Heysham and Hartlepool out of service for inspection. \"We are assessing our return to service dates for these units,\" British Energy said.

There was also relief at a number of specific measures outlined, including confirmation that the planned £3bn employer contribution to national insurance would be scrapped and – pleasing the energy industry – a decision to press ahead with plans to build new generation of nuclear power stations. One industry less than pleased, however, was aviation, after the building of a third runway at Heathrow was ruled out and a \"green tax\" on flights introduced. Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI, described the agreement between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats as \"welcome news\". He said: \"Business wants to see a stable government with the authority to take the tough decisions.\" He described the seven-page outline of agreements reached between the two parties as a \"credible document which shows that the coalition government is committed to tackling the major issues,\" and said: \"We particularly welcome the significant acceleration in the reduction of the structural deficit and the plan to achieve it through reduced spending rather than increases in taxation. This will provide comfort for international investors and underpin growth at a critical time.\" The credit ratings agency Fitch said there was some reassurance from the agreement of a five-year partnership, which reduces the risk of a short term government that might have less incentive to tackle the budget deficit. But it said a \"strong and credible\" medium-term plan would be important to underpin the UK's AAA credit rating. Malcolm Barr, an economist at JP Morgan, said the fact that a full coalition had been formed, rather than a minority administration supported on an issue-by-issue basis, was an encouraging sign that the deficit would be dealt with and confidence in the markets upheld. Simon Walker, chief executive of the BVCA, which represents the private equity and venture capital industry, also said there was \"much to be applauded\" in the policy document published on Wednesday, particularly the commitment to begin cutting spending immediately: \"This outcome is manifestly preferable to either a single-party minority administration which might fall at any moment or a multi-party 'rainbow coalition' which would have been even more insecure.\" But he said his organisation would be lobbying government to make sure that it was not caught by the proposed changes to \"non-business\" capital gains tax, which will be increased to a figure similar to the 40% rate of income tax. The energy industry welcomed a number of initiatives, including the maintenance of \"renewable obligation certificates\", which are awarded to green energy producers, the provision of a floor price for carbon and an agreement to lift the target for energy from renewable sources. It was nuclear that had faced the most uncertainty from the coalition: the Liberal Democrats had been firmly against new stations. However, they have agreed to abstain when a national planning statement is put before parliament. \"We welcome the direction of the new government's energy strategy and their evident understanding of the need for a diverse approach if the UK is to meet its carbon targets and maintain energy security,\" said Nick Luff, group finance director at Centrica. \"In particular, we're pleased they recognise the importance of new nuclear as part of the solution to replace polluting coal-fired power stations.\" The Nuclear Industry Association said it was reassured, but urged the government to \"get on with it\". RenewableUK, which represents wind and marine energy firms, said it was pleased \"how substantial the set of environmental policies is even at this early stage\". British Airways accepted it had lost the argument for a third runway at Heathrow after the coalition government ruled out expansion of Britain's largest airport. Last year, BA boss Willie Walsh launched a scathing attack on David Cameron's anti-expansion policy, warning that the Conservative party would make the \"biggest mistake ever\" if it blocked a third runway. However, the airline took a more sanguine stance after the Tories and Liberal Democrats confirmed that the runway proposal will be scrapped: \"The incoming government is well aware of our view but has taken a different position. We are content for matters to rest there.\" However, BA attacked proposals to replace air passenger duty with an environmental tax on individual flights, including cargo services. The plan is expected to lead to higher taxes on ultra-long haul flights such as Heathrow to Sydney. BA said: \"Increased taxation on the UK aviation industry will create a financial incentive for customers to fly via continental hubs rather than direct from, or transiting through, UK airports, which could actually lead to higher emissions as well as financially disadvantage the UK travel industry.\" The Federation of Small Businesses said it welcomed \"the fact that both parties have made compromises to safeguard business confidence\". As well as ditching the national insurance rise, the FSB said it was thankful that changes to capital gains tax would not impact on entreprenuers, while it also hailed the committment to raise the personal tax allowance to £10,000. Small business owner Richard Bush, whose Warwickshire-based company designs and assembles teleprompters such as those used by newsreaders said he had seen little to encourage business so far, but welcomed comments on the need for banking reform. \"Giving business access to credit that they can be confident of, that is not going to be withdrawn from them is important and I am pleased they have recognised that.\" The British Chambers of Commerce was more cautious and said the Conservative-led coalition must be \"absolutely clear\" where spending cuts would fall and said it wanted to \"the delivery of a clear and achievable plan for business over the first ninety days of a new administration\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/may/12/cameron-clegg-coalition-government-reforms","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-13T00:35:00Z","webTitle":"David Cameron and Nick Clegg set out plans for 'seismic shift' in UK politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/12/cameron-clegg-coalition-government-reforms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/may/12/cameron-clegg-coalition-government-reforms","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron and Nick Clegg set out plans for 'seismic shift' in UK politics","bodyText":"Nick Clegg is to take personal charge of a massive programme of constitutional renewal, including a referendum bill on electoral reform passed by summer 2011, in what the prime minister, David Cameron, described yesterday as a Liberal-Conservative government that marks a \"historic and seismic shift\" in British politics. Cameron will chair his first full cabinet meeting this morning before putting the finishing touches to the coalition government with the announcement of junior ministerial positions, which will include a number of Lib Dems. The new leadership was unveiled yesterday on yet another breathless day at Westminster, when Cameron and his deputy prime minister Clegg held a joint press conference in which both displayed equal enthusiasm for turning their shotgun marriage brought about by a hung parliament, into a genuine partnership. Cameron said the government would end the chronic short-termism in British politics. Clegg said: \"Until today we were rivals, and now we are colleagues. And that says a lot about the new politics which is now beginning to unfold. This is a new government and a new kind of government.\" They also published a joint memorandum negotiated over the last five days covering deficit reduction, environment, tax, banking reform, an annual cap on immigration, welfare and relations with Europe. A more detailed document will be published in a fortnight, as well as protocols on how the parties will retain their independence. On some issues, the two parties have fudged differences by setting up reviews, independent commissions or agreeing that the Lib Dems will be free to abstain – a decision that will ensure that measures such as new nuclear power stations can be built without Clegg's party endorsing them. There may also be difficulties ahead over electoral reform, with the Tories insisting that the number of MPs is reduced and the size of constituencies equalised – a move that could give the party an advantage at election time. Questions were also raised last night on the safety of the Lib-Dem-Tory plan that would require any vote to dissolve parliament to be passed by 55% of all MPs. One legal expert described such a move as \"dangerous\". On the central economic issues, the Conservatives have secured their red-line commitment to cut £6bn from public spending this year, as well as a greater emphasis on deficit reduction through spending cuts, as opposed to tax rises. Liberal Democrats have also watered down their plans for a redistributive tax switch, turning it more into a tax cut for middle-income earners. Previously the expensive reform was to be funded by a redistributive mansion tax and a tax on pensions allowances for higher earners, but these have been dropped. The details of the policy agreement came to light as Cameron appointed his first full cabinet, which includes five Liberal Democrats and four women – including the first female Muslim member of the cabinet. Among the eye-catching appointments were David Laws, a close Clegg ally, who has been appointed Treasury chief secretary. He will have responsibility for a painful emergency budget in 50 days, as well as an autumn spending review that will see the savage cuts Clegg predicted taking place over the next three years. George Osborne, the youngest chancellor in more than 180 years, told civil servants they were to treat Laws and himself as members of one government. Vince Cable, the business secretary, is surprisingly not being given responsibility for banking reform, but will sit on a joint committee. The other two Liberal Democrats given seats at cabinet are Chris Huhne, as energy and climate change secretary and Danny Alexander as Scotland secretary. In the first sign of tensions between the two parties, the Conservatives had to countermand a Liberal Democrat briefing that Cameron would not be responsible for the dismissal of Lib Dem members of the new administration. Nine previous members of the 32-strong shadow cabinet have not made it to the new cabinet. William Hague, appointed foreign secretary, is to travel to Washington on Friday to discuss Afghanistan. The most senior female appointment is Theresa May as home secretary. May famously described the Tory party as the \"nasty party\", and she will have to work closely with Ken Clarke who has been appointed lord chancellor and justice secretary. The former shadow home secretary, Chris Grayling, has been demoted to a ministerial post in the work and pensions department under Iain Duncan Smith, a man likely to advance radical welfare reforms, including making benefits more conditional on working. Duncan Smith is a strong advocate of recognising marriage in the tax system. In one of the least noticed changes, Clegg has been given responsibility for political reform including a bill enabling a referendum on the alternative vote for electing the Commons. Liberal Democrats said the referendum is intended to take place in time to be implemented at the next election. Clegg's high-risk strategy will face its first test at a special party conference in Birmingham, but his audacious move is likely to receive a full endorsement. Clegg will also face difficulties in handling a byelection in Thirsk and Malton where the Liberal Democrat candidate, Howard Keal, refused to tame his anti-Tory rhetoric saying: \"It's a full-on fight, I hope disgruntled Conservatives – of which there are plenty – will lend me their vote and Labour supporters will vote tactically to help deliver a shock result. A spokesman for Jack Straw said of the move on confidence votes: \"For all the phoney talk about a 'new politics' this proposal is simply about crudely seeking to fix the electoral system to suit partisan interests. It is profoundly anti-democratic.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/feb/05/defence-rethink-spending-trident-f35","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-05T00:05:51Z","webTitle":"Letters: Rethink needed on defence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/feb/05/defence-rethink-spending-trident-f35","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/feb/05/defence-rethink-spending-trident-f35","fields":{"headline":"Rethink needed on defence","bodyText":"It is now clear to all that there is a major hole in the UK's defence equipment budget (Top heavy: MoD plans cuts in senior army and civilian posts, 4 February). It is equally clear that the UK urgently needs a searching strategic defence review – one that identifies the real threats this country faces and how best to counter them. It is essential that this is done before it is decided how our finite defence budget is allocated. Labour's attempt to exclude the question of whether to spend £130bn on new nuclear weapons and building and equipping the UK's largest ever aircraft carriers from the spending review is irrational and shameful. Several senior military figures, including General Richard Dannatt, have already warned against spending large amounts on new weapons systems that are \"irrelevant\" to modern warfare. At a time when climate change and energy security are increasingly recognised as key threats to our security, wasting tens of billions on unstrategic cold war weapons is profoundly irresponsible. That's why we are calling on the government to halt all spending on the supercarriers and Trident replacement ahead of the election, and for all political parties to commit to holding a comprehensive strategic defence review, with no politically convenient exemptions. Louise Edge Greenpeace UK • The time has come for a genuine rethink about security – it is simply not enough to choose between \"boots or bombers\". Today, in the midst of a global economic crisis where the poor become ever more vulnerable, and with climate change threatening humanity as a whole, we need to jettison narrow self-interest and ever-increasing military spending in favour of a sustainable human security strategy that puts people, rather than the nation state, at its centre. Building security for the common good will require work on many essential components, starting with the redirection of military spending and research into projects that address the real security needs of our time. Other components will include: strengthening the authority of the UN through its democratic reform and renewal; developing international law and the structures to police and prevent conflicts from escalating; achieving political and economic rights for all human beings and communities; and educating citizens for a new understanding that our future security depends on global welfare and the common good rather than self-interest and national prosperity. Chris Cole Director, Fellowship of Reconciliation Pat Gaffney General secretary, Pax Christi • The programme for the supercarrier and F35B (its proposed aircraft) needs another review due to recent developments. The F35 flight and development programme is two years behind schedule and has a massive overrun in costs. The US defence secetary, Robert Gates, announced on Monday the firing of the general in charge and a penalty of $614m against the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin. Also production numbers are being cut, which will increase the per-unit cost. Initial flight test delays and cost overruns always balloon. What would be the advantage of completing the carriers on schedule when there would be no aircraft to fly from it? This puts the whole carrier/F35B programme in jeopardy. George Lewis Brackley, Northamptonshire • Timothy Garton Ash (Comment, 4 February) rightly states that article 6 of the 1970 nuclear non-proliferation treaty commits its signatories to work towards the reduction and eventual elimination of their nuclear weapons. But that article also includes the qualifiers that such negotiations should be conducted \"in good faith\" and \"at an early date\". It is therefore depressing to read US vice-president Joe Biden assert in the Wall Street Journal that \"we are increasing investments in our nuclear arsenal and infrastructure in this year's budget and beyond\". The cost: $7.4bn in the next five years. The Obama administration has also been hoodwinked by the industry lobby into supporting a huge increase in nuclear power – with $18.5bn in loan guarantees.

Not only did Alistair Darling's pre-budget report promise to look into a new means of funding such projects but last week the Department for Business Innovation and Skills announced a review of the consents required for such schemes besides planning permission which throw up barriers to investment. The independent review, which will be headed by Adrian Penfold, head of planning and environment at property company British Land, will look at consents that need to be obtained additionally to planning permission for such projects as bridges, tunnels, pipelines, roads and energy plant. Penfold says that he is aiming at a consents regime that is \"simple, equitable and transparent\" and which will enable early decisions on investment. In his pre budget report Alistair Darling announced that the government will \"continue to examine the framework\" for the implementation of tax increment financing, a mechanism that would enable a local authority to raise finance against future increases in business rates that will be unlocked by infrastructure improvement. The announcement received a positive response. Liz Peace, chief executive of the British Property Federation (BPF) which represents major developers. She said that councils must be given the powers they need to raise funding and that if we are serious about kickstarting construction then action will be needed to support tax increment financing (TIFs) and ensure that \"we do not stifle great opportunities to rebuild our towns\". But the government's commitment to TIFs is perceived as hesitant. Alistair Parker of property consultant Cushman &amp; Wakefield said that the single sentence noting that the government would think a bit more about TIFs was \"disappointing\" in the light of expectations raised by minister John Healey in May when local authorities were invited to put forward candidates for TIF pilot schemes and the creation of so called \"accelerated development zones\". The BPF points out that by the summer 82 areas had submitted bids for 124 projects indicating strong demand. \"After nine years of consideration and consultation one wonders what aspects of TIF the Treasury has yet to explore,\" Parker said. The idea of TIFs, which are used in America, is that total revenue from business rates will be raised owing to new developments such as business parks and TIFs would enable the funding of infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are often a prerequisite for development. Parker said he is also disappointed that the Treasury has apparently failed to understand what he describes as the \"pay-as-you-go\" TIF variant. This would use private capital to find infrastructure without reliance on public revenue guarantees. Parker says that, crucially, this variant does not require the primary legislation that the government yesterday said that it will now consider."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/jun/28/nuclear-industry-global-body-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-06-28T13:52:09Z","webTitle":"Nuclear industry accused of hijacking clean energy forum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/28/nuclear-industry-global-body-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/jun/28/nuclear-industry-global-body-plans","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear industry accused of hijacking clean energy forum","bodyText":"The nuclear power industry has been accused of trying to muscle in on plans to establish a global body to represent the renewable energy industry at a key meeting in Egypt tomorrow. France – a major user and exporter of nuclear technologies – is accused by critics of trying to win the top job inside the renewable organisation so it can move the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) towards being a promoter of \"low-carbon\" technologies – including atomic power. The talks in Sharm el-Sheikh are already threatening to become a major standoff between Germany and the United Arab Emirates over which country should win the right to have the headquarters of Irena based in its country. France, which recently signed a nuclear co-operation agreement with the UAE, is supporting Abu Dhabi. It also wants one of its own civil servants, Hélène Peloss, to be given the top role. Britain, which only signed up for membership on Friday, has given no indication whether it plans to cast its vote in favour of Bonn or Abu Dhabi, while the US is expected to join Irena in Egypt and then lend its support to Germany. Karsten Sach, an official in the German environment ministry with responsibility for Irena, said he was \"very optimistic\" that his country would be chosen but he refused to be drawn on the competition with Abu Dhabi or the role of France. \"I think we have an excellent offer in terms of experience, policy frameworks and vibrant research but we are not campaigning against any other offer,\" he argued. Bonn is considered by many to be the more obvious location because the renewables agency was the brainchild of the Germans, who have led the way in the clean technology sector through its determined championing of solar power. The promoters of Bonn are also suggesting that the Danish renewables policy expert Hans Jørgen Koch should be chosen as director general. But Abu Dhabi, in the UAE, is pushing its claims to host Irena by emphasising its new commitment to clean technology through the construction of the hugely ambitious, low-carbon Masdar City project. It is also arguing that a developing country rather than the west is better placed to pursue the vital north-south dialogue needed to beat global warming. At previous planning meetings for Irena, the French have talked about \"low-carbon\" technologies, encouraging speculation about its ultimate motives. Eric Martinot, a senior research director with the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies in Tokyo, and a former environment specialist at the World Bank, told the Huffington Post, an online newspaper, that the French manoeuvres should be resisted. \"An Irena located in Abu Dhabi under such circumstances would be 'nuclear tainted' because the negotiating process used to select a host country would be based on support for nuclear power,\" said Martinot. \"Are the original goals of Irena being co-opted so that renewables become a mere appendage to a nuclear agenda? 'Sprinkling some renewables on top of our nuclear power'?\" he asked. More than 100 countries have signed up to the new organisation, although the US and China have yet to do so. Sach said he was hopeful that the US might join in Egypt and that China would eventually come on board. The renewable agency will have a mandate to disseminate knowledge, develop regulatory framework and to actively promote the widespread adoption of renewable energy technologies around the world. It comes ahead of vital new talks in Copenhagen at the end of this year about how to tackle global warming and amid excitement that the US and China are finally starting to play more constructive roles compared with the past."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/feb/03/ofgem-report-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-03T19:12:47Z","webTitle":"Britain's energy policy goes back to the future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/03/ofgem-report-analysis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/feb/03/ofgem-report-analysis","fields":{"headline":"Britain's energy policy goes back to the future","bodyText":"Alistair Buchanan has set sail on the good ship Discovery to find a solution to Britain's twin needs of meeting energy-security and climate-change goals. But the Ofgem regulator might have better named his exploratory vessel Recovery, because this is a voyage to make up for lost time: it should have been launched years ago when North Sea supplies first started to run out and global warming began to be noticed. Buchanan has been the target of criticism because he is the man at the helm, but the reality is that those who have really directed the energy policies of this country – past, present and future – are the landlubbers in Whitehall. It is not so much Ofgem that has woken up to the dangers of the lights going out somewhat late in the day, but a government which has spent the last three winters insisting there will be no power blackouts. As we know, this December the rhetoric actually ran dry, as 100 factories and plants around the country were told they were having their gas switched off with almost immediate effect. Ofgem's Project Discovery is a consultation exercise airing a whole range of ideas about what might need to happen in future. These include enhanced subsidies for renewables with 20-year guarantees and even the creation of a centralised power-buying mechanism, possibly run by the state. Much of it involves public money and state control. Project Discovery is in many ways an exercise which heralds the end of the largely unfettered free-market energy system and a return to the security of the past, when the publicly owned Central Electricity Generating Board ensured plenty of excess power-station capacity was kept ready for those cold winter days when power demand was greater than usual. The Ofgem ship probably only had to sail from Dover to Calais to find much of what it was looking for. The government has been berating the French, Germans and others for their unwillingness to follow the Anglo-Saxon ideal in which most of the country's energy portfolio was handed over to the private sector and a competitive environment drove down consumer prices (temporarily). The largely state-owned French companies, such as EDF, and German power behemoths, such as E.ON and RWE, kept their home markets relatively tightly regulated and protected for themselves. Meanwhile they took advantage of those innovative Brits, buying up all the assets they could find. So when a utility is needed to build a nuclear power station, it's no surprise that the only one left with the cash and the appetite is the Nicolas Sarkozy-backed EDF. While the Dutch, Germans and others ensured their power companies invested in enormous gas storage capabilities, the UK has left it to the market, which did little about it, even though it has been clear for many years that the UK is becoming dependent on imported gas and needs somewhere to keep it. The privatisation of the gas sector in 1986 and electricity in 1989 brought little in the way of strategic, long-term thinking and when the privatisation of the nuclear industry came in 1996 it swiftly brought problems, with British Energy having to be bailed out by the taxpayer within six years. Now ministers once again are being called on to intervene because companies left to their own devices will not invest in new nuclear, wind and other low-carbon technologies. Having sucked profits out of the industry when government \"interference\" was a dirty word, they are – like the banks, railways and even car industry before them – keen to see the state step in and help them out with a greener and more secure agenda. The government should seize its chance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/dec/22/copenhagen-climate-change-china-miliband","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-12-22T00:05:09Z","webTitle":"Letters: Poor response to rich states' failings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/22/copenhagen-climate-change-china-miliband","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/dec/22/copenhagen-climate-change-china-miliband","fields":{"headline":"Poor response to rich states' failings","bodyText":"Ed Miliband wants to place the blame for failure at Copenhagen on China (The road from Copenhagen, 21 December). So it was nothing to do with the rich countries walking away from commitments under the Kyoto protocol? Or because the emissions-cuts targets on the table from industrialised countries were well off what it will take to stay below 2C global warming? In no way due to a proposed $100bn fund by 2020 to help poor countries respond to climate change, but with no concrete plans to raise the money and tied up with so many conditions for developing countries that it becomes disingenuous? It was not that the two-page Copenhagen accord, which is devoid of real figures, was a fix up by a few nations? Come on Miliband, we all know what is needed to get a fair, ambitious and binding deal on climate change: rich countries coming forward with a package that will really save the world. Dr Alison Doig Senior climate change adviser, Christian Aid • Ed Miliband blames China for the \"failure\" of the Copenhagen talks to achieve a legally binding agreement on greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. After complex and important negotiations it is a very bad negotiating strategy to attack your partners. The inexperience displayed by Miliband in dealing with China seems to come from a real ignorance about the rapid progress made in China in reducing GHGs through many, extensive, practical programmes – despite being a developing country. Although the UK invented cleaner coal technology, it does not yet have a single clean coal power station, whereas China, according to an excellent Asian Development Bank study, has already built 235. Forests of solar panels and hot water cylinders cover the rooftops of many Chinese cities, but try to find just a few in the UK. China has huge hydro dams, large wind turbine parks and is building nuclear power stations. In the UK, thanks to the closure of hundreds of coal mines for political, not environmental reasons, the UK's CO2 emissions were slashed by 16%. The moral high ground from which he preaches is based on the destruction of the communities all around him. I suggest that Miliband comes to China to see for himself. I would be happy to take him around.

We are happy to consume vast quantities of material, much of it plastic, which they produce cheaply, while simultaneously affecting concern about the consequences of that production.

The question looks daft. The oil company posted profits of $26bn last year. There's no doubt that BP has been pumping money into the pockets of its shareholders. The question is whether this money is what the company says it is. BP calls it profit. I call it the provision the firm should be making against future liabilities. Despite an angry letter from two US senators and a warning from Barack Obama about spending big money on their shareholders while nickel-and-diming coastal people, despite the fact that it has no idea what its total liabilities in the Gulf of Mexico will be, BP seems to be planning to pay a dividend this year. It's likely to amount to more than $10bn. As the two senators noted, by moving money \"off the company's books and into investors' pockets\", BP \"will make it much more difficult to repay the US government and American communities\". Pollution has been defined as a resource in the wrong place. That's also a pretty good description of the company's profits. The great plumes of money that have been bursting out of the company's accounts every year are not BP's to give away. They consist, in part or in whole, of the externalised costs the company has failed to pay, and which the rest of society must carry. Does this sound familiar? In the 10 years preceding the crash, the banks posted and disposed of stupendous profits. When their risky ventures failed, they discovered that they hadn't made sufficient provision against future costs, and had to go begging from the state. They had classified their annual surplus as profit and given it to their investors and staff long before it was safe to do so. Last week the British government bumped into another consequence of failing to take future costs into account. Chris Huhne, the new secretary of state for energy and climate change, revealed that nuclear decommissioning liabilities will cost the government £4bn more than it was expecting to pay over the next three years. This will cancel out two-thirds of the vicious cuts the government has announced and swallow most of his department's budget. As Huhne pointed out: \"It is a classic example of short-termism. I cannot think of a better example of a failure to take a decision in the short run costing the taxpayer a hell of a lot more in the long run.\" The decommissioning costs imposed on society by nuclear power will be dwarfed by those that are imposed by the fossil fuel industry. They include, but are not confined to, the money that will have to be spent on adapting to climate change. The \n<a>United Nations estimates this cost at $50bn–$170bn a year, but a report last year by British scientists suggested that this is around three times too low, as it counts only a small proportion of likely impacts. The UN has hired the consultancy Trucost to estimate the costs dumped on the environment by the world's 3,000 biggest public companies. It doesn't report until October, but earlier this year the Guardian published the interim results. Trucost had estimated the damage these companies inflicted on the environment in 2008 at $2.2 trillion, equivalent to one third of their profits for that year. This too is likely to be an underestimate, as the draft report did not try to value the long-term costs of any issue except climate change. Nor did it count the wider social costs of environmental change. A paper by the New Economics Foundation in 2006 used government estimates of the cost of carbon emissions to calculate the liabilities of Shell and BP. It found that while the two companies had just posted profits of £25bn, they had incurred costs in the same year of £46.5bn. The oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico from the Deepwater Horizon well is scarcely more damaging, and its eventual impacts scarcely more expensive, than the oil that is captured by neighbouring rigs then processed and burnt as intended. The total costs imposed by the oil companies, which include the loss of human lives and the extinction of species, cannot be accounted. But even if they could, you shouldn't expect the companies to carry them. They might be incapable of capping their leaks; they are adept at capping their liabilities. The Deepwater Horizon rig, which is owned by Transocean, is registered in the Marshall Islands. Most oil companies pull the same trick: they register their rigs and ships in small countries with weak governments and no international reach. These nations are, in other words, incapable of regulating them. Flags of convenience signify more than the place of registration: they're an unmistakable sign that responsibilities are being offloaded. If powerful governments were serious about tackling pollution, the first thing they would do would be to force oil companies to register their property in the places where their major interests lie. US lawyers are drooling over the prospect of what one of them called \"the largest tort we've had in this country\". Some financial analysts are predicting the death of BP, as the fines and compensation it will have to pay outweigh its earnings. I don't believe a word of it. ExxonMobil was initially fined $5bn for the Exxon Valdez disaster, in 1989. But its record-breaking profits allowed it to pay record-breaking legal fees: after 19 years of argument it got the fine reduced to $507m. That's equivalent to the profit it made every 10 days last year. Yesterday, after 25 years of deliberations, an Indian court triumphantly convicted Union Carbide India Ltd of causing death by negligence through the Bhopal catastrophe. There was just one catch: Union Carbide India Ltd ceased to exist many years ago. It wound itself up to avoid this outcome, and its liabilities vanished in a puff of poisoned gas. BP's insurers will take a hit, as will the pension funds which invested so heavily in it; but, though some people are proposing costs of $40bn or even $60bn, I will bet the price of a barrel of crude that the company is still in business 10 years from now. Everything else – the ecosystems it blights, the fishing and tourist industries, a habitable climate – might collapse around it, but BP, like the banks, will be deemed too big to fail. Other people will pick up the costs. There is an alternative, but it is unlikely to materialise. Just as Norway has treated its oil money not as profit but as provision against a tougher future, so the governments in whose territories oil companies work should force them to pay into a decommissioning fund. The levy should reflect the costs that economists are able to calculate, plus a contingency for those we can't yet foresee. This would outrage the oil firms, as it would render many of them unprofitable. But there's a simple answer to that: the money currently defined as profit is nothing of the kind.</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2007/sep/16/rugbyunion.rugbyworldcup20074","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2007-09-16T01:30:37Z","webTitle":"Eddie Butler: Ovations, perorations and a nuclear power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/16/rugbyunion.rugbyworldcup20074","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2007/sep/16/rugbyunion.rugbyworldcup20074","fields":{"headline":"Ovations, perorations and a nuclear power station","bodyText":"For a full 10 days France has been at her grand, contradictory best. Rugby had asked the nation to get behind the team, and the country had responded. Wear blue, they had been urged. From top to toe, they replied. And then les Bleus went and blew it. The hosts lost to Argentina and, with no chance to redeem themselves until today, when they play Namibia, the team and the country have been in agony. After blue, the blues. But even as the inquest has been poking into every painful part of France's World Cup opening, the competition has continued and the French have been utterly magnificent. All the stadiums I went to last week, from Paris to Lens, from Lyon to Toulouse, were full and raucous and joyous. All my fears that the ticket prices might frighten people away were totally unfounded. 'Allez les Bleus,' they roared at Samoa last Sunday at Parc des Princes, which outdoes Stade de France threefold for atmosphere. For half an hour, Samoa, unlike the French team, rose to the occasion, gloriously committed to contact and yet deft with the ball. Given that South Africa are not exactly shy about putting themselves about, this was car-crash rugby at its finest. Poor old Brian Lima, 'the chiropractor', walked straight into oncoming traffic. On he came as a replacement, one of the hardest tacklers of all time, and off he reeled three minutes later. The old boy's memories of the start of his fifth World Cup will be extremely fuzzy. If cold Kiwi referee Paul Honiss had not reset a scrum deep into first-half overtime, a set piece from which the Springboks scored, who knows what might have happened. If he had not disallowed the Samoa try at the start of the second half, who can say what might have been. Instead, South Africa took the Samoa line-out and scrum to bits and a universal truth was confirmed: no ball, no shock. From Paris I travelled south, meeting the Loire and following it towards the Auvergne. This journey, too, had its contrasts, the nuclear power station at Bonny-sur-Loire, for example, acting as an industrial gateway to the vineyards of Sancerre and Pouilly. And then, further south, rising suddenly out of all the fields of fading sunflowers, maize and Charolais cattle, the race circuit of Magny-Cours. At a table outside Le Duc restaurant in the ever-so-sleepy town of Moulins (with, say no more, its museum of stage costumes), I met Garry and Donna Shearer from Mount Pleasant, Christchurch. They were good mates of Mike Cron, the scrummaging coach who has turned the All Blacks' set piece from a vulnerable point of restart into a ferocious point of attack. The Shearers were extremely cautious of promoting New Zealand's chances. 'You can never, ever tell,' said Garry. 'Anything can happen.' They were heading in their own time from Marseille to Murrayfield. You can clock up the miles at this World Cup. Just south of Lyon, in Vienne, famous for its jazz festival, I met a larger group of Kiwis going round the town's other attraction, its Roman ruins. Their leader was the great TVNZ rugby commentator Keith Quinn. Had his lot seen anything that might worry the ABs? 'Not a thing, mate,' they replied to a man and woman, turning back to the Temple of Augustus and Livia. 'Allez les Rouges,' the crowd roared that night in the Stade Gerland in Lyon, not surprisingly lending their support for little Georgia against the party-wreckers themselves, Argentina. I was in the middle of a group of Argentine reporters, who didn't abide by the slightly starchy objectivity of the press box at, say, Twickenham. 'Woaaah, merci, merci les Francais,' they all shouted at every cheer for the Georgians. 'That's what rugby teaches us, how to lose well.' Their Pumas won well again and remain the form team of Pool D, the group of death. They were held up by noble Georgia, but kept their discipline, and a rousing game ended with Lucas Borges going over for the bonus-point try. From Lyon, across the Massif Central by non-motorway roads, through the mountain towns of Le Puy and Mende and then down the A75, across the utterly majestic Viaduc de Millau, and on and on to Toulouse. A fantastic journey for the eye, while for the ear there was the accompaniment of the radio debate of the week: the letter of Guy Moquet. In 1941 a young French resistance fighter, aged but 17½, wrote a farewell letter from his prison cell to his family, the day before he was shot by the Germans. France coach Bernard Laporte asked non-playing full-back Clement Poitrenaud to read it to the French team on the night of their opening match, the one they lost. 'Ma petite maman cherie, mon tout petit frere adore, mon petit papa aime...' There is absolutely no question about the letter's power to move. 'Je vais mourir...' It is about love and loss, and the sacrifice of youth in a nation deep in despair. Was it appropriate, though, to make it part of what was intended to be six weeks of sport and celebration? Was it really necessary to boost the emotions of the French team before they stepped out in front of a crowd of 80,000? Weren't they already pumped up sufficiently? There was more. When the Rugby World Cup is over, Laporte will have a new job as under-secretary of state to the Minister of Sport. That is, he is joining the conservative government of Nicolas Sarkozy. And the new president had already made it known that he wished Guy Moquet's letter to be read out in all French schools once a year. Some teachers have declared that they do not wish to used as purveyors of propaganda. The letter has turned political. 'Allez les Rouges,' roared the fans in Toulouse, backing Japan against Fiji. The underdogs here have been embraced and kissed extravagantly in France. It was a slow burner at Le Stadium. John Kirwan's Japan kicked the leather off the ball to begin with; the Fijians dropped more or less every pass. But it grew and grew. Trailing 35-31 and chasing a match-winning try, Japan ran and passed a full five minutes non-stop into overtime. They ended the game without the score, scattered in little piles across the field. The crowd gave them a standing ovation and then one for Fiji. I drove back to the capital after the game. Lyon-Toulouse-Paris in a day. Sorry about the carbon footprint. But it was time to put the minnows aside and prepare for England-South Africa. Only for it to turn into a turkey. Precisely one week after France floundered at the Stade de France, England were even worse. Their followers, the most equable rugby supporters in the world, were horrified. The two giants of the European game had jilted their fans. Contradictions, so exclusively French nine days ago, have been embraced by les rosbifs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"science/2011/mar/24/brian-cox-wonders-of-the-universe","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-24T08:01:00Z","webTitle":"Brian Cox: Physics is better than rock'n'roll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/mar/24/brian-cox-wonders-of-the-universe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2011/mar/24/brian-cox-wonders-of-the-universe","fields":{"headline":"Brian Cox: 'Physics is better than rock'n'roll'","bodyText":"He stands like a hotsy-totsy god with legs so far apart that the rising sun is momentarily framed by Gore-Tex-swathed thighs. \"Once the remnants of the last stars have decayed away to nothing,\" he says portentously to an imaginary camera in one of those regional accents they like at the BBC, \"the story of our universe will finally come to an end.\" He closes the book, looks moodily out of shot, then struts down the Kings Road like Liam Gallagher – ego the size of the Virgo Supercluster, swinging his arms like a chimp. What a great shot that would make, he thinks, before the credits. But enough about me. I'm late for lunch with Professor Brian Cox OBE. When I arrive, he's sitting outside the Bluebird cafe, poised to order chicken pie. How very northern, I say to the Oldham-born cosmologist. \"Mmm yes, it might be too stodgy. Spaghetti and rocket salad please,\" he tells the waiter. Even particle physicists have to watch their mass. We're meeting to discuss the success of Wonders of the Universe, his four-part BBC2 series that ends on Sunday. It's accrued impressive viewing figures (6m watched the initial episode and it was the first BBC factual show to top the iTunes chart). It is also reportedly responsible for a hike in telescope sales. But, as night follows day, or as a planetary nebula becomes a white dwarf, it has its detractors. I show him two letters from the Radio Times. One suggests that Cox's presenting style is an unwitting homage to Paul Whitehouse's perma-smiling enthusiast for the wonders of nature on The Fast Show. \"Isn't Einstein brilliant! Aren't black holes brilliant! Isn't Pauli's exclusion principle brilliant! Isn't the heat death of the universe, though somewhat depressing, fundamentally ... BRILLIANT!\" You get the idea. \"I think that, as a TV presenter, if you can't be impersonated, you're probably not doing it right,\" retorts Cox cheerfully. He likes the fact that impressionist Jon Culshaw nails his voice. Being teased is tolerable – up to a point. Let's hope his skin's thick enough to enjoy the YouTube satire of him doing the rounds. The other letter is more troubling. It lists the series' visual shortcomings. Incessant slow-mo footage; baffling CGI of putative cosmic objects whirling like a bad LSD trip; presenter legs akimbo on a mountain peak like a rutting stag to a soundtrack of bombastic power chords. Endless foreign-location sequences of questionable relevance that us increasingly impecunious dupes (licence-fee payers) are bankrolling. Carl Sagan (late US astrophysicist, cosmologist and one of Cox's idols) wouldn't have stooped to conquer viewers with such visual cliches. \"I accept some criticisms of the series,\" says Cox, 43. \"I think the days of standing alone on a mountaintop while a helicopter circles round me are over. We're not going to do that again. But it's a challenge to suggest the epic, awe-inspiring nature of the universe. When Carl Sagan, whose work I loved from when I was a boy, made Cosmos [a 1980 TV series and book], he got a lot of stick. So do I. But it's hard: how do you keep the body of the documentary and remove all the visual cliches? To be honest, I'm a little bored of the grandiose thing and I want to move on.\" He balks, though, at the suggestion he's cost licence-fee payers lots of money by travelling the world. \"My foreign travel was hardly as costly as the CGI or the camera crew. Anyway, it's about the value we bring in the programme. You need epic locations to give the right resonance to what you're talking about.\" True, but some critics have pointed out the cosmic irony that extraterrestrial wonders are illustrated by shots of Earth's natural wonders. Cox twirls his spaghetti crossly. It's as though he's trying to reduce his pasta from supernova to ultra-dense neutron star. (This, you will be pleased to learn, will be this article's first and last cosmological simile.) As Cox twirls, his smile fades. The last time I saw that smile disappear so thoroughly was last Sunday during the episode on gravity. There he brilliantly explained the differing gravitational forces on different planets while sitting in a centrifuge, and there is nothing like a centrifugal gravitational simulator to wipe the smile off someone's face. What's he cross about? \"What annoys me is that I can't get out my intellectual cricket bat with my critics, as I can when you're doing physics. There's a brutality in science because you're measuring yourself against reality. As a presenter, I have to be circumspect, but as an academic I just want to beat them into the ground.\" Who? \"The people who accuse me of dumbing down. I may have been standing on a mountaintop, but what I was saying was about electro-weak symmetry breaking. Some people can't see the content for the style. I just want to get the script and say, 'Here's what I said about gravitational mass and inertial mass, or about Einstein's general theory of relativity or about entropy. Now you tell me what you fucking know about entropy.' I suspect they couldn't because they weren't paying attention. They're so bewitched by complaining that the style of Wonders isn't like the great TV documentaries from when they were young.\" He's still cross that complaints about the noisiness of the musical soundtrack led producers to turn down the volume on later episodes. \"That was a mistake. It was only a handful of complaints. When I worked as a science adviser with Danny Boyle on Sunshine [the 2007 sci-fi film set 50 years in the future in which a team of astronauts are sent to reignite the dying Sun] he said that music is an integral part of the emotional presentation of a film. It's the same for Wonders: this is supposed to be a documentary about the wonders of the universe and the music should be in the same emotional register. It's not a lecture.\" Cox argues that the BBC could have made two different soundtracks available for the series as it was screened. One authentically loud, presumably for the kids whom Cox wants to lure into studying science and engineering; the other muted for more venerable demographics likely to send why-oh-why complaints to Points of View. \"It would be similar to making subtitles available, an option you could choose with your remote. It wouldn't cost much. It would be like having wheelchair lifts to buses.\" After the interview, the BBC press officer chaperoning Cox tells me it would be prohibitively expensive to provide such audio options. His insistence on his documentary having an emotional dimension underwritten by epic images and loud music highlights is what we might call Cox's Paradox. \"I'm trying to get viewers to feel my first reaction to science, which was awe at the universe and astonishment at what we've learned.\" But at the same time, his vision of science is one devoid of emotion. \"Sagan always said this – people don't need to know when the universe began; people need to know how science works, that it's not got an agenda, and that it is a process that is utterly dispassionate.\" So you're trying to get younger viewers to have a passionate reaction to something that is methodologically dispassionate? \"It's a paradox, but it's what I'm doing. I'm fighting for reason. With scientific education in a democracy, which is what this is about, you have to accept that reason is radical. We live in a culture where people can say 'I don't like nuclear power' or 'I don't think wind farms are pretty', whereas PhD scientists are valuable precisely because they instinctively strip away emotional responses and say, 'Here's the evidence. Here are reasons.' I want Britain to be more reason-based.\" As a Royal Society University Research Fellow, Cox has a brief to educate Britons about science and to instil enthusiasm about science and engineering in young people. Why's the latter important? \"Britain is squandering its lead in science and engineering. We once led the world, and we can again.\" I catch a sidelong glance of Cox as he talks. High-cheekboned, plump-lipped, favoured with serene brown eyes, flecks of grey dignifying his Madchester hairdo – he is not an ugly man. Such improperly non-dispassionate assessments, though, about his looks and their corollary, his alleged egotism, drive the professor nuts. He's just concluded a Twitter war with Sarah Vine, Times columnist and wife of education secretary Michael Gove. In a hyperbolically rude outburst, Vine wrote that Cox's ego was a \"giant intergalactic body of energy, an object so large and indomitable that it threatens to obscure even the light of the sun. . . Not even Narcissus himself would have had the brass neck to stipulate . . . long, lingering shots of the handsome professor silhouetted against a night sky.\" Cox tweeted: \"Sarah Vine should speak to her husband about the impact of science and history programming before scribbling her drivel in the Times\". He added that it was Gove's job to encourage young people to into the fields. Then he tweeted Vine: \"Your article offends me, and I dare say everyone who has an interest in encouraging more young people into science.\" Vine snapped back: \"If someone can point me towards an ugly scientist who objects to my piece as much as @ProfBrianCox then I will take his objection seriously.\" Cox replied: \"Surely age/sex/appearance has nothing to do with it. Perhaps scientific track record would be a better barometer?\" It's edifying – isn't it? – to see two footsoldiers of Rupert Murdoch's evil empire (Cox writes a column for the Sun) mash each other up as the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies will do in 3bn years' time? (Another cosmological metaphor. Sorry). Don't you guys realise you love each other, I ask Cox. \"Well, I'm glad she's admitted she was wrong. I know what it's like to be a journalist – you get called at 2pm and told to file something at 4 on something topical.\" He tells me he did just that recently, in a column for the Sun in which he eviscerated Saint Vince of Cable because the coalition business secretary seemed poised to cut science funding by 20% in the comprehensive spending review. \"The Sun illustrated my article with a Spitfire flying from a double helix, with the headline that cutting back on science now would be like cutting back on the Spitfire programme in 1938. Bang on.\" Excellent. But didn't Vine have a point? Where are TV's ugly presenters? Doubtless in some BBC Television Centre holding pen, poor hideous brutes. Would Patrick Moore have been given air time in a TV culture that privileges lookers over thinkers? \"I guess my answer is what you're looking for is someone people want to watch. It's the same for actors. It's not all about looks. If you look at the BBC's science output now it's all middle-aged academics – Marcus du Sautoy, Alice Roberts, Ian Stewart, Jim Al-Khalili, me. It's not like we're Take That.\" Casting Professor Cox as a boyband member, though fun, is wrong. He played keyboards for Dare in the 80s and for D:Ream in the 90s, but his rock'n'roll years are long over. What happened? Picture the scene: it's Manchester in the early 90s, probably raining. A physics undergraduate who only got a D in A-level maths and used to enjoy bus-spotting, is presented with an unimaginably glamorous offer – to tour sunny Australia with a band with a misplaced colon in its name. \"It was a really exciting prospect. But I decided I needed to concentrate on my studies.\" It was a Damascene moment: down one path lay sex, drugs and rock'n'roll; down the other, gluons, muons and the quest to find the hypothesised Higgs boson particle. He chose the latter. Why? \"Physics excited me more. I felt so energised by the process of learning – the intensity of learning – you don't get that very often.\" He looks wistful: \"Actually, I'm trying to get space to get that feeling back. I like going on learning curves and doing TV has given me that but nothing's been as thrilling as the intensity of learning physics.\" In 1997, one of his last performances with D:Ream was at Labour's election night party at the Royal Festival Hall. Their song Things Can Only Get Better had been co-opted as the Blairite anthem. \"It became a hit again as a result, but I don't think I got any money.\" Were you a New Labour supporter? \"No, I wasn't politicised. I've never been party political. I only became political in 2007 when Labour was cutting science funding. I got to work in the Particle Physics Action group to fight it. I had a horror of politics then – everybody knew it was wrong to cut science funding, but nobody admitted that they had made a mistake. That's how politics differs from science. In science, you're peer-reviewed into admitting your mistakes. In politics, you don't have to, in fact you have a vested interest in not doing so.\" The year after playing for dad-dancing New Labourites, Cox got his PhD in high-energy particle physics at Manchester. He became a member of the High-Energy Physics group at the University of Manchester and worked on the Atlas experiment at Cern, aimed at investigating basic forces that have shaped our universe since the beginning of time and that will determine its fate. Put that way, it's not hard to see why Cox chose physics over rock'n'roll. In 2004, he married US blogger and film-maker Gia Milinovich at Cern. They have a son called George, who will be two in May. His middle name is Eagle after the first spacecraft to land on the moon. Two years ago he became professor of particle physics at Manchester, aged only 41. Between now and September he will collaborate on a book on quantum mechanics and start filming a five-part BBC TV series called The Wonders of Life. It follows his two successful series (the first of which last week earned Cox a Royal Television Society award) and will be a physicist's take on what life is. Didn't David Attenborough's Life on Earth series cover the same ground? \"His was a naturalist's perspective; mine goes back to the time when there's an argon content in water and you had living organisms in uranium in rock. It will be about how life was brought about by chemical reaction.\" Will it be as grandiose as the previous series? \"I hope not.\" We'll see, when the series is screened later next year. Just before Cox's cab drops me off and he heads to his publisher where he must sign copies of his new book, Cox tells me one of his heroes is physicist Richard Feynman. \"He was one of the greatest minds of the 20th century but people always expressed frustration that he didn't concentrate on one thing more. He could have achieved more.\" Isn't the same true of you? After all, you're doing TV, writing for the Sun, signing books, rather than knuckling down to the hard stuff: understanding the natural laws of the cosmos. \"Well, he got a Nobel prize. I won't. I'm not Feynman. I'm not a genius like him!\" The cab pulls away. Inside it, there is someone whose ego is not intergalactically proportioned but, so far as I can judge, more modest. • This article was amended on 25 March 2011.

Let me take one important example. Last Wednesday Gordon Brown held his monthly prime-ministerial press conference. The reports by the Guardian's current and former political editors (\"Producers may pass on cost of energy package to consumers\"; \"Brown comes up with a cones hotline moment\" and the supporting editorial, \"Lofty ideals\") overlooked the fact that in the press conference launching the energy support package, Brown chose on no less than three occasions to praise nuclear power. He said: \"I think people may have forgotten that we made the right decision about nuclear power, I think very few people now doubt that\". Actually, the prime minister might be surprised that many do still oppose an energy source that produces dangerous plutonium as an unavoidable byproduct, and sometimes uses it in new fuel too, requiring methods of transport that are vulnerable to terrorism. Some 105,000 kilograms of this stuff is stockpiled at Sellafield: it takes but 5 kilos to make a bomb of the size that devastated Nagasaki in 1945. As Dr Bennett Ramberg, security advisor to the state department in the 1980s, has argued, nuclear regulators are unfortunately not likely to implement appropriate protective insurance strategies \"as long as they cling to the view that attacks are improbable and plants are well protected. The annual commemoration of the Chernobyl accident should serve as a useful reminder of what can happen if the presumptions prove wrong.\" Some think that Brown, hitherto sceptical about the benefits of nuclear power, may have been unduly influenced by the fact that his brother is public relations chief for EDF-UK, whose parent company in France – a company 78% dependent on nuclear power – is in the final throes of buying the majority share in Britain's main nuclear generator, British Energy. Brown added \"I am encouraging other countries to go ahead with nuclear power, France and Britain are leaders in nuclear power ... \" This is inconsistent with Brown's insistence on fighting international terrorism and the foreign secretary's oft-stated determination to curb nuclear proliferation. More, France has been a major industrial partner in the controversial Iranian nuclear industry. A little known report (pdf) prepared last year by Paris-based analyst, Mycle Schneider, for the Green group in the European parliament, revealed that in 1974 Iran took a 40% share in a special purpose nuclear company Sofidif, the other 60% owned by the French Government owned nuclear giant, Areva. The next year, Schneider reports, Sofidif took up a 25% share in the international Eurodif consortium that built a large uranium enrichment facility in Pierrelatte in the south of France. Sofidif still exists, still holds the same share in Eurodif and is still active. In a letter dated 13 February 2006 (reproduced by Schneider), addressed to the CEO of Sofidif, Reza Aghazadeh, vice-president of Iran and president of the Iranian atomic energy organisation, announced the changeover of the Iranian representatives on the board of Sofidif, demonstrating their contemporary involvement. Is this the kind of international nuclear partnership Brown wants to promote? And on broader geopolitical energy matters Brown asserted: \"Russia must maintain the obligations and commitments it makes to the international community ... I do say there is another thing that has arisen from not only what has happened in Russia, but it is happening in other countries as well, we cannot allow a country like ours, given the need for energy security, to be wholly dependent on the supply of one resource. Instead of being wholly dependent on oil and gas, which of course is not going to be the best way of us proceeding as North Sea oil declines, we want a balanced energy policy, and so in my view does the rest of Europe. That will mean more nuclear building ... \" Brown finds himself a curious political bedfellow with none other than the Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate for Copeland, the constituency containing Sellafield. In a letter to his local newspaper, the Whitehaven News, on September 11, Councillor Chris Whiteside wrote: \"But if we don't support nuclear or coal, how are we to keep the lights on? Are we going to rely on buying gas from Vladimir Putin? I don't think that's a good idea\". You can dress up nuclear power stations however you like: they are still inevitable generators of nuclear explosives and nuclear waste, alongside electricity. Ducking under the duvet won't change these facts, Brown."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/blog/2013/jun/26/osborne-spending-review-2013-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2013-06-26T12:51:00Z","webTitle":"Osborne announces spending review 2013: Politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2013/jun/26/osborne-spending-review-2013-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2013/jun/26/osborne-spending-review-2013-live","fields":{"headline":"Osborne announces spending review 2013: Politics live blog","bodyText":"That's enough for today.

There will also be more chance tomorrow to mull over the implications of today's spending review. Here's the Guardian's current lead story with an overview of what George Osborne announced. On the economics, the overall picture is clear: the austerity show is still going strong. Unsurprisingly, George Osborne is sticking to fiscal discipline. Some of his investment announcements received a positive write-up, but even the CBI struggled to sound enthusiastic. (See 3.37pm.) But the politics provided more of a surprise. We were told that this would not be a welfare spending review, because there would be no further welfare cuts. Yet, by announcing details of his welfare cap and by a surprise decision to tighten conditions for people claiming jobseeker's allowance (which isn't a cut - money saved will be reinvested in getting claimants in to work) Osborne has thrust welfare spending right back into the centre of the political debate - where, presumably, he wants it to stay until the election. He is determined to find benefit cuts or punitive measures that Labour will oppose, although, so far, the opposition is refusing to play ball. Osborne is also, slowly, recasting the state. Local government is shrinking again, public sector pay is about to become less generous, NHS spending and social care spending is merging a bit more and the school funding review is bound to produce winners and losers. We haven't seen the details, but it's probably fair to assume that inner-city schools in Labour constituencies won't be the beneficiaries. Also, overall, he is changing the focus of state spending. Stephanie Flanders put this particularly well in her blog: [Osborne has] put us on a road to a very different kind of public sector ... In future, the government will spend quite a lot on social security, health, defence and education - and not very much else.\" On that note, I'm winding up. Thanks for the comments. This is from Henry McDonald in Belfast. Unionists and trade unionists have a radically different take on how Northern Ireland has fared in the Spending Review. The Ulster Unionists contends that the province has done as well as could reasonably have been expected. Sandra Overend, UUP Assembly member, pointed out that the £9.6 billion annual fiscal lifeline to Northern Ireland remains in place. But the Northern Ireland Public Service Allowance criticised the end of automatic annual increases for public sector workers which will have a huge impact in a region with a higher level of civil servants. The SR document does not clearly explain how the savings in the announcement add up to £11.5bn. But the Treasury has now sent out this chart with those figures. Local government is the biggest loser. Its budget has been cut by £2.6bn. For those without telescopic eyesight, here are the change in spending figures, from 2014-15 to 2015-16, for the main departments. Health - up £100m Education - down £500m Transport - down £300m Communities - down £100m Local government - down £2.6bn Business - down £800m Home Office - down £600m Justice - down £700m Defence - down £500m Foreign Office - down £100m DfID - up £100m Energy - down £100m Environment - down £200m Culture - down £100m Work and pensions - down £400m Scotland - down £400m Wales - down £200m Northern Ireland - down £100m Tory HQ has sent out a list of what it says are six challenges for Labour in the light of today's SR. Here they are: 1. Would Labour match the £11.5 billion of savings in 2015-16? 2. Do you oppose any of the cuts announced today and if so how would you pay for reversing them? 3. Would Labour borrow more to spend more than the Government’s capital spending plans in 2015-16? 4. The Government has excluded the basic state pension from its welfare cap. Will you keep the basic state pension inside Labour’s welfare cap? 5. The SR announced 180 new free schools in 2015-16. Will you cut these? 6. Will you vote for the back to work welfare reform package, including the 7 day wait for benefits and the English language test? Ed Balls has gone some way to answering these with his declaration that he will take the coalition's day-to-day spending plans for 2015-16 as a starting point (but perhaps spend more on capital spending), and this afternoon he gave a partial answer to 6, but the list is interesting because it tells you something about Osborne's strategy. Severin Carrell has sent me this. John Swinney, the Scottish finance secretary, has said Osborne's increase in Scotland's capital spending for 2014 of £400m has been dwarfed by the cumulative cuts in his capital budget since the Tory-Lib Dem cuts started in 2010. He said Scotland's overall capital spending budget had been cut by 26% in real terms, a fall which would be cumulatively worth £3.2bn by 2015. Nearly £300m of that additional capital spending in 2014 would need to be repaid from future Scottish budgets, Swinney added, while his Scottish government's revenue budget was still falling in real terms by £333m. He said that strengthened the case for a “yes” vote in next year's independence referendum: “Scotland did not vote for this disastrous economic agenda and next year we can choose to take a different and better path, with all of Scotland’s resources at our disposal. “Scotland is a wealthy nation. Welfare and pensions are more affordable in Scotland. In the last year Scotland paid a higher share of UK taxes into the Treasury, than we received of UK spending and in every one of the last 30 years Scotland has paid in more in taxes per person, than across the UK as a whole.” Here a SR reading list. • Stephanie Flanders on her BBC blog says Osborne is reshaping the state. Think about it: he has now laid out the 6th of what is now likely to be a 7, or 8 year austerity programme. That has slashed the size of many Whitehall departments, in a dire economic environment, and put us on a road to a very different kind of public sector despite the continued high level of borrowing. In future, the government will spend quite a lot on social security, health, defence and education - and not very much else. The opposition may continue to protest, but the reality is that a majority of the public has accepted both the direction of change - and the broader argument for the austerity that gave rise to it. And Labour has had to accept those things too. • James Forsyth at Coffee House says George Osborne decision to put welfare at the centre of the SR was a reminder \"that he remains a thoroughly political Chancellor\". • Fraser Nelson at the Spectator presents the SR in five graphs. • Duncan Weldon at Touchstone says that, in macroeconomic terms, the SR was a non-event and that the increases in capital spending are an illusion. • Iain Martin at the Telegraph says that the SR was a \"tidying up exercise\" and that it may get disrupted by the global markets. • Mary Riddell at the Telegraph says Osborne has effectively killed off the NHS ringfence. Here's the Guardian's Comment is free panel on the SR, with contributions from Polly Toynbee, Jonathan Portes, Melissa Kite, Sue Marsh, Tom Clark, Ian Mulheirn, Gavin Kelly and Tony Travers. From Jane Hutt, finance minister in the Labour-led Welsh government Today’s announcement on the Spending Round confirms the challenge we face in delivering our priorities. However, I was pleased to hear the Chancellor commit to giving a response to Silk in the near future and that he recognised our impressive plans for upgrading the M4. The Barnett Formula means the UK Government’s settlement for Wales will reflect their priorities. Our challenge is to manage how we can deliver our priorities within this settlement. With £11.5bn of UK Government cuts, this was always going to have a negative impact on all of us. The Spending Round shows that we are taking a 2% cut between 2014-15 and 2015-16. Overall, our budget in 2015-16 will be £280m lower in real terms than our budget in 2014-15. It’s also worth remembering that these cuts come on top of those we have already had to manage since 2010 - so by 2015-16, our Budget will be lower by £1,680m in real terms than it was in 2010-11. From Michelle Mitchell, Age UK’s director general Winter fuel payments are simple to understand and generally do not need to be claimed, avoiding the complexity of means-testing. While the introduction of a temperature test could allay concerns about ex-pats in hot countries receiving the payment, it is important that proposals for change do not complicate the system or result in those in need losing out. From Dave Prentis, the Unison general secretary Today’s spending review reveals the true extent of the government’s failure. The Chancellor has got it horribly wrong - despite all the promises, the austerity measures and cuts, he still hasn’t got the country out of recession. We are still in the slowest economic recovery in 100 years and yet all we get from this chancellor is more of the same. The government is losing grip on economic reality if they continue travelling down the same path, expecting to arrive at a different destination. They need a plan B and they need it now. The idea that the NHS is being ring-fenced would be laughable if it wasn’t so sad. We’ve all paid into the NHS and we expect it to be there to deliver when we need it. From Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary George Osborne’s comprehensive spending review offers no hope and no growth and will cast the UK into economic gloom for the next decade. With over 80 per cent of the cuts yet to come, it is clear that there will be no let up in the misery that the coalition is inflicting on ordinary families trying to make ends meet. Don’t expect this chancellor to create jobs for our kids, to support families struggling with soaring energy bills or ease off on the destruction of our NHS. Instead, we face a future of economic misery where the chill winds of self defeating austerity continue to howl through town halls and communities up and down the country. Services that people rely on are already at breaking point and local authorities will be pushed to the brink of going bust thanks to this further round of cuts. With our economy on life support, our nation desperately needs spades in the ground to get Britain building. We need spending to boost jobs and growth now, not in five or ten years time and an end to the economic misery this chancellor is causing. This is what George Osborne said about the single local growth fund in his speech. We’re also embarking on major reforms to the way we spend money locally through the creation of the Single Local Growth Fund that Lord Heseltine proposed. This will be £2 billion pounds a year – that’s at least £10 billion over the next Parliament - that Local Enterprise Partnerships can bid for and the details will be set out tomorrow. Our philosophy is simple: trust people to make their own decisions and they will usually make better ones. Lord Heseltine, who proposed the single local growth fund idea in his report No Stone Unturned report, was speaking at a conference in Manchester and he welcomed the announcement. This is the biggest shift of resources from London to the rest of England that I can ever remember. It is a huge shift. This is a visionary reversion of history by a very imaginative chancellor. I set out the scale of the problem and this government has taken a huge first step in the direction of reversing the decade, centuries, of centralism. It is an unbelievable opportunity for local people to influence that size of money. But he may have been being diplomatic. He wanted decentralisation to go much further, and he proposed a single funding pot worth £49bn over four years. Osborne's will only be worth £8bn over four years. Commenting on the announcement, Ed Cox from IPPR North said: The Single Local Growth Fund is a pigeon step in the right direction, but given that Lord Heseltine proposed a £49 billion fund over 4 years, the announcement is less than one fifth of that which LEPs might have hoped for, only going to prove once again how hard Whitehall finds putting the rhetoric of decentralisation into practice. Mark Brown has sent me this. English Heritage today welcomed George Osborne's announcement of a one-off lump sum of £80m and the creation of a new self-financing charity to look after the 420 historic sites in its care. The heritage deal is seen as a good one. The £80m will help fund the heaving backlog of work required across a portfolio that includes Stonehenge, Audley End and Charles Darwin's home Down House in Kent. Consultation will begin on setting up a charity, by March 2015, that will keep the name English Heritage and in time will be self-financing. In other words it will no longer need taxpayer support. The organisation's planning and heritage protection responsibilities will be taken on by a body to be known initially as the National Heritage Protection Service, “until a friendlier title is chosen.” A statement from English Heritage said: “This is an excellent outcome to an extremely challenging spending review. This year we have been celebrating 100 years of state protection for heritage and today's announcement sets the scene for the next century.” Here is some reaction to the environmental measures. From Guy Shrubsole, a Friends of the Earth campaigner The environment has taken another big hit in this review on top of the 30 per cent cut Defra suffered two years ago. This will mean less money to protect wildlife and reverse the decline in nature at the same time as Government planning reforms give free rein to developers to damage our green and pleasant land. Meanwhile, with climate change making extreme weather in the UK worse, a government commitment to new flood defences is absolutely vital, and the minimum that flood-stricken communities deserve. From Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP Osborne claims that he is unwilling to ‘make the children of the future pay for the mistakes of the past’, yet by ignoring the warnings on climate change from the international scientific community, economists and environmentalists, he is doing exactly that. Last night, President Obama outlined the urgent need to act on climate change and the benefits this would bring the American people in terms of manufacturing, jobs and protection from the impacts of climate change. By committing the government to reckless spending on polluting high carbon infrastructure such as roads, airports and shale gas instead of investing in the jobs-rich green economy through, for example, renewable energy and energy efficiency, George Osborne is denying the British people those same huge benefits – and a more positive vision of the future. And here's some reaction to the plans for some health and social care budgets to be merged. From Sir Merrick, Cockell, chair of the Local Government Association The government has made a positive, practical move in delivering on our call for the transfer of money from the health budget to help deliver services which keep people healthy, independent and out of hospital. Today’s announcement is a start towards addressing the very real crisis in providing care to some of the most vulnerable members of society. It will ultimately save taxpayers money and improve the quality of care people receive. The £2 billion we have secured on behalf of local government will help deliver a much more efficient use of taxpayers’ money by reducing the need for expensive medical treatments. However, this transfer does not disguise the fact that council funding will have been cut by the equivalent of four times this amount across the life of this Parliament. This cut is having a severe impact on local services, including those this money is designed to support. From Michelle Mitchell, Age UK's director general We are pleased that the Government has recognised the extent of the care crisis and in difficult economic times has decided to ease the burden on the health &amp; social care system by investing in better integrated services. Age UK has long argued that poor social care results in avoidable additional costs to the NHS because of delayed discharges and preventable hospital admissions. This investment must reach frontline social care services if it is to make a real difference to the lives of vulnerable older people. Local authorities, who provide the lion’s share of social care services, are facing budget cuts of another 10%, so the Government must ensure that today’s announcement is not just used to plug the hole in council budgets. Better integration between health and social care is the right approach, but the social care system is on the verge of collapse due to a perfect storm of an ageing population and local authority spending cuts. Whilst the population of over 85s has risen by 8% since 2010, £810 million less in real terms has been spent on social care services for older people. From Dr Clive Peedell, co-leader of the National Health Action Party Integration of health and social care is to be welcomed in principle, but this is just a transfer resources from the NHS to social care. There is no extra funding and this will only damage our healthcare system. And here's some reaction to the welfare cap proposal. (See 2.30pm.) From Ann Marie Carrie, Barnardo’s chief executive With average incomes set to be £1,250 per year lower in 2015 than they were in 2007, the government must apply extreme caution before further capping spending on those benefits that provide a crucial safety net for families facing financial crisis. Many parents are barely able to scrape together enough to run a household and any further drop in income risks plunging them into poverty, compromising the health and life chances of their children. The government must consult fully to ensure that plans to cap Annually Managed Expenditure (AME) do not have the knock-on effect of pushing more families below the breadline. From Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice Imposing an artificial cap on some welfare spending is a huge gamble. The Treasury is capping its ability to respond appropriately to changes in the economic situation, which removes government’s ability to provide a strong and fair safety net. People’s legitimate need for support should decide spending levels, not the other way round. Forcing ministers into a situation where they choose between political embarrassment, or meeting vulnerable people’s living costs, may mean that people with a disability, or who are struggling to meet housing costs, do not get the help they need. From Michelle Mitchell, Age UK's director general Benefits such as pension credit and housing benefit are a vital lifeline to low income pensioners, providing millions of older people with an acceptable income level. Yet with 1.6 million older people living below the poverty line, any future cuts to these benefits will deal a sharp blow to the poorest and most vulnerable pensioners, who have very few options to increase their incomes, and are likely to increase pensioner poverty. From Richard Hawkes, chief executive of the disability charity Scope Disabled people will be extremely concerned about the cap on welfare. After £28.3bn of cuts, disabled people can’t bear any further squeezes on their living standards. This is about the kind of society we want to live in, and this announcement represents a huge change in the way we think about social security. Some disabled people will always need financial support. It doesn’t make them scroungers or skivers. The AME cap divorces the provision of welfare from the demand for it. Where’s the fairness in that? From Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter It’s absolutely vital that a cap on welfare spending doesn’t result in further cuts to housing benefit, which would be a disaster for families already battling to stay in their homes. From Alison Garnham, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group The cap risks rationing decency and increasing child poverty. The main drivers of increased social security spending actually lie outside of the benefits system – an ageing population, low pay and rising housing and childcare costs. But the cap ignores this. It says that although the fault lies elsewhere, the people who will pay the price for the failure to tackle these root causes will be families who have done nothing wrong but, for a time, have to rely on benefits. Caps could distort policy by incentivising measures that cut DWP spending even though they drive up child poverty and government spending in other areas – child poverty costs us £29 billion a year. Here is some reaction to the plans to impose new conditions on jobseekers. (See 2.28pm.) From Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice Seven days is a long time to wait before being caught by the safety net. This could mean families who have fallen on hard times being unable to eat or heat their homes, relying even more on food banks which are already breaking under the strain of demand, or turning to payday lenders. The Chancellor must explain if people moving in and out of temporary or low paid work, or on zero-hours contracts, will be penalised if their work dries up and they face seven days with no income. The uncertainty this creates for people in precarious employment completely undermines the stability Universal Credit is intended to provide.\" The Spending Round 2013: Policy Costings document shows there is great deal of uncertainty about the effect these policy changes will have on the time that people will spend off benefits. Now that the Social Fund has been abolished, and with food banks running dry, the government must explain how it will support families through this time to cope without any income. From Leslie Morphy, chief executive of Crisis Our clients already have to deal with long delays before benefit claims are processed, leaving them penniless in some cases. Making people who lose their job or are on low wages ineligible to claim for a week on top of this will needlessly leave more people utterly destitute. This arbitrary move will lead to debt, unheated rooms, unpaid rent, hunger and homelessness. A cruel and senseless measure and one we call on the government to reconsider. From Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group The decision to delay eligibility for Job Seekers Allowance to seven days is a ‘foodbanks first’ policy that will hurt families stuck in the low pay – no pay cycle, moving in and out of insecure, low-paid jobs, and will lengthen foodbank queues. We’re talking about parents doing the right thing but who have very little in the way of savings to tide them over if they lose their job. There should be no doubt this will leave more families and children cold and hungry and push more families towards doorstep lenders and foodbanks. From Chris Goulden, head of poverty at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation People who lose their jobs will now not be able to claim Job Seeker’s Allowance (JSA) until they have been looking for work for seven days. Many will also be required to come into Job Centre Plus (JCP) more often (weekly rather than fortnightly). Without expanding the resources of JCP, this implies they will receive less interaction with an adviser per visit. The key to good job outcomes is personalised support as soon as possible. There’s a risk that the quality of support will decline and people will be left without recourse to funds when they become unemployed. Already nearly half of people eligible don’t bother to claim for JSA. And there are already significant delays in getting benefits to people in need. The dangers are compounded by the uncertainty surrounding Social Fund support since its localisation this year. We want unemployed people to claim their entitlements and be given the support they need to get back into work as quickly as possible. It's best to get your spelling right when going on about language skills. This is from the Tory MP Andrew Selous. This is from Jonathan Edwards, Plaid Cymru's Treasury spokesman. Today’s CSR paints a grim picture of further austerity ahead for Wales. The Tory Chancellor George Osborne laid a political trap for Labour that they have fallen into hook, line, and sinker by publicly accepting austerity cuts if they form the next government. This leaves the people of Wales with absolutely no difference between Tory austerity and Labour austerity. Austerity has failed on its own terms – it has been self-defeating, with the economy either in recession or stagnant in recent years. Even the IMF – the high priests of austerity – have realised the error of their ways and called on the Government to ease the cuts and spend much more on infrastructure to grow the economy. Labour’s commitment to Tory spending plans will bring real harm to the people of Wales where this year, cuts to social security will take over £1billion from the Welsh economy. Not only have the so-called Opposition proposed a regional benefits cap, they have also failed to commit to scrapping the devastating bedroom tax policy. Plaid Cymru represents the only hope for struggling communities and businesses in Wales. We reject austerity and have put forward plans for a massive expansion in investment in vital public services and building schools, hospitals and transport links in order to create jobs and grow the economy. And this is also from Patrick Butler. Local authorities warned that essential services would be stretched to “breaking point” after the chancellor George Osborne announced a 10% cut in funding for councils. Council leaders said the reduction for 2015-16, coming on the back of a 33% reduction in councils budgets for the 2011-15 period, meant libraries, leisure centres and school support services would bear the brunt of the cuts. A further 144,000 local government jobs would disappear by 2015-16, the chancellor predicted, a figure which comes on top of the 312,000 already cut in the first two years of the Coalition. The chancellor said local government’s 10% budget cut amounted to a 2% cut once other sources of income were taken into account. “We have to ask local government for the kind of sacrifice central government is making”. He announced £2bn of new investment for councils to set up integrated health and social care services, £3bn of capital investment in affordable housing and an additional £200m for the Troubled families initiative, which would be extended to 400,000 “high risk” households. Councils would be funded to enable them to freeze council tax bills for 2014-15 and 2015-16. This would save £100 a year off the average council tax bill, Osborne said. Community budget pilots, in which public services in each locality work together to find efficiency savings, will be extended, alongside a £30m fund to encourage fire, and ambulance services to merge. Details of a £2bn a year investment in local economic growth funds would be published on Thursday. Communities secretary Eric Pickles, who the chancellor called in his speech “the model of lean government,” said that the settlement for his department represented “a fair deal for councils and a fair deal for council tax payers.” There's little in today's spending review to affect the Britain's broad economic outlook, argues Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global insight. He writes: The spending cuts of £11.5 billion announced for 2015/16 had already been flagged up by the Chancellor in the budget and this is essentially providing the detail of where they will actually occur. There are no more spending cuts in total to occur than had already been announced. Similarly, while the Chancellor announced that £50 billion of capital spending will be made in 2015/16 and set out capital spending pans to 2020/21, this confirmed the figures set in the March budget. No extra investment spending has been introduced on top of the extra £3 billion a year from 2015/16 that was set out in the March budget. It is again mainly a case of setting out where the capital spending will occur. Archer argues that Osborne may be feeling a little more bullish about life, now that economic growth is back. However, the Treasury may be concerned about the recent rise in UK borrowing costs (as measured by the 'yield' on British gilts): Sustained markedly higher interest rates could significantly damage the Chancellor’s ability to meet his fiscal targets. As this graph above shows, the yield on Britain's 10-year bonds was around 5% in summer 2008 before the collapse of Lehman Brother, falling to record lows of 1.45% in summer 2012. In recent weeks, though, they're risen back to 2.5%. This is from Patrick Butler. The chancellor George Osborne moved to place a cap the on the £157bn UK welfare budget by introducing controls on spending on housing benefit, disability allowances, tax credits and some pensioner benefits. But the cap, designed to limit expenditure on so-called annually managed expenditure, and dubbed “a limit on the nation’s credit card” by the chancellor, will not affect the state pension, which accounts for over half of social security spending. Campaigners are concerned that the move failed to address the underlying causes of rising welfare spending, such as low wages, lack of jobs and rising rents. They say the move represented a huge change in the way welfare is managed, by breaking the link between the provision of social security from the need for it. Osborne also signalled a range of measures to tighten up eligibility for social security benefits, including a seven day wait before people can sign on after losing their job. Claimants who do not speak English will be required that people must agree learn English as a condition of receiving benefits, the chancellor said, and if they refused their benefits would be cut. Lone parents with children aged as young as three will be forced to regularly attend job centres in order to claim benefits, while all job seekers will be asked to sign on weekly instead of fortnightly. A new “upfront work search” scheme will be launched, under which jobseekers will have to turn up with a cv and “start looking for work.” Although the chancellor made it clear he would protect pensioner benefits he announced an annual “temperature test” which will restrict winter fuel payments to pensioners who live abroad in warmer climates: “People who live in hot countries will no longer get it. It is, after all, a payment for winter fuel,” said Osborne. Here is some business reaction to the SR. From John Cridland, CBI director general The chancellor has carefully walked a tightrope of protecting growth, while making sizeable savings to pay down the debt. Infrastructure is rightly singled out as the most effective engine for growth, as we urged. While the Government talks a good game on infrastructure we’ve seen too little delivery on the ground so far. It is critical we see a real pipeline of projects announced tomorrow, so investors know what schemes are going ahead, where and when. Other pro-growth areas including science, innovation, skills and exports have also been shielded from cuts. The £185 million boost for the Technology Strategy Board - a crucial anchor for innovation - is particularly welcome. With stretched government finances it is tough but necessary to target automatic progression pay in the public sector. It is encouraging to see that government will have greater control of the welfare budget through the new cap. The next big challenge to address is the issue of ring-fencing to ensure that efficiency flows across all parts of the public sector. From John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce In many respects, businesses will be encouraged by what they have heard from the chancellor. He and his team have signalled important investments in areas like transport, science, education, innovation and defence procurement, which are of great importance to companies of all sizes. Business will also be pleased to see an end to automatic increases in public sector pay, and will support moves to begin to tame welfare spending. Yet more must be done. For our economic future to be great, rather than just acceptable, Britain needs a more radical shift in public expenditure to underpin a truly enterprise-friendly environment. Infrastructure, exports, and access to finance must be top priorities not just for the next few years, but for decades to come. From Mark Boleat, policy chairman at the City of London Corporation The additional £9bn in capital spending for London by 2020 outlined today by the Chancellor is vital to supporting jobs and growth. The government’s readiness to consider the case for a Crossrail 2 line is also most welcome. Investment in infrastructure pays for itself over the long-term and it is imperative we act now to meet rising demand on the capital’s transport network. As an international gateway for business, we cannot afford to stand still while our rivals across the globe are building for the future. From Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors The Spending Review leaves business feeling like Oliver Twist. More please, chancellor. Please could you go further and faster with spending restraint? Please could you shift even more expenditure from current spending towards infrastructure? Please could you widen the welfare cap to include pensions? But please could you also do less ring-fencing of spending in departments such as the NHS. The chancellor made many welcome announcements in the spending review, including the 1% limit to public sector pay growth and the intention to curtail automatic pay progression - regardless of performance - within the public sector. This, combined with previous policies aimed at decentralising public sector pay, is creating a quiet revolution in public services. Taken together with the commitment to accelerate the free schools programme, the spending review had a radical supply-side dash. Here's Frances O'Grady, the TUC general secertary, on the SR. This is a toxic mix of bad economics, nasty politics and dishonest presentation. The last thing our struggling economy needs is further cuts to spending to try to close a deficit made worse by the Chancellor’s earlier cuts. When the medicine is not working and side effects are choking the patient you need a change in treatment not more of the same. Many services will be hard hit. Worst of all is a new attack on some of the most vulnerable in our society through the seven day wait and other conditions for social security payments. The chancellor may think attacks on welfare go down well with voters, but these will lead to parents not having enough cash to feed their children. And for all the talk of new investment, the truth is that the overall capital spend in 2015 will be exactly the same as the chancellor forecast in his budget earlier this year. Perhaps the most eye-catching announcement in the speech was the one about the Waterloo battlefield. Perhaps this was another sop to Ukip. (\"Is there anything you like about Britain?\" someone asked Ukip supporters recently after hearing them moan about everything at a focus group session. \"The past\", one of them replied.) Richard Norton-Taylor has sent me this. The site of the Battle of Waterloo, south of Brussels, will be restored in time for the 200th anniversary on 18 June, 2015, the chancellor announced in a move reflecting government plans to commemorate British military engagements beyond those of the 1914-16 world war. The government also wants to commmorate the anniversary of the Battle of Agincourt, where Henry V beat the French, on 25 October, 1415. For years the site at Waterloo has been neglected from the victor’s point of with cafes and souvenir shops dominated by Napoleon. The biggest monument is the Lion’s Mound commorating the spot where the Prince of Orange, Britain’s ally was wounded. The Wellington Museum is situated in a modest building in the village of Waterloo hidden from the battlefield. Funds for the site of the battle, fought in 1815, will be provided by the Department of Culture, Media, &amp; Sport. When he made this announcement in his speech, Osborne used it as a peg for a joke about Labour. Waterloo was \"a great victory for coalition forces over a discredited former regime that impoverished millions,\" he said. Here's Ian Sample on the science announcements. George Osborne declared the settlement for science a “huge investment” for the area and spoke of hopes to make Britain once again a country where the future is invented. In practice, that means continuing the freeze on the science research budget, which has been held at £4.6bn since the spending review in 2010. The flat cash settlement back then equates to a cut in real terms over the period, as inflation takes its toll. But the chancellor pledged a major increase in capital spending, up by 9% at the Department of Business, Innovation and skills. That will include a raise for science spending from £600m to £1.1bn a year until the 2021, a move that will help the long term planning and expansion of scientific projects. In 2010, the government pulled capital spending out of the science budget, and slashed it by half. The deficit has since been made up, with new money announced over 2011/12 for high performance computing, the UK space agency and an institute dedicated to the wonder material, graphene. During his speech, Osborne urged scientists in Britain to “keep inventing, keep delivering” and promised that the country would “back you all the way.” Projects the government has pledged to back include the synergistic air-breathing rocket engine (Sabre) and a new supercomputer for the Met Office. Osborne added: “Scientific discovery is first and foremost an expression of the relentless human search to leasrn more about our world, but it’s also an enormous strength for a modern economy. From synthetic biology to graphene, Britain is very good at it and we’re going to keep it that way.” To the relief of many scientists, the Medical Research Council will not move the the Department of Health, a move that was being considered by Vince Cable to save costs. Here's Natalie Bennett, the Green party leader, on the SR. The cuts in the departments for the environment and energy of 10% and 8% are disturbing and will surely see essential programmes and policies even further neglected, when what we need to see is proper planning on our energy future and protection of our natural world. The claim that flood defence spending is being 'protected' doesn't stand up to scrutiny. With inflation remaining high, the maintenance of what was already inadequate spending in cash terms is a significant cut in the actual protection that will be able to be provided. The chancellor's continuing promotion of shale gas exploration threatens to lock us into a high cost energy future, whilst making it impossible to meet our carbon emissions targets. This is clearly an ideologically driven spending review, George Osborne taking one of his last chances to slash away at the British state, undercutting the core policies and plans that we need to have in place. We saw where that got us in the Department for Transport with the West Coast mainline tendering debacle - we can sadly expect many more of the same, as demoralised, overworked officials are left in understaffed, underresourced departments. Ed Balls has just been interviewed on the BBC. He was pressed on whether he would accept various George Osborne proposals. While stressing that we need to see the details, and that there were not many details in the document issued today, he did seem to sign up to some of the most controversial ones. We need to look at the detail, obviously. On the welfare things, English language for incoming migrants - definitely. For the seven-day [the seven-day wait before people can claim jobseeker's allowance] - is it going to be a blank cheque for Wonga? Let's look at the detail. If it saves money and it works, fine. In terms of pay progression, again, we have got to look at this. Is it actually going to work and save money? Or, if you move to individualised performance-related pay, does it end up costing more? I don't know the answer to that, but we'll study it. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, did not particularly like the SR. The chancellor has announced some welcome savings which will ease the pressure on taxpayers now and in the future, including some sensible changes to the welfare system and an attempt to end the absurdity of pensioners on the Costa del Sol getting the Winter Fuel Payment. Tens of billions of pounds are still being wasted by bloated bureaucracies each year, so there is plenty of room for further cuts. Unfortunately Mr Osborne is still boasting about squandering enormous amounts on foreign aid and vanity projects in the energy sector, while other developed economies are showing more restraint. This is from Mark Tran on aid. Aid will rise significantly in the next few years as the coalition government meets the longstanding UN aid target of 0.7% of gross national income. According to Treasury documents released under the spending review, total UK aid will rise to £11.7bn in 2014-15 and £12.2bn in the following year. Last year the UK spent £8.5bn on on official development assistance (ODA), roughly £137 per head. George Osborne acknowledged opposition in Tory ranks to the government’s decision to protect the UK’s aid budget but said he refused to balance the books on the backs of the poor. The chancellor said he was proud to support a government that is the first to meet the 0.7% target. Osborne had announced in his March budget that the coalition would meet the target this year. Foreign aid - along with health and schools in England - has been “ringfenced”, which has not gone down well with many Tory backbenchers who think the aid budget should not escape the axe. Foreign aid, health and schools spending were also protected in the 2010 spending review. This means that the reductions in spending since 2010 have fallen more heavily on other departments. The same applies to cuts for 2015/16. I thought the line about compulsory English lessons for jobseekers who do not speak the language would go down well with Ukip. (See 1.39pm.) But a Ukip spokesman has just been on the BBC dismissing the idea. He did not like the idea of the taxpayer funding these courses, he says. (Lesson for David Cameron. You can never win with this lot!) This is from Stewart Hosie, the SNP's Treasury spokesman, on the SR. The chancellor has had to make these swingeing cuts in spending for one simple reason. He has failed to meet every target he has set himself in terms of borrowing, deficit reduction and growth. Given that he has failed so far the chancellor must explain why he is now set on a course that will make the same mistakes again. Capital cuts continue, he is cutting revenue and sucking more consumption out of the economy. He has had the UK’s credit rating downgraded and even with these huge cuts the UK will still have one of the worst deficits in the developed world by 2015, the point at which George Osborne promised we would be well on the road to recovery. Even more shameful is that Labour have now subscribed to George Osborne’s cuts as a ‘starting point‘ for their austerity plans. This current round of cuts takes us to 2016 and Osborne today promised they will continue for years to come, so a Yes vote next September is now even more important to ensure we no longer have a discredited, failed Westminster Chancellor of a government we didn’t vote for and don’t want squeezing hard working families in Scotland. This is from Alan Travis on the Home Office budget. Sharp increases of up to 10% each year in visa fees for those coming to work or study in Britain over the next two years are to be introduced to cushion the impact of a further 6% cut in the Home Office budget. This increase in visa fees, some of which are already more than £800, will be the second substantial rise in the three years. The Home Office said that visitor visas fees will also be increased by up to 6% over the next two years. The cost of a basic tier two visa for a sponsored skilled migrant in Britain is already £578 and contrasts with only £95 charged for a work permit back in 2003. The Treasury said the increases in visa fees would be accompanied by improvements in the way visa applications were dealt with. The split-up of the UK Border Agency would also generate savings. The policing budget, which has already suffered a 20% cut in Whitehall grants, now faces the prospect of a further in 2015/2016 - general election year, but the Chancellor declined to spell out exactly how much but said it would be less than the overall 6% figure. Home Office officials have made clear that while the police budget has been “relatively protected” immigration will have to take a greater share of the savings. While the budget for counter-terrorism policing has been entirely protected, not all counter-terrorism work has been shielded in the same way raising the prospect that the Prevent programme, which involves local authorities, may face cutbacks. A £50 million innovation fund is to be set up to encourage police forces to colloborate and “share services” with each other and local authorities. George Osborne's decision to switch to gross capital spending rather than using the typical net figure (as flagged up by Heather Stewart here) is attracting criticism. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady has accused Osborne of 'dishonest presentation', explaining: And for all the talk of new investment, the truth is that the overall capital spend in 2015 will be exactly the same as the Chancellor forecast in his Budget earlier this year. Channel 4's Faisal Islam has dug through March's budget, to show that gross capital spending was already scheduled to hit the £50bn figure. The TUC's Duncan Weldon make the same point here: Gross public sector net investment is around £47bn a year and was previously expected to be £50.4bn in 2015/16 according to the OBR (table 4.18). In other words there doesn’t actually appear to be an increase in capital spending. How very misleading. This isn’t a real increase and it is not even scheduled to start for two years, the economy needs a boost now – not smoke and mirrors about the future. Danny Alexander has already fielded some questions on this issue too, on Radio 4. Could run and run Severin Carrell has sent me this from Scotland. Alex Salmond's government has emerged as one of the main beneficiaries of George Osborne's spending review, as the Treasury moved to quell support for Scottish independence. The Scottish government will have the fourth largest budget of any Treasury funded areas and department by 2015, with a total spend of £28.6bn, after the Chancellor increased its capital spending by £400m to £3.3bn, and held its day-to-day spending at near level terms. Scotland's spending will be the next largest after the NHS and education funding in England and Wales, and defence spending, in a move designed to repel Salmond's attacks over his government's reduced spending power. The timing is significant as 4m Scots prepare to vote in the independence referendum in September 2014; the independence movement plans to capitalise on discontent with Osborne's heavy cuts in government spending, particularly on welfare. Michael Moore, the Scottish secretary, whose small department will see a 10% budget cut by 2015, said the UK government was responding to Salmond's demands for extra spending by increasing his capital budgets by 12.9% in real terms. This was a “huge spending boost”, he said, before acknowledging that part of the £400m would come from a new borrowing limit of £293m for the Scottish government. The Scottish government's day-to-day revenue spending would fall by 1.9% in real terms by 2015. Moore said that was far lower than the 10% average cuts in Whitehall spending. Under the Treasury's funding formula for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, grants are closely tied to health and education spending in England and Wales, which Osborne has again protected. And this is what the SR document says about progression pay - another potential flashpoint. Despite pay restraint across the public sector since 2010, average public sector pay growth has continued to exceed that in the private sector.40 A key driver of this is progression pay, with some employees enjoying automatic annual pay increases of up to 7 per cent. This is unfair to those public sector employees who have seen their pay awards frozen, or restricted to one per cent, and unfair to the many private sector workers who have seen no or low pay growth. Budget 2013 announced that public sector pay awards in 2015-16 would be limited to an average of up to 1 per cent, saving at least £1.3 billion. The Spending Round announces further action to ensure that public sector workers do not receive an automatic pay increase purely as a result of time in post. Departments will put in place plans to end automatic time-served progression pay in the civil service by 2015-16. Automatic progression for teachers will be abolished. Uplifts for prison officers will become non-contractual and subject to performance assessments. The police have been subject to a two-year progression freeze. Most health staff will be subject to local performance standards which will link progression pay more closely to performance, not time served, and the Government will seek further reforms. This is what George Osborne said in his speech about a new funding formula for schools. School funding across the country is not equally distributed, but distributed on a historical basis with no logical reason. The result is that some schools get much more than others in the same circumstances. It’s unfair and we’re going to put it right. Many MPs from all sides have campaigned for it. My Honourable Friend for Worcester [Robin Walker] has been a particular champion in this Parliament. Now the lowest funded local authorities in this country will at last receive an increase in their per pupil funding as we introduce a national funding formula to ensure that no child in any part of our country is discriminated against. And we will consult on all the details so that we get this historic reform right. On the BBC Paul Johnson, the IFS director, has just said that it is hard to know what this will mean. But there will be winners and losers. If Walker has been campaigning for this, I think we can guess that schools in places like Worcester will benefit. This is what the SR document says about merging some health and social care budgets. Action will include: • putting £3.8 billion in a single pooled budget for health and social care services to work more closely together in local areas, based on a plan agreed between the NHS and local authorities. This shared pot includes an additional £2 billion from the NHS and builds on the existing contribution of around £1 billion in 2014-15, with the aim of delivering better, more joined-up services to older and disabled people, to keep them out of hospital and to avoid long hospital stays. To ensure that closer integration between health and social care can start immediately, the NHS will make an extra £200 million available in 2014-15 as an upfront investment in new systems and ways of working that will benefit both services Another key announcement was about the welfare cap. This is what Osborne said about it in his speech. We’ve already capped the benefits of individuals – now we cap the system as a whole. Under that system we inherited, welfare spending was put in a category called Annually Managed Expenditure. But the problem was it wasn’t managed at all. The cost of welfare went up by a staggering 50 per cent - even before the crash. Our Welfare Cap will stop that happening again. The Cap will be set each year at the Budget for four years. It will apply from April 2015. It will reflect forecast inflation, but it will be set in cash terms. In future, when a government looks set to breach the Cap because it is failing to control welfare, the OBR will issue a public warning. The government will then be forced to take action to cut welfare costs or publicly breach the Cap. We’ll exclude a small number of the most cyclical benefits that directly rise and fall with the unemployment rate – to preserve the automatic stabilisers. Housing benefit, tax credits, disability benefits, and pensioner benefits will all be included. But the State Pension will not. As I said earlier, one of the most newsy announcements in the SR was the package of new conditions for people claiming jobseeker's allowance. Here are the details. I've taken them from the SR document. The Spending Round announces new measures to support people to move into work, to improve welfare spending control and to ensure that the welfare system remains affordable. Building on the current regime, the Spending Round announces a significant reform package that increases the support and requirements placed upon claimants by: • introducing upfront work search, requiring all claimants to prepare for work and search for jobs right from the start of their claim; • introducing weekly rather than fortnightly visits to Jobcentres for half of all jobseekers; • requiring all unemployed claimants, and those earning less than the Government expects them to, to wait seven days before becoming eligible for financial support; • requiring all claimants who are subject to conditionality to verify their claim every year; • requiring all claimants whose poor spoken English is a barrier to work to improve their English language skills; and • requiring lone parents who are not working to prepare for work once the youngest child turns three. Together these reforms will deliver over £350 million in annual savings, including savings from claimants leaving welfare more quickly. All of these savings will be reinvested in more help for claimants to get back into work and in the cost of enforcing the new conditions. As promised, here are some extracts from Ed Balls' response to George Osborne. Isn't your economic failure the reason why you are back here today? More cuts to the police, more cuts to our defence budgets, more cuts to our local services. (You) have failed on living standards, growth, and the deficit, and families and businesses are paying the price for your failure. You pledged to get the banks lending but lending is down month on month on month. You made the number one test of your economic credibility keeping the AAA credit rating but on your watch we have been down-graded not once but twice. You promised living standards would rise but they are falling year on year on year. You said we were all in this together but then you gave a huge tax cut to millionaires. You promised to balance the books but that promise is in tatters. Failed tests, broken promises - your friends call you George, the President calls you Jeffrey but to everyone else you are just Bungle ... Even Zippy [a reference to David Cameron, who was laughing] on the frontbench can't stop smiling ... It doesn't have to be this way. Instead of planning cuts in 2015, two years ahead, surely the chancellor should be taking bold action now to boost growth this year and next. Investment that would get our economy growing, get the tax revenues coming in, more revenues which would mean our police, armed forces and public services would not face such deep cuts in 2015. If the chancellor continues with his failing economic plan, it will be for the next Labour government to turn the economy round, to take the tough decisions, to get the deficit down in a fair way ... I have to say to the chancellor - there is no point boasting about infrastructure investment in five or seven years time, we need action now. Instead of action to boost growth and long-term investment all we got today is more of the same from a failing chancellor ... We have called for a cap on social security, we fully support the triple lock on the pension, something not even mentioned in the chancellor's statement. The fact is the chancellor tried to set a cap in 2010 on social security spending, and he has overspent his cap by £21 billion. Industry groups have given a muted reaction to the spending review. Mike Cherry, national policy chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, warns that a skills gap could still hurt industry: It is good that the Government has taken a long term view of how to plan capital spending to the end of the decade. The FSB said in its submission that a longer-term view needed to be taken. However what we now need is a clear timetable for delivery. Small firms tell us that school leavers aren’t ready for the world of work with many concerned about their ability in maths and English. Giving the funding direct to schools should be used to address this issue. The continued investment in science, technology and apprenticeships is also good news. EEF, which represents manufacturers, reckons the review is \"as good as can be expected\". And the The Work Foundation said Osborne could have been bolder. It's director, Ian Brinkley, said: As called for in our submission, the government has protected the science and innovation budget, with a welcome boost for the Technology Strategy Board.... However, the review was disappointingly timid in following Lord Heseltine’s recommendations to devolve resources to the local level. And this is from Henry McDonald in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland's regional budget has emerged relatively unaffected by the cuts as health and education form a large part of public spending in the province. However, its proposed resource budget for 2015/2016 will be cut by two per cent. The Police Service of Northern Ireland meanwhile are one of the few winners in the review with an extra £31 million reflecting ongoing concerns about security, street disorder linked to the flags issue and the continued threat from dissident republican terrorism. The Chancellor's decision to end automatic hikes in pay for civil servants including ultimately teachers, prison staff and police means that most of the public sector in the province will no longer receive annual pay increases based on their length of service. Mark Brown is at Northern Ballet's headquarters in Leeds. He's sent me this. It is a relief,” said Mark Skipper, chief executive of Leeds-based Northern Ballet, as George Osborne announced a 5% cut for arts organisations. \"Especially given that we were looking at modellings of 15% and the devastation that would cause. I think 5% is a good outcome.” That response will be echoed across the arts and museum sector. The DCMS has agreed a budget reduction of 7%, from which cuts to Arts Council England and national museums will be limited to 5%. The Treasury, it seems, listened to arguments that any more would spell disaster for a sector that is buoyant artistically but also a significant cash generator for the UK. Osborne said that national museums would have greater freedoms to use their budgets as they saw fit. But the DCMS cut is not the whole story. Also of worry are the 10% cuts to local government on which many arts groups rely on for funding. Some had feared a repeat of 2010 when the Arts Council was given a 30% cut (including an order to cut its administration costs by half) from which arts organisations were cut 15%. That led to an enormous shake up, agonising for some - 206 organisations lost their regular funding – but good for others with 110 brought in to the portfolio for the first time. What happens now? If you're the National Gallery, say, then it is straightforward - you make provision for a 5% cut. If you're funded by ACE and/or local authorities then you make your application for funding and you wait. Arts organisations will have to submit applications and decisions will be made strategically – some may get cut, some may get an increase. Gwyn Topham has been looking at transport. On transport, the chancellor has taken with one hand but given with the other. The Department for Transport’s day-to-day budget has been cut by 9%, but George Osborne said the capital budget for long-term schemes would rise to £9.5bn - an extra £2bn on 2014-15. He indicated that Transport for London’s grant will take a major hit, and the government would also “bear down on the running costs” of rail administration. However, he also vowed to preserve mayor Boris Johnson’s annual capital budget of £1.8bn until 2020 - ie, allowing London to continue to invest in tube upgrades and projects such as the Northern Line extension. That means fares may well rise again and some bus services are likely to suffer - news that comes on a day that TfL announced £2.5m in bonuses to executives. Network Rail’s long-term budget is effectively ringfenced for now and Osborne pledged to continue “record” investment, but will be looking for more savings. Cuts in the budget may also affect road maintenance, even as Osborne promised to build more new ones than for 50 years. The chancellor referenced projects mainly already announced: road spending, Crossrail and HS2 - whose budget is likely to get cross-party approval in a paving bill this afternoon. But he also endorsed looking at Crossrail 2, a new north-south rail line in London. Transport will though be the beneficiary of much of the £100bn in infrastructure projects that Danny Alexander will detail tomorrow (£300bn in total pledged until the end of the decade). Transport projects may also pick up some crumbs in a Local Growth fund the chancellor announced - but of just £2bn, lower than expected. This is Damian Carrington's verdict. Osborne has, like in 2010, inflicted the worst level of cuts on the department for environment, food and rural affairs. He pledged to support flood defence spending - the department's really big ticket item - but Treasury documents show that this spending will remain level in cash terms. That's a real terms cut when the need for flood defences is rising due to climate change. And here's Owen Gibson on sport. Almost one year on from a hugely successful Olympic Games, the extent of the promised legacy for sport on which it was secured is under the microscope. Recent figures from Sport England showed that fewer people are playing sport regularly than they were before the Olympics and the 5% cut for community sport, part of an overall 7% cut to the DCMS announced today threatens to damage the government in perception terms. But in practice, the cut to the exchequer-funded portion of Sport England's grassroots sport budget – which applies only to resource funding and not capital projects - will amount only to a few million pounds. The majority of its £300m annual budget now comes from the Lottery following changes to the way that money is distributed. The sports minister, Hugh Robertson, is believed to be satisfied with the result of the spending negotiations after making the argument that deeper cuts would undermine the Olympic legacy case. The budget for elite Olympic and Paralympic sport, which will see £355m invested by UK Sport over the four years to 2016, was ringfenced as part of a deal unveiled during the Olympics when the medals were raining in. The more profound questions for the Olympic legacy, aside from whether Sport England can effect a genuine shift in the nation's sport habits with its comparatively meagre budget, come as a result of the further cuts to local authority budgets that will inevitably lead to pressure on faciltiies and community sport programmes. This is from Ian Black and Neil Johnston on the Foreign Office settlement. Foreign and Commonwealth Office spending is to be be cut by 8% in 2015 but plans are proceeding to open more embassies in what the chancellor called the “emerging world” and focus British diplomacy on commercial opportunities in “growing markets” from Shanghai to Abuja. The FCO is expected to make £70m worth of savings by “co-locating” UK missions with Commonwealth and EU countries and continuing an existing programme to reduce UK-based-staff by 10% by 2015. Other savings are like to be found from programmes dealing with counter-terrorism, human rights and Arab partnerships. Another tried efficiency is the creation of regional “hubs” providing corporate services to a number of British missions in the same region. One bright spot is the announcement of £70m to be shared with UKTI to support global economic growth. “The extra money recognises the FCO’s strong track record in this field,” a spokesperson said. “By supporting countries in making political and economic reforms we in turn support the UK’s prosperity.” William Hague was praised as “the best foreign secretary in a generation” who had already demonstrated how to make pounds “go further.” It had been anticpated that the FCO might get off lighter than other departments due to claims around around conflict and peacekeeping. FCO spending is largely on salaries and buildings rather than programmes. Grand premises like the elegant British embassy in Paris give an impression of diplomats living lavishly at taxpayer’s expense — an image dismissed as a misleading carictaure by the FCO. Its budget was already tight after the last spending review in October 2010. It was cut then from £1.6bn in 2011-12 to £1.36bn in 2014/15. Here's Richard Norton-Taylor on the spending increase for the intelligence agencies. The security and intelligence agencies - MI5, MI6, and GCHQ - will benefit from a 3.4% increase in their combined annual budget of nearly £2bn under the government’s spending plans in a move likely to mark the start of a significant long-term trend. The overall defence budget will continue to fall but the chancellor announced a sweetener - fines on banks for fixing Libor rates will fund the military covenant. How this will in practice benefit members of the armed forces, their families, and veterans, was not immediately clear. There will be no further cuts in the numbers of armed forces personnel - 4,480 soldiers have been handed redundancy notices as the force aims to reduce personnel numbers to 82,000 by 2018 from more than 100,000 three years ago. However, the number of civilians working for the Ministry of Defence will be cut further. The government has already announced cuts in defence civilian staff from 75,000 to 40,000 over nine years. The defence resource budget will be maintained in cash terms at £24bn, a cut in real terms, though, as already announced, the defence equipment budget, now totalling £14bn will grow by 1% in real terms in the year 2015/16. Both the armed forces and the intelligence agencies will be spending more money on cyber warfare. MoD contracts with private contractors will be further scrutinised for savings. Rises in the MI5, MI6, and GCHQ budgets reverse this year’s budgetary cuts and was widely expected after the heads of the agencies lobbied for them even before the Woolwich attack on a soldier last month. The security and intelligence budgets are likely to rise for the forseeable future as the amount of money spent on the armed forces falls. This is likely to be a long term trend. My colleague Heather Stewart has sent an economic analysis of the SR. George Osborne was keen to present the Spending Review as the latest stage in a strategic plan to fix the British economy, rather than an emergency cost-cutting exercise. He set out three rather Brownite-sounding principles - reform, growth and fairness - which had guided the Treasury’s decision-making about where the cuts should fall; and which he claimed would help create a “Britain on the rise”. As part of this drive to kick-start growth (and perhaps by being bloody-minded), business secretary Vince Cable managed to secure a minimal, 6% cut in his department’s budget, with spending on science and apprenticeships protected. And even the Foreign Office has promised to expand embassies in fast-growing emerging economies, as it cuts back elsewhere, to help create shopfronts for British businesses abroad. Osborne also emphasised strong infrastructure spending as a key part of his plan. Capital expenditure was cut sharply in the coalition’s spending review in 2010; but since then the Treasury has sought to find extra pounds to spend on upgrading roads, railways and broadband connections in a bid to create the conditions for a sustainable economic recovery. To that end, the chancellor promised that capital spending would be £50bn in 2015-16, and total £300bn over a decade — though that claim was based on gross investment, not the net figure normally used in analysing public spending, which excludes the deterioration in existing assets. It’s also worth noting that even on that measure, capital spending will be unchanged between 2014-15 and 2015-16. Capping Britain’s welfare budget each year in cash terms was also presented by Osborne as part of his economic vision: he said slapping a ceiling on benefits spending would act as a “limit on the nation’s credit card”. However, he has excluded some of the benefits, including Jobseekers Allowance, which rise rapidly when growth slows down: economists call such payments “automatic stabilisers”, because they help in hard times to limit the speed of a slowdown. Here's a Guardian summary of the key points in the spending review. And here's an at-a-glance guide to winners and losers. Here are the key documents you need with all the details of the SR. • Full text of George Osborne's speech • A Treasury summary of the main announcements. • The 66-page spending round 2013 document (pdf). • The 17-page distributional analysis (pdf). • The 22-page policy costings document (pdf). • The 13-page impact on equalities document (pdf). Ed Balls' response to George Osborne was, from what I heard, punchy and fun. He avoided the specifics, but taunted Osborne over his failure to balance the budget according to the timetable he set. His best joke was probably this one. His friends call him George, the president calls him Jeffrey, but to everyone else he's just Bungle. I'll post full extracts later. Snap Verdict: Well, it wasn't boring. We were told that there would be no further welfare cuts, but the string of new conditions being imposed on jobseekers, which Osborne saved for the end, will probably dominate the red-top headlines tomorrow. Some of it, like compulsory English lessons for claimants who do not speak the language, may have come straight out of the Ukip manifesto. Without having seen the small print, it is hard to know quite what impact these measures will have, but they certainly sound old-school Tory. Otherwise, the speech was also full of measures that could, over time refashion the public sector in quite striking ways. For example, he says he wants to merge health and social care budgets, change the way schools are funded, alter the way public sector salaries are paid and impose an overall welfare cap with teeth. It's all big stuff. On health and social care Osborne seems to be lifting a plan from Andy Burnham, but some of these other announcements will pose a challlenge to Labour. More later ... Duncan Weldon, the TUC's senior policy advisor, says the seven-day wait before allowing people to sign on for jobseeker's allowance will cause unnecessary suffering. He also criticises Osborne's decision to raise capital expenditure now, having cut when the economy was weaker: On Osborne's temperature test for the winter fuel allowance, ITN's Jess Brammar points out that the issue over overseas claimants has been around for years: Osborne says these savings bring the total extra welfare savings for 2015 up to £4bn. He winds up there. Third, Osborne says Iain Duncan Smith has changed the debate about welfare. But Osborne says he wants to go further in reducing worklessness. He is introducing upfront work search. People will have to turn up with a CV and look for work. Only then will they get their benefit. Lone parents who qualify for nursery care will have to start looking for work. And there will be a seven-day wait before people can claim benefits. People who lose their job should look for work first. Also, people who do not speak English will have to start learning Engish, or lose their benefits. That's a reasonable requirement, he says. Second, Osborne says he will stop winter fuel payments being paid to people living abroad. From 2015, it will be linked to a temperature test. People in hot countries won't get it. Osborne turns to welfare. The welfare system needs to support those who are old, and those of working age who pay their taxes. The government has already introduced reforms that will save £18bn a year. Every single one was opposed by Labour. Now the government is proposing three new changes. First, it will impose a cap on overall welfare spending. The welfare cap will be set each year at the budget for four years. It will be set at the budget, and it will be set in cash terms. When the government is forecast to breach the cap, the Office for Budget Responsibility will issue a warning. The government will either have to take action, or explaining why it is going to breach the cap. Osborne says state pensions will not be included in the cap. The cap shows the government is serious about controlling spending. Pendle MP Andrew Stephenson isn't rocking the boat: Turning to care, Osborne says old people often fall between the cracks between health and social care. Investing in social care has already kept people out of hospital, he says. He says a significant chunk of health and social care spending will be merged. The budget for this will be £3bn. This is a historic change, he says. It will save the NHS at least £1bn. Integrated health and social care is now longer an aspiration, he says. Osborne turns to health. The NHS is the people's priority, he says. The health budget in 2015-16 will be £110bn. The government is demanding reform, he says. Osborne says he is proud to support a government that is the first to meet the 0.7% aid budget. The DfID budget will be £11.1bn in 2015-16. Osborne moves on to his final principle - fairness. Those with the broadest shoulders should bear the biggest burden. In every year of this parliament, the rich will be more in income tax than under Labour, he says. He expects to raise more than £1bn more in tax revenues from a crackdown on tax evasion. Hilary Benn, Labour's shadow secretary of state for Communities and Local Government, tweets: Osborne says new schools and technical college will be funded. Labour want no more free schools, he says. Instead, the coalition will accelerate the programme. There will be 180 new free schools in 2015-16. Children will not pay for the mistakes of the past, he says. Osborne says Michael Gove's school reforms have been \"brilliant\". He says the schools budget will be protected. And more money will actually go to schools. School spending will be allocated in a fairer way than every before. At the moment, school funding is not fair, he says. Many MPs from all sides of the Commons have been in favour. The Tory MP Robin Walker has been a particular champion of this, he says. The government will consult so that it gets the detail right. When you have infrastructure and science, you still need education, he says. Reforms to higher education were bitterly contested, he says. It was claimed that tuition fees would destroy social mobility. But the proportion of pupils from deprived backgrounds applying to university is at its highest level ever, he says. Osborne says there will be a 9% increase in capital investment by the Department for Business, including a huge increase in science spending. The resource budget for science will be maintained, and the capital budget for science will be increased. Investment in science is an investment for the future, he says. The Department for Energy will see an 8% reduction. The Department for Environment will see a 10% reduction. But spending on flood defences will be protected. The Department for Business will see its budget cut by 6%. But more money will be put into apprenticeships, he says. Osborne says Britain's civil nuclear programme is being restarted. Osborne says the Department of Transport will make a 9% cuts in its day to day costs. But its capital spending budget will go up to £9.5bn. That is the largest rise, he says. He says the Commons will today give the green light to High Speed Two. Now the government is looking at the case for Crossrail Two. The mayor of London will have an extra £9bn by the end of this decade. City traders are taking Osborne's statement in their stride, so far (my colleague Graeme Wearden on the City desk reports). Britain's borrowing costs are down today, with the yield (effectively the interest rate) on our 10-year bonds falling to 2.46%, from 2.53% last night. In the media world, the BBC's Robert Peston suggests Osborne is putting too much faith in 'efficiency' savings to make his numbers add up: The decision to to end the automatic pay increases in the public sector has been welcomed by the Sunday Times economic editor, David Smith: Osborne says government spending does not produce sustainable growth. Enterprise does. Britain was once the place where the future was invented. We can be that country again, he says. But successive governments of all colours have refused to commit to capital spending plans. There will be £50bn capital spending in 2015. That amounts to capital spending of £300bn by the end of this decade. That means capital spending will be higher in this decade than in the last decade, when Labour wasted money on an industrial scale. Osborne says Chris Grayling will make savings of 10% in his departmental budget. At the same time, he is making reforms, he says. Every difficult choice taken has been opposed by vested interests and those who got us into this mess in the first place. Osborne says the police are a model for public service reform. He praises Theresa May. In response to questions from Labour, he says she is the best home secretary for a generation. Crime is falling, he says. Labour said the government would not be able to control the borders. But immigration is falling. May's resource budget will fall by 6%, he says. But the police budget will not be cut by that much, and the counter-terrorism budget will be protected. William Hague is the best foreign secretary for a generation, Osborne says. Hague's budget will be cut by 8% in 2015-16. But Hague will still be able to open more embassies. Osborne is now talking about the intelligence services. They will get an increase, he says. I've had a computer crash, but it seems to be working again now. I will pick up from here and summarise the bits I've missed (including the Waterloo battlefield restoration - how odd is that?) later. Public sector pay rises will be limited to an average of up to 1% for 2015-16 and automatic progression pay in the civil service will be ended by 2015-16. The government aims to remove automatic pay rises for time served in schools, NHS, prisons and the police – but not the armed forces. For 2015-16 the Treasury resource budget will be reduced by 10%. The Cabinet Office resource budget will be reduced by 10%. Local government department has been reduced by 60% - Eric Pickles is “the model of lean government”. He has agreed to another 10% reduction in resource budget. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts total number of people working for the government to fall by a further 144,000 by 2015-16. Osborne announces a more than £3bn capital investment in affordable housing. The Welsh resource budget will be £13.6bn. The Culture, media and sport department resource budget cut 7% - elite sport is protected, museums funding is cut by 5%. Osborne says when the government took office, it was borrowing £1 for every £4 it was spending. Now borrowing is £49bn lower than it was, he says. The deficit has come down by a third. Total government spending in 2015-16 will be £745bn, he says. But the government has to find savings of £11.5bn. He pays tribute to Danny Alexander for the \"huge effort\" he has put into this. Reform, growth and fairness are the principles, he says. George Osborne says Britain is moving from recesssion to recovery. He is acting on behalf of everyone who knows Britain must live within its means. The SR has three principles: growth, reform and fairness. Those with the broadest shoulders will have to pay the most. The greatest unfairness is loading debts on to the young, he says. The government has always believed that you can get better services without spending more. Opposition to that has collapsed into incoherence, he says. According to Chris Bryant, George Osborne looks unwell. Cameron says he is not ruling out a public inquiry into the Lawrence affair. But, at the moment, the police are not investigating themselves, he says. Labour's Stephen Pound asks when Cameron will publish the results of the inquiry into claims that the Tories sold access to Cameron to party donors. Cameron says he is happy to publish its findings. But when will Labour pay back the money saved in tax by its donor, John Mills? Labour's Meg Munn asks if the government has got it in for Sheffield. It is going to lose the right to use its name for products, and the Territorial Army HQ is moving, she says. Cameron says Sheffield is a wonderful city. On the name issue, he says that he has been assured that Sheffield will be protected. Cameron says high speed rail will help free up congestion on existing rail lines. Labour's Barry Gardiner says borrowing is going up. Why are we having a spending review when the government said it would not have to ask for more? Cameron says he is cleaning up the mess left by Labour. Charlotte Leslie, a Conservative, asks for a review of Labour's culture of cover-up in the NHS. Cameron says there was a problem under Labour of problems in the NHS being covered up. He quotes from a former CQC executive, Barbara Young. Labour's John Cryer asks Cameron if he has ever had a conversation with Lynton Crosby about alcohol pricing or cigarette packaging. He says Cameron did not answer this last week, because he only talked about being lobbied by Crosby. Cameron dodges the question and says he has not been lobbied by Crosby. The real scandal is Labour being lobbied by the unions, who also fix parliamentary selections, he says. Ben Gummer, a Conservative, says he has just visited a new school being built in Ipswich that was not build under Labour. (PMQs is even more partisan and propagandist than usual today.) Jane Ellison asks about borrowing. She is the third Conservative to give Cameron a chance to say Labour would increase borrowing. He also says that, under the coalition, the redevelopment of Battersea Power Station will start this year. Cameron says that if further inquiries need to be held into the Stephen Lawrence undercover police revelations, they will be. PMQs Snap Verdict: Miliband had Cameron on the ropes. It was his clearest win for ages. Those infrastructure statistics were lethal. Miliband says the government promised 100,000 new homes. Only 2,000 have arrived. Even the British Chambers of Commerce says the government's infrastructure programme is \"hot air\" and \"complete fiction\". Cameron explains how much the government has spent on housing. He asks the borrowing question again, and says half the country think Miliband is Bert from the Muppets. He belongs in Sesame Street, not Downing Street. Milband says the British people are paying the price for Cameron's failure. Cameron says Miliband said crime would go down. It's gone up. He said the coalition's immigration policy would not work. It has. Miliband is wrong about everything, he says. It is not trusted by anyone. Miliband asks about infrastructure projects. How many of the 500-odd promised have started. Cameron says the government is spending more on infrastructure than Labour planned. On the details, he says: \"You cannot build a nuclear power station overnight.\" This government is electrifying 300 miles of track. Labour did nine miles. Miliband rattles off a list of schools and hospitals completed under Labour. He says only seven of the 576 infrastracture projects have started. And five of those were started under Labour, he says. He ask how many starts there have been under a new homes initiative. Cameron sidesteps this, and asks if borrowing would go up under Labour. Ed Miliband asks how many projects have started under the schools building programme. Cameron says Building Schools for the Future, Labour's programme, was a \"mess\". Miliband says 261 school developments were promised under the government's programme. But only one has started. Cameron says Labour left a mess. Gordon Henderson, a Conservative, asks for an assurance that interest rates will stay low. David Cameron says he won't be taking advice from Labour. On Saturday Ed Miliband said he wanted to control borrowing. But on Sunday Ed Balls said borrowing would go up under Labour. Some more background reading while we wait for PMQs. This is from Duncan Weldon, a TUC official. The prime minister's spokesman said the SR would be a review for \"reform, growth and fairness\". The plans were generally welcomed by ministers when George Osborne and Danny Alexander briefed cabinet this morning, the spokesman said. \"I think everyone agreed it is a good and the right outcome,\" he added. Philippa Roe, the Conservative leader of Westminster council, has issued a statement saying that there is no point councils just moaning about cuts. She wants much more decentralisation. We know that local government is looking at a 10% reduction on Wednesday, so the traditional game played by some councils of bemoaning the lack of money is even more pointless than usual. If you are one of the authorities who gains from the announcements we have been led to expect on roads and housing, then that’s great. But it is clear that in the long-term, centrally allocating money from Whitehall isn’t the best way to kick start local schemes. That’s why the government needs to make sure the most progressive authorities can benefit from the so-called Heseltine pot, making it as deep and wide as possible in the funding that goes into it from across Whitehall. Councils have the local knowledge and the expertise to make this work far harder for local economies than centrally delivered projects. It’s now down to us as local authorities to behave differently when it comes to delivering services, and that covers everything from social finance schemes to early intervention on troubled families. Freeing up restrictions and allowing councils to borrow against their assets is key. That will allow us to build more houses, get more people into work, save money and deliver better public services. The chancellor has an opportunity with the spending round to do exactly this, but he needs to be radical and not let the opportunity slip. I've already posted a list of three things to read if you are looking for some background on the SR. (See 9.23am.) Here are some more helpful blogs and briefing notes. • An Institute for Fiscal Studies briefing on the SR (pdf). • A general SR briefing from the Social Market Foundation (pdf). This is particularly good on the long-term pressures on the NHS. • Julian McCrae at the Institute for Government on what to look out for in Osborne's speech. • Duncan Weldon at Touchstone imagines the speech that Osborne would have given if everything had worked out as he planned. • The government's official guide to the SR. • A Resolution Foundation analysis suggesting further tax rises or welfare cuts are likely after 2015. • James Kirkup at the Telegraph identifies five things to look out for in the SR. • James Plunkett at the New Statesman on three things to remember about today's SR. • A Transportxtra briefing on what the SR may mean for transport. • An Inside Housing briefing on what the SR may mean for housing. Labour MP Ian Lavery has posted this on Twitter about the SR. David Cameron has been tweeting about the SR (but not very revealingly). At the weekend George Osborne and Ed Balls were both acknowledging that over the long term welfare spending would have to be reviewed. Nick Clegg has been making the same point. The Lib Dems fought to stop welfare cuts being included in today's SR, but Clegg has said in an interview that it would be \"unrealistic\" to think that welfare, and pensions, could be protected for good. All I’m saying is that given that of the £700bn that we spend as a nation on public spending, about £200bn of that is welfare and pensions ... The idea — and even the Labour Party is now coming round to this view — that you can just say you’re never going to look at that £200bn in the round seems to me to be unrealistic, but it needs to be done in the fairest possible way. I'm regularly staggered by the industry of my colleagues on the red-top press. At the Sun they are running a story about the \"burger backlash\", George Osborne being slagged off for posting a picture of himself eating a burger on Twitter. Some details of George Osborne's SR announcement are already laid out in today's papers. Here are the three key stories. • The Times says Osborne will announce plans to end “progression pay” - automatic pay rises for public sector workers linked to the amount of time they have been in a job. Teachers, council staff, nurses and most civil servants at present get a pay increase every year owing to time served — even during a pay freeze — costing the taxpayer £2 billion a year. This has made it impossible for Mr Osborne to contain the £160 billion public sector wage bill, despite a two-year freeze for most workers. The NHS, which employs 1.2 million people, typically had to pay its staff 2-5 per cent in pay increases. In March Mr Osborne announced a 1 per cent pay cap for a further two years in the hope of saving £1 billion, but the savings would be higher without progression pay. Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, led the way last year by announcing he would replace incremental rises with performance-related pay. Trade unions are taking strike action tomorrow over the issue in 3,000 schools in the North West. Whitehall sources said that the programme to abolish progression pay would have to be phased in after negotiations with unions. One source admitted that employers had obligations to pay staff annual increments. “Contracts will have to be renegotiated in different workforces,” he said. • Robert Winnett in the Daily Telegraph says the intelligence agencies will be the biggest winners in the SR. MI6, MI5 and Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) will see an inflation-busting increase in their combined £1.9 billion budget, underlining the Government’s concern over the growing terrorist threat following the Woolwich attack. Police spending on counter-terrorism will also be protected and will rise in line with inflation. The percentage increase in the budgets of the intelligence agencies – at more than three per cent in addition to inflation – will be the largest of any item of government spending including the NHS, schools and international development. It will lead to the agencies receiving about another £100 million in funding annually from 2015. • The Daily Mail says Osborne will announce that winter fuel payments will no longer be available to pensioners living abroad in warm places. It is expected that pensioners living in European countries, who can currently claim a range of benefits, will lose winter fuel payments if they live in a region with a higher average winter temperature than the warmest region of the UK. This system would disqualify an estimated 120,000 people and save £30million a year after 2015/16, when it is expected to come into force. Controversially, richer pensioners who have emigrated to colder countries will continue to receive the payments, while poorer pensioners will lose it if they live in warmer areas. (For aficionados of the Mail, their story makes interesting reading. It's as if the paper cannot make up its mind whether the \"no more winter fuel payments to ex-pats in Spain\" story is a good thing, because it's a welfare crackdown, or a bad thing, because it's an attack on Mail-reading pensioners. The Sun, which has the same story, is more certain. It has an editorial praising the move.) Here's a flavour of what people have been saying about the SR on today's morning programmes. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said he expected tax rises after the general election. The scale of the cuts are really astonishing. If you really do carry on with the next two years up to 2017-18, as pencilled in, that will result in a whole slew of Government spending being a third or more less than it was less than it was in 2010. If I was a betting man I think they’ll be some kind of tax rise after the election. Lord Lamont, the former Conservative chancellor, said George Osborne should stop ringfencing the NHS and other departments. As someone once said, [the NHS has] been stabbed in the back with a chequebook and it hasn't done it any good. I’ve never been a great believer that just pouring money into the NHS would solve its problems and so it has proved. But it's not just the NHS. I think the whole ringfenced area including overseas aid, education, this has meant that the chancellor has had to target his cuts on a very tiny area of expenditure. That is not rational really. Chris Leslie, the shadow Treasury minister, called for a £10bn spending stimulus. The IMF had some very good advice on this. They suggested £10bn of stimulus now in the near term. The IMF have suggested there is a choice, that is the advice we would take. If he took that action now, that might mean in two years’ time we might not need these appalling cuts that he’s pencilling in. The Chancellor hasn’t listened to us for the last three years. Stephen Williams, a Lib Dem MP, said the Lib Dems wanted higher taxes for the wealthy. We can’t get agreement with our coalition colleagues that we do need to tax the wealthy a bit more. We would have a mansion tax, we would look at the perks wealthy pensioners get and start taking away those before we go back to the working poor or those who are unemployed and say you need to pay a little but more. I've taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. The Telegraph has produced an interactive spending review quiz. And I've written a rather more basic SR Q&amp;A. Last night George Osborne posted a picture of himself on Twitter putting the finishing touches to his speech. Ed Miliband, however, has been commenting. This is what he said about the spending review (SR) outside his house this morning. What we see again today is the British people paying the price for this government’s failure. The government tell us the economy is healing but actually it is getting worse for ordinary families. What we actually need is a fairer plan to get growth moving, living standards rising and the deficit down. Cabinet ministers have been leaving Number 10 this morning after being briefed on the spending review. But they haven't been talking. Westminster has felt a bit flat in recent weeks but today it is going to burst into life because we’re getting one of those agenda-defining, set-piece events that shape the political year (or even the five-year parliament). It is, of course, George Osborne’s spending review for 2015-16. If you are looking for some background reading, here are three good places to start. • A 12-page House of Commons library note on the spending review (pdf). For a factual, objective analysis of what’s at stake, this is hard to beat. • Today’s Guardian story about the announcement. • Patrick Wintour’s analysis. I’ll post some more background reading about the spending review later. And why does it matter? Here are three quick reasons. 1. The cuts themselves are important. George Osborne is announcing cuts worth £11.5bn. Given that the government is expected to spend a total of almost £750bn in 2015-16, you could argue that these sums are relatively small. But many people who work in the public sector, or are dependent on public services, will be affected by the decisions announced today. 2. The politics are probably even more important. The next general election may well be won by the party must trusted on the economy and on public spending and part of Osborne’s motive for holding the review (which could easily have waited until next year) was to set a challenge for Labour: either reject the plans (and face accusations of profligacy) or accept them (and infuriate the left and face accusations of inconsistency). Ahead of today’s announcement, Labour has already clarified its position on spending in 2015-16, although it is not clear yet which party is actually “winning” on this terrain. 3. And the way public money is spent may change too - which could turn out to be the most significant news of the day. So far most attention has been focused on the cuts - ie, on what is being spent. But Osborne is also expected to announce various changes to the way Whitehall money is spent. For example, he is expected to flesh out details of his proposed cap on welfare spending, promote further use of community budgets (a localised form of pooling budgets from different departments) and announce the size of the single local growth fund (another former of budget pooling, championed by Lord Heseltine). This is techy stuff, but potentially it is transformative. I will be covering the spending review statement in detial, as well as bringing reaction and analysis. Here’s the timetable. 12pm: David Cameron and Ed Miliband clash at PMQs. 12.30pm: George Osborne announces the spending review.

On the first Thursday of May 2015 according to the text of the coalition agreement under which both parties agree to establish five-year fixed-term parliaments. A binding motion specifying the date of the next election will be introduced into the Commons \"in the first days\" of the new government followed by the necessary legislation. It means that the prime minister will lose the power to call an earlier election. Does that mean that the Con-Lib coalition will now be in power for the next five years come what may? No. The legislation will provide for a general election to be called if 55% or more of the Commons votes in favour. The convention since 1782 has been that a significant defeat on a major issue can lead to a vote of no confidence in the government. If they lose that vote then they are obliged to resign or call a general election. This happened twice in the last century – in 1923 and 1979. The fixed-term parliament legislation will take away the power of a prime minister to call an election in these circumstances. But it will also mean that if the government falls the sitting prime minister can try to form a new coalition government from among the opposition parties. If that fails in other fixed-term parliaments, such as in Germany, the head of state can call an election, but in Britain there is no wish to involve the Queen in such decisions. So they have settled on a threshold of 55% of MPs to force a general election. The 55% figure is significant because the Conservatives have 47% of MPs and it ensures that the Lib Dems cannot simply walk out of the coalition and vote with the opposition to call a general election as they can only muster 53% of the vote. Now Nick Clegg is deputy prime minister will he also have an office in Downing Street? No, but he will be very close by in the Cabinet Office building round the corner in Whitehall. There is a connecting corridor with 10 Downing Street. Clegg joked that Cameron promised the door would be left unlocked. Cameron said they would work so closely together they would not have to schedule meetings or telephone calls. Where will the Lib Dems sit in the Commons chamber, on the government or opposition benches? On the government benches, although whether they will sit as a block or intermingled with Conservative MPs is not yet clear. Labour will now move to the opposition side of the chamber with minor parties. What will happen at prime minister's question time? Cameron will face Harriet Harman across the dispatch box every Wednesday but Clegg will stand in for him when he is away: \"I am going to try to be away a lot,\" joked Cameron. The Lib Dems will, however, retain their separate party organisation in the Commons and Lords with their own whips and internal party committees. What about rebellions within the coalition? Won't discipline have to be rigorously enforced? Not necessarily as the Con-Lib coalition has a healthy majority of 80-plus in the Commons and, unlike the last Labour government, an overwhelming majority in the House of Lords. In fact it is possible the government will suffer far fewer parliamentary defeats than any government since the late 1980s. What about byelections? Will coalition Conservative candidates stand against coalition Lib Dems in the Thirsk and Malton byelection due on 27 May? Yes, outside parliament both will continue to operate exactly as now, although it can be expected that the language of their attacks may be toned down a little at least in the early days. Both party leaders indicated they would continue to contest all byelections separately. Clegg said they could both travel to the pending North Yorkshire byelection in the same car but get out of different doors. Michael Heseltine was among the last candidates to fight an election under the label National Liberal in the Gower in 1959 – a successor to a Liberal party group which had gone into the national coalition with the Conservatives in 1931. Will they have separate party conferences? Yes, and they could become important vehicles for dissent for the parties' grassroots and their anxieties over the coalition deal. How will reshuffles work? Cameron made clear he has the final say over government appointments but Clegg will be consulted. What about select committees and other ways parliament holds ministers to account? The Wright committee proposals to reform the way the House of Commons works are to be implemented in full. This could be one of the most radical changes to parliament's scrutiny of the government. They provide for the chairs and members of select committees to be directly elected by a secret ballot of MPs, taking the process out of the hands of the party whips which led to allegations of committees being nobbled by the government. The reforms also provide for parliament to take back control of its business from the government. A backbench business committee is to be set up to organise the timetabling of legislation and debates. At first this will only cover private members' bills but the coalition agreement says that within three years this will include government bills as well. It could ensure that some major issues no longer reach the statute book without proper debate. What about the public; do they get a look-in on this \"new politics\"? Yes, the changes will mean that e-petitions to parliament will be accepted and a new mechanism set up to allow the public to ensure that a given issue is debated in the Commons. Can the Lib Dems rebel against government policy? Yes but only by special arrangement. This already exists to allow them to oppose any expansion of nuclear power. Lib Dem spokesmen can speak against but must abstain on any Commons vote. If it leads to a government defeat it will not be regarded as an issue of confidence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2007/nov/22/nuclearindustry","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2007-11-22T10:55:49Z","webTitle":"Ambitions of nuclear power industry in UK are 'a fantasy'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/22/nuclearindustry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2007/nov/22/nuclearindustry","fields":{"headline":"Ambitions of nuclear power industry in UK are 'a fantasy'","bodyText":"The prospects of a nuclear power renaissance in Britain are zero and the global industry is in steep decline, Green MEPs warned yesterday. An independent consultants' study, the World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2007, casts severe doubts over the government's expected proposals this year to build up to 10 nuclear power stations to replace a rapidly ageing capacity. Mycle Schneider, the report's co-author, said the government's plans were seriously jeopardised by an acute shortage of skilled engineers and manufacturing bottlenecks. \"I can't think of any other country where the crisis in engineering is more absolute,\" he said. \"You don't educate engineers in Britain any more, let alone nuclear engineers. The only perspective I can see is that EDF [the French state-owned power group] orders its own reactor and brings in people from elsewhere to build it.\" His report, co-authored by a London-based consultant, Anthony Froggatt, said that there are 439 nuclear reactors operating in the world - five fewer than five years ago - and 32 units are said to be \"under construction\" - 20 fewer than in the late 1990s. In the EU's 27 states the number of operating units had declined to 146 from 177 in 1989. In Britain, where half the nuclear plants were out of operation last month, the 19 reactors account for 18.3% of electricity generated, compared with 22% four years ago and many of them are more than 30 years old, small and inefficient. The average age of operating nuclear power plants in the world is 23 years. Schneider ridiculed operators' plans to extend the plants' lifetime to 40 years but said that even if that were feasible it would be impossible to maintain global output. He calculates that, on top of the 32 units under way, an extra 69 would have to be planned, built and started up by 2015, the equivalent of one every six weeks. In the following decade 192, or one every 18 days, would have to be connected to the grid. Rebecca Harms, a German Green MEP, said: \"The gap between the expectations being promoted by the nuclear industry and reality are perfectly highlighted by the bungled attempt to build a new reactor at the Olkiluoto plant in Finland.

Three-quarters of the reduction has been the result of less industrial activity, with the rest coming from countries turning to renewable energy and nuclear power. But the world's premier energy analysts calculated that to avoid dangerous climate change, countries around the world will have to spend $400bn a year building more than 350 new nuclear plants and 350,000 wind turbines in the next 20 years. They also estimate that by 2020, three-fifths of cars will need to use alternatives to the traditional internal combustion engine. The findings came in a special extract of the IEA's forthcoming annual world energy outlook report, published at the UN climate talks in Bangkok. The emissions cuts, only the fourth in the last 50 years, provide countries with a unique chance to switch to less carbon-intensive energy sources, said the IEA's chief economist, Fatih Birol. \"Average growth in emissions has been 3% a year but we estimate this year that emissions will fall 3%. Because of the financial crisis, many industries have the chance to move away from unsustainable power. If we get a good result at the Copenhagen climate talks, then they could be turned to sustainable energy,\" he said. The independent agency, which is funded by the world's richest 28 countries, said it would be a catastrophe if countries continued with business as usual. \"We need an energy and environment revolution. Business as usual would increase temperatures by 6C. To hold emissions to 450ppm [parts per million], we need in the region of 18 nuclear power stations, 17,000 turbines, 100 concentrated solar power stations and 16 carbon capture and storage plants to be built every year until 2030,\" said Birol. \"We think the share of renewables and nuclear which is now 18% worldwide needs to go up to 33% by 2030,\" he said. \"But energy efficiency will be the key.\" The energy revolution envisaged by the IEA would cost about $400bn a year to fund between now and 2020, but it would cost far more to catch up with emission cuts later on, said Nobuo Tanaka, the director of the agency. \"The benefits will be that we avoid the worst implications of climate change which are unquantifiable. Everyone will also save money,\" he said. Under the IEA's scenario of how the world could hold emissions to 450ppm, countries would have rapidly away from the internal combustion engine. \"Ninety-five per cent of new cars today have internal combustion engines. To hold emissions to 450 [ppm] you need more and more hybrids and electric cars. By 2020, only 40% of cars should have internal combustion engines,\" it suggested. For the first time, the agency estimated the costs to Opec oil-producing countries of a worldwide shift away from petrol and oil. With no deal at Copenhagen, it says, the industry could expect to earn about $28tr between 2012 and 2030. But holding emissions to 450ppm would reduce the industry's revenue by 16% to $24tr, said Birol. \"They would earn less, but it would still be four times more than they have earned in the last 22 years, he said. \"Oil, coal and gas needs to peak at 2020 and then decline. Renewables, nuclear and CCS [carbon capture and storage] need to go up dramatically,\" said the report. He said that the climate talks due to conclude in Copenhagen in December were fundamental to whether the world moved away from fossil fuels. \"That requires signals. People do not invest in dirty power because they are bad but because of the money. Without an incentive signal from Copenhagen it will not change,\" he said. \"The IEA's report confirms what we already know – that every year's delay in climate action will significantly increase the costs,\" said Kaisa Kosonen, Greenpeace International policy analyst. The assessment confirms that current industrialised country targets are not enough to drive energy efficiency and renewables on the scale needed. It also confirms what Greenpeace's own scenario shows, that energy efficiency will play by far the biggest role in solving climate change - over and above any other technologies. The rise and fall of carbon emissions Carbon emissions are strongly linked to economic growth and have increased globally roughly 3% a year since the 1950s. But they have also fallen three times in the last 60 years. The first drop occurred during the oil crises of the early 1970s when the price of oil more than doubled, forcing many industries to contract or close. Emissions fell again in the early 1990s with the economic collapse of the Soviet Union which depended heavily on coal. Industrial output plummeted, coal mines closed and people could not afford to heat their homes. More surprisingly, carbon emissions also fell 0.3% in 1998-99, thanks partly to improved energy efficiency but mainly because Britain and Germany closed many coal mines and switched to gas, and China reduced its energy subsidies. The world economy continued to grow, mainly though information technologies and service sectors that were not then major energy users. The 2009 fall in emissions due to the credit crunch and the recession that has followed it is the deepest since the 1970s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/may/12/cameron-clegg-seismic-shift-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-12T16:32:16Z","webTitle":"David Cameron and Nick Clegg hail 'historic and seismic shift' in politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/12/cameron-clegg-seismic-shift-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/may/12/cameron-clegg-seismic-shift-politics","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron and Nick Clegg hail 'historic and seismic shift' in politics","bodyText":"David Cameron today hailed the creation of the first peacetime coalition since the 1930s to govern Britain as a \"historic and seismic shift\" as he stood alongside Nick Clegg in the Downing Street garden to launch an agreed programme. In a relaxed joint appearance, the new prime minister stood side by side with his deputy at an open-air press conference and said the Lib-Con five-year fixed-term government would be underpinned by principles of \"freedom, fairness and responsibility\". Cameron said the appointment of six Lib Dems, including Clegg, to the cabinet was \"a sign of the strength and depth of the coalition and our sincere determination to work together constructively to make this coalition work in our national interest\". The prime minister said: \"Today we are not just announcing a new government and new ministers. We are announcing a new politics. A new politics where the national interest is more important than party interest, where co-operation wins out over confrontation, where compromise, give and take, reasonable, civilised, grown-up behaviour is not a sign of weakness but of strength.\" Clegg said: \"Until today, we have been rivals: now we are colleagues. That says a lot about the scale of the new politics which is now beginning to unfold. \"This is a new government and a new kind of government. A radical reforming government where it needs to be. And a source of reassurance and stability, too, at a time of great uncertainty in our country.\" Of the Liberal Democrats, Vince Cable will be business secretary, David Laws will be chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander will be Scottish secretary and Chris Huhne is expected to be appointed to the energy and climate change department. On the Conservative side, Cameron appointed the former chancellor Ken Clarke as justice secretary and lord chancellor, Theresa May as the second ever female home secretary, Michael Gove as schools secretary and George Osborne – as expected – as chancellor of the exchequer. William Hague will run the Foreign Office, Liam Fox, the Ministry of Defence and Andrew Lansley the Department of Health. Iain Duncan Smith, the former party leader and author of an influential report in Tory circles on \"Broken Britain\", seems likely to return as secretary of state for work and pensions. \"We have a shared agenda and a shared resolve to tackle the challenges our country faces,\" Cameron said. \"To safeguard our national security and support our troops abroad, to tackle the debt crisis, to repair our broken political system and to build a stronger society.\" The prime minister said he and Clegg had discussed the possibility of a Conservative minority government with \"confidence and supply\" support from the Lib Dems but decided it was \"really uninspiring\" and they decided on a full coalition instead. Cameron will address the weekly prime minister's questions session, with Clegg standing in when he is away. \"It's obviously going to be quite a different beast,\" said the Tory leader. The deputy prime minister will be based in the Cabinet Office, connected by a corridor to 10 Downing Street, and his responsibilities will include the political reforms agreed in the coalition deal. A referendum bill on electoral reform includes provision for the introduction of the alternative vote system, as well as the creation of fewer and more equal-sized constituencies, and fixed-term five-year parliaments. Both parties will campaign separately in byelections, such as the delayed Thirsk and Maldon poll, though Cameron joked they may share a car to the constituency to save on petrol. Clegg admitted both party leaders had taken \"big risks\" in joining forces and had taken \"a very, very big step\" away from previous political norms. \"We will now have to show the sceptics who predict that it will go wrong that they are wrong,\" he said. The most light-hearted moment came when Cameron was asked whether he stood by a previous comment that \"Nick Clegg\" was his favourite joke, prompting his new deputy to pretend to walk out of the press conference. Cameron replied: \"If it means swallowing some humble pie and if it means eating some of your words, I cannot think of a more excellent diet in which to provide the country with good government.\" Other cabinet appointments appear likely to include the Tory chairman, Eric Pickles, as communities secretary. Patrick McLoughlin, the Tory chief whip will become the government chief whip. The Conservative mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said the coalition looked like \"a kind of cross between a bulldog and a chihuahua\". \"They've created a mongrel breed,\" he said. \"And like all mongrel breeds I think it will have a great deal of hybrid vigour and strength.\" Details also emerged of the government's programme, with the Tories making good on the pre-election pledge to make a \"significant acceleration\" to reduce the budget deficit – including £6bn of spending cuts this year. An emergency budget will take place within 50 days, with Clegg's Lib Dems tailoring their pre-election pledge to delay the timing of deficit reduction to now agree with the Tory analysis that cuts should start immediately. Cameron said both sides had been encouraged by the way negotiating teams had worked together to thrash out the coalition deal. The fruits of these negotiations were published today in a seven-page \"Agreements Reached\" document. It outlines the way the most sensitive areas of policy for each party have been resolved, with concessions made on both sides. The document includes the complicated arrangements that relax the normal requirements of party discipline and cabinet collective responsibility. Liberal Democrats will be able to \"continue to make the case for alternatives\" to the renewal of the UK's Trident nuclear deterrent and abstain in votes on higher education funding. A Lib Dem spokesman will be allowed to speak in the House of Commons in opposition to the construction of new nuclear power stations, which Conservatives support, but the party's MPs will be required to abstain rather than join other parties in voting the policy down."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/jun/24/rees-makes-religion-out-of-science","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-24T20:30:06Z","webTitle":"Martin Rees paints science as religion, so his bishops can gather their annual tithe | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/24/rees-makes-religion-out-of-science","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/24/rees-makes-religion-out-of-science","fields":{"headline":"Martin Rees makes a religion out of science so his bishops can gather their tithe","bodyText":"A \"mammoth of research\" is about to rise behind London's St Pancras station, a biomedical centre costing £600m and housing about 1,250 \"cutting-edge\" scientists. Ask not its value. Science jeers at the idea. The UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation has already been dubbed a \"cathedral of science\", justified by faith, not reason. In which context I turn to the Reith lectures. Each year the dear BBC gestures towards high seriousness by getting a celebrity intellectual to muse in public for four hours. Ennui is relieved with a chatty preamble from the redoubtable Sue Lawley, followed by safe, hand-picked questions and no nasty supplementaries. The whole thing has the air of a Soviet academy. No one does it better than the astronomer and president of the Royal Society, Martin Rees, who concluded the 2010 series this week. Needless to say, he spoke to the BBC's current craze – anything to do with science. The airwaves are crammed with science quizzes, science chatshows, science magazines and science feedback. News must have science stories, the Today programme science items, all reverential. No scepticism is admitted to this new orthodoxy – or rather this revival of CP Snow's \"two cultures\" orthodoxy of the late 1950s. Rees is shameless. After a brisk, familiar canter through the wonder of science – internet, genomes, bugs, space travel – his last lecture brought him to the matter in hand. Science, he said, should \"engage broadly with society and public affairs\". In other words, it should get more money. There is nowhere better to plead for this than on the BBC. We are now shaping up for what, under the Osborne cuts, will be the greatest defensive operation in the history of Britain's professions. Rees will not allow scientists to miss out. He is rightly worried over public anxiety at the more disreputable antics of his colleagues. It was too bad that the Icelandic ash clouds turned out to be not as bad as \"the science\" had claimed. It was too bad if science banned beef on the bone; too bad if science wasted £2bn on Tamiflu; too bad if science wrecked the case for nuclear power by its hypersafe radiation limits, or failed properly to defend GM foods. These, by implication, were the fault of politicians for taking science too literally. To Rees, \"the advance of science spares us from irrational dread\", and if science replaced irrational dread with an exaggerated fear of risk, that also is just too bad. Since science supplies its own \"organised scepticism\", its claims on the public purse should be asserted as infallible. Cathedrals are no place for question marks. The Times ran a supplement before the election suggesting a \"pro-science\" MP was more important than any party, like \"pro-life\" candidates in America. To criticise science teaching is little short of blasphemy. Above all, science should be seen as above money. To Rees, a science grant is like an arts grant, a virtue beyond measure. In his lecture he insulted the financial sector as \"not the real world\", as \"faffing around with derivatives\" and as undeserving of any graduate's respect. (Yet within minutes Rees was moaning that in Britain there was not enough \"venture capital for startups\".) The giveaway was a questioner who doubted the value of the Large Hadron Collider, on a par with aircraft carriers and Olympic games for useless extravagance. Rees stuck to the party line that forbids him to say that £7bn and \"thousands of scientists\" buried under a Swiss mountain might have been better employed on energy research. Politicians must show a sense of \"priorities and perspectives\", he said, but scientists do not do priorities. They just want money. Rees is part of the lobby that led to the fiasco of the late 1980s, when colossal resources were devoted by the former Tory education secretary Lord Baker and others to maths and science education. They said it should form two thirds of the so-called core curriculum. Grants for science teaching soared. History and geography were demoted. University courses were expanded and colleges received twice as much grant for a science place as for an arts one. By 1993, when the policy had been in place for a whole secondary school cohort, it had utterly failed. Demand for science GCSE and A-level had fallen by 10%. University science labs lay empty as entry requirements fell to E-grades. Yet a plummeting market for science graduates left government targets unchanged. A body called Save British Science castigated the \"shocking underpayment\" of scientists, even as it demanded that schools turn out ever more of them. It was a classic policy failure that passes unaudited, by government, by politics or by academia. The science lobby reacted by turning itself into a religion. If economics could not justify its priority, then faith should do so. Men such as Rees and his colleague, Lord May, became archbishops preaching the word, that: \"Britain needs more scientists.\" Their canticle was: \"More money for research.\" Other vocational subjects such as law, accountancy and finance were deplored, even as the jobs market screamed for them. Unfashionable science-based occupations such as nursing and pharmacology had to burgle poor countries for staff. Rees is two-faced about this talent theft. Facing the accusation that science steals bright graduates from poorer countries, he suggests that they should \"fulfil their potential without emigrating\", perhaps by Britain securing them \"less dispiriting conditions\" back home. He wants a collider in every kraal. Yet he promotes just such theft. He wants more money or Britain's \"success in attracting mobile talent will be at risk\". Unless we continue to attract and nurture foreigners, we will \"not retain international competitiveness\". Less cash would jeopardise the nation's status in \"the international premier league\". It would damage Britain's \"standing\", its \"leverage\", indeed, the very \"sustainability of its society\". This is big science, like big defence, dressing in the clothes of the League of Empire Loyalists. When a lobby is in full cry, no quarter is given to reason. If science is so international, why see it in such chauvinist terms? Why not let less-privileged countries share in the global talent? Besides, science is all on the internet. A virtue of back-to-basics in public finance is that it might strip the cliches about \"vital for the nation's interest\" from the log-rolling. Every lobby is going into action to defend its subsidies. Scargill's miners were nothing to what we shall see from the scientists, doctors, lawyers, farmers, sportsmen and, above all, generals. They will turn on government as never before, claiming exemption from cuts in the cause of national pride and prosperity. When pain is expected of every corner of the public sector, no claim to public money should escape scrutiny. Those intending to live off the earnings of others should always have to explain why. I share Rees's glory in the wonder of science. I wish the wonder could be taught in schools, which still prefer to be kindergartens for lab technicians. But science research is one lobby among many. The BBC should not lavish it with favours against less-fashionable claimants for its platforms. One thing is for sure, Rees's subsidies must come from taxes on the professions he most despises – banking and finance. I bet no one devotes a research grant or a Reith lecture to them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2010/mar/17/manufacturing-sector-energy-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-17T19:54:52Z","webTitle":"Mandelson's bid to fire up low-carbon economy gets cool reception","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/17/manufacturing-sector-energy-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/mar/17/manufacturing-sector-energy-industry","fields":{"headline":"Mandelson's bid to fire up low-carbon economy gets cool reception","bodyText":"Lord Mandelson is spraying cash around various business sectors this week – the car industry tomorrow and nuclear today – all in the name of industrial activism. But judging from the reaction at the Royal Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IME) headquarters today, he has some way to go to convince many his strategy is as bright as the spring crocuses outside. Unveiling an £80m loan to a key company at the heart of the nuclear supply chain, the business secretary said he was determined to make finely focused interventions that could kickstart the low-carbon economy both here and abroad. \"This is government and industry working together to build the success of British manufacturing. This will help to realise the potential of our industrial base to be world-leading, export-led, and creating jobs and value here at home,\" he said. \"Our high-value manufacturing, knowledge base and highly skilled workforce mean, with the right investment, like today's, the UK can win a huge amount of business in this growth sector,\" Mandelson added. The old state-owned industries approach had shown its limitations in the 1970s, while the unfettered free market had failed to deliver the goods in the 1980s and 1990s, Mandelson argued. It was time to bring the two approaches together: \"Our ambition is to embed the teamwork approach [of public and private sector working together] right across government.\" Critics claim the business secretary has been heavier on the rhetoric of industrial activism than action. They point to the failure to defend Cadbury sweet factories from the bitterness of a Kraft Food cuts programme post-takeover. And there was a decidedly muted reaction today from engineers as Mandelson unveiled the loan that would help Sheffield Forgemasters build an enormous 15,000 tonne press to make ultra-large components for nuclear power stations, both in the UK and abroad. There was also only limited enthusiasm for the minister's decision to inject public money to create 1,000 new apprenticeships and other initiatives to help with a skills gap that threatens any industrial renaissance. The IME later welcomed the £80m loan but pointed out it represented 0.16% of the estimated £50bn investment required if 15 new atomic stations were to be built. The 1,000 apprentices would help, but not much, given the industry was losing 5% of its skill base every year through retirement, it added. Mandelson is aware that the UK needs new infrastructure, including high-speed rail links as well as renewable and traditional power plants. He is also anxious this spending spree should not largely benefit companies overseas at a time of high unemployment in Britain and after the UK manufacturing sector has been hollowed out by recession. The business secretary boasted that Britain had become a world leader in offshore wind but made no mention of the largest project in the world: the London Array. Perhaps that is because the 340-turbine scheme off Kent is controlled by a trio of foreign firms: E.ON of Germany, Masdar of Abu Dhabi and Dong of Denmark. And 90% of the €2bn worth of new supply chain contracts for the scheme have been awarded to overseas companies. E.ON said it could not find appropriate wind power providers in Britain. The nuclear supply chain is equally weak in the UK, as capacity and skills have been run down by closures. The business secretary was happy to mention Sheffield Forgemasters but more coy about the involvement of US-based but Japanese-owned Westinghouse. He is right to be, given that Westinghouse – one of the world's top three nuclear engineering firms – was until five years ago owned by government-controlled British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) and then privatised. BNFL sold it just as a nuclear renaissance began. Westinghouse is now trying to get its AP-1000 design approved in Britain so it can be used by those utilities lining up to invest in new nuclear. Again, those utilities are largely foreign-owned. British Energy, the one locally owned atomic power generating group, has been bought by EDF of France, although it has hived off a small percentage to British Gas. The other companies talking loudest about building new nuclear facilities are E.ON and RWE, both of Germany. The industrialists squeezed into the IME's ornate headquarters were clearly glad to hear the various initiatives from Mandelson but they have a long list of other issues which still need to be satisfied. A report from the IME last week – ominously entitled \"Nuclear Build: A Vote of No Confidence?\" – concluded ministers needed to resolve \"key enabling issues including planning, grid connection, nuclear waste, and offering loan guarantees or setting a minimum carbon price\". Talk of industrial activism is helpful but more earthy considerations remain to be tackled if the full flowers of nuclear and other low-carbon technologies are truly to bloom. • This article was amended on 19 March 2010 to correct details of Sheffield Forgemasters' new press."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/feb/03/tea-party-gop-liberals-compromise","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-03T14:00:00Z","webTitle":"Latte-sipping liberals – it's time to grind some beans | Megan Carpentier","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/feb/03/tea-party-gop-liberals-compromise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/feb/03/tea-party-gop-liberals-compromise","fields":{"headline":"Latte-sipping liberals – it's time to grind some beans","bodyText":"During the American Revolution, Americans traded in their tea for coffee in the wake of the Boston Tea Party to show support for the guerillas and to deny their British overlords the tea tax revenue. Try telling that to America's teabaggers today, who decry liberals as at best unpatriotic and at worst all but treasonous. So much for history: tea is the new revolutionary beverage, and us latte-sipping liberals are just going with the bureaucratic flow. On the other hand, the teabaggers have a point, albeit not the one they endeavoured to make. What happened to the revolutionary spirit that inspired the first American coffee drinkers? These days, there's no revolution left in the American left: regardless of how many times Glenn Beck tries to get his audience fired up about Saul Alinsky, the left seems more interested in playing nice with Democratic leaders than it seems in yanking them, kicking and screaming, towards anything remotely revolutionary. Conservative activists have no such qualms. From the Tea Party Nation to the Tea Party Patriots, they have one goal: to push the Republican party as right as they want it to be and, if not, to get their own people elected. After Democrat Bill Owens beat out the teabagger-backed Doug Hoffman in the wake of their attacks against the moderate Republican Dede Scozzafava, they took it as a call to arms, backing everyone from conservative Marco Rubio against the moderate (if more electable) Charlie Crist in the Republican Senate primary in Florida to declaring Democratic turncoat congressman Parker Griffith as not nearly conservative enough. They're not interested in compromise, they're not interested in playing nice and they're not interested in abiding by \"what's best for the party\". And they're winning over Republicans. By comparison, the left is still patting itself on the back for getting President Obama elected in 2008 and seemingly thinks he needs just a little more time to implement all that change he once promised. And while Democrats got their Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, even Lilly Ledbetter herself now says that it isn't nearly enough. Obama promised in his state of the union to \"work with Congress\" to repeal the military's discriminatory \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, but he's not going to sign any executive order. Healthcare is an acknowledged mess, but Obama's answer is to accept a semi-national health insurance exchange, several significant restrictions on abortion access and a promise by insurance companies to not refuse to cover people with pre-existing conditions (but they can charge whatever they want to cover them) – and then to call it a success. His green economy, if the state of the union is anything to go by, will be powered by \"clean\" coal, nuclear power and offshore drilling (as long as it doesn't ruin the sight lines at the Kennedy compound in Hyannisport, Massachusetts). And where are liberals? They're compromising with the administration in advance of congressional negotiations on reproductive health in healthcare reform and transgender workplace protections in the LGBT nondiscrimination legislation to keep from rocking the boat. They're telling themselves not to yell about oxymoronic \"clean\" coal technologies in order to get John McCain's cap-and-trade bill passed. They're telling themselves that the elimination of \"don't ask don't tell\" – which affects a minority of the LGBT community – is a good start even as the administration's lawyers file into court to defend the moronically named defence of marriage act that prohibits the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages. In other words, since it's their president and their House Speaker and their Senate majority leader, then there's no need for liberals to fight to pull them left even though other forces are pulling them right. Where are the latte-sippers to pull Congress left to counteract the tea-drinkers who are pulling it right? They might be at Starbucks, but they aren't on the hill or at the White House right now. The revolutionary spirit of drinking coffee to stick it to the man has been replaced with something more decaffeinated, and far less satisfying.

The UAE is regarded by the US as a moderate Arab state and the transfer is to allow it to build a nuclear power plant to produce energy, not a bomb. But it is easier for a country with civilian nuclear power technology to make the change to military purposes. Critics of the decision argue that could lead to an arms race in the Middle East, encouraging other countries seeking nuclear technology. They say does not make sense at a time when the US is engaged in trying to persuade Iran to abandon its uranium enrichment programme that Washington sees as intended to achieve a nuclear weapons capability. The Bush administration last year agreed in principle to the transfer to the UAE but there was some doubt over whether Obama would endorse it. The move is worth billions of dollars to US energy companies. \"I have determined that the performance of the agreement will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defence and security,\" Obama said. The US argues that the transfer of technology for civilian purposes, with all the safeguards and monitoring required by international law, helps avoid an arms race and is a relatively safe option. At present, Israel is the only country in the Middle East with a nuclear weapon. Iran could have nuclear weapons capability within the next few years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/nov/20/uk-skills-shortage-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-20T14:03:00Z","webTitle":"Skills shortage dents UK's green credentials","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/20/uk-skills-shortage-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/nov/20/uk-skills-shortage-environment","fields":{"headline":"Skills shortage dents UK's green credentials","bodyText":"Britain lacks the skills or training facilities to make the successful transition to a low-carbon economy that its international commitments require, an influential group of businesses and non-governmental organisations warns today. In a report that will dent Britain's image ahead of the Copenhagen climate conference, the Aldersgate Group says that in spite of the UK's pledge to meet a European Union 2020 target for carbon emissions, the government's skills strategy is inadequate to meet those needs. The report, Mind the Gap – skills for the transition to a low carbon economy, says it is now imperative that ambition and delivery are accelerated. John Edmonds, former TUC chief and Aldersgate Group Project chair for the report said: \"The skills gap in the UK economy is well documented, with one in three firms already hampered by a shortage of skilled staff, from those needed to install new technology to scientists and engineers. \"Investment in low-carbon skills is vital if the UK is to build a more resilient and sustainable economy. In the next two years a commitment to green training will accelerate the growth of new jobs and help us out of recession.\" The skills shortage comes at a time when demand for engineers for major infrastructure projects is increasing, as Britain attempts to address expansion in offshore and onshore wind, carbon capture and storage, nuclear power, flood defences, high-speed rail and upgrading the water infrastructure, the report says. \"Many of the required skills identified in the report are not unique to a low-carbon economy – it is a shortage of precisely these skills that has held back the UK economy for decades. In this respect, reskilling for a low-carbon economy involves a policy of no regrets. The UK needs to fix these skill shortage problems in order to prosper in the modern world,\" Edmonds added. The report says that the most significant driver for low-carbon skills is a robust industrial policy that encourages investment in low-carbon technology and resource efficiency. Germany has shown how an active industrial and skills policy can help stimulate widespread economic growth and job creation. Responsibility for progress must be shared between government, businesses, trade unions, professional bodies and the workforce, it adds. Germany, in the decade since it launched its \"feed-in tariff\" policy for boosting the take-up of renewable energy technology – has created at least 250,000 jobs in the sector – more than 10 times as many as exist in Britain. Peter Young, chairman of the Aldersgate Group, said: \"This report shows that our training institutions must be able to look beyond our current industrial and business structures and plan for the skill requirements of the future. Most of our recommendations are aimed at government because business members said they needed certainty from government if they are to invest.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2007/oct/15/7","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2007-10-15T15:23:47Z","webTitle":"GDF Suez to invest in UK nuclear power stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/oct/15/7","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2007/oct/15/7","fields":{"headline":"GDF Suez to invest in UK nuclear power stations","bodyText":"GDF Suez, the new French energy powerhouse, is planning to invest in new-generation nuclear power stations in Britain under a capital programme unveiled today to spend up to \u008010bn (£7bn) a year on expanding the group's business. It is understood that GDF Suez has already held exploratory talks with British Energy, the UK's biggest nuclear generator which provides around a fifth of Britain's power, and is the latest continental energy group after EDF, Eon, RWE and others, to signal its willingness to take part in the expected nuclear renaissance. A government consultation process on building new-generation atomic plants ended on October 10, with ministers now expected to give the go-ahead by the end of this year for up to 10 new reactors to be constructed on brownfield sites - where plants linked to the grid already exist or are being decommissioned. Announcing GDF Suez's post-merger operational and financial objectives, Gérard Mestrallet, chief executive, said the group would decide next year or in 2009 whether to take part in building one or more EPR reactors \"in countries where that would be possible and desirable\". \"We are in a period of thinking and analysing. We have not yet taken a decision,\" he said. But insiders said the new group would take part. It is already involved in the first EPR being built by French operator Areva and Germany's Siemens in Finland and in the second at Flamanville on the French side of the channel. The new group, which expects to complete its merger early next year, said its priority would be growth in Europe. It aimed to capture 20percent of France's electricity customers by virtually doubling its generating capacity to 10GW (gigawatts) by 2013 compared with 5.6GW now. It also plans to build capacity elsewhere in Europe and internationally up to 90GW from 47GW now. The group, which is floating off 65% of Suez's environment business, said it planned for pre-tax profits of \u008017bn by 2010 and would raise the dividend by 10 to 15% a year by then - when more than half of earnings would be distributed to shareholders. Amid accusations that the merger, brokered by President Nicolas Sarkozy, would renationalise Suez, the state will have seven out of the 10 GDF seats on the 23-strong board. But insiders pointed out that at least a third of seats would be held by independent directors and these would chair the five key committees: audit, nominations, compensation, ethics/environment and strategy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2007/jul/24/nuclear.japan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2007-07-24T14:56:02Z","webTitle":"Fire at Japanese nuclear power plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/24/nuclear.japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2007/jul/24/nuclear.japan","fields":{"headline":"Fire at Japanese nuclear power plant","bodyText":"A small fire broke out today at a partly constructed nuclear power station in northern Japan, the third blaze at the plant this month. It comes a week after an earthquake caused a radioactive spillage at another atomic plant. The operator, Hokkaido Electric Power (Hepco), said there was no danger of a radiation leak and there were no injuries during the incident at the Tomari plant. Two other reactors at Tomari were operating normally, it said. The Kyodo news agency said investigators found damage to electrical wiring and suspected foul play, but the operator was unavailable to comment. The fire came eight days after an earthquake caused radiation leaks at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant - which generates the most electricity of nuclear power stations worldwide. International inspectors were due to visit the Kashiwazaki plant in the aftermath of the quake, in which 400 drums of low-level radioactive waste fell over, with about 40 losing their lids and spilling their contents. The spillage was one of more than 50 malfunctions at the plant in the immediate aftermath of the quake. The operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), was criticised for failing to deal with the blaze and for initially under-reporting the scale of the radioactive leaks. The Kashiwazaki plant has been closed indefinitely and Japan's 54 other nuclear power stations have been ordered to carry out emergency safety checks. The Tomari plant has had problems before. In 2003, Hepco temporarily shut a reactor there after a leak in a coolant tank. And in 1995, four workers were badly burned when a radioactive waste tank caught fire. Hepco said no radiation had leaked outside the compound in any of the cases."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/may/20/osborne-queens-speech-schools-welfare","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-20T21:42:18Z","webTitle":"Schools and welfare expected to dominate Queen's speech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/20/osborne-queens-speech-schools-welfare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/may/20/osborne-queens-speech-schools-welfare","fields":{"headline":"Schools and welfare expected to dominate Queen's speech","bodyText":"Attacks on child poverty through welfare and school reforms, as well as urgent measures to require banks to lend, are likely to feature in next week's Queen's speech, ministers indicated today at the launch of their sweeping \"coalition programme for government\". George Osborne, the chancellor, said the aim was to end \"a whole culture that says 'let's do what we want, rather than what is right'\". A \"huge part\" of the Queen's speech \"will be the big structural reforms to education and welfare that will help the life chances of people\", he said. The school reforms will see a reduced role for local education authorities, the introduction of free schools, and a pupil premium for disadvantaged children. Welfare reforms will include tougher conditionality clauses for those on welfare, the introduction of more private-sector employment providers, and immediate testing for availability for work of current incapacity benefit claimants. But Osborne insisted that he would keep the previous government's target of eliminating child poverty by 2020, saying the Labour government's definition of child poverty had not been opposed by the Conservatives when it was put on the statute book last year. Osborne's pledge came on the day fresh figures showed that another 100,000 children had been lifted out of poverty as defined by the government. Vince Cable, the business secretary, with his social democratic roots, emphasised the importance of fairness, saying he would not have countenanced the coalition without that principle. \"The success of government will not be measured with whether we cut the deficit, but how we cut the deficit.\" he said. Today's coalition agreement includes a strong attack on vested interests in the public sector, with an attack on police pay structures, an erosion of rigid national pay bargaining for teachers, renegotiation of GP contracts, and greater powers to sack civil servants. Discussing the programme at a press conference attended by the most senior Whitehall mandarins, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, said there had been compromises on both sides of the coalition, but this had strengthened and not weakened the contents. David Cameron said it was remarkable that the joint programme for government, with its strong emphasis on responsibility and individual liberty, had been agreed so quickly. Among the eye-catching proposals are the restoration of anonymity for rape defendants in England and Wales, a move immediately opposed by many women's groups. The Lib Dems have held this policy since 2006, on the basis that it is unfair if defendants whose guilt has yet to be established are accused of the crime by women seeking some sort of vengeance. The identity of the defendant would be made known if found guilty. Other pledges include a free vote to end the ban on fox hunting, a pledge to end the closure of accident and emergency wards, the introduction of 12 elected city mayors in England, a complete sentencing review, and a special fund to allow all-postal primaries in 200 seats that have been held by one party for many years. Overall, the agreement includes 400 separate objectives. Despite frantic negotiations, differences between the two parties led to the announcement of 29 reviews, including five commissions. Liberal Democrat and Conservative MPs have agreed to differ on how to vote on fox hunting, electoral reform, nuclear power, and recognition of marriage in the tax system. But both Cameron and Clegg insisted they had a genuine synthesis of Conservative and Lib Dem thinking. The foreword claimed that this synthesis represents a merger of both Big Society and the big citizen. The prime minister admitted the process had not been an effortless fusion: \"The urgency of the hour required compromise and negotiation … the more we talked, the more we listened, the more we realised our visions for the country and the values that inspire them are strengthened and enhanced by the two parties coming together.\" He singled out the health service as an area where Conservative principles on competition had merged well with Lib Dem plans for greater accountability by primary care trusts. The document also promises a commission to look at how social care will be funded. Before the election, the Tories had backed a voluntary insurance scheme, whereas the Liberal Democrats prefer universal payments. Clegg claimed: \"Even if anyone had read 100 manifestos, this would be different. It is not one party's ideas, not even just two party's ideas, but a joint programme for government.\" Those policies under review Commissions Separating retail and investment banking, the creation of a British bill of rights, long-term care and the affordability of public sector pensions.

News Corporation owns just over 39% of BSkyB and analysts said it would cost around £9bn - including debt - to buy the rest of the business at the rumoured price of 735p a share. Neither company would comment on what was termed \"talk in the marketplace\", and many traders dismissed the tale as \"a bit of Friday fun.\" However BSkyB's shares ended 28.5p higher at 598p with 21m shares traded, substantially above the recent daily average of around 4m. The 5% rise made the company the biggest riser in the leading index. Analyst Paul Richards at Numis said the story was plausible: Sky has invested very heavily over the last few years, in broadband and high definition. It is just on the verge of starting to benefit from this. There should be a material increase in profits over the next two years, but the market is not convinced of this so the shares have been held back. In terms of timing it would make sense to do it now, if News Corp wanted to do it. The question is, do they? It would cost around £7.5bn - or £9bn including debt - but it could have earnings of £1.5bn-£2bn in a couple of years. So you can certainly see the attraction. Another thing to bear in mind is that News Corp would be using dollars to bid, so given the weakness of the pound you could see why it would stack up. However we have heard stories like this before in the past, when Sky's shares were weak or when credit was readily available. In fact BSkyB was one of a number of companies subject to takeover gossip, a trend which dealers said was an unmistakable sign of a bull market. Among the mid-caps Game Group gained 3.05p to 88.95p on talk of interest from US rival GameStop, while Bovis Homes, 12.8p better at 405.5p, was the day's supposed target for rival housebuilder Persimmon, up 8p at 444.7p. Just a day earlier Barratt Developments, 2.4p higher at 126.9p, was said to be in Persimmon's sights. Software group Aveva added 33p to £11.50 as Goldman Sachs issued a buy note, in which among other things it said the company could be appealing to a possible predator. The bank said Aveva could command a price of anywhere between £12.58 and £27.02 a share, based on previous takeovers in the sector. Goldman said: We reiterate our conviction buy on Aveva shares and continue to view the company as a structural winner in the European software sector due to its exposure to key global growth themes of high exposure to infrastructure build in the fast growing emerging markets, increasing share of offshore versus onshore development in the oil and gas industry and renewed investments in nuclear power both in the developed and emerging world. The stock trades at a significant discount (20%-40%) to its peer group despite better expected top-line growth, operating margins and cash returns and hence we believe it is undervalued at current levels. In our view, Aveva is a premier strategic asset in the software sector that could appeal to a potential acquirer. It named a list of possible buyers, including Dassault Systemes, Autodesk, SAP, Oracle and IBM, or even industrial players such as Areva and Siemens. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 8.39 points higher at 5625.65, but it came off its best levels as disappointing US consumer confidence figures outweighed better than expected American high street sales. Nick Serff, market analyst at City Index, said: The markets have had a very choppy day with some quite sharp moves after US retail sales figures and Michigan consumer sentiment both managed to delight and alarm all in the space of 90 minutes. The sharp equity moves as a result emphasises how sensitive investors are to economic data right now. Banks were among the leading risers, after investors warmed to their US peers on hopes that President Obama's plans to restructure the sector would be watered down. Royal Bank of Scotland rose 2.02p to 42.57p, while Lloyds Banking Group ended 1.93p higher at 58.47p and Barclays was 8.1p better at 351.85p. But HSBC fell 10.6p to 684p following news of a data theft at its Swiss private bank affecting 24,000 clients. As a result Fitch placed the Swiss bank on a negative rating watch. The ratings agency said the move reflected the problem was \"a serious operational incident which could potentially have reputational repercussions for HSBC's private banking franchise.\" Insurer Resolution was the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, down 1.15p to 72.45p. The company learnt this week that it was losing its place in the leading index, to be replaced by specialist banking group Investec, steady at 530p. British Gas-owner Centrica closed 1p better at 290p after it held an investment day for institutions and analysts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/blog/audio/2009/jul/13/guardian-daily-podcast1","type":"audio","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-13T07:36:48Z","webTitle":"Guardian Daily podcast: More support for keeping troops in Afghanistan; plus an exam-free future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/audio/2009/jul/13/guardian-daily-podcast1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/blog/audio/2009/jul/13/guardian-daily-podcast1","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Daily: Poll shows rise in support for troops in Afghanistan","bodyText":"Richard Norton Taylor assesses the government's latest position on Afghanistan, after a week in which eight soldiers died in a 24-hour period.

For the last half century, liberal and left-leaning parties have won a majority of votes in general elections, but often not a majority of seats. This progressive majority in British politics has been cheated out of power, over and over again. Thanks to the unfair voting system, the anti-Tory majority have frequently ended up with a minority of MPs. Indeed, every government since the 1950s has taken power based on less than 50% of the popular vote. None has won majority public support at the ballot box. In the 2005 election, Labour won 35% of the vote but bagged 55% of the seats. Of eligible voters, only 22% voted Labour. Yet with the support of only one-fifth of the electorate Labour won a 66-seat majority. This is not democracy. It echoes the gerrymandering and ballot-rigging of two centuries ago, which galvanised the Chartists to campaign for a democratic, representative parliament. The electoral process is \"rigged\". In 2005, if you total all the votes cast for the main parties, it took an average 26,906 votes to elect a Labour MP, 44,373 to elect a Tory MP and 96,539 votes to elect a Lib Dem MP. Not since the rotten boroughs of the 18th century have elections been so corrupt. This democratic deficit is a direct result of the first-past-the-post (FPTP) system, which allows the election of MPs and governments with minority support. FPTP enabled Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair to win landslide majorities based on popular votes of only 35% to 44%. If there had been a fairer, proportional voting system, we would have never had the stand-alone, single-party governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major and, as a result, never had \"New\" Labour and the ditching of socialism under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Recent political history would have been very different — and more progressive. With proportional representation (PR), neither Thatcher and Major nor Blair and Brown would have been able to form governments without the support of other parties. Supported by only a minority of voters and with only a minority of seats, they would have had to form coalitions, which would have almost certainly prevented policy excesses, such as the poll tax and the Iraq war. If there had been PR in the 1980s, Thatcher would have had to go into coalition with the Lib Dems and other minor parties (which would have scuppered many of her reactionary policies). Alternatively, Labour might have been able to form a coalition with the Lib Dems and other parties, which would have meant no Conservative government in the 1980s – sparing Britain the social destruction of Thatcherism. Some defenders of FPTP complain that if we switch to PR Labour might never again win a majority of seats and form a government in its own right. But if Labour can't persuade a majority of voters, it doesn't deserve to form a government (ditto the Tories). Democracy is supposed to be about the will of the majority. It cannot be reconciled with a voting system that persistently allows parties with minority support to form governments with often huge majorities. If the last three elections had been conducted under PR, Labour would not have won an overall majority of seats. But there would have been Green MPs and more Lib Dem, SNP and Plaid Cymru MPs. On many issues, these four parties are to the left of the Labour government. If they had been in coalition with Labour since 1997, they would have had a mostly radicalising influence on Blair and Brown, probably preventing post office closures, Trident renewal, ID cards, expanded nuclear power, privatisation of public services and British troops in Iraq. With PR, the Tories might never rule alone again; thereby preventing a repeat of Thatcherite extremism. We'd be likely to see the election of MPs representing the Greens and possibly radical left parties, as happened under Scotland's PR system. This would shift the political centre leftwards. Labour would be radicalised because it would have to rule in coalition with Green, left and Liberal Democrat MPs (despite their flaws, the Lib Dems are more left-leaning than Gordon Brown on many issues). Labour and the Lib Dems could end up more or less permanently in power as the major partners in a new progressive \"traffic light\" coalition of red, orange and green. This is definitely preferable to having the Tories in government and wielding the knife. A democracy requires a parliament that reflects the people's will; where the proportion of seats won corresponds to the proportion of votes cast. This means finishing the parliamentary reform process begun by the Chartists. The Additional Member System for elections to the Scottish parliament, Welsh assembly and London assembly is a practical example of a fairer electoral process. Electors vote for both a constituency MP and for a party list. This combines the accountability of single-member constituencies with additional \"top-up\" MPs based on the total list vote received by each party; thereby ensuring proportionality between the number of votes cast for a party and the number of seats it wins. This system works in Scotland, Wales and London, why can't we have it at Westminster? Polls show that a majority of people want a fairer electoral system. It would benefit all progressive people and parties, shifting the political consensus leftwards. Whichever party wins the upcoming election, the new government should let the people decide by means of a two-stage referendum: first, on whether people want to change the voting system and second, if they do want change, on what kind of PR system they want. Until we make the voting system fair, our democracy will remain tainted and flawed, and the progressive majority – liberals, lefts and greens – will often be out of government, even when they have won a majority of the popular vote. • More information about the voting reform campaign, see Vote for a Change"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/audio/2008/sep/25/edf.british.energy","type":"audio","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-09-25T07:59:37Z","webTitle":"Terry Macalister on EDF buying British Energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/audio/2008/sep/25/edf.british.energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/audio/2008/sep/25/edf.british.energy","fields":{"headline":"EDF buys British Energy: 'The value is the land it controls'","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/apr/11/us-pakistan-jihadi-suspects-set-up","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-11T21:03:19Z","webTitle":"American jihadi suspects 'set up' by police, say lawyers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/11/us-pakistan-jihadi-suspects-set-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/apr/11/us-pakistan-jihadi-suspects-set-up","fields":{"headline":"American jihadi suspects 'set up' by police, say lawyers","bodyText":"Police fabricated evidence to incriminate five Americans facing trial in Pakistan on terror charges, lawyers representing the men will argue in court this week. The men, all Muslims, were arrested in December in the central town of Sargodha, and have been charged with planning terrorist acts in Pakistan, Afghanistan and the US. While the men admit wanting to travel to Afghanistan, they deny involvement in any jihadist activities and say they were planning to carry out \"community work\" in the country. Defence lawyers will argue the men could not have made email contact with a Pakistani extremist linked to al-Qaida in the way the police claim. According to the police's own summary of the investigation submitted to the court, investigators discovered the email account which was allegedly used to make contact several days after police had briefed journalists on the messages. Similarly, the police report describes the discovery of maps of alleged target sites and other incriminating evidence more than two weeks after they had already told media about their existence. The defence will also call into question police claims about the date of the men's arrest, which is several days after their widely reported detention on 9 December last year. Umer Farooq, 24, Waqar Hussain Khan, 22, Ramy Zamzam, 22, Ahmed Minni, 20, and Aman Hassan Yemer, 18, were charged under anti-terrorism laws. Police say the group's intended target was Chashma Barrage, a complex located near nuclear power facilities in Punjab that includes a water reservoir and other structures. The men, who pleaded not guilty, face life sentences if convicted on the most serious of the charges. They all grew up in the suburbs of Washington DC, where they were a tight-knit, religious group of friends. The Farooqs are originally from Sargodha and the men claim they had travelled to the Pakistani town to attend Umer's arranged marriage. According to the police, the men were taken into custody on 9 December, but were allowed to go home each evening, and were only formally arrested five days later on 14 December. But there are no reported sightings of the men after 9 December. Farooq's father Khalid, who was held for nearly three weeks before he was released, said that all of them were in continuous police custody after 8 December. \"I was with the boys, in the same cell,\" he said. \"There's no question of them being allowed out.\" His son, Umer Farooq, 24, is on trial with Waqar Hussain Khan, 22, Ramy Zamzam, 22, Ahmed Minni, 20, and Aman Hassan Yemer, aged just 18. All of them grew up in the suburbs of Washington DC, where they were a tight-knit, religious, group of friends. The Farooqs are originally from Sargodha and the men claim they had travelled to the Pakistani town to attend Umer's arranged marriage to a local woman. In a letter to Zamzam's parents seen by the Guardian, the men, who allege they were beaten by police and deprived of sleep and food in custody, face life in prison if convicted on the most serious of the charges.Following the arrest of the men, on 10 and 11 December police gave on-the-record briefings to local and international media about a Yahoo email account used to communicate with a Pakistani extremist called Saifullah. They also said at the time that maps and jihadi literature were found with the men. But according to the police report lodged with the anti-terrorism court in Sargodha, where the men are being tried, it was only on 17 December that the suspects disclosed \"their secret email address along with password\" – allowing the investigators to find the communication with Saifullah. In the document, a copy of which was seen by the Guardian, the police say that they found the extremist literature and maps on 26 December. Defence lawyer Hasan Dastagir alleges that police misrepresented the date of the men's arrest in order to allow for inconsistencies in the evidence. \"By the ninth, the police had made up their mind what they were going to plant on these boys, because they had nothing on them,\" said defence lawyer Hasan Dastagir Katchela. \"There are going to be some massive surprises (in court).\" The trial of the men resumes this on Saturday, 17 April. According to Katchela, the later time given for the arrest was to allow police to create emails and other evidence dated after 9 December, and police have had to change the dates for the discovery of evidence, to fit the timing when they were \"cooked up\". As they were transported to a court hearing in early February, the men tossed a note to journalists scribbled on toilet paper, alleging that they had been tortured. The claims were repeated in a letter from Zamzam which was passed to his parents in March by US state department officials. In the letter, seen by the Guardian, he wrote: \"We were taken to a place where I still don't know where it was (we were blindfolded) and there were like 30 police and [intelligence] agency people who beat and tortured us.

Education experts from nine different countries, funded by the EU, gathered in the Lake District in November to see what they could learn about how to enrich children's education by taking them outdoors. The event was the first of its kind to be held in the UK and shows how Europe is looking across the Channel to help shape outside learning. It was organised by Geoff Cooper, who runs the Wigan council outdoor education centre at Low Bank and has more than 30 years' experience in outdoor education. \"I think the UK is leading the way compared to other countries in Europe that don't have the same wealth and richness of opportunities as we do here,\" says Cooper. \"Our whole system of outdoor education centres – something like 100 in Britain – is linked to the curriculum in schools and, compared to other parts of Europe, this is quite unusual.\" Another indicator of how outside learning is becoming embedded in education is the number of organisations and venues accredited under the government's Learning Outside the Classroom (LOtC) quality badge scheme, launched a year ago. More than 500 different companies and venues – from nuclear power stations to the offices of the Guardian newspaper – have been awarded a quality badge under the scheme in recognition of being able to offer a high-quality educational visit within a safe environment. School trip organisations, however, express disappointment that the scheme is still not widely known in schools. Ian Pearson, development officer for the School Travel Forum, which represents 21 educational tour operators, and who is also a member of the LOtC committee and its advisory group, says: \"The quality badge is there but it isn't fully recognised through education – that is the task for today, the task for yesterday was to get it established.\" The intention is that the LOtC database of badge holders will become the first port of call for teachers looking to organise a school trip – but that has yet to happen, says Martin Hudson from the British Activity Holiday Association (Baha) which represents 200 activity centres. \"Schools don't seem aware of the benefits that the scheme can bring them. The whole thing needs to raise its profile.\" One school that has embraced LOtC is Sandhill View school in Sunderland. Last year, the 972-pupil institution beat off competition from 120 other schools to win the 2009 LOtC award for excellence and innovation. Joan Nix, school curriculum area manger, says: \"I think it is important that our children get as many different experiences as possible. Learning outside the classroom gives them an extra dimension and engages them academically. It's also good for their social learning as well.\" Mick Brookes, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers and a member of the LOtC's board of trustees, shares the same view: \"Taking children out into wilderness experiences and showing them what the world is like is very much about real, deep education.\" But he is concerned that school trips will be marginalised as schools focus increasingly on attainment and targets. \"The environment needs to change and that needs to be led by teachers and schools because they need to move away from that focus of 'bean counting'.\" Effect of the downturn Another factor influencing the availability of school trips has been the downturn in the economy. The market has held up better than the general tourism market in the past 12 months, according to school trip organisations, with more interest coming from primary schools than secondary schools. \"Primary school is where the UK market is and that's where it's growing,\" says Hudson from Baha. Schools are increasingly looking to add an \"adventure element\" to a trip according to Pearson who says: \"There is a hybrid emerging between what you might think of as a traditional school trip and an expedition. For example, a trip to Morocco might now include gorge walking and camel rides along with studying the indigenous population.\" Schools are also looking for trips that cover more than one subject. Pearson says: \"It's no longer just about doing a 'foreign language' trip or a 'geography trip' – it's become cross-curricula.\" As pressure on the public purse strings mounts in the next 12 months what will this mean for school trips? Pearson is confident that they will still thrive: \"It's never really been about the money, although schools do increasingly look for value for money.\" Brookes is equally optimistic that they will survive. \"It may be tougher in a period of austerity and it's about wherever possible you can find some additional funds, but you must realise that headteachers are extremely entrepreneurial.\" And as Nix from Sandhill View says, \"learning outside the classroom isn't always about the big things \"like taking a group of year 10s to Washington\", it can also be about getting pupils out of classroom into the school grounds and using the environment on your doorstep.

We as taxpayers are being asked to take responsibility for significant amounts of spent fuel - something omitted by Rivaz. Spent nuclear fuel contains most of the radioactivity from the new reactors, but neither government nor its regulators have assessed its \"disposability\", or the health effects of managing it. The Nuclear Industry Association says a repository dealing with legacy wastes could readily accommodate the smaller volumes of easier-to-handle wastes from the new nuclear plants. But the spent fuel from EDF's planned European pressurised reactors in England would be hotter and more radioactive than that from the EPR at Olkiluoto, in Finland. There are serious doubts it could be disposed of in the deep geological repository for legacy waste, but the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority has only recently received the detailed information from EDF that will allow it to make the assessment. Having asked for a copy of that information, I have been told by the NDA that it was submitted in confidence under contractual arrangements, and agreement to the release of the information has not been granted. Thus data directly relevant to independent assessment of health detriments during the storage, retrieval, encapsulation, emplacement and subsequent abandonment of spent fuel, is being withheld by the company concerned. I have asked the energy department to publish the data, but the secretary of state is busy promoting nuclear power by \"reducing regulatory risks for investors\".

China has plans for 24 nuclear plants and outline proposals for another 76, according to the Economic Research Council, using figures from the International Energy Agency and the IAEA. \"China's plans indicate its key role in new nuclear build, and the impact of just a small element of its projects being realised would have major implications for new nuclear build capacity — and the many constraints,\" according to the ERC. The research into planned and proposed nuclear plants is part of the ERC's Digest of Energy Statistics 2008, tracking energy trends including consumption, reserves, prices and efficiency at the European Union and world levels. The ERC defines planned plants as those with funding and planning consent , while proposed plants may lack funding, planning consent or both. One of the digest's editors, Nigel Hawkins, said there had been little nuclear new-build in the world after the Chernobyl disaster 20 years ago, but rising fossil fuel prices and the need for new electricity capacity has meant that most leading countries are now looking at the possibility of new nuclear facilities. \"Over the next 20 to 30 years we are going to see a major ramp-up in nuclear build ,\" he said. Hawkins pointed out that the number of companies capable of nuclear newbuild was limited. They include Areva, which has applied jointly with EDF for UK approval of the technology for the EPR reactor, General Electric, Westinghouse — which Toshiba bought from British Nuclear Fuels in early 2006 — and Atomic Energy of Canada. In Britain, the authorities are looking at building a small number of nuclear power plants and are studying at least three reactor designs. British Energy and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority are expected to put forward a number of sites close to existing nuclear plants or former facilities which have been closed. Hawkins warned that, given the volumes under consideration by Beijing, the relatively small programme being considered by Britain could mean China would be seen as more of a priority by nuclear plant construction companies In June, business and enterprise secretary John Hutton said: \"As more and more countries seek to insulate themselves against future energy price rises and the irrefutable reality of climate change, they're competing hard to enable their own nuclear programmes. \"The UK government has the ambition and commitment to build and maintain the best market in the world for companies to do business in nuclear power. \"The UK must aim to become the world's number one location for new nuclear investment.\" The government owns more than a third of British Energy and has given its blessing to plans for EDF to make a bid for the company, though no offer has yet emerged because of opposition by other shareholders. EDF is seen as a good fit because it has the experience of running existing nuclear power plants and nuclear new -build. But the government is keen to stress that its nuclear policy does not rest entirely on a British Energy/EDF tie-up. A spokesman from the Department for Business and Enterprise said: \"We are not putting all our eggs into one basket. \""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/nov/18/energy-bill-queens-speech","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-18T11:25:19Z","webTitle":"Energy bill in Queen's speech latest step to low-carbon economy in Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/18/energy-bill-queens-speech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/nov/18/energy-bill-queens-speech","fields":{"headline":"Energy bill in Queen's speech latest step to low-carbon economy in Britain","bodyText":"The latest energy bill is designed to help the UK move towards a low-carbon economy. It includes a £9.5bn levy on electricity suppliers to fund four demonstration carbon capture and storage (CCS) coal power plants. The \"CCS Incentive\", as the levy is known, was announced last week by energy secretary Ed Miliband as he outlined plans to fast-track major energy infrastructure projects such as coal plants, nuclear power stations and windfarms. Currently only two of the four demonstration projects, those from Scottish Power and E.ON, are proceeding to the next stage of the CCS competition. Professor Stuart Hazeldine, a geologist at the University of Edinburgh and CCS expert, recently claimed the government's competition to build to such demonstration plants was \"dead on its feet.\" Shadow energy secretary Greg Clark last week said he supported Miliband's energy plans, but criticised the government for delays on energy policy that had led to a \"last minute scramble.\" He also said industry figures had suggested the CCS competition was likely to be delayed from its 2014 deadline for active demonstration plants. The bill also includes provisions to establish a mandatory social price support scheme to help more of the most vulnerable households with their energy bills, and strengthen the powers of regulator Ofgem to refer market abuse to the competition commission. Ed Miliband, the climate change secretary, said the bill would ensure consumers could \"be confident that British energy is sustainable and secure.\"\"Carbon capture and storage is a key technology to tackle climate change, and 18 days ahead of the crucial talks in Copenhagen, this bill sets up a new CCS Incentive to support the development of up to four commercial-scale CCS projects in the UK,\" he said. Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat shadow energy secretary, said he was disappointed that measures on energy efficiency were not in the bill. \"If you insulated every home properly in Britain it would be equivalent of taking all the cars of Britain off the roads. What the country needs is a united policy to deliver a warm home for every household,\" Hughes said. Green groups called for a legally-binding limit on greenhouse gas emissions from future coal power plants. David Norman, Director of Campaigns at WWF-UK, said: \"Our main concern with this bill is that it does nothing to prevent new large coal plants being built with only a small fraction of their emissions being captured. Without a guarantee of a legally-binding policy which limits CO2 emissions, the bill gives the energy companies too much carrot and no stick.\" Greenpeace's Jim Footner added: \"It will be easier for the Government to sell public funding for carbon capture and storage to cash-strapped British consumers if it goes hand-in-hand with a legal limit on emissions from power stations. And this legal limit would make sure that the coal utilities can't simply get paid to carry on causing climate change.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/jan/20/scott-brown-climate-change-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-20T19:25:43Z","webTitle":"Fate of US climate change bill in doubt after Scott Brown's Senate win","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/20/scott-brown-climate-change-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/jan/20/scott-brown-climate-change-bill","fields":{"headline":"Fate of US climate change bill in doubt after Scott Brown's Senate win","bodyText":"An ambitious climate change bill had been sliding down President Barack Obama's to-do list even before the Republican upset in Massachusetts that saw Scott Brown take Ted Kennedy's Senate seat. Now it seems more likely than ever that Democrats in the US Senate will not touch global warming in 2010 unless they can be assured of sizeable Republican support. Brown's election has also led to international concern that any failure to act by the US - the world's biggest historical polluter - would undermine attempts to seal a global deal. However, Senator John Kerry, who is leading the push on climate change in the Senate, said he remained confident of getting broad support for a bill. \"The political atmosphere doesn't reduce the urgency of dealing with pollution and energy, and the surest way to increase the anger at Washington is to duck the issues that matter in peoples' lives. There's overwhelming public support and this can be a bipartisan issue,\" he said today . \"This is the single best opportunity to create jobs, reduce pollution, and stop sending billions overseas for foreign oil from countries that would do us harm. Sell those arguments and you've got a winning issue.\" The House of Representatives narrowly passed a climate change bill last June. But Senate Democrats had long calculated that - with the divisive fight over healthcare causing internal splits - their only hope of passing their own version of a climate bill was to win Republican support. Kerry has been leading a tripartisan effort with Republican Lindsey Graham and independent Joe Lieberman to craft a bill that would pull support from at least a few Republicans. The troika has yet to produce a draft proposal, but there is anticipation of an expanded role for nuclear power, perhaps with more cheap government loans or streamlined regulations to get projects approved. There is also talk of offshore oil and gas drilling. Some Senators have proposed limiting the scope of the bill, regulating only the biggest power plants, or perhaps encouraging renewable energy without laying the foundations of a carbon trading market. Other Democrats - who were opposed to a climate change bill even before the vote in Massachusetts - say the Senate is unlikely to move in 2010 without those compromises. \"It is my assessment that we likely will not do a climate change bill this year, but we will do energy,\" Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who opposes action on climate change told reporters in a conference call yesterday. \"I think it is more likely for us to turn to something that is bipartisan and will address the country's energy interest and begin to address specific policies on climate change.\" Brown's victory robs the Democrats of their filibuster-proof 60-40 majority in the Senate. But it is not entirely clear the Senate's newest member would be an automatic no. In the excitement of the campaign, Brown cast himself as a climate change sceptic. \"I think the globe is always heating and cooling,\" the Boston Globe quoted Brown as saying. \"It's a natural way of ebb and flow. The thing that concerns me lately is some of the information I've heard about potential tampering with some of the information.\" But as a Massachusetts state senator in 2008, Brown voted for a regional cap-and-trade regime, which is similar in concept to what the climate bill is proposing on a nationwide scale. Outside the US, reaction to Brown's win suggested it made a global pact to fight global warming harder. Nick Mabey, head of the E3G climate thinktank in London, said without US action there were risks talks would stall. \"We can't afford climate to be a dysfunctional regime like trade,\" like the inconclusive Doha round on freer world trade launched in 2001, he said. \"On the international front, China is constantly looking to the US on climate bills. This is definitely bad news. It doesn't bring new confidence to international negotiations,\" said Ailun Yang of Greenpeace in Beijing. Shirish Sinha of WWF India said US action was essential but that \"irrespective of what happens in US...it is on our self-interest to do something for climate change.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/feb/17/sellafield-plant-closure","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-02-17T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"10-year-old Sellafield nuclear plant may be closed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/17/sellafield-plant-closure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/feb/17/sellafield-plant-closure","fields":{"headline":"10-year-old Sellafield plant may be closed","bodyText":"One of the great white elephants of Britain's atomic industry looks set for closure, according to documents published by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA). The NDA is examining the closure of Sellafield's troubled \"mixed oxide\" or Mox production plant, which has performed badly since it was opened 10 years ago. The demise of the long-troubled Sellafield Mox plant (SMP) would be an embarrassment for ministers at a time when they are trying to persuade sceptics that a new generation of atomic plants can delivered on time and on budget. The plant's closure would make it more likely that a 100-tonne stockpile of highly radioactive plutonium will be stored until the wider Sellafield site in Cumbria is shut, down, rather than turned into new fuel, say industry figures. The Mox plant was set up to manufacture new fuel from recycled plutonium and uranium on site. The death knell for the reprocessing facility is effectively delivered in the NDA's just-published Plutonium Topic Strategy, which says: \"NDA have reviewed SMP and do not believe that it provides either the capacity or longevity to be used for the UK civil stockpile and the recycle options that NDA has considered [assuming] that plutonium is either sold direct or that Mox [mixed oxide] is fabricated in a new plant. There may be an opportunity to utilise the [existing] plant in a meaningful manner for the low specification Mox option.\" The NDA declined to comment, insisting it had yet to decide on a formal recommendation and pointing out that the final decision would be taken by ministers. But the wording of the technical review of the SMP makes clear it is close to dead, and well placed industry sources said there was little chance it would stay open, believing the reference to a \"low-specification\" role was merely cosmetic. The plant cost £470m to build but, with the construction costs written off, it was assessed by government-appointed consultants in 2001 to have a net positive value of only £216m - and this was partly based on winning back Japanese business, which proved hard after the falsification of quality-assurance data in 1999. Green groups opposed the facility as uneconomic when it was proposed in the late 1990s. But it was given the go-ahead by ministers on the basis that it would reprocess 120 tonnes of fuel a year for use in Britain and abroad. It has suffered repeated breakdowns and, last spring, the then energy minister, Malcolm Wicks, admitted in response to a parliamentary question that SMP had managed to reprocess only 2.6 tonnes of fuel per year between 2002 and 2007. Between 1998 and 2002, the plant produced annual figures respectively of 2.3 tonnes, 0.3 tonnes, 0 tonnes and 0 tonnes following a string of technical difficulties. Wicks said it was using \"largely unproven technology\" and admitted that even when it operated at top capacity it could produce only 72 tonnes a year by 2001. The SMP was designed to make new fuel from the recycled uranium and plutonium recovered from used nuclear fuel, which had been reprocessed by the nearby thermal oxide reprocessing plant (Thorp) at Sellafield. A Mox demonstration complex was opened in 1998, but was hit by a scandal involving quality control and the falsification of documents, which led to the resignation of John Taylor, chief executive of BNFL. Attempts to open the main SMP facility led to high court challenges by Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, which argued that the government's decision to allow BNFL to proceed was unlawful under European law. The Irish government also took unsuccessful legal action to stop the SMP opening over concerns about radioactive effluent polluting the Irish sea. Jean McSorley, a nuclear campaigner at Greenpeace, said last night that the SMP plant, along with the troubled Thorp facility, was a dramatic failure. \"It just shows the differences between the claims and realities of the nuclear industry, but my fear is they could instead opt to import technology from France [for a new Mox plant], and that also should be avoided,\" she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/jul/26/greenpeace-legal-action-eon-nuclear-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-26T18:11:50Z","webTitle":"Greenpeace threatens E.ON with legal action over nuclear reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/26/greenpeace-legal-action-eon-nuclear-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/jul/26/greenpeace-legal-action-eon-nuclear-reactors","fields":{"headline":"Greenpeace threatens E.ON with legal action over nuclear reactors","bodyText":"Greenpeace is threatening to take legal action against E.ON and other nuclear power companies for rushing ahead with plans to build new reactors before they have got the proper consents. The move has been triggered by reports that preparatory bore holes for new reactors will start to be drilled for E.ON on 3 August at Oldbury in Gloucestershire. EDF is said to be considering similar work. A Greenpeace spokesman said its lawyers were reviewing a situation which made a mockery of a whole raft of hurdles that were meant to be overcome before the government starts official licensing in 2013. The environmental campaigning group said there has not yet been a final national policy statement on nuclear, an official \"justification\" process for building more stations as needed by law, or an assessment of reactor designs by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII). The green group has sent a letter to the government telling it to put a brake on E.ON. \"Greenpeace is concerned to ensure that any decision to carry out preparatory work does not affect or pre-judge the regulatory or democratic process. Alternatively, the government should ensure that no work goes ahead unless and until it has been formally permitted, including through any decision on justification,\" says John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, in the letter to Miliband. \"The justification process, involves (among other things) weighing the economic disbenefit against any benefit from a new nuclear practice. The problems inherent in permitting building to go ahead without first carrying out the justification process are clear from the experience of the (troubled) Sellafield Mox plant,\" he adds. The Mox fuel reprocessing facility cost £500m to build and a further £100m to commission but has been plagued with problems and produced only a fraction of the fuel promised. Mox was built before the formal justification process was undertaken and the government decided that it should go ahead anyway because the construction costs had already been \"sunk.\" Greenpeace has already successfully challenged in the courts a \"sham\" public consultation process by the government, which has been forced to repeat the exercise. The Guardian recently revealed that the head of the NII had proposed giving a waiver to some parts of the design assessment and coming back to them later in a bid to speed up the introduction of new nuclear. Ministers are in a rush because they know Britain faces an energy crunch after 2015 when many existing nuclear and coal-fired stations will reach the end of their lives or need to be phased out because they do not meet pollution standards. Nuclear companies have said they can get a first new plant up and running by 2017, but only if there are no delays of any kind. The moves come amid reports from Canada that the Ontario government has put its nuclear power plants on hold because the only bid from Atomic Energy of Canada, the only \"compliant\" one received, came in at more than three times more than the province expected to pay. The first nuclear reactor built in Western Europe for three decades – in Finland – has also been attracting negative publicity with some politicians saying the cost overruns put a question mark over whether any further plants should be constructed. E.ON denied last night that it was jumping the gun. \"We will do nothing of a serious nature until the government gives the green light. This is just preparatory seismic work to make sure the ground is suitable. We are not preparing the foundations or anything like that,\" said the company spokesman. EDF said it was doing various studies at sites such as Hinkley Point in Somerset ahead of putting in a formal planning application next year. \"Any permits that are necessary for preparatory work have been obtained,\" said a company spokesman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2008/dec/04/nuclear-power-edf-eon","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-12-04T17:39:14Z","webTitle":"PlPlant delays and overspend harm the cause of nuclear cheerleaders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/04/nuclear-power-edf-eon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/dec/04/nuclear-power-edf-eon","fields":{"headline":"Plant delays and overspend harm the cause of nuclear cheerleaders","bodyText":"Widespread doubts about the ability of nuclear power to bring a new generation of reactors on stream at the right time and on budget were raised today within an industry that the UK government is relying on to meet its climate change and energy security goals. EDF Energy, the French power company that has been positioning itself as one of the leading future players in the UK market, admitted that its new European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) at Flamanville in France had already run 20% over budget while major delays continue to plague a Finnish facility, the only other new plant under construction in Europe. Paul Golby, chief executive of E.ON UK, which also wants to construct two nuclear facilities in Britain, said the 2017 target for a first new reactor in this country was \"extremely ambitious\" and he urged ministers to proceed with a new generation of coal plants, such as the controversial Kingsnorth scheme, to fill the growing energy gap. He was talking at a London conference organised by the Nuclear Industries Association, which was told by another top industry official that although the industry might have a range of problems to overcome, it had recently achieved an extraordinary transformation and was now perceived externally as \"sexy\". Lady Barbara Judge, chairwoman of the Atomic Energy Authority (AEA), highlighted skills shortages and waste disposal as potential difficulties but felt they could be overcome. \"Atomic was a dirty word but now it's certainly a sexy one,\" she argued. But she did warn that the safety of existing stations remained paramount and while the difficulties of the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island disasters had been overcome, they could be repeated. \"Everyone knows just one accident and the industry will be shut down for 20 years.\" Golby raised concerns about the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate which governs the industry's health and safety but questioned whether 2017 was a realistic date for a new station. A colleague had suggested that atomic power would be available to cook the Christmas lunch that year but he said: \"I have a fear it will be humble pie we will be eating rather rather than turkey.\" Meanwhile at an investors' day in Paris, EDF said the EPR which is being built in Flamanville would cost €4bn (£3.47bn) at 2008 prices instead of €3.3bn . \"This update takes into account increase in prices and the effects of some contractual indexes due to higher raw material costs and the impact of technical and regulatory evolutions,\" explained EDF. The new total cost of the electricity generated is €54/MW hour in 2008, instead of the €46 announced when the project was launched in May 2006. Luc Oursel, a president at Areva, said despite the Flamanville problems and rising costs and delays at the Olkiluoto plant in Finland still made commercial sense. He insisted the mistakes learned would help build plants in Britain on schedule. Mike O'Brien, the energy minister, said he was confident industry would do all it could to deliver on time and dismissed concerns about any delays affecting climate change policies. He added: \"All you can do is work towards it (a target) by a particular date.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/nov/17/planning-permission-turbines-solar","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-17T14:51:51Z","webTitle":"Wind turbines and solar panels could be put up without planning permission","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/17/planning-permission-turbines-solar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/nov/17/planning-permission-turbines-solar","fields":{"headline":"Wind turbines and solar panels could be put up without planning permission","bodyText":"Wind turbines up to 15 metres high could be put up in industrial estates or farmland without planning permission under plans published by the government today. Changes to the planning system would also make it easier for new solar roofs to go up on stadiums, schools and railway stations or for offices to be re-clad in solar panels, the Department for Communities and Local Government said. But the new rules, which would also allow councils and electric car drivers to install charging points on streets and in car parks without a planning application, would come with strict caveats about size, noise levels and visual impacts on an area, the government said. Installation of renewables ranging from ground and water source heat pumps, biomass boilers, anaerobic digestion system, solar panels and wind turbines could go ahead without planning permission in areas where they would be appropriate, with limits which would vary according to their location. The overhaul of the planning system, which is being put out to consultation for three months, aims to help people cut their carbon emissions to fight climate change and deliver government commitments to boost renewables. Housing minister John Healey said: \"The people who want to greenproof their homes should get a helping hand, not a stop sign. At the same time we need tough rules so that permitted development does not become a nuisance, so I'm putting in place strong safeguards in relation to noise levels, size, location and the potential impact on an area.\" Energy minister Lord Hunt, added: \"Our clean energy cashback scheme coming next year will mean people get paid to produce their own renewable energy. We can't allow the planning system to get in the way of tackling climate change.\" Friends of the Earth's Executive Director Andy Atkins said the overhaul was welcome but called for a better clean energy cashback deal: \"These schemes would be given an even bigger boost if the Government improved on its plans to introduce a feed-in tariff next year - homes, businesses and communities must be paid more generously than currently intended for the green energy they generate.\" Currently many householders wanting to add solar panels or wind turbines to their homes have to apply for planning permission with their local authority, despite government reforms of planning laws in 2008 (pdf) designed to make such \"microgeneration\" installations easier.. Danish wind turbine manufacturer Vestas this summer also blamed the closure of the UK's only major turbine plant partly on UK planning laws. \"It is clear there is a need for reviewing [planning laws] in the UK,\" said Ditlev Engel, the company's chief executive. \"Nimbyism is also an issue.\" In October, the British Wind Energy Association revealed (pdf) approvals by local authorities for small onshore wind farms are down to 25%, a record low and down from 63% in 2007. Last week, the energy and climate change secretary Ed Miliband announced plans to fast-track larger scale new energy developments such as nuclear power stations and wind farms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2008/sep/24/edf.britishenergygroup","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-09-23T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"EDF prepares to seal £12bn purchase of Britain nuclear energy future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/24/edf.britishenergygroup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/sep/24/edf.britishenergygroup","fields":{"headline":"EDF prepares to seal £12bn purchase of Britain nuclear energy future","bodyText":"The UK's main nuclear power generator is set to be bought today by French energy group EDF in a £12.4bn deal that should kick-start government plans for a new generation of atomic plants. British Energy, saved from bankruptcy by the state in 2002, is being acquired by EDF primarily because the French want to win control of attractive sites on which to construct more nuclear plants. The deal would mean that the French company not only controls the bulk of the UK's current nuclear power stations but also will be responsible for implementing the government's plans to give the energy source a greater role. According to reports on ft.com, EDF has also signed a memorandum of understanding for Centrica, the owner of British Gas, to take a 25% stake in British Energy. According to the website report, that deal is not likely to be signed for several months. The takeover of British Energy by EDF was set for completion in the summer but an 11th-hour revolt by key BE investors scuppered the public launch. EDF has sent out invitations for a press conference in Paris this morning and last night sources close to the industry said the loose ends had been tied up. Neither EDF nor British Energy would comment but industry sources said that Invesco and M&amp;G, which had rebelled against a 765p-a-share offer, now backed the deal. The offer has been raised to 774p but there is also an alternative of cash or a mixture of cash and contingent value rights (CVRs). These are used as a mechanism by which shareholders of an acquired company can receive additional benefits if a specified event occurs. In the case of British Energy, Invesco believes there will be more electricity price rises. The takeover will allow the UK government to claw back a multibillion pound windfall from its 36% stake in the firm following the bail-out which was necessitated after a period of plummeting electricity prices. According to some reports, EDF would pay £3bn for the bulk - or entirety - of the government's holding. British Energy used to provide a quarter of the UK's electricity but increasingly frequent breakdowns of its ageing equipment had reduced that figure to less than 15%. The deal with EDF is expected to see the French company agree to hand over to government a number of sites that it could then auction off to rival companies such as E.ON and RWE, known to be keen to build their own atomic plants. BE runs eight UK nuclear sites with adjacent land on which reactors could be built. The eight are Dungeness B in Kent, Hartlepool, Heysham 1 and 2 in Lancashire, Hinkley Point B in Somerset, Hunterston B in Ayrshire, Sizewell B in Suffolk and Torness in East Lothian. The group also owns a coal-fired power station at Eggborough, north Yorkshire. Ft.com reported that the French group has agreed to sell some of British Energy's land at Bradwell, Essex, and possibly Dungeness, Kent, or Heysham, Lancashire, for other companies such as E.ON and RWE of Germany to build reactors. It is also reported that Centrica would have an option to take a 25% stake in expansion of nuclear generating capacity using the British Energy sites. The business secretary, John Hutton, said last week that new nuclear power plants were essential for keeping the lights on in the UK, increasing security of supply, ending dependence on foreign imports and fighting climate change. Pledging \"maximum support\" for new reactors, Hutton said private-sector investment could total £20bn and help create 100,000 jobs. But he warned of stiff competition from overseas as the world plans to build 400 new nuclear plants over the coming decades."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2010/may/05/science-policy-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-05T16:12:21Z","webTitle":"Election 2010: If science had a vote, which party would it vote for?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/may/05/science-policy-labour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2010/may/05/science-policy-labour","fields":{"headline":"Election 2010: If science had a vote, which party would it vote for?","bodyText":"It's easy to get cynical about elections. We used to vote for the people we disliked the least. Then along came the Liberal Democrats and we realised it might be possible to make everybody lose. Added to that, any rational discussion of policy is pushed aside by a media machine more interested in what shoes the leaders' wives are wearing than in serious analysis of the parties' plans. Science policy has hardly been mentioned in the news. So it's probably just as well that since the start of last week the Guardian has been looking in detail at the science policies of the main parties. What have we learned? Our survey reveals the root cause of the media's lack of interest in science at this election. One striking feature of the parties' answers to our questions was the extent to which they all agree. A broad consensus exists on climate change, the need to develop renewable sources of energy, support for GM and stem cell research, animal testing, dealing with pandemics, libel reform and science funding. Equally, all the parties seem to view science as inextricably linked with business, something that many scientists will be – and should be – wary of. These aren't party political issues, so it's not really surprising that they don't feature much in an election campaign. Whether this consensus is a good thing or not varies from issue to issue. In the case of libel, the consensus is a demonstration of the astonishing success of the Libel Reform campaign in recent months. On climate change, it indicates that a vigorous attempt by internet cranks to subvert science has met something of a brick wall, unless the next government turns out to be a coalition of Ukip and the BNP. On the other hand it's hard to be optimistic when it comes to science funding – none of the parties seems particularly committed to it, and if the science budget isn't cut I'll happily dance around Guardian HQ naked. The only question is how much it will be cut by – the suspicion from Adam Afriyie's recent comments is that the Tories might wield the larger axe, but it's just a guess. When it comes to the differences between the parties, all of them are committed to some extent to basing policy on evidence. The sticking point is where this clashes with moral ideology. Nowhere is this clash of political cultures starker than in the debate over drug policy, with both Labour and the Conservative party happy to abandon the pretence of a rational, evidence-based debate in favour of reactionary policies that pander to public opinion. This wouldn't be a problem if we were able to have a proper public debate on drugs, but the right-wing press has made any sensible discussion of drug policy impossible. Not only do we have to endure hysterical shrieking over every drug scare that comes along, but academics have been subjected to what amount to vicious campaigns of intimidation. Witness the newspaper attacks last year that were directed not just at Professor David Nutt himself, but also at his family. It's harder to understand the reasoning behind the Liberal Democrats' opposition to nuclear power, which seems to be based on more than simply the economic costs, or why the Labour party is so in thrall to the alternative medicine community. And what of the respective potential science ministers? Dr Evan Harris commands the respect of the scientific community for the knowledge and passion he brings to the job. Similarly Lord Drayson managed to retain the respect of scientists even as they became increasingly disgruntled with his party. Like Harris he is heavily engaged with scientists and could regularly be found at meetings and events around London, or responding to Tweets on Twitter. His curious disappearance during this campaign has prompted some speculation about what his future might hold. The Conservative shadow science minister, Adam Afriyie, on the other hand, is an unknown and rarely seen figure who has yet to demonstrate any real passion for scientific issues – which inevitably harms his party's credibility on science. So if science could cast a vote, where would it put its cross? I've concentrated here on the three main parties because as well as having no chance of forming a government, the smaller parties generally lack credibility on science. Plaid Cymru and the SNP are well-meaning, but don't cover the full spectrum of science policy. Ukip's policymakers are disastrously ignorant, while the Greens are gradually maturing but are still in thrall to irrational fears. Both might benefit from wider engagement with real scientists, whereas the BNP and Christian Party are too far gone to be saved. That leaves the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Labour's record on science policy is unfortunate, with the debacle over funding for the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and the sacking of David Nutt being particular lows. On the other hand, the party performs well in areas such as climate and energy. The Conservatives look better than Labour on paper, but here we come up against the limits of an exercise like this. Can their answers really be trusted given, for example, the apparently lukewarm support within the party for action on climate change? At any rate, should the Tories win the election, the majority of their MPs are likely to be new faces, which makes any predictions uncertain. Do you choose the devil you know, or take a gamble on the devil you don't? Except that this time there's a third way – the Liberal Democrats. Their science spokesman is an activist in his own right, while Nick Clegg comes across well on science. There are unanswered questions and potential flaws in their energy policy, but overall they provided a much more solid response to our questions than any of the other parties. Which leads me to emerge from two weeks buried in paperwork and political promises to find myself at this conclusion. If I were to cast my vote based purely on science, it would be for the Liberal Democrats, for Nick Clegg and for Evan Harris. How much science matters when you cast your vote is up to you, but I'll leave you with one final thought. Science itself may not be the biggest issue at this election, but a commitment to science-based policy is a commitment to evidence. Who would you trust more on the economy: a party prepared to listen to expert evidence and properly test and review its ideas, or a party that abandoned evidence as soon as it clashed with ideology? Tomorrow it's up to you."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/nov/12/delay-government-loan-sheffield-forgemasters","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-12T19:12:22Z","webTitle":"European regulations threaten crucial £140m government loan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/12/delay-government-loan-sheffield-forgemasters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/nov/12/delay-government-loan-sheffield-forgemasters","fields":{"headline":"European state aid regulations could harm UK industry","bodyText":"European rules on state aid are delaying the completion of a crucial £140m government loan, which would allow British manufacturers to help build new nuclear reactors at home and abroad. Lord Mandelson's business department is hoping Sheffield Forgemasters International will have the funding by Christmas. But, in the week that the government announced plans to build 10 new nuclear power stations in the UK in the next ten years, unions fear the timetable could slip into next year with damaging consequences for the company. Dougie Rooney, Unite's energy officer, warned further delays could result in Sheffield Forgemasters losing a key contract to overseas competitors to make components for the first batch of new reactors planned for the UK. The company is one of only three in the world able to make the special forgings for new reactors. Mandelson is keen for the company – and other British manufacturers – to supply as many components for the industry as possible, particularly in the UK. The £140m loan would allow Sheffield Forgemasters, whose origins go back to the seventeenth century, to build a 15,000-tonne press to make the large forgings in short supply globally – though it is under pressure to secure funding soon. The joint venture, between E.ON and RWE npower, will choose in the first quarter next year whether to order reactors from Westinghouse, which would soon afterwards place an order for the forgings. If the £140m loan continues to be delayed, Westinghouse would be forced to buy the forgings for its first batch of reactors, planned for the UK, from overseas. Although ministers have agreed in principle a loan in the region of £140m, the fear of breaching EU competition rules is making the process more drawn-out than expected. Mandelson's former role as an EU trade commissioner makes the process particularly sensitive. But British companies are perplexed why the UK seems determined to obey the letter of EU competition law when much of the nuclear industry in Europe is controlled, and supported, by the state. Today, Richard Caborn, the Labour MP for Sheffield Central, urged the government to set up a \"low carbon energy launch fund\" within the £1bn National Investment Corporation unveiled by Gordon Brown in September. In a speech to the British Metallurgical Plant Constructors Association, he said that a fund aimed at supporting start-up companies or projects such as Sheffield Forgemasters' new press would help the UK get round these EU competition laws. \"Financial markets are not geared up to providing the medium- and long-term investment needed for projects like this,\" he told the Guardian. The government and Sheffield Forgemasters declined to comment about the detail of their discussions. Peter Birtles, director at Sheffield Forgemasters, said: \"Our request for funding support is under active discussion between the government and the company and we remain optimistic for a favourable outcome.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/228597","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-30T09:59:50Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: Gordon Brown pleads Gary McKinnon's case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/228597","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/228597","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: Gordon Brown pleads Gary McKinnon's case","bodyText":"Tuesday, 06 October 2009, 16:46 S E C R E T LONDON 002303 NOFORN SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 10/06/2019 TAGS PREL, PGOV, ECON, UK, KNNP, MOPS, IR, PK, AF SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR THE SECRETARY'S OCTOBER 10-11 VISIT TO LONDON Classified By: Ambassador Louis B. Susman for reasons 1.4 (b/d). 1. (C//NF) Summary. The Secretary's visit to London comes on the heels of the Labour, Conservative, and Liberal Democrat political party conferences -- their last before the UK elections which must be held by June 2010. The domestic political situation remains in flux, but with the Conservatives enjoying a consistent lead in the polls. A Conservative victory is not assured, however; the Conservatives have done a better job of criticizing Labour policies than of selling Conservative solutions. The cumulative contraction of the UK economy by 5.7 percent over the last five quarters has focused electoral discussions on economic issues. The major foreign policy issues for the election are the UK's involvement in Afghanistan, which all parties continue to back for now in spite of eroding public support and a lively debate in the media, and the UK's role in the EU, which Labour has been using as an example of the Conservatives' \"isolationist\" tendencies on economic and foreign policy. Politically, PM Brown and Foreign Secretary David Miliband will want the Secretary's visit to demonstrate the strength of their relationship with the U.S. administration in order to counter domestic press speculation about a perceived decline in the \"special relationship\" following Megrahi's release and President Obama's reported \"snubbing\" of PM Brown's requests for one-on-one meetings at the G-20 and UNGA. Some of the key issues of import to the UK Government are Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Northern Ireland, and non-proliferation. End summary. The UK on Key Issues -------------------- 2. (S//NF) The Secretary's meetings with PM Gordon Brown and Foreign Secretary David Miliband likely will focus on the following key issues: -- Afghanistan - As the second largest force contributor in Afghanistan, the UK has lost 219 soldiers since operations began in 2001. The up-tick in British casualties in July and August 2009 has contributed to renewed public debate on the UK's engagement there. Public support for the war effort is tepid. Rather than questioning the reasons for the UK's presence in Afghanistan, many critics instead have asserted that Brown has provided insufficient troops and equipment (including helicopters) to get the job done. In his September 25 discussion with the President, Brown said Afghan forces must shoulder a greater portion of the burden and take more responsibility for their own affairs and asserted the UK would not be \"cutting out\" of Afghanistan, though it lacks the capacity to commit additional troops. Brown and Miliband made similar statements to General McChrystal on October 1 and Admiral Mullen and Admiral Stavridis October 2, and the PM's Foreign Policy Advisor Simon McDonald has asked the USG to show \"understanding of the political pressures that the PM is under.\" However, UK military officials claim that 1,000 - 2,000 additional troops are available for deployment. Brown, Miliband, and British military leaders would like other NATO allies to assume a greater share of combat operations, stressing that the U.S., UK and a few other allies have borne the brunt of the fighting. The PM very much wants to see strong U.S. leadership and is anxious to see the Administration's policy review completed soon. -- Iran - The UK has privately shared with us that it is ready to proceed with designations of the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) and Bank Mellat under their Counter Terrorism Act powers, an action that requires parliamentary approval. In the wake of the October 1 P5 1 meeting in Geneva, however, UK officials are likely to want to consult with the U.S. on the best timing for announcing the designation. UK officials may also raise the issue of Nosratollah Tajik, former Iranian ambassador to Jordan, currently under arrest in the UK and awaiting extradition to the U.S. on charges of procuring restricted military items (night-vision goggles) for the Iranian government. Tajik has exhausted all judicial appeals in the UK and all that stands in the way of the extradition is approval by the Home Secretary. Before approving the extradition, the UK wants to be sure the timing is right and will not interfere with our joint efforts through the P5 1 to engage with Iran. -- Pakistan - Because of immigration and economic ties, Pakistan has an important domestic dimension for the UK and will feature in public debates in the run-up to the UK's 2010 elections. Following the Friends of Pakistan meeting on September 25, the UK announced it will provide an extra GBP 50 million (USD 80 million) to improve infrastructure and security in Pakistan's border areas. However, UK officials later confirmed that these are not new funds and will instead come from the current GBP 655 million (USD 1 billion) already designated for Pakistan aid. British leaders view a secure Pakistan as key to regional stability. They recognize Pakistan's now more effective response to the Taliban and other extremists, but say more is needed. -- Northern Ireland - Prime Minister Brown and Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward will probably ask the Secretary to urge Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness to accept the \"Westminster Package,\" regarding the devolution of justice and policing powers, which was recently presented by Prime Minister Brown. HMG would like to reach an agreement with the parties this week, before the Secretary's arrival. HMG argues that the proposal is a good deal for Northern Ireland. If the agreement is not completed by the weekend, there is potential that some of the parties could seek to draw in the Secretary. The best approach is to urge all parties to work together patiently to reach agreement. An agreement would be a strong, positive signal to potential investors. -- Nuclear Non-proliferation - Both PM Brown and FS Miliband welcome U.S. leadership on the global nuclear non-proliferation agenda, including the April 2010 Nuclear Security Summit in Washington. The UK firmly agrees with us on the importance of close P5 and P3 cooperation in the lead up to next year's Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) review conference. At UNGA, Brown emphasized that the onus is on non-nuclear states to prove they are not developing nuclear weapons. He also pledged the UK's support for sponsoring a uranium bank and offering civil nuclear power to non-nuclear states that fulfill their responsibilities. He also announced that, subject to the sustained ability to maintain continuous deterrence, the UK will consider reducing its fleet of Trident nuclear-armed submarines from four to three. The move also is regarded as a cost-cutting measure for a government facing significant fiscal challenges in the coming years. -- Defense Trade Treaty - The PM and FS Miliband may ask about the status of the Defense Trade Treaty and when the Senate will ratify it. U/S Tauscher told UK officials on September 30 that her goal is to have the Senate act on the treaty by year's end. U/S Tauscher and A/S Shapiro are working to counter the SFRC staff's belief that implementing legislation is necessary to enforce the treaty and to address their concerns about Congressional consultations and notifications. -- Arms Trade Treaty - Miliband frequently raises with senior U.S. interlocutors the possibility of negotiating an ATT. We continue to have doubts about the possibility of negotiating an effective treaty, but are willing to move forward on the condition that it will proceed on the consensus basis traditional for multilateral arms control and nonproliferation negotiations. -- Gary McKinnon Extradition Case - The PM will likely raise with the Secretary (as he has with the Ambassador) the extradition case of Gary McKinnon. McKinnon is a 43-year old computer hacker with Asperger's Syndrome who is wanted for prosecution in the U.S.; he is accused of hacking into U.S. government systems in 2001 and 2002. McKinnon has gained enormous popular sympathy in his appeal against extradition; the UK's final decision is pending. The case has also caused public criticism of the U.S.-UK extradition treaty. In August, PM Brown, in a one-on-one meeting with the Ambassador, proposed a deal: that McKinnon plead guilty, make a statement of contrition, but serve any sentence of incarceration in the UK. Brown cited deep public concern that McKinnon, with his medical condition, would commit suicide or suffer injury in imprisoned in a U.S. facility. The Ambassador has raised this proposal with AG Holder and would be happy to brief the Secretary in more detail. Domestic Politics in Flux in Run-up to Elections --------------------------------------------- --- 3. (C//NF) The annual political party conferences currently underway have thrust the UK into electoral campaigning mode, with the Labour, Conservative, and Liberal Democrat parties all positioning themselves for the general elections, which must occur before June 2010. The recent conferences have given each party in turn an up-tick in the polls, though with the Tories consistently enjoying a significant overall lead. PM Brown is unchallenged as leader of the Labour Party, but remains embattled by the UK media. Many in his party question if Labour can win the next elections with him at the helm despite his strong showing at the Labour conference. Honing its campaign message, the Labour Party plans to make the elections about class divisions, highlighting Labour's strong public services record and its economic vision for Britain. At present, the major foreign policy issues shaping the electoral debate are the UK's involvement in Afghanistan, which all parties continue to back for now in spite of eroding public support and a lively debate in the media, and the UK's role in the European Union, which Labour has been using as an example of Conservative economic and foreign policy \"isolationist\" tendencies. 4. (C//NF) Conservative leader David Cameron's headline message to the media as the Tory conference began October 5 was about the UK's \"twin crises\" of debt and unemployment and the Tory's to-be-unveiled \"big, bold, and radical\" scheme to \"get Britain working.\" The Tories' platform during the June European and local elections was based on keeping in focus bedrock issues such as the economy, job creation, and health and education reform; casting Labour as profligate and irresponsible; and portraying the Conservatives as the party of thrift, responsible spending and transparency. Ireland's \"yes\" vote on the Lisbon Treaty has highlighted internal Conservative party divisions on the EU as the conference gets underway. PM Brown and FS Miliband may ask the Secretary to emphasize U.S. support for a \"strong Europe\" as a way to highlight Conservative schisms. 5. (C//NF) In response to the summer 2009 parliamentary expenses scandal, which has alienated some voters from the political class and the mainstream parties, Cameron has been credited with reacting more decisively than Brown - a performance that some political commentators have said demonstrated impressive leadership, especially compared to Brown (who throughout his prime ministership has had to fight accusations of indecisiveness). Keeping the public focused on the economy, Cameron has said the Conservatives would be judged by their response to the UK's debt crisis and has called for an \"age of austerity.\" While spending cuts are expected to be a large part of the future Conservative program, neither Cameron nor Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Osborne has offered details on where government spending should be cut, beyond just saying there will be a ten percent cross-the-board cut with only education and the National Health Services remaining untouched. Many in the UK public remain skeptical of the Tories' unspecified plans for major cuts. 6. (C//NF) The UK's relationship with the U.S. has also become a campaign issue. During the fever pitch of UK media reporting on the release of convicted Pan Am 103 bomber Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, the Conservatives blamed Labour for damaging the \"special relationship.\" The UK media has refused to let the issue die, continuing its mischievous reporting of recent alleged USG snubs of senior UK officials, particularly during UNGA. Overview of UK Economy ---------------------- 7. (U) The UK officially entered recession in the third quarter of 2008 and has suffered a cumulative contraction of 5.7 percent over the last five quarters. In July, the IMF forecast a further contraction of 4.2 percent in 2009 and growth of 0.2 percent in 2010. HM Treasury expects a contraction of 3.5 percent in 2009 and growth of 1.25 percent in 2010. Unemployment stands at 7.8 percent, its highest since 1995, and is expected to climb to more than 10 percent in early 2010. Unemployment is particularly acute among 18-to-24 year olds at 17 percent. The economic downturn is taking a heavy toll on trade. According to U.S Commerce Department and U.S. International Trade Commission monthly trade statistics, U.S. goods exports to the UK declined by 21.7 percent from January to June 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, and UK exports to the U.S. declined by 25.6 percent. Concerns about employment figures remain high, with unemployment rates near eight percent and expected to peak just in advance of the parliamentary elections. 8. (U) Public debt stands at GBP 800 billion (56.8 percent of GDP), its highest level since records began in 1974, and up from 56.6 percent last month. However, UK debt as a percentage of GDP is still lower than in the other G7 countries. How to manage and finance the UK's debt burden is a key issue dividing the two parties, and is expected to emerge as one of the top economic issues during the political campaign.
